The famous examples in this category are the quantized\nelectrical Hall conductance and thermal Hall conductance, which encodes the\ntopological order of integer and fractional quantum Hall states. Here, we\nreview the recent thermal transport study of integer and fractional quantum\nHall states realized in graphene-based van der Waals heterostructures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
