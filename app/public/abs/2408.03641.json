Multi-dimensional\npartitionings occur, for example, when analyzing parameter spaces of simulation\nmodels, where each segment of the partitioning represents a region of similar\nmodel behavior. Having computed a partitioning, one is commonly interested in\nunderstanding how large the segments are and which segments lie next to each\nother. While visual representations of 2D domain partitionings that reveal\nsizes and neighborhoods are straightforward, this is no longer the case when\nconsidering multi-dimensional domains of three or more dimensions. We propose\nan algorithm for computing 2D embeddings of multi-dimensional partitionings.\nThe embedding shall have the following properties: It shall maintain the\ntopology of the partitioning and optimize the area sizes and joint boundary\nlengths of the embedded segments to match the respective sizes and lengths in\nthe multi-dimensional domain. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nby applying it to different use cases, including the visual exploration of 3D\nspatial domain segmentations and multi-dimensional parameter space\npartitionings of simulation ensembles. We numerically evaluate our algorithm\nwith respect to how well sizes and lengths are preserved depending on the\ndimensionality of the domain and the number of segments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
