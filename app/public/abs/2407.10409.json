Using the tensor renormalization group,\nboth the complex action problem and topological freezing problem in the\nstandard Monte Carlo simulation are avoided. We find the first-order phase\ntransition with sufficiently large Higgs mass at $\\theta=\\pi$, where the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ charge conjugation symmetry is spontaneously broken. On the\nother hand, the symmetry is restored with a sufficiently small mass. We\ndetermine the critical endpoint as a function of the Higgs mass parameter and\nshow the critical behavior is in the two-dimensional Ising universality class.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
