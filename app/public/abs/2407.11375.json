However, ensuring transparent\ndecision-making processes of AI models in compliance with regulations requires\na comprehensive understanding of the model's internal workings. However,\nprevious methods heavily rely on expensive pixel-wise annotated datasets for\ninterpreting the model, presenting a significant drawback in medical domains.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel medical neuron concept annotation method,\nnamed Mask-free Medical Model Interpretation (MAMMI), addresses these\nchallenges. By using a vision-language model, our method relaxes the need for\npixel-level masks for neuron concept annotation. MAMMI achieves superior\nperformance compared to other interpretation methods, demonstrating its\nefficacy in providing rich representations for neurons in medical image\nanalysis. Our experiments on a model trained on NIH chest X-rays validate the\neffectiveness of MAMMI, showcasing its potential for transparent clinical\ndecision-making in the medical domain.
