Magnetic field dependence allows us to derive the\nmagnetization as a function of concentration and magnetic field. It turns out\nthat, in the limit of zero field, the magnetization tends to a nonzero value\nwith a singular dependence on the magnetic field. We derive the explicit form\nof the singularity in thermodynamic quantities such as energy $E\\simeq E_0+m_0\nh + E_1e^{-h_0/h}$, which is an essential singularity known as Griffiths\nsingularity. We confirm our analytical results using the numerical approach\nbased on iterative equations for energy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
