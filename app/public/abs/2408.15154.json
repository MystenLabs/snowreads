Here $\\varepsilon>0$ denotes the size of an initially\nsufficiently small, Sobolev regular and localized perturbation. A similar\nstatement also holds for the related dispersive SQG equation.\n  At the core of this result is a dispersive effect due to anisotropic internal\ngravity waves. At the linearized level, this gives rise to amplitude decay at a\nrate of $t^{-1/2}$, as observed in [EW15]. We establish a refined version of\nthis, and propagate nonlinear control via a detailed analysis of nonlinear\ninteractions using the method of partial symmetries developed in [GPW23].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
