This requires controlled flat-top operation in type-I ELMy H-mode\nregimes. Hydrogen or helium plasma discharges are used exclusively in these\nstages to ensure negligible production of neutrons from fusion reactions. With\nthe expected higher L-H power threshold of hydrogen and helium plasmas compared\nto corresponding D and D/T plasmas, it is uncertain whether available auxiliary\npower systems are sufficient to operate in stable type-I ELMy H-mode. This has\nbeen investigated using integrated core and edge/SOL/divertor modelling with\nJINTRAC. Assuming that the L-H power threshold is well captured by the Martin08\nscaling law, the presented simulations have found that 30 MW of ECRH power is\nlikely required for the investigated hydrogen plasma scenarios, rather than the\noriginally planned 20 MW in the 2016 Staged Approach ITER Baseline. However,\npast experiments have shown that a small helium fraction (~10 %) can\nconsiderably reduce the hydrogen plasma L-H power threshold. Assuming that\nthese results extrapolate to ITER operation regimes, the 7.5MA/2.65T hydrogen\nplasma scenario is likely to access stable type-I ELMy H-mode operation also at\n20 MW of ECRH.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZR_3Nu4FB1iIIo0J5T4JoUaglrZGnCkT6uXqfkkflDE","pdfSize":"1666199"}
