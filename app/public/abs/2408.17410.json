We explore essential\nproperties, including the characterization of the density function for various\ndistribution types, as well as other key aspects such as identifiability,\nquantiles, stochastic representation, conditional and marginal distributions,\nmoments, Kullback-Leibler Divergence, and parameter estimation. A Monte Carlo\nsimulation study is performed for examining the performance of the developed\nparameter estimation method. Finally, the proposed models are used to analyze\nsocioeconomic data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
