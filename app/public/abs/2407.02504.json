The system executes both\nstatic and dynamic calculations, the former being completely dependent, while\nthe latter completely independent to the user's inputs. The solution is adapted\nto a Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with CFM56-7B engines. However, the calculations\nalso apply for similar aicrafts, equipped with a tricycle landing gear and\nturbofan engines. The system is aligned with current regulations and\ncertification specifications, where applicable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
