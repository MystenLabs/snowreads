In particular, the proton and\ndeuteron fussion to ${}^3 \\mathrm{He}$ of the $pp$ chain that produces\nenergetic neutrino and gamma photon with 5.5$\\,$MeV of energy release can also\nproduce a pair of dark matter particles. Besides, we establish an analytical\nformalism of using the Boltzmann equation to study the solar attenuation effect\non the produced dark matter flux. The projected sensitivity is illustrated with\nArgon target at the DarkSide-LowMass experiment.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
