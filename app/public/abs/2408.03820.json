However, assessing\nthe tissue-material interaction mathematically and computationally can be very\ncomplex, in particular when functional, such as biodegradable, implant\nmaterials are investigated. In this work, we expand and refine suitable\nexisting mathematical models of bone growth and magnesium-based implant\ndegradation based on ordinary differential equations. We show that we can\nsimulate the implant degradation, as well as the osseointegration in terms of\nrelative bone volume fraction and changes in bone ultrastructure when applying\nthe model to experimental data from titanium and magnesium-gadolinium implants\nfor healing times up to 32 weeks. By conducting a parameter study we further\nshow that a lack of data at early time points has little influence on the\nsimulation outcome. Moreover, we show that the model is predictive in terms of\nrelative bone volume fraction with mean absolute errors below 6%\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
