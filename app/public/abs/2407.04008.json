The stiffness is caused\nby the occurrence of three reaction rates $k_1,\\,k_2$, and $k_3$, with largely\ndiffering orders of magnitude, acting as parameters. The model has been widely\nused as a numerical test problem. Surprisingly, no asymptotic analysis of this\nmultiscale problem seems to exist. In this paper we provide a full asymptotic\nanalysis of the Robertson model under the assumption $k_1, k_3 \\ll k_2$. We\nrewrite the equations as a two-parameter singular perturbation problem in the\nrescaled small parameters $(\\varepsilon_1,\\varepsilon_2):=(k_1/k_2,k_3/k_2)$,\nwhich we then analyze using geometric singular perturbation theory (GSPT). To\ndeal with the multi-parameter singular structure, we perform blow-ups in\nparameter- and variable space. We identify four distinct regimes in a\nneighbourhood of the singular limit \\mbox{$(\\varepsilon_1,\\varepsilon_2)=\n(0,0)$}. Within these four regimes we use GSPT and additional blow-ups to\nanalyze the dynamics and the structure of solutions. Our asymptotic results are\nin excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the numerics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
