The latter is able to acquire a nonzero\nspacetime-dependent vacuum expectation value, which gives rise to a spontaneous\nviolation of spacetime symmetries. Based on the (3+1) decomposition, we\ndemonstrate how to develop the Hamiltonian formulation for this model. Having\ndone so, our primary interest is to understand how spontaneous spacetime\nsymmetry violation manifests itself in such a setting. In particular, we find\nthat the constraint structure of GR is preserved, although the constraints are\nclearly modified by the scalar background field. These results emphasize the\nbeauty of spontaneous spacetime symmetry violation in gravity from the\nviewpoint of the Hamiltonian formulation. They may pose the base for further\nstudies of more sophisticated models of vector and higher-rank tensor fields.\nMoreover, the description developed can bear fruits when applied within\nphenomenological quests for spacetime symmetry violation in gravity, in\nparticular, at cosmological scales.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
