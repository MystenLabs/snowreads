We focus on endogenous crashes, driven by internal market\ndynamics, and model these events as first-order phase transitions critical,\nstochastic, and dynamic. Through a comparative analysis of early warning\nsignals associated with each type of transition, we demonstrate that dynamic\nphase transitions (DPT) offer a more accurate representation of market crashes\nthan critical (CPT) or stochastic phase transitions (SPT). Unlike existing\nmodels, such as the Log-Periodic Power Law (LPPL) model, which often suffers\nfrom overfitting and false positives, our approach grounded in DPT provides a\nmore robust prediction framework. Empirical findings, based on an analysis of\nS&P 500 stocks from 2019 to 2024, reveal significant trends in volatility and\nanomalous dimensions before crashes, supporting the superiority of the DPT\nmodel. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of the predictive\nsignals preceding market crashes and offers a novel perspective on their\nunderlying dynamics.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AyI_k-k20xsKzt6mHqzqdyXjIU7K5YQZhWzkrP2w6Js","pdfSize":"951095"}
