Assuming the initial data is\nwell-prepared, we prove a convergence theorem of the velocity fields to a\ntwo-dimensional vector field solving a linear, damped ordinary differential\nequation.The proof is based on a weak-strong uniqueness argument, combinedwith\nan abstract result implying that the weak convergence of a familyof weak\nsolutions to the Navier-Stokes-Coriolis system can be translated into a form of\nuniform-in-time convergence.This argument yields strong convergence of the\nvelocity fields, without a precise rate though.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
