The conditioning we propose is then designed by\nrequiring the total progeny to exceed arbitrarily large exponential random\nvariables. This is related to a Doob's $h$-transform with an explicit excessive\nfunction $h$. The $h$-transformed process, i.e. the conditioned process, is\nshown to have a finite lifetime almost surely (it is either killed or it\nexplodes continuously). When starting from positive values, the conditioned\nprocess is furthermore characterized, up to its lifetime, as the solution to a\ncertain stochastic equation with jumps. The latter superposes the dynamics of\nthe initial logistic CB process with an additional density-dependent\nimmigration term. Last, it is established that the conditioned process can be\nstarting from zero. Key tools employed are a representation of the logistic CB\nprocess through a time-changed generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, as well\nas Laplace and Siegmund duality relationships with auxiliary diffusion\nprocesses.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1eYGA_eOtWYwuFQOYj3ae5Q8C52bye_BBqFAwJhFiwg","pdfSize":"519880"}
