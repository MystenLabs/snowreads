In this paper, we give a graph neural network based convolutional\nneural network (CNN) model, that can be applied on diverse source of data, in\nthe attempt to extract features to predict the trends of indices of\n\\text{S}\\&\\text{P} 500, NASDAQ, DJI, NYSE, and RUSSEL. The experiments show\nthat the associated models improve the performance of prediction in all indices\nover the baseline algorithms by about $4\\% \\text{ to } 15\\%$, in terms of\nF-measure. A trading simulation is generated from predictions and gained a\nSharpe ratio of over 3.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
