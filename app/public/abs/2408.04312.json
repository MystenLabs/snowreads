Qonductor exposes the\n$Qonductor~API$, a high-level and hardware-agnostic API for customizable hybrid\napplication development and execution, that abstracts away the complexity of\nhybrid resource management. To guide hybrid resource management, the\n$resource~estimator$ accurately estimates execution fidelity and runtime to\ngenerate and offer resource plans. The $hybrid~scheduler$ leverages the\nresource plans to automate job scheduling on hybrid resources and balance the\ntradeoff between users' objectives of high fidelity and low runtimes and the\ncloud operator's objective of resource efficiency.\n  We implement an open-source prototype of Qonductor by building on top of\nKubernetes and evaluate it using more than 7000 real quantum runs on the IBM\nquantum cloud to simulate real cloud workloads. Qonductor achieves up to 54\\%\nlower job completion times (JCTs) while sacrificing 6\\% fidelity, balances the\nload across QPU which increases quantum resource utilization by up to 66\\%, and\nscales with increasing system sizes and loads.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
