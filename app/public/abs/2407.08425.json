The vaccination effort possibly imposed by the health-care deciders\nis classically modeled by a control input affecting the epidemic dynamic. After\na preliminary viability analysis the existence of optimal controls is\nestablished, and their structure is characterized by using a state-constrained\nversion of Pontryagin's theorem. The resulting optimal controls necessarily\nhave a bang-bang regime with at most one switch. More precisely, the optimal\nstrategies impose the maximum-allowed vaccination effort in an initial period\nof time, which can cease only once the ICU constraint can be satisfied without\nfurther vaccination. The switching times are characterized in order to identify\nconditions under which vaccination should be implemented or halted. The\nuniqueness of the optimal control is also discussed. Numerical examples\nillustrate our theoretical results and the corresponding optimal strategies.\nThe analysis is eventually extended to the infinite horizon by\n$\\Gamma$-convergence arguments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
