The\nalgorithm has been validated using commonly employed observables, such as\ntypical fluctuations of the positional distribution, rare fluctuations, the\nmean and the variance of the position, and breakthrough curves with\ntime-dependent bias, demonstrating a perfect match.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JrxfeTDlaiEADCZxnKxlHMbeYYkRyWvaojLvssSjeOo","pdfSize":"614216","txDigest":"5SqAqUUBDq7626mZVmbJkqyq5U61F2vWatiH6c5aiEMm","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
