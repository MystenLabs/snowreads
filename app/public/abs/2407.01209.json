This paper focuses on enhancing the recognition capability of\nsmall-scale grasping, aiming to improve the overall accuracy of grasping\nprediction results and the generalization ability of the network. We propose an\nenhanced receptive field method that includes a multi-radii cylinder grouping\nmodule and a passive attention module. This method enhances the receptive field\narea within the graspable space and strengthens the learning of graspable\nfeatures. Additionally, we design a graspable balance sampling module based on\na segmentation network, which enables the network to focus on features of small\nobjects, thereby improving the recognition capability of small-scale grasping.\nOur network achieves state-of-the-art performance on the GraspNet-1Billion\ndataset, with an overall improvement of approximately 10% in average\nprecision@k (AP). Furthermore, we deployed our grasp detection model in\npybullet grasping platform, which validates the effectiveness of our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
