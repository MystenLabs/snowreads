Proactively caching required sensing data (SD) is a\npivotal strategy for alleviating network congestion and improving data\naccessibility. Despite merits, existing studies predominantly address SD\ncaching within a single time slot, which may not be scalable to scenarios\ninvolving multi-slots. Furthermore, the oversight of service capacity at\ncaching nodes could lead to significant queuing delays in SD reception. To\ntackle these limitations, we jointly consider the problem of anchoring caching\nplacement and requests allocation for SD. A value model incorporating both\ntemporal and spacial characteristics is first proposed to estimate the\nsignificance of different caching decisions. Subsequently, a stochastic integer\nnonlinear programming model is provided to optimize the long-term system\nperformance, which is converted into a series of online optimization problem by\nleveraging the Lyapunov method and linearized via introducing auxiliary\nvariables. To expedite the solution, we provide a binary quantum particle swarm\noptimization based algorithm with quadratic time complexity. Numerical\ninvestigations demonstrate the superiority of proposed algorithms compared with\nother schemes in terms of energy consumption, response latency, and cache-hit\nratio.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
