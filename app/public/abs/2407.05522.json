The non-linear part is assumed to be\nquasi-increasing. Given an initial value in between a sub- and a super-solution\nof the stationary problem we find a solution of the semi-linear evolutionary\nproblem. Convergence as $t\\to\\infty$ is also studied for the solutions. Our\nresults are applied to the logistic equation with diffusion, to a\nLotka-Volterra competition model and the Fisher equation from population\ngenetics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
