For an $S$-invariant\nfunction $\\P$, we associate a vertical subdistribution $\\V_\\P$ and find the\nrelation between the holonomy distribution and $\\V_\\P$ by showing that the\nvertical part of the holonomy distribution is the intersection of \\ok{all\nspaces $\\V_{\\F_S}$ associated to $\\F_S$ where $\\F_S$} is the set of all Finsler\nfunctions that have the geodesic spray $S$. As an application, we study the\nLandsberg Finsler surfaces. We prove that a Landsberg surface with\n$S$-invariant flag curvature is Riemannian or has a vanishing flag curvature.\nWe show that for Landsberg surfaces with non-vanishing flag curvature, the flag\ncurvature is $S$-invariant if and only if it is constant, in this case, the\nsurface is Riemannian. Finally, for a Berwald surface, we prove that the flag\ncurvature is $H$-invariant if and only if it is constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
