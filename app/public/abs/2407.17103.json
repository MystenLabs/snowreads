The idea is to first define an \"elementary\"\nchannel $\\Phi_2$ and then to analyze when $\\Phi\\Phi_2^{-1}$ is completely\npositive. The sufficient criterion obtained this way -- which even yields an\nexplicit factorization of $\\Phi$ -- is that one has to find orthogonal unit\nvectors $x,x^\\perp$ such that $\\langle x^\\perp|\\mathcal K_\\Phi\\mathcal\nK_\\Phi^\\perp|x\\rangle=\\langle x|\\mathcal K_\\Phi\\mathcal\nK_\\Phi^\\perp|x\\rangle=\\{0\\}$ where $\\mathcal K_\\Phi$ is the Kraus subspace of\n$\\Phi$ and $\\mathcal K_\\Phi^\\perp$ is its orthogonal complement. Of course,\nusing linearity this criterion can be reduced to finitely many equalities.\nGenerically, this division even lowers the Kraus rank which is why repeated\napplication -- if possible -- results in a factorization of $\\Phi$ into in some\nsense \"simple\" channels. Finally, be aware that our techniques are not limited\nto the particular elementary channel we chose.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
