Ground\nstates of local Hamiltonians inherit this locality, resulting in EHs that are\ndominated by local, few-body terms. Unfortunately, in non-equilibrium\nsituations, analytic results are rare and largely confined to continuous field\ntheories, which fail to accurately describe microscopic models. To address this\ngap, we present an exact analytic result for the EH following a generic quantum\nquench in non-interacting fermionic models. This derivation adapts the\ncelebrated quasiparticle picture to the EH, providing detailed insights into\nits physical properties. The resulting analytic formula serves as a foundation\nfor engineering EHs in quantum optics experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
