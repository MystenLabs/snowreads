It is\nshown here how a magnetic force field at a magnetic-nonmagnetic fluid interface\nresults in an ultra-soft interface with nonlinear elasticity and tunable\nviscous shear properties. The balance between magnetic pressure, viscous stress\nand Laplace pressure results in a deformed and stable liquid-in-liquid tube\nwith apparent elasticity in the range 2 kPa -10 kPa, possibly extended by a\nproper choice of liquid properties. Such highly deformable liquid-liquid\ninterfaces of arbitrary shape with vanishing viscous shear open doors to unique\nmicrofluidic phenomena, biomaterial flows and complex biosystems mimicking.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
