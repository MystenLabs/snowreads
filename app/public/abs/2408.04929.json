These\nreal-world scenarios are formalized by our new universal computation model.\nLeveraging this model and new proof techniques, we discover tight lower bounds\nthat apply to virtually all synchronous and asynchronous methods, including\nMinibatch SGD, Asynchronous SGD (Recht et al., 2011), and Picky SGD (Cohen et\nal., 2021). We show that these lower bounds, up to constant factors, are\nmatched by the optimal Rennala SGD and Malenia SGD methods (Tyurin &\nRicht\\'arik, 2023).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
