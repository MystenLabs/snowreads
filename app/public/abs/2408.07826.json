Greenberg's conjecture states that if\n$E/\\mathbb{Q}$ is an elliptic curve with good ordinary reduction at $p$, and\n$E[p]$ is irreducible as a Galois module, then the Selmer group of $E$ over the\ncyclotomic $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ extension of $\\mathbb{Q}$ has $\\mu$-invariant zero.\nWe prove that if $E$ is an elliptic curve over $\\mathbb{Q}$, then we have\n$\\mu=0$ for all but finitely many primes $p$ of good ordinary reduction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
