We focus on prescribing the scalar curvature function K and\nthe boundary mean curvature H on the standard ball. Our analysis extendes\nprevious studies by considering the scenario where the curvatures K and H are\nclose to constants. Using a perturbative approach and leveraging the ansatz\nintroduced by Han and Li, we establish new existence results for the conformal\nmetric when the prescribed curvatures are near constants\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
