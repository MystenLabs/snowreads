Using a\ndimension relaxation method, we use a recursion method to enhance density of\nclustering results. Our methods provide advantages in both computational\nefficiency and clustering accuracy for grouping datasets into three clusters,\nsubstantiated through comprehensive experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
