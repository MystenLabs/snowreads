We attempt to understand why the dimensionally regularized\ntwo-pion exchanges with the explicit delta isobar is much stronger than the\nones with spectral function regularization. When the cutoff value of spectral\nfunction regularization is varied, the isoscalar central component exhibits a\nrather large cutoff variation. This reveals a surprisingly large numerical\nfactor of the deltaful two-pion exchange potentials. The power counting is\nadjusted accordingly and we discuss the results and how to improve upon this\nfinding.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
