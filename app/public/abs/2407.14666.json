However, securitizing casualty insurance risk is non-trivial,\nas it requires forecasting loss ratios for pools of insurance policies that\nhave not yet been written, in addition to estimating how the underlying losses\nwill develop over time within future accident years. In this paper, we lay out\na Bayesian workflow that tackles these complexities by using: (1) theoretically\ninformed time-series and state-space models to capture how loss ratios develop\nand change over time; (2) historic industry data to inform prior distributions\nof models fit to individual programs; (3) stacking to combine loss ratio\npredictions from candidate models, and (4) both prior predictive simulations\nand simulation-based calibration to aid model specification. Using historic\nSchedule P filings, we then show how our proposed Bayesian workflow can be used\nto assess and compare models across a variety of key model performance metrics\nevaluated on future accident year losses.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MxmLE2F6EXFPIpdh3qjKJzE3mB2NmH8e4wU-mFrpMXI","pdfSize":"4661456"}
