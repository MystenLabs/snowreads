We present a\nnumber of motivations to justify the coupling of the axion to the photon in\nterms of a general non-linear extension of the electromagnetic sector. Our\nemphasis in the paper relies on the investigation of the constitutive\npermittivity and permeability tensors, for which the axion contribution\nintroduces a dependence on the frequency and wave vector of the propagating\nradiation. Also, we point out how the axion mass and the axion-photon coupling\nconstant contribute to a dispersive behavior of the electromagnetic waves, in\ncontrast to what happens in the case of non-linear extensions, when effective\nrefractive indices appear which depend only on the direction of the propagation\nwith respect to the external fields. The axion changes this picture by yielding\nrefractive indices with dependence on the wavelength. We apply our results to\nthe special case of the Born-Infeld Electrodynamics and we show that it becomes\nbirefringent whenever the axion is coupled. We also include in our analysis the\nLorentz violation phenomenon through a Carroll-Field-Jackiw term, where we\ninvestigate the influence of this sector on the dispersion relations, and\nconsequently, on the optical phenomena.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vz4Wi0O7r0wzk23qLddoDyvZbYTz2sTcG90eVz9tnlc","pdfSize":"2751818"}
