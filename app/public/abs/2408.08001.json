{"id":"2408.08001","title":"Path Planning for Spot Spraying with UAVs Combining TSP and Area\n  Coverages","authors":"Mogens Plessen","authorsParsed":[["Plessen","Mogens",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 08:00:48 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-16","timestamp":1723708848000,"abstract":"  This paper addresses the following task: given a set of patches or areas of\nvarying sizes that are meant to be serviced within a bounding contour calculate\na minimal length path plan for an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) such that the\npath additionally avoids given obstacles areas and does never leave the\nbounding contour. The application in mind is agricultural spot spraying, where\nthe bounding contour represents the field contour and multiple patches\nrepresent multiple weed areas meant to be sprayed. Obstacle areas are ponds or\ntree islands. The proposed method combines a heuristic solution to a traveling\nsalesman problem (TSP) with optimised area coverage path planning. Two\nTSP-initialisation and 4 TSP-refinement heuristics as well as two area coverage\npath planning methods are evaluated on three real-world experiments with three\nobstacle areas and 15, 19 and 197 patches, respectively. The unsuitability of a\nBaustrophedon-path for area coverage gap avoidance is discussed and inclusion\nof a headland path for area coverage is motivated. Two main findings are (i)\nthe particular suitability of one TSP-refinement heuristic, and (ii) the\nunexpected high contribution of patches areas coverage pathlengths on total\npathlength, highlighting the importance of optimised area coverage path\nplanning for spot spraying.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
