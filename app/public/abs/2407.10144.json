This paper encompasses the design,\nanalysis and implementation of a novel on-line pricing scheme based on\ncoalitional game theory. The setting consists of a network with multiple energy\nretailers competing to attract consumers by announcing a price in a\nhierarchical leader-follower structure. The process of coalition formation\nunder such a pricing scheme can be viewed as a game for which we show that a\nStackelberg equilibrium exists, \\ie given a price, consumers will respond by\nconforming to a reciprocal power consumption quantity. We propose a coalition\nformation algorithm and perform a game-theoretic stability analysis on the\nresulting coalitions. We integrate the pricing setting with a resistive\nmicro-grid dynamic model. In this context we analyse the behaviour of the\nintegrated system, bridging the gap between market and physical layers of the\nproblem. Simulations provide a comparison of profits generated by the proposed\nscheme against a more traditional single retailer scheme, while simultaneously\nshowing convergence towards a steady-state equilibrium. Additionally, we shed\nlight into the system's physical response when subject to our proposed pricing\nscheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
