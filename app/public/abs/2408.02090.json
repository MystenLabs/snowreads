In our setting, in\naddition to random observation noise, the stochastic gradient may be subject to\nindependent oblivious noise, which may not have bounded moments and is not\nnecessarily centered. Specifically, we assume access to a noisy oracle for the\nstochastic gradient of $f$ at $x$, which returns a vector $\\nabla f(\\gamma, x)\n+ \\xi$, where $\\gamma$ is the bounded variance observation noise and $\\xi$ is\nthe oblivious noise that is independent of $\\gamma$ and $x$. The only\nassumption we make on the oblivious noise $\\xi$ is that $\\mathbf{Pr}[\\xi = 0]\n\\ge \\alpha$ for some $\\alpha \\in (0, 1)$. In this setting, it is not\ninformation-theoretically possible to recover a single solution close to the\ntarget when the fraction of inliers $\\alpha$ is less than $1/2$. Our main\nresult is an efficient list-decodable learner that recovers a small list of\ncandidates, at least one of which is close to the true solution. On the other\nhand, if $\\alpha = 1-\\epsilon$, where $0< \\epsilon < 1/2$ is sufficiently small\nconstant, the algorithm recovers a single solution. Along the way, we develop a\nrejection-sampling-based algorithm to perform noisy location estimation, which\nmay be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PA62yvqVnSwutRSSmOiWoSL6d9up-Qb_1wq8Q1ZWl3I","pdfSize":"529436","txDigest":"9Y4pt47frSfb9C9FNeabZ6yDa3QvwmWT69hq32RZyd1L","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
