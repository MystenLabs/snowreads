Wearable assistive grasping devices often focus on this familiar\nwrist-driven technique to provide additional support and amplify grasp force.\nDespite recent research advances in modernizing these tools, people with SCI\noften abandon such wearable assistive devices in the long term. We suspect that\nthe wrist constraints imposed by such devices generate undesirable reach and\ngrasp kinematics. Here we show that using continuous robotic motor assistance\nto give users more adaptability in their wrist posture prior to wrist-driven\ngrasping reduces task difficulty and perceived exertion. Our results\ndemonstrate that more free wrist mobility allows users to select comfortable\nand natural postures depending on task needs, which improves the versatility of\nthe assistive grasping device for easier use across different hand poses in the\narm's workspace. This behavior holds the potential to improve ease of use and\ndesirability of future device designs through new modes of combining both\nbody-power and robotic automation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
