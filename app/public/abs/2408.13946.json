For a sufficiently strong field, these crystalline rods\norient themselves such that the crystal's easy plane is parallel to the\nmagnetic field, the rod's direction being defined as the direction of the\ncrystal's c-axis. As the rod rotates about the crystal's hard axis there will\ntherefore be a range of angles that the rod makes with the magnetic field. We\ndetail this behavior by first providing illustrations of hemozoin crystals at\nvarious orientations. These illustrations clearly demonstrate that the\norientation angle that the crystalline rod makes with respect to the magnetic\nfield varies from about 30 deg to 150 deg. We also derive an analytical\nexpression for the probability density function for the orientation angle. We\nfind that the orientation angles are not uniformly distributed between the\nlimits of 30 deg and 150 deg, but rather tend to cluster near these limits.\nThis suggests experimental tests and addresses confusion about the rod\norientation found in past literature. The relevance to other anisotropic\nbiofluid crystals, such as those produced by gout, is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KREX0NlUXxB4TrBcNHtlcocCpDYFbhJ9GWdcv3J0aX8","pdfSize":"952064"}
