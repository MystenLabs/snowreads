We then fully describe the NL-cone\nand its extremal rays in the cases of moduli spaces of polarized K3 surfaces\nand hyperk\\\"ahler manifolds of known deformation type for low degree\npolarizations. Moreover, we exhibit explicit divisors in the boundary of\nNL-cones for polarizations of arbitrarily large degrees. Additionally, we study\nthe NL-positivity of the canonical class for these modular varieties. As a\nconsequence, we obtain uniruledness results for moduli spaces of primitively\npolarized hyperk\\\"ahler manifolds of ${\\rm{OG6}}$ and ${\\rm{Kum}}_n$-type.\nFinally, we show that any family of polarized hyperk\\\"ahler fourfolds of\n${\\rm{Kum}}_2$-type with polarization of degree $2$ and divisibility $2$ over a\nprojective base is isotrivial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
