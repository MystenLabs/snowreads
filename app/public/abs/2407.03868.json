Here we report the realization of an exceptional line\nsemimetal in a three-dimensional non-Hermitian phononic crystal. A pair of\nexceptional rings with opposite topologies are connected by the drumhead bulk\nstates in the first Brillouin zone. The exceptional rings not only possess\nwave-function topology and thus result in the drumhead surface states, but also\nhost spectral topology and thereby give rise to the hybrid-order\ngeometry-dependent skin effect in three dimensions. Our experimental results\nevidence the complete non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence of the\nthree-dimensional exceptional line semimetal, and may pave the way for\ndesigning non-Hermitian acoustic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
