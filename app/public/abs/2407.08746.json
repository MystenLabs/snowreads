We explain spike propagation through a model\nwith multiple input and output spikes at each neuron, as well as design\ntraining rules for end-to-end backpropagation. This strategy enables us to\nprocess information changing over time. The model is trained and evaluated on a\nTwitter bot detection task where the time of events (tweets and retweets) is\nthe primary carrier of information. This task was chosen to evaluate how the\nproposed SNN deals with spike train data composed of hundreds of events\noccurring at timescales differing by almost five orders of magnitude. The\nimpact of various parameters on model properties, performance and training-time\nstability is analyzed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
