This challenge aims at semantic\nsegmentation of images degraded by various degrees of weather from all around\nthe world. We addressed this problem by introducing a pre-trained large-scale\nvision foundation model: InternImage, and trained it using images with\ndifferent levels of noise. Besides, we did not use additional datasets in the\ntraining procedure and utilized dense-CRF as post-processing in the final\ntesting procedure. As a result, we achieved 2nd place in the challenge with\n45.1 mIOU and fewer submissions than the other winners.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
