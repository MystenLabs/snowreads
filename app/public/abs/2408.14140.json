The fluid equations are solved using a\nfinite-volume scheme on the block-structured semi-staggered grids with both\nsubcycling and non-subcycling methods. The particle-fluid interaction is\nresolved using the multidirect forcing immersed boundary method. The associated\nLagrangian markers used to resolve fluid-particle interface only exist on the\nfinest-level grid, which greatly reduces memory usage. The volume integrals are\nnumerically calculated to capture the free motion of particles accurately, and\nthe repulsive potential model is also included to account for the\nparticle-particle collision. We demonstrate the versatility, accuracy, and\nefficiency of the present multi-level framework by simulating fluid-particle\ninteraction problems with various types of kinematic constraints. The cluster\nof monodisperse particles case is presented at the end to show the capability\nof the current solver in handing with multiple particles.
