We formulate the CARE as two constrained polynomial\noptimization problems, and then use Lasserre's hierarchy of semi-definite\nrelaxations to solve them. Compared to the existing work, our approaches can\nobtain the exact positive semi-definite solution of the CARE when the\ncoefficient matrices are symmetric. Moreover, our methods can detect the\nnonexistence of the positive semi-definite solution for the CARE. Numerical\nexamples show that our approaches are effective compared to the existing\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
