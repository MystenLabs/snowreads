Let $C_n$ denote\nthe cyclic group of order $n$, $D_4$ the dihedral group of order 8, and $A_4$\nthe alternating group of order 12. Assuming that $f(x)$ is monogenic, we give\nnecessary and sufficient conditions involving only $a$ and $d$ to determine the\nGalois group $G$ of $f(x)$ over ${\\mathbb Q}$. In particular, we show that\n$G=D_4$ if and only if $(a,d)=(\\pm 2,2)$, and that $G\\not \\in \\{C_4,C_2\\times\nC_2\\}$. Furthermore, we prove that $f(x)$ is monogenic with $G=A_4$ if and only\nif $a=4k$ and $d=27k^4+1$, where $k\\ne 0$ is an integer such that $27k^4+1$ is\nsquarefree. This article extends previous work of the authors on the\nmonogenicity of quartic polynomials and their Galois groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
