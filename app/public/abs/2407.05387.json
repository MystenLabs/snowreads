By\nemploying extensive single-spin flip Monte Carlo simulations and a recently\ndeveloped method of studying the zeros of the energy probability distribution\nwe are able to probe, with a good numerical accuracy, several critical\ncharacteristics of the transitions. Additionally, the universal aspects of\nthese transitions are scrutinised by computing the corresponding probability\ndistribution functions. The energy distribution has been underutilised in the\nliterature when compared to that of the magnetisation. Somewhat surprisingly,\nhowever, the former appears to be more robust in characterising the\nuniversality class for both models upon varying the crystal field $\\Delta$ than\nthe latter. Finally, our analysis suggests that in contrast to the Blume-Capel\nferromagnet, the Baxter-Wu model appears to suffer from strong finite-size\neffects, especially upon increasing $\\Delta$ and $S$, that obscure the\napplication of traditional finite-size scaling approaches.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
