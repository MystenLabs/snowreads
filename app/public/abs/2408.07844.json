The parameter $\\alpha$, the nonrandomness parameter of\nNRTL, is often heuristically fixed to a value in the range of 0.1 to 0.47. This\ncan be seen as a manual application of a (subset selection) regularization\nmethod. In this work, the identifiability of the NRTL model for describing the\nVLE is analyzed. It is shown that fixing $\\alpha$ is not always a good decision\nand sometimes leads to worse prediction properties of the final parameter\nestimates. Popular regularization techniques are compared and Generalized\nOrthogonalization is proposed as an alternative to this heuristic. In addition,\nthe sequential Optimal Experimental Design and Parameter Estimation (sOED-PE)\nmethod is applied to study the influence of the regularization methods on the\nperformance of the sOED-PE loop.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SazD0idNnA8fzHDrKWpt3L4_ZIauC34XVQ7No2EJQFs","pdfSize":"1716790"}
