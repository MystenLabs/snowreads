The\ncenterpiece of the model consists of a set of physical equations for the global\nclimate system which we show how to cast in non-linear state space form. The\nparameters in the model are estimated using the method of maximum likelihood\nwith the likelihood function being evaluated by the extended Kalman filter. Our\nstatistical framework is based on well-established methodology and is\ncomputationally feasible. In an empirical analysis, we estimate the parameters\nfor a data set comprising the period 1959-2022. A likelihood ratio test sheds\nlight on the most appropriate equation for converting the level of atmospheric\nconcentration of carbon dioxide into radiative forcing. Using the estimated\nmodel, and different future paths of greenhouse gas emissions, we project\nglobal mean surface temperature until the year 2100. Our results illustrate the\npotential of combining statistical modelling with physical insights to arrive\nat rigorous statistical analyses of the climate system.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"93_0jwB3UxcvzzbJfRq0MmrLET039FdthWbArT4J0aE","pdfSize":"652981"}
