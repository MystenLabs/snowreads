The study builds upon existing literature on stock price\nprediction methods, emphasizing the shift toward machine learning and deep\nlearning approaches. Using historical stock prices of 180 stocks across 18\nsectors listed on the NSE, India, the LSTM model predicts future prices. These\npredictions guide buy/sell decisions for each stock and analyze sector\nprofitability. The study's main contributions are threefold: introducing an\noptimized LSTM model for robust portfolio design, utilizing LSTM predictions\nfor buy/sell transactions, and insights into sector profitability and\nvolatility. Results demonstrate the efficacy of the LSTM model in accurately\npredicting stock prices and informing investment decisions. By comparing sector\nprofitability and prediction accuracy, the work provides valuable insights into\nthe dynamics of the current financial markets in India.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
