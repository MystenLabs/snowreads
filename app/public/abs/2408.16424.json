We\nstudy a randomized block-coordinate interpretation of the Chambolle-Pock\nprimal-dual algorithm, based on inexact proximal gradient steps. A specificity\nof the considered algorithm is its robustness, as it converges even in the\nabsence of strong duality or when the linear program is inconsistent. Using\nmatrix preconditiong, we derive tight sublinear convergence rates with and\nwithout duality assumptions and for both the convex and the strongly convex\nsettings. Our developments are extensions and particularizations of original\nalgorithms proposed by Malitsky (2019) and Luke and Malitsky (2018). Numerical\nexperiments are provided for an optimal transport problem of service pricing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
