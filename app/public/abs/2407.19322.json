Relevant electron-heavy species collisions for\ndiatomic molecules are included: rotational and vibrational excitation,\ndissociation and dissociative ionization. Plasma-wall interaction giving rise\nto associative recombination of atomic species into molecular species is\nincluded too. As reference, the plasma thruster is operated with Xe, at a power\nof 300W and a mass flow of 1mg/s. Simulations are run by injecting 1mg/s of\nN$_2$ and O independently for powers between 100 and 3000W. The performances\nand trends of plasma response for these propellants are similar to Xe, but\ndisplaced to powers between 1250 and 2000W. At optimum power, the thrust\nefficiency for N$_2$ and O surpasses that of Xe, due to the excess of\nre-ionization for Xe. Performances of 50/50 mixtures of N$_2$/O, which are a\nrealistic composition in the ionosphere, are found to be linear combinations of\nthe performances of each propellant. Performances using O$_2$, which could be\ngenerated from associative recombination of O at the intake, are very similar\nto those of the atomic oxygen.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
