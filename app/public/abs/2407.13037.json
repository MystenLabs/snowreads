We identify a unifying relationship between these\nparameters for overdamped undulatory swimmers (including nematodes,\nspermatozoa, and mm-scale fish) moving in diverse environmental rheologies, in\nthe form of an active `dispersion relation' $\\omega\\propto k^{\\pm2}$. A model\ntreating the organisms as actively driven viscoelastic beams reproduces the\nexperimentally observed scaling. The relative strength of rate-dependent\ndissipation in the body and the environment determines whether $k^2$ or\n$k^{-2}$ scaling is observed. The existence of these scaling regimes reflects\nthe $k$ and $\\omega$ dependence of the various underlying force terms and how\ntheir relative importance changes with the external environment and the\nneuronally commanded gait.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oIirVHHGNn91ttwqS6y8byp44dGsZuVpJhffHilXu98","pdfSize":"4110796","objectId":"0xf5d4b0895448fbea6465829ba6e2634c7999ed104809fd16a2ed43cf8353c8cf","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
