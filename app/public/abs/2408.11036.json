This gives us many new computations of dcat, especially for\nessential manifolds and (generalized) connected sums. In the process, we also\ndetermine the dcat of closed 3-manifolds having torsion-free fundamental groups\nand some closed geometrically decomposable 4-manifolds. Finally, we extend some\nof our results to closed Alexandrov spaces and discuss their cat and dcat in\ndimension 3.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0owQLEfwdKeWMfAZi7WtfQSAhpjFSALi5fdecNX9djo","pdfSize":"427569"}
