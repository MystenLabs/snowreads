The temporal evolution\nof plasma structures measured with self-emission imaging shows the vertical\nexpansions and horizontal separation of plasma, which can be signatures of\nreconnection outflows in self-generated and external magnetic fields,\nrespectively. Because the outflows in self-generated magnetic fields are not\nclear in the presence of the external magnetic field, the external magnetic\nfield can suppress the magnetic reconnection in self-generated magnetic fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
