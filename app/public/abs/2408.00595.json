The\ninflaton field is assumed to roll on the natural potential and the result is\nanalyzed in light of Planck 2018 and BICEP/Keck 2021 data. We start our work by\nobtaining the field equations under slow-roll approximations. We then evaluate\nthe scalar and tensor power spectra and their corresponding spectral index and\ntensor-to-scalar ratio with a temperature-dependent form of the dissipation\ncoefficient during the inflationary era. We find that the warm inflation model\nin $f(\\phi)T$ gravity is compatible with observational bands.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
