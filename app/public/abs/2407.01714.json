In order to shed light on our\nunderstanding of GC formation, we aim to constrain the amount of stellar mass\nthat Fornax has lost via tidal interaction with the Milky Way (MW). Exploiting\nthe flexibility of effective multi-component $N$-body simulations and relying\non state-of-the-art estimates of Fornax's orbital parameters, we study the\nevolution of the mass distribution of the Fornax dSph in observationally\njustified orbits in the gravitational potential of the MW over 12 Gyr. We find\nthat, though the dark-matter mass loss can be substantial, the fraction of\nstellar mass lost by Fornax to the MW is always negligible, even in the most\neccentric orbit considered. We conclude that stellar-mass loss due to tidal\nstripping is not a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly high stellar mass\nof the GC system of the Fornax dSph and we discuss quantitatively the\nimplications for GC formation scenarios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HKyijreBSykpy6R2IwtotfODzmyd4su3ReAfA5adUAU","pdfSize":"1689359"}
