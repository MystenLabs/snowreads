In this paper, we use a motor to drive a\nmulti-link leg mechanism. The major issues addressed in this paper are as\nfollows: (i) design human leg training mechanism based on the multi-link\nmechanism (ii) Simulate leg movement trajectory of multi-link mechanism based\non walking process (iii) make use of one motor torque control to control the\ntrajectory and velocity of this mechanism.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
