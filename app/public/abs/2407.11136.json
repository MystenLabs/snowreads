The three-body model of $^{6}$Be\nwith the proton-proton interaction, which is adjusted to reproduce the\nexperimental energy release, is utilized. Time-dependent calculation is\nperformed to compute the coupled-spin state of the emitted two protons. The\nspin-correlation function $S$ as the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH)\nindicator is evaluated as $\\abs{S} \\cong 2.65$. Namely, the $2p$-spin\nentanglement beyond the limit of local-hidden-variable (LHV) theory is\nsuggested. This entanglement is sensitive to the proton-proton interaction. The\nshort-lived (broad-width) $2p$~state has the weaker spin entanglement. In\nparallel, the core-proton interactions do not harm this entanglement during the\ntime-dependent decaying process. The CHSH measurement can be a novel probe into\nthe effective nuclear interaction inside finite systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u7z8MUQHqP1Ctf3I3jFJQ1GbyfC7mj2nMm4hfeiAOj8","pdfSize":"388563","objectId":"0x15c2458e1c03e3d24bc0b40752cffb0c876875d1d875225471a9c7117a55c9d5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
