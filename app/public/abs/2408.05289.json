We\nobserve that an analogous model structure can be constructed on the category of\ncubical sets, and use it to equip the category of (simple) graphs with a\nfibration category structure whose weak equivalences are discrete\n$n$-equivalences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
