Our generalization is indexed by a convex function $\\phi$.\nWe find necessary and sufficient conditions for $\\phi$-means to be finite and\nprovide a tight bound for the diameter of the intrinsic mean set. We also\nprovide sufficient conditions under which all the $\\phi$-means coincide in a\nsingle point. Then, we prove the consistency of the sample $\\phi$-mean to its\npopulation analogue. We also find conditions under which classes of\n$\\phi$-means converge uniformly, providing a Glivenko-Cantelli result. Finally,\nwe illustrate applications of our results and provide algorithms for the\ncomputation of $\\phi$-means.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
