The taming is required in this case\nsince one cannot expect the regular Euler scheme to have finite moments in\n$L^p$. We additionally show that our setting applies to the case of two scalar\nvalued particles with singular interaction kernel. To the best of the author's\nknowledge, this is the first work we are aware of to prove strong convergence\nof an Euler-type scheme in the case of non-locally integrable drift.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
