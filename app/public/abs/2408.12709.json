A primary advantage of Droop-e is an increased utilization of\navailable power headroom that directly mitigates system frequency excursions\nand reduces the rate of change of frequency. The motivation for Droop-e as\ncompared to a linear grid-forming control is first established, and then the\nfull controller is described, including the mirrored inversion at the origin,\nthe linearization at a parameterized limit, and the auxiliary autonomous power\nsharing controller. The analytic stability of the controller, including\nsynchronization criteria and a small signal stability analysis, is assessed.\nElectromagnetic transient time domain simulations of the Droop-e controller\nwith full order power electronic converters and accompanying DC-side dynamics,\nconnected in parallel with synchronous generators, are executed at a range of\ndispatches on a simple 3-bus system. Finally, IEEE 39-bus system simulations\nhighlight the improved frequency stability of the system with multiple, Droop-e\ncontrolled grid-forming inverters.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
