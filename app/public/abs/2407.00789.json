In\nthis work, we study words whose images as word maps on every finite group are\nidentical. We establish that two words in $F_2$, where one of the words is\n$x^n$ or $[x,y]^n$ for $n \\in \\Z$, having same image on every finite group, are\nendomorphic to each other. Furthermore, we demonstrate that if the word map\ncorresponding to a word $w_1 \\in F_n$ has the same image as a test word $w_2\n\\in F_n$ on every finite group, then this is sufficient to ensure that $w_1$\nand $w_2$ induce the same measure on every finite group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
