Amongst other things, we establish that the category of perfect\ncomplexes of a coherent algebra over a separated Noetherian scheme is strongly\ngenerated if, and only if, there exists an affine open cover where the algebra\nhas finite global dimension. As a consequence, we solve an open problem posed\nby Neeman. Further, as a first application, we study the existence of\ngenerators and behaviour under the derived pushforward for Azumaya algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ktvKb46OthSe2bosGd9iiH8e-oKiJAxxyLQ923HW9D4","pdfSize":"312720"}
