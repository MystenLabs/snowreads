Therefore,\nit is crucial to assess the impact of intensity correlations on the practical\nsecurity of MDI QKD systems. In this work, we propose a theoretical model that\nquantitatively analyzes the secure key rate of MDI QKD systems under intensity\ncorrelations. Furthermore, we apply the theoretical model to a practical MDI\nQKD system with measured intensity correlations, which shows that the system\nstruggles to generate keys efficiently under this model. We also explore the\nboundary conditions of intensity correlations to generate secret keys. This\nstudy extends the security analysis of intensity correlations to MDI QKD\nprotocols, providing a methodology to evaluate the practical security of MDI\nQKD systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
