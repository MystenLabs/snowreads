This is a vast generalization of the\ntorus fixed-point localization theorem in equivariant intersection theory,\nwhich is the special case of the stack quotient of a scheme $X$ by an action of\na torus $T$. Taking on the one hand an algebraic stack in place of $X$, we\ndeduce a generalization of torus localization to algebraic stacks. Taking on\nthe other hand any algebraic group $G$ instead of $T$, we obtain a localization\ntheorem in $G$-equivariant intersection theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
