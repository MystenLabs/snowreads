The BSC involves designing routes for a\nnumber of mobile sensors (a.k.a. robots) to periodically collect information as\nmuch as possible from points of interest (PoIs). To approach this problem, we\npropose to first examine the {\\em multi-orienteering problem} (MOP). The MOP\naims to find a set of $m$ vertex-disjoint paths that cover as many vertices as\npossible while adhering to a budget constraint $B$. We develop a\nconstant-approximation algorithm for MOP and utilize it to achieve a\nconstant-approximation for BSC. Our findings open new possibilities for\noptimizing mobile sensor deployments and related combinatorial optimization\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
