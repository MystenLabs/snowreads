The employed computational methods\nplay a quintessential role in many scientifically and technologically relevant\nresearch fields. However, a question of paramount importance is whether\napproximations aimed at reducing the computational complexity for solving the\nmany-electron Schr\\\"odinger equation, are accurate enough. Here, we investigate\nrecently reported discrepancies of noncovalent interaction energies for large\nmolecules predicted by two of the most widely-trusted many-electron theories:\ndiffusion quantum Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster theory. We are able to\nunequivocally pin down the source of the puzzling discrepancies and present\nmodifications to widely-used coupled-cluster methods needed for more accurate\nnoncovalent interaction energies of large molecules on the hundred-atom scale.\nThis enhances the reliability of predictions from quantum mechanical\nmany-electron theories across a wide range of critical applications, including\ndrug design, catalysis, and the innovation of new functional materials, such as\nthose for renewable energy technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
