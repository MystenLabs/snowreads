This background\nmodel allows a user to perform a purely data-driven search for anomalous\nlocalized sources of gamma-ray emission, including new physics. As an\napplication, we use TweedleDEE and the MADHATv2 package to perform the first\nsearch for dark matter annihilation in the newly discovered Leo VI dwarf\nspheroidal galaxy, and present model constraints for a variety of choices of\nthe annihilation channel and velocity dependence of the cross section.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
