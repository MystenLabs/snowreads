This has so far only been achieved\nfor unpolarized matrix elements. We derive the full set of splitting amplitudes\narising in longitudinally polarized tree-level QCD matrix elements at NNLO in\nthe Larin $\\gamma_5$ scheme. They are extracted from DIS-like processes, and\nare verified in matrix elements of higher multiplicity. Our results will enable\nthe calculation of NNLO corrections to longitudinal spin asymmetries in\npolarized collider processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_k8mZRcW523xd-i8Amank9taDEzlTgCtAwimiXQX3e4","pdfSize":"181286"}
