The calibration is carried out for potentials constructed\nusing naive dimensional analysis in $NN$ relative momenta ($p$) up to\nnext-to-leading order [NLO, $O(p^2)$] and next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order\n[N3LO, $O(p^4)$]. We consider two classes of pionless EFT potential: one that\nacts in all partial waves and another that is dominated by $s$-wave physics.\nThe two classes produce broadly similar results for calibrations to $NN$ data\nup to $E_{\\rm lab}=5$ MeV. Our analysis accounts for the correlated\nuncertainties that arise from the truncation of the pionless EFT. We\nsimultaneously estimate both the EFT LECs and the parameters that quantify the\ntruncation error. This permits the first quantitative estimates of the pionless\nEFT breakdown scale, $\\Lambda_b$: the 95% intervals are $\\Lambda_b \\in\n[50.11,63.03]$ MeV at NLO and $\\Lambda_b \\in [72.27, 88.54]$ MeV at N3LO.\nInvoking naive dimensional analysis for the $NN$ potential, therefore, does not\nlead to consistent results across orders in pionless EFT. This exemplifies the\npossible use of Bayesian tools to identify inconsistencies in a proposed EFT\npower counting.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
