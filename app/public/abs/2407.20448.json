This is because these\nestimators extract the non-Gaussian information contained in the small scales.\nHowever, fully leveraging the statistical precision of such estimators is\nhampered by theoretical uncertainties, such as those arising from baryonic\nphysics. Moreover, as non-Gaussian estimators mix different scales, there\nexists no natural cut-off scale below which baryonic feedback can be completely\nremoved. We therefore present a Bayesian solution for accounting for baryonic\nfeedback uncertainty in weak lensing non-Gaussianity inference. Our solution\nimplements Bayesian model averaging (BMA), a statistical framework that\naccounts for model uncertainty and combines the strengths of different models\nto produce more robust and reliable parameter inferences. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of this approach in a Stage IV convergence peak counts analysis,\nincluding three baryonic feedback models. We find that the resulting BMA\nposterior distribution safeguards parameter inference against biases due to\nbaryonic feedback, and therefore provides a robust framework for obtaining\naccurate cosmological constraints at Stage IV precision under model uncertainty\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
