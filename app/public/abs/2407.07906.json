New concepts are introduced and compared with available\nnotions. Following the two proposed approaches, we study fuzzy differential\nequations. Their relation with Zadeh's extension principle and the generalized\nHukuhara derivative is discussed. Moreover, we prove existence and uniqueness\ntheorems for fuzzy differential equations. Illustrative examples are given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
