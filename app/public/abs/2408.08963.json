Algorithmic improvements and better lattice spacing determinations allow\nus to test the properties of the emergent de Sitter geometries of our\nsimulations to higher precision than previously possible. Although the\nagreement with de Sitter is good, the improved precision reveals deviations\nthat can be interpreted as non-trivial vacuum dynamics, well-described by a\ncosmological constant that runs with scale. The simulations show that the\ndominant running is quadratic and that the scale can be identified with the\nHubble rate. Several key cross-checks support this picture, including\nconsistent results across multiple lattice spacings and the fact that covariant\nenergy conservation is maintained. The parameters of the running are fully\ndetermined by simulations, enabling predictions when extrapolated to the scales\nrelevant for our universe. This leads to a model for dark energy that is\ncompatible with current observations, but which predicts deviations from\n$\\Lambda$CDM at the ${\\cal O}(10^{-3})$ level in cosmological observables that\ncould be tested with future improvements in precision measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
