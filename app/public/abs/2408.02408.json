Recent research shows that learning\ndiscriminative image representations under specific weather conditions can\nsignificantly enhance performance. However, the frequent occurrence of unseen\nextreme weather conditions hinders progress. This paper introduces MCGF, a\nMulti-weather Cross-view Geo-localization Framework designed to dynamically\nadapt to unseen weather conditions. MCGF establishes a joint optimization\nbetween image restoration and geo-localization using denoising diffusion\nmodels. For image restoration, MCGF incorporates a shared encoder and a\nlightweight restoration module to help the backbone eliminate weather-specific\ninformation. For geo-localization, MCGF uses EVA-02 as a backbone for feature\nextraction, with cross-entropy loss for training and cosine distance for\ntesting. Extensive experiments on University160k-WX demonstrate that MCGF\nachieves competitive results for geo-localization in varying weather\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
