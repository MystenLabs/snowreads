A handful of\nresearch efforts incorporate one or a few areal features while learning\nspatio-temporal correlation, to capture similar demand patterns between similar\nareas. However, urban characteristics are polymorphic, and they need to be\nunderstood by multiple areal features such as land use, sociodemographics, and\nplace-of-interest (POI) distribution. In this paper, we propose a novel\nspatio-temporal multi-feature-aware graph convolutional recurrent network\n(ST-MFGCRN) that fuses multiple areal features during spatio-temproal\nunderstanding. Inside ST-MFGCRN, we devise sentinel attention to calculate the\nareal similarity matrix by allowing each area to take partial attention if the\nfeature is not useful. We evaluate the proposed model on two real-world\ntransportation datasets, one with our constructed BusDJ dataset and one with\nbenchmark TaxiBJ. Results show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art\nbaselines up to 7\\% on BusDJ and 8\\% on TaxiBJ dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i2Icjf2Nio8dwON-k-OneOM7dopcS1R0pObx7ID8O_Q","pdfSize":"1030618"}
