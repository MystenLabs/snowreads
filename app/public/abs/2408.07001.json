The proximity of the magnetospheres of the\ncomponents leads to magnetospheric interactions, which are revealed as periodic\npulses in the radio light curve of this system. In this work, we aim to\ninvestigate the magnetospheric interaction phenomenon in the X-ray domain. We\nobserved this system with the XMM-Newton telescope, covering its orbital\nperiod. We observe variable X-ray emission with maximum flux near periastron,\nshowing similarity with radio observations. The X-ray spectra show\nsignificantly elevated hard X-ray flux during periastron. We attribute the soft\nX-ray emission to individual magnetospheres, while the hard X-ray emission is\nexplained by magnetospheric interaction, particularly due to magnetic\nreconnection. However, unlike in the radio, we do not find any significant\nshort-term X-ray bursts. This exotic system can be an ideal target to study\nmagnetospheric interactions in close binaries with organized magnetospheres.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
