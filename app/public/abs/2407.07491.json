In this article,\nwe extend Krein`s resolvent formalism in order to describe all, not necessarily\nself-adjoint, extensions $S \\subset \\tilde{A}$ with $\\varrho(\\tilde{A})\\neq\n\\emptyset$. The corresponding $Q$-functions turn out to be quasi-Herglotz\nfunctions. We will use their structure to characterize the spectrum of such\nextensions. Finally, we also provide a model for such an extension on a\nreproducing kernel Hilbert space when $S$ is simple.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
