We employ an adapted Vision\nTransformer (ViT) architecture to model quantum impurity models, optimizing it\nwith a subspace expansion scheme that surpasses conventional variational Monte\nCarlo in both accuracy and efficiency. Benchmarks against matrix product states\nin single- and three-orbital Anderson impurity models show that these ViT-based\nneural quantum states achieve comparable or superior accuracy with\nsignificantly fewer variational parameters. We further extend our approach to\ncompute dynamical quantities by constructing a restricted excitation space that\neffectively captures relevant physical processes, yielding accurate core-level\nX-ray absorption spectra. These findings highlight the potential of ViT-based\nneural quantum states for accurate and efficient modeling of quantum impurity\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
