Nonetheless, numerous empirical studies show that the ethical\nrequirements of the real world are very diverse and can change rapidly from\nregion to region. This eliminates the idea of a universal robot that can fit\ninto any ethical context. However, creating customised robots for each\ndeployment, using existing techniques is challenging. This paper presents a way\nto overcome this challenge by introducing a virtue ethics inspired\ncomputational method that enables character-based tuning of robots to\naccommodate the specific ethical needs of an environment. Using a simulated\nelder-care environment, we illustrate how tuning can be used to change the\nbehaviour of a robot that interacts with an elderly resident in an\nambient-assisted environment. Further, we assess the robot's responses by\nconsulting ethicists to identify potential shortcomings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3oOajPGXGTHvsdQezOpyzQJHQpNU9cuEFILiHmMvk0o","pdfSize":"747076"}
