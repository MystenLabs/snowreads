If $t$ is equal\nto $0$ and $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of $[0,1]^d$, it is known that the\n$(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\\cap[0,1]^d$ is a strictly increasing function\nof $d$ when $d$ is at least $3$. The study of the monotonicity of this volume\nis extended for $t$ up to above $1/2$ and, when $d$ is large enough, for every\nnon-negative $t$. In particular, a range for $t$ is identified such that this\nvolume is a strictly decreasing function of $d$ over the positive integers. The\nlocal extremality of the $(d-1)$-dimensional volume of $H\\cap[0,1]^d$ when $H$\nis orthogonal to a diagonal of either $[0,1]^d$ or a lower dimensional face is\nalso determined for the same values of $t$. It is shown for instance that when\n$t$ is above an explicit constant and $d$ is large enough, this volume is\nalways strictly locally maximal when $H$ is orthogonal to a diagonal of\n$[0,1]^d$. A precise estimate for the convergence rate of the Eulerian numbers\nto their limit Gaussian behavior is provided along the way.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
