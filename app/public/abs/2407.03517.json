Using\nbank-county-year level data, we provide evidence of the geographic imbalance of\ndeposits and loans and develop a methodology for investigating the contribution\nto this imbalance of branch networks, market power, and scope economies.\nResults are based on a novel measure of imbalance and estimation of a\nstructural model of bank competition that admits interconnections across\nlocations and between deposit and loan markets. Counterfactual experiments show\nbranch networks and competition contribute importantly to credit flow but\nbenefit more affluent markets.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
