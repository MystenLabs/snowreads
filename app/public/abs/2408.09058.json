While ground mobile robots are mostly employed in fruit\nharvesting, certain crops, like avocado trees, cannot be harvested efficiently\nfrom the ground alone. This is because of unstructured ground and planting\narrangement and high-to-reach fruits. In such cases, aerial robots integrated\nwith manipulation capabilities can pave new ways in robotic harvesting. This\npaper outlines the design and implementation of a bimanual UAV that employs\nvisual perception and learning to autonomously detect avocados, reach, and\nharvest them. The dual-arm system comprises a gripper and a fixer arm, to\naddress a key challenge when harvesting avocados: once grasped, a rotational\nmotion is the most efficient way to detach the avocado from the peduncle;\nhowever, the peduncle may store elastic energy preventing the avocado from\nbeing harvested. The fixer arm aims to stabilize the peduncle, allowing the\ngripper arm to harvest. The integrated visual perception process enables the\ndetection of avocados and the determination of their pose; the latter is then\nused to determine target points for a bimanual manipulation planner. Several\nexperiments are conducted to assess the efficacy of each component, and\nintegrated experiments assess the effectiveness of the system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
