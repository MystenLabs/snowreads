Although Bayesian methods are common in\nspatio-temporal modeling, standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques\nare usually slow for large datasets such as house price data. To tackle this\nproblem, we propose a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal modeling approach.\nThis method involves partitioning the data into multiple subsets and applying\nan appropriate Gaussian process model to each subset in parallel. The results\nfrom each subset are then combined using the Wasserstein barycenter technique\nto obtain the global parameters for the original problem. The proposed\nmethodology allows for multiple observations per spatial and time unit, thereby\noffering added benefits for practitioners. As a real-life application, we\nanalyze house price data of more than 0.6 million transactions from 983 middle\nlayer super output areas in London over a period of eight years. The\nmethodology provides insightful findings about the effects of various\namenities, trend patterns, and the relationship between prices and carbon\nemissions. Furthermore, as demonstrated through a cross-validation study, it\nshows good predictive accuracy while balancing computational efficiency.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
