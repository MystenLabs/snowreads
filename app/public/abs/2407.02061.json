In this paper, a LiDAR-based\nonline localization system is developed, incorporating road marking detection\nand registration on a high-definition (HD) map. Within our system, a road\nmarking detection approach is proposed with real-time performance, in which an\nadaptive segmentation technique is first introduced to isolate high-reflectance\npoints correlated with road markings, enhancing real-time efficiency. Then, a\nspatio-temporal probabilistic local map is formed by aggregating historical\nLiDAR scans, providing a dense point cloud. Finally, a LiDAR bird's-eye view\n(LiBEV) image is generated, and an instance segmentation network is applied to\naccurately label the road markings. For road marking registration, a semantic\ngeneralized iterative closest point (SG-ICP) algorithm is designed. Linear road\nmarkings are modeled as 1-manifolds embedded in 2D space, mitigating the\ninfluence of constraints along the linear direction, addressing the\nunder-constrained problem and achieving a higher localization accuracy on HD\nmaps than ICP. Extensive experiments are conducted in real-world scenarios,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
