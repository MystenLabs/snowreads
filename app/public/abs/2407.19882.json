In this paper, we\nestablish supercongruences for $$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\\frac{\\binom{x}{k}\\binom{x+k}{k}(-4)^k}{(dk+1)\\binom{2k}{k}}\\pmod{p^2}\n$$ and $$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\\frac{\\binom{x}{k}\\binom{x+k}{k}(-2)^k}{(dk+1)\\binom{2k}{k}}\\pmod{p^2},\n$$ where $d\\in\\{0,1,2\\}$. As consequences, we extend some known results. For\nexample, for $p>3$ we show $$\n\\sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\\binom{3k}{k}\\left(\\frac{4}{27}\\right)^k\\equiv\\frac19+\\frac89p+\\frac{4}{27}pE_{p-2}\\left(\\frac13\\right)\\pmod{p^2},\n$$ where $E_n(x)$ denotes the Euler polynomial of degree $n$.
