By looking at the ideal performance figures\nassumed to hold for these skeletons, we show that any stream parallel skeleton\ncomposition can always be rewritten into an equivalent \"normal form\" skeleton\ncomposition, delivering a service time which is equal or even better to the\nservice time of the original skeleton composition, and achieving a better\nutilization of the processors used. The normal form is defined as a single farm\nbuilt around a sequential worker code. Experimental results are discussed that\nvalidate this normal form.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jEmsd7fr-nPCeSRzaVqKqNi3ivctFz-iy2Igzeu0HSs","pdfSize":"196017"}
