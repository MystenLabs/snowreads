Considering a\nlinear\n  $f(R,T)=R+ 2\\lambda T$ form, we show that a wide variety of wormhole\nsolutions with asymptotically linear equation of state exist. Our solutions\nsatisfy all the energy conditions, namely the null, weak, strong and dominant\nenergy conditions. The relationship between free parameters in the shape\nfunction and boundary conditions is analyzed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
