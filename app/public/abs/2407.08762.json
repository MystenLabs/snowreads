Recent graph\nrewiring approaches facilitate long-range interactions in sparse graphs, making\nsuch rewirings commute-time-optimal on average. However, when an expert prior\nexists on which node pairs should or should not interact, a superior rewiring\nwould favour short commute times between these privileged node pairs. We\nconstruct two synthetic datasets with known priors reflecting realistic\nsettings, and use these to motivate two bespoke rewiring methods that\nincorporate the known prior. We investigate the regimes where our rewiring\nimproves test performance on the synthetic datasets. Finally, we perform a case\nstudy on a real-world citation graph to investigate the practical implications\nof our work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
