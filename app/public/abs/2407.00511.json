We provide a precise definition for knit objects with a knot theoretic\ncomponent and propose a simple undirected graph, a simple directed graph, and a\ndirected multigraph model for any arbitrary knit object. Using these models, we\npropose natural categories related to the complexity of knitting structures. We\nuse these categories to explore the hardness of determining whether a knit\nobject of each class exists for a given graph. We show that while this problem\nis NP-hard in general, under specific cases, there are linear and polynomial\ntime algorithms which take advantage of unique properties of common knitting\ntechniques. This work aims to bridge the gap between textile arts and graph\ntheory, offering a useful and rigorous framework for analyzing knitting objects\nusing their corresponding graphs and for generating knitting objects from\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DBq67KatdwYmzUclfULxp-qDN3dvA3udT0_s5xHRiFs","pdfSize":"970169"}
