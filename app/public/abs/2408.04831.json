This task confronts several difficulties: 1) the\nlimited number of input images that lack consistent information; 2) dependence\non the quality of input images; and 3) the substantial size of model\nparameters. To address these challenges, we propose a self-augmented\ncoarse-to-fine Gaussian splatting paradigm, enhanced with a structure-aware\nmask, for sparse-view 3D reconstruction. In particular, our method initially\nemploys a coarse Gaussian model to obtain a basic 3D representation from\nsparse-view inputs. Subsequently, we develop a fine Gaussian network to enhance\nconsistent and detailed representation of the output with both 3D geometry\naugmentation and perceptual view augmentation. During training, we design a\nstructure-aware masking strategy to further improve the model's robustness\nagainst sparse inputs and noise.Experimental results on the MipNeRF360 and\nOmniObject3D datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performances for sparse input views in both perceptual quality\nand efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
