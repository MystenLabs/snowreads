While these tools provide opportunities for improved\nteaching and education, they also pose significant challenges for assessment\nand learning outcomes. We conceptualize these challenges through the lens of\nvulnerability, the potential for university assessments and learning outcomes\nto be impacted by student use of generative AI. We investigate the potential\nscale of this vulnerability by measuring the degree to which AI assistants can\ncomplete assessment questions in standard university-level STEM courses.\nSpecifically, we compile a novel dataset of textual assessment questions from\n50 courses at EPFL and evaluate whether two AI assistants, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4\ncan adequately answer these questions. We use eight prompting strategies to\nproduce responses and find that GPT-4 answers an average of 65.8% of questions\ncorrectly, and can even produce the correct answer across at least one\nprompting strategy for 85.1% of questions. When grouping courses in our dataset\nby degree program, these systems already pass non-project assessments of large\nnumbers of core courses in various degree programs, posing risks to higher\neducation accreditation that will be amplified as these models improve. Our\nresults call for revising program-level assessment design in higher education\nin light of advances in generative AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BJNfu_fkQQXDWnMh6bbYWyF_IgYqiLFihezXlDvnFJo","pdfSize":"1274530"}
