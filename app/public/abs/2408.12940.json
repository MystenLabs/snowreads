The approach is based on developing\nthe \"one-zone\" density-temperature relationship of the gas into a full\ndynamical model. We convert this density-temperature relationship into a\nbarotropic equation of state, which we use to calculate the density and\nvelocity profiles of the gas. From these quantities we calculate the\ntime-dependent mass accretion rate onto the center of the cloud. The approach\nclarifies the mechanism by which radiative cooling induces gravitational\ninstability. In particular, we distinguish the rapid, quasi-equilibrium\ncontraction of a cooling gas core to high central densities from the legitimate\ninstability this contraction establishes in the envelope. We develop a refined\ncriterion for the mass scale of this instability, based only on the\nchemical-thermal evolution in the core. We explicate our model in the context\nof a primordial mini-halo cooled by molecular hydrogen, and then provide two\nfurther examples, a delayed collapse with hydrogen deuteride cooling and the\ncollapse of an atomic cooling halo. In all three cases, our results agree well\nwith full hydrodynamical treatments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
