Through the prism of the quest to quantise gravitational waves in\ncurved spacetimes, we study their properties from the point of view of\nellipticity, gauge invariance, and the existence of a spectral gap.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
