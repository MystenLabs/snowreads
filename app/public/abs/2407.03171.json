We utilise this framework to investigate the phases of\nsuch theories that arise by varying the couplings away from the conformal\npoint. We demonstrate that many 5d SCFTs, including strongly coupled gauge\ntheories, have couplings giving rise to massive, confining vacua with confining\nstrings and corresponding unbroken 1-form symmetries. The simplest examples\narise by considering the parameter space of {\\it complete} Ricci flat metrics\non discrete quotients of the standard conifold singularity. Varying other\ncouplings produces coupled 5d SCFTs interacting via massive BPS instanton\nparticle states.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
