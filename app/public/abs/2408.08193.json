While researchers have investigated how and why\nblind and d/Deaf people wish to disclose their disabilities in VR, little is\nknown about the preferences of many others with invisible disabilities (e.g.,\nADHD, dyslexia, chronic conditions). We filled this gap by interviewing 15\nparticipants, each with one to three invisible disabilities, who represented 22\ndifferent invisible disabilities in total. We found that invisibly disabled\npeople approached avatar-based disclosure through contextualized considerations\ninformed by their prior experiences. For example, some wished to use VR's\nembodied affordances, such as facial expressions and body language, to\ndynamically represent their energy level or willingness to engage with others,\nwhile others preferred not to disclose their disability identity in any\ncontext. We define a binary framework for embodied invisible disability\nexpression (public and private) and discuss three disclosure patterns\n(Activists, Non-Disclosers, and Situational Disclosers) to inform the design of\nfuture inclusive VR experiences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"KQK8iL7rFT7G8f24FXMRGb_BzqThXWg14uiL6l5Ydyk","pdfSize":"1992510"}
