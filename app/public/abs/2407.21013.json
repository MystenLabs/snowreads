A key complication in this\ncase is the need to handle the shot noise component of the associated discrete\nangular mask which, for sparse catalogs, can lead to strong coupling between\nvery different angular scales. We show that this problem can be solved easily\nby estimating this contribution analytically and subtracting it. The resulting\nestimator is immune to small-scale pixelization effects and aliasing, and, more\ninterestingly, unbiased against the contribution from measurement noise\nuncorrelated between different sources. We demonstrate the validity of the\nmethod in the context of cosmic shear datasets, and showcase its usage in the\ncase of other spin-0 and spin-1 astrophysical fields of interest. We\nincorporate the method in the public $\\texttt{NaMaster}$ code\n(https://github.com/LSSTDESC/NaMaster).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4kpNobMP-xzQ_aUJh7idUaM_X8H6aIlkn-o8abnkTh4","pdfSize":"1824735"}
