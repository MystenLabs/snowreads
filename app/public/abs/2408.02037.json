To deal with the challenge, it is promising to combine aerial\naccess networks (AANs) with multi-access edge computing (MEC) equipments to\nprovide computation services with high QoS. However, as for uncertain data\nsizes of tasks, it is intractable to optimize the offloading decisions and the\naerial resources. Hence, in this paper, we consider the AAN to provide MEC\nservices for uncertain tasks. Specifically, we construct the uncertainty sets\nbased on historical data to characterize the possible probability distribution\nof the uncertain tasks. Then, based on the constructed uncertainty sets, we\nformulate a distributionally robust optimization problem to minimize the system\ndelay. Next,we relax the problem and reformulate it into a linear programming\nproblem. Accordingly, we design a MEC-based distributionally robust latency\noptimization algorithm. Finally, simulation results reveal that the proposed\nalgorithm achieves a superior balance between reducing system latency and\nminimizing energy consumption, as compared to other benchmark mechanisms in the\nexisting literature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
