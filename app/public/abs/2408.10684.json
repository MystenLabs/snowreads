This research derives\nmathematical upper and lower bounds for the scrambling rate by applying the\nMaligranda inequality. Our results indicate that the upper bounds, lower\nbounds, and scrambling rates coincide precisely when local operators exhibit\nHermitian and unitary operators. Crucially, the convergence or divergence of\nthese upper and lower bounds relative to the scrambling rate is contingent upon\nthe system's initial state. To validate our theoretical framework, we\ninvestigated the spin-star model, considering both thermal and pure initial\nstates. Furthermore, three distinct scenarios for local operators were\nexamined, namely single-qubit, one multi-qubit, and both multi-qubit\nconfigurations. The implantation of the ancilla or external qubit aligns the\nscrambling rate with the established bounds. The upper and lower bounds may\ndiverge from the scrambling rate based on the system's initial state when both\nlocal operators are multi-qubit systems. We noticed that the scrambling rate\nincreased as the number of qubits in local operators increased.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aKndFolFnld6kueKKMHzYOlTQhcfDnol2gkL_z_SZ2c","pdfSize":"262129"}
