Using a holographic\ndescription of these defects furnished by probe D4-branes in AdS${}_7$\nsolutions of ten-dimensional type IIA supergravity, we compute the two\nindependent defect Weyl anomalies from the on-shell action for a spherical\ndefect and defect sphere entanglement entropy. We find agreement between the\nholographic prediction for the defect A-type anomaly coming from the defect\nsphere free energy and the leading large $N$ contribution to the defect `t\nHooft anomaly found using anomaly inflow. We also find agreement between the\nholographic computation of the expectation value of a surface operator wrapping\na torus and the supersymmetric localization computation for a circular Wilson\nloop in $\\mathcal{N}=1$ super Yang-Mills theory on $S^5$. Lastly, we\nholographically compute the defect gravitational anomaly from the Wess-Zumino\naction of the probe D4-brane, which provides a subleading large $N$ correction\nto the defect A-type anomaly.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JkDPgNzRkGCuaxeFe_7AyJSeU_eOlEtVYe2JKcJaOPw","pdfSize":"2438702"}
