While\ntransporting raw materials from Earth can be costly and time-consuming, in-situ\nresource utilization (ISRU) presents an attractive alternative. This review\npaper aims to provide a thorough examination of the current state and future\npotential of Lunar-based manufacturing and construction (LBMC), with a\nparticular focus on the prospect of utilizing in-situ resources and additive\nmanufacturing. The paper analyzes existing research on LBMC from various\nperspectives, including different manufacturing techniques and compositions,\nthe potential of ISRU for LBMC, characterization of built parts and structures,\nthe role of energy sources and efficiency, the impact of low-gravity and vacuum\nconditions, and the feasibility of using artificial intelligence, automation,\nand robotics. By synthesizing these findings, this review offers valuable\ninsights into the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead for LBMC.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
