In order to deeply investigate\ncomplicated interactions within MAS scenarios, we originally propose \"GNN for\nMBRL\" model, which utilizes a state-spaced Graph Neural Networks with\nModel-based Reinforcement Learning to address specific MAS missions (e.g.,\nBilliard-Avoidance, Autonomous Driving Cars). In detail, we firstly used GNN\nmodel to predict future states and trajectories of multiple agents, then\napplied the Cross-Entropy Method (CEM) optimized Model Predictive Control to\nassist the ego-agent planning actions and successfully accomplish certain MAS\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
