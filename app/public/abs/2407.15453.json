We\npresent a general-purpose post-processing algorithm that, using accurate\nestimates of the regression function and a sensitive attribute predictor,\ngenerates predictions that meet the demographic parity constraint. Our method\ninvolves discretization and stochastic minimization of a smooth convex\nfunction. It is suitable for online post-processing and multi-class\nclassification tasks only involving unlabeled data for the post-processing.\nUnlike prior methods, our approach is fully theory-driven. We require precise\ncontrol over the gradient norm of the convex function, and thus, we rely on\nmore advanced techniques than standard stochastic gradient descent. Our\nalgorithm is backed by finite-sample analysis and post-processing bounds, with\nexperimental results validating our theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
