We revisit Iyer-Wald derivation\nwithin the framework of covariant phase space with fluctuating boundaries. We\nextend Iyer-Wald derivation by relaxing the need for the assumptions at a\nbifurcation surface and asymptotic infinity, as well as addressing the\nquestions regarding the integrability of charges. Along the way, we also shed a\nclarifying light on the longstanding question of defining covariant charges in\ngeneral relativity and present a first principles derivation of the Smarr\nrelation within our framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
