A skew left brace\n$(A, \\cdot, \\circ)$ induces an action $\\lambda^{\\op}: (A, \\circ) \\to \\Aut (A,\n\\cdot)$, which gives rise to the group $\\Lambda_{A^{\\op}} = (A, \\cdot)\n\\rtimes_{\\lambda^{\\op}} (A, \\circ)$. We prove that if $A$ and $B$ are isoclinic\nskew left braces, then $\\Lambda_{A^{\\op}}$ and $\\Lambda_{B^{\\op}}$ are also\nisoclinic under some mild restrictions on the centers of the respective groups.\nOur key observation is that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the\nset of equivalence classes of irreducible representations of $(A, \\cdot,\n\\circ)$ and that of the group $\\Lambda_{A^{\\op}}$. We obtain a decomposition of\nthe induced representation of the additive group $(A, \\cdot)$ and of the\nmultiplicative group $(A, \\circ)$ corresponding to the regular representation\nof the group $\\Lambda_{A^{\\op}}$. As examples, we compute the dimensions of the\nirreducible representations for several skew left braces with prime power\norders.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
