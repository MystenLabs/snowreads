However, the explicit\nconstruction of local hidden-variable (LHV) models remains an outstanding\nchallenge in the general setting. To address this, we develop an approach that\nemploys gradient-descent algorithms from machine learning to find LHV models\nwhich reproduce the statistics of arbitrary measurements for quantum many-body\nstates. In contrast to previous approaches, our method employs a general\nansatz, enabling it to discover an LHV model in all cases where the state is\nlocal. Therefore, it provides actual estimates for the critical noise levels at\nwhich two-qubit Werner states and three-qubit GHZ and W states become\nnon-local. Furthermore, we find evidence suggesting that two-spin subsystems in\nthe ground states of translationally invariant Hamiltonians are local, while\nbigger subsystems are in general not. Our method now offers a quantitative tool\nfor determining the regimes of non-locality in any given physical context,\nincluding scenarios involving non-equilibrium and decoherence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
