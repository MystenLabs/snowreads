The hierarchy is complete, in the sense that if a\n$(\\!(n,K,\\delta)\\!)_2$ code does not exist then a level of the hierarchy is\ninfeasible. It is not limited to stabilizer codes and thus applicable\ngenerally. While it is formally dimension-free, we restrict it to qubit codes\nthrough quasi-Clifford algebras. We derive the quantum analog of a range of\nclassical results: first, from an intermediate level a Lov\\'asz bound for\nself-dual quantum codes is recovered. Second, a symmetrization of a minor\nvariation of this Lov\\'asz bound recovers the quantum Delsarte bound. Third, a\nsymmetry reduction using the Terwilliger algebra leads to semidefinite\nprogramming bounds of size $O(n^4)$. With this we give an alternative proof\nthat there is no $(\\!(7,1,4)\\!)_2$ quantum code, and show that\n$(\\!(8,9,3)\\!)_2$ and $(\\!(10,5,4)\\!)_2$ codes do not exist.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
