This problem arises in various applications, including image\nprocessing and network analysis. Previous research proposed Poisson matrix\ncompletion for count data with noise that follows a Poisson distribution, which\nassumes that the mean and variance are equal. Since overdispersed count data,\nwhose variance is greater than the mean, is more likely to occur in realistic\nsettings, we assume that the noise follows the negative binomial (NB)\ndistribution, which can be more general than the Poisson distribution. In this\npaper, we introduce NB matrix completion by proposing a nuclear-norm\nregularized model that can be solved by proximal gradient descent. In our\nexperiments, we demonstrate that the NB model outperforms Poisson matrix\ncompletion in various noise and missing data settings on real data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
