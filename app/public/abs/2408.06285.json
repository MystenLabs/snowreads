However, acquiring suitable\ndata to train these systems poses significant challenges. Privacy concerns\nprevent the use of real conversations, necessitating synthetic alternatives.\nSynthetic dialogue generation from publicly available clinical notes offers a\npromising solution to this issue, providing realistic data while safeguarding\nprivacy. Our approach, SynDial, uses a single LLM iteratively with zero-shot\nprompting and a feedback loop to generate and refine high-quality synthetic\ndialogues. The feedback consists of weighted evaluation scores for similarity\nand extractiveness. The iterative process ensures dialogues meet predefined\nthresholds, achieving superior extractiveness as a result of the feedback loop.\nAdditionally, evaluation shows that the generated dialogues excel in factuality\nmetric compared to the baselines and has comparable diversity scores with GPT4.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IBTPLHqtw-ikh5WluiK_Z_TgbaA8GCeecHgGxFS0fTA","pdfSize":"939423"}
