However, a\ncomprehensive study focusing on the complexities of the controllable phase\nevolution in this atomically thin film has yet to be performed. This work aims\nto address this issue by systematically investigating molecular beam epitaxial\ngrowth of monolayer Mo-Te compounds on bilayer graphene substrates. By\nutilizing scanning tunnelling microscopy, we explored a series of thermally\ndriven structural phase evolutions including distinct T'-MoTe2, H-MoTe2, Mo6Te6\nnanowires, and multistoichiometric MoTe2-x. Furthermore, we carefully\ninvestigated the critical effects of the growth parameters-annealing\ntemperature and time and tellurium concentration-on the controllable and\nreversible phase transformation within monolayer MoTe2-x. The findings have\nsignificant implications for understanding the thin film synthesis and phase\ntransformation engineering inherent to two-dimensional crystals, which can\nfoster further development of high-performance devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
