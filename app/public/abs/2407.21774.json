Comparative models are\nused to predict the possible impact of this noise factor and estimate spurious\nsolar-wind effects on acceleration noise in LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Data from\nNASA's Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE), situated at the L1 Lagrange point,\nserved as a reliable source of solar-wind data. The data sets were compared\nover the 114-day time period from March 1, 2016 to June 23, 2016. To evaluate\nthese effects, the data from both satellites were formatted, gap-filled, and\nadapted for comparison, and a coherence plot comparing the results of the Fast\nFourier Transformations. The coherence plot suggested that solar-wind had a\nminuscule effect on the LPF, and higher frequency coherence (LISA's main\nobserving band) can be attributed to random chance correlation. This result\nindicates that measurable correlation due to solar-wind noise over 3-month\ntimescales can be ruled out as a noise source. This is encouraging, although\nanother source of noise from the sun, solar irradiance pressure, is estimated\nto have a more significant effect and has yet to be analyzed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
