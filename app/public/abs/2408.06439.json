It is also commonly believed that this principle holds the key to\nanswering why, for example, we do not notice the orbital velocity of the Earth\nas we go about our day. And yet, I argue in this paper that the precise content\nof this principle is ambiguous: standard presentations fail to distinguish\nbetween two principles that are ultimately inequivalent, the \"External Galilean\nRelativity Principle\" (EGRP) and the \"Internal Galilean Relativity Principle\"\n(IGRP). I demonstrate that EGRP and IGRP play distinct roles in physics and\nthat many classical systems that satisfy IGRP fail to satisfy EGRP. I further\nshow that the Relativity Principle introduced by Einstein in 1905-which is not\nrestricted to classical systems-also leads to two inequivalent principles. I\nconclude by noting that the phenomenon originally captured by Galileo's famous\nship passage is much more general than contemporary discussions in the\nphilosophy of symmetries suggest.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"J5IJcQIMGy-jWYXUjpKLzhrlZlQwMOPmM8BMjQxI2Ig","pdfSize":"794753"}
