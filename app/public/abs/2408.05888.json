This paper provides a comprehensive review and analysis of\nintegrative approaches that harness AI techniques to enhance cybersecurity\nframeworks and optimize data management practices. By exploring the synergies\nbetween these domains, we identify key trends, challenges, and future\ndirections that hold the potential to revolutionize the way organizations\nprotect, analyze, and leverage their data. Our findings highlight the necessity\nof cross-disciplinary strategies that incorporate AI-driven automation,\nreal-time threat detection, and advanced data analytics to build more resilient\nand adaptive security architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
