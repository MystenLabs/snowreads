Specifically, we consider the\nsituation where both emission-absorption and scattering processes take place.\nWe study the initial boundary value problem given by the coupling of the\nradiative transfer equation with the energy balance equation on a convex domain\n$ \\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^3 $ in the diffusion approximation regime, i.e.\nwhen the mean free path of the photons tends to zero. Using the method of\nmatched asymptotic expansions we will derive the limit initial boundary value\nproblems for all different possible scaling limit regimes and we will classify\nthem as equilibrium or non-equilibrium diffusion approximation. Moreover, we\nwill observe the formation of boundary and initial layers for which suitable\nequations are obtained. We will consider both stationary and time dependent\nproblems as well as different situations in which the light is assumed to\npropagate either instantaneously or with finite speed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
