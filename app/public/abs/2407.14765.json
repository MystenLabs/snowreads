Achieving high-quality graph\nrepresentation is important for identifying linked patterns, leading to\nimprovements in Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to better capture data structures.\nHowever, challenges such as data scarcity, high collection costs, and ethical\nconcerns limit progress. As a result, generative models and data augmentation\nhave become more and more popular. This study explores using generated graphs\nfor data augmentation, comparing the performance of combining generated graphs\nwith real graphs, and examining the effect of different quantities of generated\ngraphs on graph classification tasks. The experiments show that balancing\nscalability and quality requires different generators based on graph size. Our\nresults introduce a new approach to graph data augmentation, ensuring\nconsistent labels and enhancing classification performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
