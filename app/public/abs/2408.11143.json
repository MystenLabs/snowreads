One is based on unique sequences\nof involutive distributions, while the other is based on a unique sequence of\nintegrable codistributions. In this paper, the relation between these sequences\nis discussed and it is shown that the tests are in fact dual. The presented\nresults are illustrated by an academic example.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tiPLh8QkBTfUOcmDl-hGvfmwuTg__po6tvbx4P6jV3k","pdfSize":"220928"}
