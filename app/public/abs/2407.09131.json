We investigate the scattering\nbetween wobbling kinks whose orthogonal shape mode is initially excited,\nexamining how the final velocities, amplitudes, and frequencies depend on the\ninitial excitation amplitude. The differences that this model presents with\nrespect to the $\\phi^4$ model and its novel properties are highlighted. This\nanalysis sheds light on the intricate dynamics that arise from the interplay\nbetween multiple degrees of freedom in kink scattering processes, offering\ninsights distinct from those observed in simpler models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gGyo6FzEcyPaw2cLaEpTZ9WV-fwMhzeBvpZEN8W93ek","pdfSize":"4386369","objectId":"0x985d387b2485ea359c57ee379941efd5185170ed5262099203aa92947b169a8f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
