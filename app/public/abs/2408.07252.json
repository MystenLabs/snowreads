Active control has been an effective strategy to suppress\nvibrations, but it faces great challenges in the real-time control of nonlinear\nflexible structures. Here, we present a control design framework using\nreductions on aperiodic spectral submanifolds (SSMs) to address the challenges.\nWe formulate high-dimensional nonlinear optimal control problems to suppress\nthe vibrations and then use the SSM-based reductions to transform the original\noptimal control problems into low-dimensional linear optimal control problems.\nWe further establish extended linear quadratic regulators to solve the reduced\noptimal control problems, paving the road for real-time active control of\nnonlinear flexible structures. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our control\ndesign framework via a suite of examples with increasing complexity, including\na finite element model of an aircraft wing with more than 130,000 degrees of\nfreedom.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
