However, there has been little work in\nassessing how well PINNs perform for inverse problems across wide ranges of\ngoverning equations across the mathematical sciences. We present a new and\nchallenging benchmark problem for inverse PINNs based on a parametric sweep of\nthe 2D Burgers' equation with rotational flow. We show that a novel strategy\nthat alternates between first- and second-order optimization proves superior to\ntypical first-order strategies for estimating parameters. In addition, we\npropose a novel data-driven method to characterize PINN effectiveness in the\ninverse setting. PINNs' physics-informed regularization enables them to\nleverage small quantities of data more efficiently than the data-driven\nbaseline. However, both PINNs and the baseline can fail to recover parameters\nfor highly inviscid flows, motivating the need for further development of PINN\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
