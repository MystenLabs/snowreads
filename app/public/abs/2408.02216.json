The 1,3-cyclohexadiene photoisomerization is\nprobed by the high-harmonic generation (HHG) process induced by the ultrashort\nfew femtosecond intense laser pulse. For each of the long-lived or stable\nisomers, we present results for HHG spectra and HHG ellipticities, as well as\nmulti-photon ionization. Moreover, the laser-induced electronic excitations are\ncalculated and the effect of excitations on HHG spectra is discussed. We\ndescribe the characteristic properties of the nonlinear response for each of\nthe isomers that can be used for ultrafast detection of the isomers by tracking\nthe specific changes in HHG response.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
