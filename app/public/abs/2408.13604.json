In this study, we report the\nthermopower measurements to investigate a change in Fermi surface across the\nQCP in pure and 4.4% Sn-doped CeRhIn$_5$. Results show that their thermopower\nbehavior differs significantly in the vicinity of their respective\npressure-induced QCP. In pure CeRhIn$_5$, a drastic collapse of the thermopower\ntakes place at the Kondo breakdown QCP, where the Fermi surface reconstructs\nconcurrently with the development of the magnetic order. By contrast, the\nthermopower exhibits a broadly symmetric behavior around the QCP in 4.4%\nSn-doped CeRhIn$_5$, which is a characteristic of the spin-density-wave QCP.\nThese observations are consistent with the theoretical expectations and suggest\nthe effectiveness of thermopower measurement in discriminating the nature of\nquantum criticality in heavy-fermion systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
