This research\nexplores methods for fusing iris and face feature vectors and implements robust\nsecurity measures to protect fused databases and conduct matching operations on\nencrypted templates using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE). Evaluations on\nthe QFIRE-I database demonstrate that our method effectively balances user\nprivacy and accuracy while maintaining a high level of precision. Through\nexperimentation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of employing FHE for template\nprotection and matching within the encrypted domain, achieving notable results:\na 96.41% True Acceptance Rate (TAR) for iris recognition, 81.19% TAR for face\nrecognition, 98.81% TAR for iris fusion (left and right), and achieving a 100%\nTAR at 0.1% false acceptance rate (FAR) for face and iris fusion. The\napplication of FHE presents a promising solution for ensuring accurate template\nmatching while safeguarding user privacy and mitigating information leakage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
