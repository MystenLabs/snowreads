We\nstudy the extremely non-generic irreducible components in the reduced part of\nthe Emerton-Gee stack for $\\mathrm{GL}_2$. We show precisely which irreducible\ncomponents are smooth or normal, and which have Gorenstein or Cohen-Macaulay\nnormalizations, as well as give a description of the singular loci. We use our\nresults to update expectations about the conjectural categorical $p$-adic\nLanglands correspondence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zpPwjgd3a-JYTSOI9Ru3UwFjEgCNmJZW76OMqBK3IgA","pdfSize":"528038"}
