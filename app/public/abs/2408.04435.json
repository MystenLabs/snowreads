While the folding of single molecules into\ncomplex structures is routinely achieved through engineering basepair\nsequences, much less is known about the emergence of structure on larger scales\nin DNA fluids. The fact that polymeric DNA fluids can undergo phase separation\ninto dense fluid and dilute gas opens avenues to design hierachical and\nmultifarious assemblies. Here we investigate to which extent the phase behavior\nof single-stranded DNA fluids is captured by a minimal model of semiflexible\ncharged homopolymers while neglecting specific hybridization interactions. We\nfirst characterize the single-polymer behavior and then perform direct\ncoexistence simulations to test the model against experimental data. We\nconclude that counterions not only determine the effective range of direct\nelectrostatic interactions but also the effective attractions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
