Combined with a societal shift from\npagan beliefs to Christian doctrines, Antiquity gave way to the Byzantine era.\nWhile Western Europe entered an extended period of intellectual decline,\nConstantinople developed into a rich cultural crossroads between East and West.\nYet, Byzantine scholarship in astronomy and geography continued to rely heavily\non their ancient Greek heritage, and particularly on Ptolemy's Geography.\nUnfortunately, Ptolemy's choices for his geographic coordinate system resulted\nin inherent and significant distortions of and inaccuracies in maps centred on\nthe Byzantine Empire. This comprehensive review of Byzantine geographic\nachievements -- supported by a review of astronomical developments pertaining\nto position determination on Earth -- aims to demonstrate why and how, when\nConstantinople fell to the Turks in 1453 and the Ottoman Empire commenced,\nByzantine astronomers had become the central axis in an extensive network of\nChristians, Muslims and Jews. Their influence remained significant well into\nthe Ottoman era, particularly in the context of geographical applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
