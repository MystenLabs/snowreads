Recently, neural operators have shown promise in learning PDE\noperators and quickly predicting the PDE solutions. However, training these\nneural operators typically requires large datasets, the acquisition of which\ncan be prohibitively expensive. To overcome this, physics-informed training\noffers an alternative way of building neural operators, eliminating the high\ncomputational costs associated with Finite Element generation of training data.\nNevertheless, current physics-informed neural operators struggle with\nlimitations, either in handling varying domain geometries or varying PDE\nparameters. In this research, we introduce a novel method, the Physics-Informed\nGeometry-Aware Neural Operator (PI-GANO), designed to simultaneously generalize\nacross both PDE parameters and domain geometries. We adopt a geometry encoder\nto capture the domain geometry features, and design a novel pipeline to\nintegrate this component within the existing DCON architecture. Numerical\nresults demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
