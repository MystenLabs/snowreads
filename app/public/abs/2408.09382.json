Recent advances in\ngenerative AI have enabled the automatic creation of realistic 3D layouts.\nHowever, it is unclear how capabilities of generative AI can be used in\nimmersive authoring to support fluid interactions, user agency, and creativity.\nWe introduce VRCopilot, a mixed-initiative system that integrates pre-trained\ngenerative AI models into immersive authoring to facilitate human-AI\nco-creation in VR. VRCopilot presents multimodal interactions to support rapid\nprototyping and iterations with AI, and intermediate representations such as\nwireframes to augment user controllability over the created content. Through a\nseries of user studies, we evaluated the potential and challenges in manual,\nscaffolded, and automatic creation in immersive authoring. We found that\nscaffolded creation using wireframes enhanced the user agency compared to\nautomatic creation. We also found that manual creation via multimodal\nspecification offers the highest sense of creativity and agency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
