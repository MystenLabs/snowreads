When the preheat field is light during inflation and its background\nvalue modulates the preheating process, the superhorizon isocurvature\nperturbations of the preheat field may be converted to curvature perturbations\nthat leave an imprint on the cosmic microwave background and the large-scale\nstructure of the universe. We use high-precision lattice simulations to study\nkinetic preheating after $\\alpha$-attractor inflation, a case where the\neffective mass of the preheat field is naturally suppressed during inflation.\nBy comparing the expansion e-folds between different Hubble patches, we find\nthat the conversion from isocurvature perturbations to curvature perturbations\nis very inefficient and can hardly be detected by cosmological observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
