This study proposed a mathematical model that simulates\nautonomic cardiac regulation response to Valsalva Maneuver, which is a commonly\nused test that provokes the autonomic nervous system. Dataset containing skin\nsympathetic nervous activity extracted from healthy participants' ECG was used\nto validate the model. In the data collection procedure, each participant was\nrequired to perform Valsalva Maneuver. The preliminary result of modeling for\none subject is presented, and the model validation result showed that the root\nmeasure square error between the simulated and measured average skin\nsympathetic nervous activity is 0.01$\\mu$V. The model is expected to be further\ndeveloped, evaluated using the dataset including 41 subjects, and ultimately\napplied for capturing the early signs of cardiac dysfunction in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qtyiTQl3JNjnlZZeTSnWnrGgWT9G8dtlCN2LqeFD4VE","pdfSize":"522330"}
