Here, we demonstrate\na novel method to coherently steer reaction flux of a three-body recombination\nprocess across different product spin channels. For this, we employ a\nmagnetically-tunable Feshbach resonance to admix, in a controlled way, a\nspecific spin state to the reacting collision complex. This allows for the\ncontrol of the reaction flux into the admixed spin channel, which can be used\nto significantly change the reaction products. Furthermore, we also investigate\nthe influence of an Efimov resonance on the reaction dynamics. We find that\nwhile the Efimov resonance can be used to globally enhance three-body\nrecombination, the relative flux between the reaction channels remains\nunchanged. Our control scheme is general and can be extended to other reaction\nprocesses. It also provides new opportunities in combination with other control\nschemes, such as quantum interference of reaction paths.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
