Lu, Introduction to Mathematical Sociology, Princeton UP,\n2012). Yet it attracts attention of numerous computational scholars, as it is\nan example of a macroscopic ordering which emerges as a consequence of local\ninteractions. In this paper, we investigate the thermal evolution (driven by\nthermal noise level $T$) of the work function $U(T)$ for Heider balance on\nseveral Archimedean lattices that contain separated triangles, pairs of\ntriangles, chains of triangles and complex structures of triangles. To that\nend, the heat-bath algorithm is applied. Two schemes of link values updating\nare considered: synchronous and asynchronous. In the latter case, the\nanalytical formula $U(T)=-\\tanh(1/T)$ based on the partition function is\nprovided. The Archimedean lattices are encoded with adjacency matrices, and\nFortran procedures for their construction are provided. Finally, we present the\nmathematical proof that for any two-dimensional lattice, perfect structural\n(Heider) balance is unreachable at $T>0$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VC_57uzsafuugrZbKl08NH-m-T8L-PktrO5N9i65RGQ","pdfSize":"6232483"}
