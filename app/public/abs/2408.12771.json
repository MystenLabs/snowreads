The origin\nrepresents a Hopf-zero equilibrium in the FitzHugh-Nagumo system for two\nclasses of parameters. In this paper, we employ recent techniques in averaging\ntheory to investigate, besides periodic solutions, the bifurcation of invariant\ntori within the aforementioned families. We provide explicit generic conditions\nfor the existence of these tori and analyze their stability properties.\nFurthermore, we employ the backward differentiation formula to solve the stiff\ndifferential equations and provide numerical simulations for each of the\nmentioned results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
