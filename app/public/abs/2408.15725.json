In most\nsimulations, agent capabilities and corresponding behaviour needs to be\nprogrammed into the agent. We report on the architecture of a tool that\ndisconnects the programmed functions of the agent, from the acquisition of\ncapability and displayed behaviour. This allows multiple different domain\nexperts to represent qualitative insights, without the need for code to be\nchanged. It also allows a continuous integration (or even change) of\nqualitative behaviour processes, as more insights are gained. The consequent\nbehaviour observed in the model is both, more faithful to the expert's insight\nas well as able to be contrasted against other models representing other\ninsights.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U6L6grdkrXV0v2w0WYoSBPv7wGAGgaJcfGTFI5yDP1E","pdfSize":"953367"}
