We train a specific class of deep auto-encoders that learn to\nreproduce the input waveforms after a data-compressive bottleneck, and then use\na simple triggering algorithm at the bottleneck to label waveforms as noise or\nsignal.\n  Our approach is motivated by the intuition that efficient compression of data\nshould represent signals differently from noise, and is facilitated by a\ntime-axis-preserving approach to auto-encoding and intuitively-motivated\nchoices on the architecture and triggering.\n  We demonstrate that the detection performance of the unsupervised approach is\ncomparable to, and in some cases better than, some of the state-of-the-art\nsupervised methods. Moreover, it has strong \\emph{cross-dataset\ngeneralization}. By experimenting with various modifications, we demonstrate\nthat the detection performance is insensitive to various technical choices made\nin the algorithm.\n  Our approach has the potential to be useful for other signal detection\nproblems with time series data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Geophysics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
