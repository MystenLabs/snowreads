In the absence of nightside heating, the entire atmosphere\ncollapses near the day-night terminator, so condensation seems inevitable, but\nthe impact of clouds on radiative transfer, dynamics, and observables has not\nyet been studied in the non-global atmospheric regime. Therefore, we simulate\ncloud formation and determine which lava planets should be most affected by\nclouds. We find that despite the scattering of visible light by clouds, heat\nadvection compensates for the cooling effect of clouds in the atmosphere. On\nthe other hand, surface temperatures are significantly affected and can drop\n100-200 K under a cloudy sky. We find that among our targets, HD213885b and\nHD20329b are most affected by cloud formation: there is a discernable\ndifference between having clouds and not having them, but the precision\nrequired to make such an inference is at the limit of current instruments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pUlM0-aPExHlKouXORI7QDLu2GhFSM2GVIegxROtOLI","pdfSize":"1713318"}
