Specifically, within the\nframework of conformally compactifiable manifolds, we prove a splitting theorem\nfor the Riemannian universal covering. Furthermore, we demonstrate two distinct\nmethods by which the Riccati equation can establish the connectivity of the\nconformal boundary under the static Einstein equation. Additionally, for\ncompact static triples possessing positive scalar curvature, we establish the\ncompactness of the universal covering.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Fh5iFmTVzD0VyBkmnZldr1onk_YpcDR014zfDu6HPVg","pdfSize":"251700"}
