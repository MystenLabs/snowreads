The present paper uses the Time-Discontinuous Galerkin Method (TDGM)\nfor computing the temporal contributions of the space-time separate-variables\nsolution of the LATIN-PGD approach, which offers several advantages when\nconsidering a high number of DOFs in time. The efficiency of the method is\ntested for the case of a 3D bending beam, where results and benchmarks\ncomparing LATIN-PGD to classical time-incremental Newmark/Quasi-Newton\nnonlinear solver are presented. This work represents a first step towards\ntaking into account uncertainties and carrying out more complex parametric\nstudies imposed by seismic risk assessment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2iEep5EBgZ9wM-eBVBlmhYaYh22xZ1GZMYAdYYjPnJk","pdfSize":"3087039"}
