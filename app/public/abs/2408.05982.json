Animals exhibit remarkable navigation abilities by efficiently\nusing memory, imagination, and strategic decision-making to navigate complex\nand aliased environments. Building on these insights, we integrate traditional\ncognitive mapping approaches with an Active Inference Framework (AIF) to learn\nan environment structure in a few steps. Through the incorporation of\ntopological mapping for long-term memory and AIF for navigation planning and\nstructure learning, our model can dynamically apprehend environmental\nstructures and expand its internal map with predicted beliefs during\nexploration. Comparative experiments with the Clone-Structured Graph (CSCG)\nmodel highlight our model's ability to rapidly learn environmental structures\nin a single episode, with minimal navigation overlap. this is achieved without\nprior knowledge of the dimensions of the environment or the type of\nobservations, showcasing its robustness and effectiveness in navigating\nambiguous environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
