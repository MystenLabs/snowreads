Due to\ntheir interactivity, non-linearity, and narrative nature, many aspects must be\ncoordinated and considered simultaneously. In addition, games are often\ndeveloped in an iterative workflow, making revisions to previous designs\ndifficult and time-consuming. In this paper, we present PaceMaker, a toolkit\ndesigned to enable common design workflows for pacing while addressing the\nchallenges above. We conducted initial research on pacing and then implemented\nour findings in a platform-independent application that allows the user to\ndefine simple state diagrams to deal with the possibility space of games. The\nuser can select paths on the directed graph to visualize a node's data in\ndiagrams dedicated to intensity and gameplay category. After implementation, we\ncreated a demonstration of the tool and conducted qualitative interviews. While\nthe interviews raised some concerns about the efficiency of PaceMaker, the\nresults https://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#commentsdemonstrate the expressiveness\nof the toolkit and support the need for such a tool.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
