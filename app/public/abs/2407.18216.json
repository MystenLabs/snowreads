Among regularities, periods and covers are the easiest to\ncompute and the more informative. Lately new interesting string matching\nresults have been achieved using different sampling techniques. One of these\ntechnique, called Character-Distance-Sampling (\\texttt{CDS}) consists of\nrepresenting a string by storing the distance between the positions of selected\ncharacters called pivots. Here we select as pivots only the first character of\nthe string and use its \\texttt{CDS} representation for computing its period and\nits shortest cover. Experimental results show that the proposed methods are\nmuch faster than classical methods for computing these two features.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HMqsjWBP6sAnl0y54QjqqpuNH_-Rm2i3LEfouvvMyJU","pdfSize":"181062"}
