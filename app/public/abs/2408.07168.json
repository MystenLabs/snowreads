Spicules are\njet-like structures observed in the Sun's chromosphere and transition region.\nSome spicules exhibit rotating motion, potentially indicating vorticity and\nAlfven waves. Machine learning and the Hough algorithm were used to analyze\nover 3000 frames of the Sun, identifying spicules and their characteristics.\nThe study found that rotating spicules, accounting for 21 percent at the poles\nand 4 percent at the equator, play a role in energy transfer to the upper solar\natmosphere. The observations suggest connections between spicules, mini-loops,\nmagnetic reconnection, and the acceleration of fast solar winds. Understanding\nthese small-scale structures is crucial for comprehending the origin and\nheating of the fast solar wind.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
