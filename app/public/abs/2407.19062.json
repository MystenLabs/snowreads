As it is well known,\nseveral results on holomorphic vector bundles can be extended to the Higgs\nbundles setting. In this article we show that some classical propositions,\ninvolving orthogonal decompositions of holomorphic hermitian vector bundles and\nthe second fundamental form of its holomorphic subbundles, can be extended to\nhermitian Higgs bundles. The extended results concerning orthogonal\ndecompositions have immediate applications in Higgs bundles, and we include\nthem in the form of two corollaries. The extended results concerning the second\nfundamental form are previously known in literature \\cite{Bruzzo-Granha}. Here\nwe revisit these results and include alternative proofs without using local\ncomputations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
