Here, we\nintroduce LLM-for-X, a system-wide shortcut layer that seamlessly augments any\napplication with LLM services through a lightweight popup dialog. Our native\nlayer seamlessly connects front-end applications to popular LLM backends, such\nas ChatGPT and Gemini, using their uniform chat front-ends as the programming\ninterface or their custom API calls. We demonstrate the benefits of LLM-for-X\nacross a wide variety of applications, including Microsoft Office, VSCode, and\nAdobe Acrobat as well as popular web apps such as Overleaf. In our evaluation,\nwe compared LLM-for-X with ChatGPT's web interface in a series of tasks,\nshowing that our approach can provide users with quick, efficient, and\neasy-to-use LLM assistance without context switching to support writing and\nreading tasks that is agnostic of the specific application.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
