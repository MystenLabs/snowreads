While the topology of the Calabi--Yau space determines\nthe overall matter content in the low-energy effective field theory, further\ndetails of the compactification geometry are needed to calculate the normalized\nphysical couplings and masses of elementary particles. In this work, we present\nnumerical computations of physical Yukawa couplings in a number of heterotic\nmodels in the standard embedding and demonstrate the existence of natural\nhierarchies, a coveted feature in string model building.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
