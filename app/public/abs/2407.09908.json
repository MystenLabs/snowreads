Recent angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy imply an intermediate regime\nwith hybridization fluctuations prior to the establishment of Kondo coherence,\nwhich appears at odds with traditional transport measurements. Extensive\nexperimental works are highly demanded to both reconcile this dichotomy and\ndelineate the intrinsic features in this special regime. Here, on the example\nof quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we investigated\nangular dependent magnetotransport properties by planar Hall effect and planar\nanisotropic magnetoresistance measurements. Upon cooling from $T_K^{on}$ (an\nonset of incoherent Kondo scattering ) to below $T^*$ (where coherent $c$-$f$\nhybridization comes into play), the two-fold symmetrical pattern of planar Hall\neffect changes sign gradually (i.e. $180^\\circ$ phase shift); most strikingly,\nas a crossover, additional oscillations appear and persist until the\nheavy-electron state is stabilized below $T^*$. These results provide new\ninsights for the regime of hybridization dynamics which might be deemed as a\nprecursor state of the heavy-electron state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
