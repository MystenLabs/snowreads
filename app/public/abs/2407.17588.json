The function of a corporate director is still\none of the few that are legislated for execution by a \"natural\" rather than an\n\"artificial\" person. The main prerequisites for development of systems for full\nautomation of management decisions made at the level of a board of directors\nare formed in the field of corporate law, machine learning, and compliance with\nthe rules of non-discrimination, transparency, and accountability of decisions\nmade and algorithms applied. The basic methodological approaches in terms of\ncorporate law for the \"autonomous director\" have already been developed and do\nnot get rejection among representatives of the legal sciences. However, there\nis an undeniable need for further extensive research in order to amend\ncorporate law to effectively introduce \"autonomous directors\". In practice,\nthere are two main options of management decisions automation at the level of\ntop management and a board of directors: digital command centers or automation\nof separate functions. Artificial intelligence systems will be subject to the\nsame strict requirements for non-discrimination, transparency, and\naccountability as \"natural\" directors. At a certain stage, autonomous systems\ncan be an effective tool for countries, regions, and companies with a shortage\nof human capital, equalizing or providing additional chances for such countries\nand companies to compete on the global market.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
