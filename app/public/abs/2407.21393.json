In this study, we extend a network model of $\\theta$-neuron\noscillators to include a realistic form of adaptive plasticity. In place of the\nless tractable spike-timing-dependent plasticity, we employ recently validated\nphase-difference-dependent plasticity rules, which adjust coupling strengths\nbased on the relative phases of $\\theta$-neuron oscillators. We investigate two\napproaches for implementing this plasticity: pairwise coupling strength updates\nand global coupling strength updates. A mean-field approximation of the system\nis derived and we investigate its validity through comparison with the\n$\\theta$-neuron simulations across various stability states. The synchrony of\nthe system is examined using the Kuramoto order parameter. A bifurcation\nanalysis, by means of numerical continuation and the calculation of maximal\nLyapunov exponents, reveals interesting phenomena, including bistability and\nevidence of period-doubling and boundary crisis routes to chaos, that would\notherwise not exist in the absence of adaptive coupling.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
