We apply the luminosity-volume\n($V/V_{\\mathrm{max}}$) test to examine the distribution of these transient\nsources, accounting for cosmological and instrumental effects, and determine\nthe energy distribution for the sampled population over the redshift range\n$0.01 \\lesssim z \\lesssim 1.02$. We find the distribution between $10^{23}$ and\n$10^{26}$J Hz$^{-1}$ to be consistent with both a pure power-law with\ndifferential slope $\\gamma=-1.96 \\pm 0.15$, and a Schechter function with\n$\\gamma = -1.82 \\pm 0.12$ and downturn energy $E_{\\rm max} \\sim 6.3 \\cdot\n10^{25}$J Hz$^{-1}$. We identify systematic effects which currently limit our\nability to probe the luminosity function outside this range and give a\nprescription for their treatment. Finally, we find that with the current\ndataset, we are unable to distinguish between the evolutionary and spectral\nmodels considered in this work.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
