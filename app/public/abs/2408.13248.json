We introduce a small-scale multimodal framework\nfor analyzing semiconductor electron microscopy images (MAEMI) through\nvision-language instruction tuning. We generate a customized\ninstruction-following dataset using large multimodal models on microscopic\nimage analysis. We perform knowledge transfer from larger to smaller models\nthrough knowledge distillation, resulting in improved accuracy of smaller\nmodels on visual question answering (VQA) tasks. This approach eliminates the\nneed for expensive, human expert-annotated datasets for microscopic image\nanalysis tasks. Enterprises can further finetune MAEMI on their intellectual\ndata, enhancing privacy and performance on low-cost consumer hardware. Our\nexperiments show that MAEMI outperforms traditional methods, adapts to data\ndistribution shifts, and supports high-throughput screening.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
