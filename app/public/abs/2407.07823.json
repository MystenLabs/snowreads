However, it remains unclear what particular\naspects (other than the stiffness generally spoken of in the literature) of the\nEOS and to what precision they will be better constrained. In this work, within\na Bayesian framework using a meta-model EOS for NSs, we infer the posterior\nprobability distribution functions (PDFs) of incompressibility $K_{0}$ and\nskewness $J_{0}$ of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM) as well as the slope $L$,\ncurvature $K_{\\rm{sym}}$, and skewness $J_{\\rm{sym}}$ characterizing the\ndensity dependence of nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\\rm{sym}}(\\rho)$,\nrespectively, from mean values of NS radii consistent with existing\nobservations and an expected accuracy $\\Delta R$ ranging from about 1.0 km to\n0.1 km. We found that (1) the $\\Delta R$ has little effect on inferring the\nstiffness of SNM at suprasaturation densities, (2) smaller $\\Delta R$ reveals\nmore accurately not only the PDFs but also pairwise correlations among\nparameters characterizing high-density $E_{\\rm{sym}}(\\rho)$, (3) a double-peak\nfeature of the PDF($K_{\\rm{sym}}$) corresponding to the strong\n$K_{\\rm{sym}}-J_{\\rm{sym}}$ and $K_{\\rm{sym}}-L$ anti-correlations is revealed\nwhen $\\Delta R$ is less than about 0.2 km, (4) the high-precision radius\nmeasurement for canonical NSs is more useful than that for massive ones for\nconstraining the EOS of nucleonic matter around (2-3) times the saturation\ndensity of SNM.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
