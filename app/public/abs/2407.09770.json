The topological properties are revealed through the observation of\nthe Berry curvature and hence the first Chern number, as a nonadiabatic\nresponse of the physical observable to the change rate of the control parameter\nof the modulated drive. The parameter manifold, constructed from the system's\nHamiltonian that determines its dynamics constrained in the state space spanned\nby the even and odd cat states as two basis states, is adjusted so that the\ndegeneracy crossing the manifold indicates a topological transition. The\nscheme, with such continuous variable states in mesoscpic systems, provides a\nnew perspective for exploration of the geometry and the related topology with\ncomplex systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
