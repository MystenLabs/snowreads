In particular, we deduce generation results for the\noperator $A :=- (1+|x|^2)^{\\alpha} \\Delta^{2}$, $0\\leq\\alpha\\leq2$. Moreover,\nwe characterise the maximal domain of $A$ in $L^1(\\mathbb{R}^N)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
