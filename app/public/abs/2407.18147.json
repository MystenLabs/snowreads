The shared task addresses\nbias and propaganda annotation in multilingual news posts. We focus on the\nearly days of the Israel War on Gaza as a case study. The task aims to foster\ncollaboration in developing annotation guidelines for subjective tasks by\ncreating frameworks for analyzing diverse narratives highlighting potential\nbias and propaganda. In a spirit of fostering and encouraging diversity, we\naddress the problem from a multilingual perspective, namely within five\nlanguages: English, French, Arabic, Hebrew, and Hindi. A total of 17 teams\nparticipated in two annotation subtasks: bias (16 teams) and propaganda (6\nteams). The teams competed in four evaluation tracks: guidelines development,\nannotation quality, annotation quantity, and consistency. Collectively, the\nteams produced 129,800 data points. Key findings and implications for the field\nare discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
