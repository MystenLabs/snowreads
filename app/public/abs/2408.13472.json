Concretely, we have shown that the\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the circuit forming an approximate\nt-design is given by simple integer optimization for general symmetry and\nlocality. By using the result, we explicitly give the maximal order of unitary\ndesign under the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$, U(1), and SU(2) symmetries for general\nlocality. This work reveals the relation between the fundamental notions of\nsymmetry and locality in terms of randomness.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SRcomMOzptMFFl0UY0GBaEva3NAympp23ZLOT0zpphM","pdfSize":"514932"}
