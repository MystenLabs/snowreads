Guessing Random\nAdditive Noise Decoding (GRAND) and Ordered Reliability Bits GRAND (ORBGRAND)\nare powerful universal decoding algorithms that work well with short, high-rate\ncodes. As short forward error correcting codes can help limiting latency, and\ncode unification in 6G calls for flexible, possibly code-agnostic decoders,\nGRAND and ORBGRAND are well suited to tackle 6G URLLC. This work proposes a\nultra-high, constant speed ORBGRAND decoder architecture with very low\nworst-case and average latency. Compared to a baseline architecture, through\nout-of-order output, aggressive clock gating, and selective programmability,\nthe decoder reduces area, power, and average latency by 15.5%, 19.4%, and 56%,\nrespectively. In 3nm FinFET technology, it achieves a constant throughput of\n95.49Gb/s, with 29.59ns worst-case latency and 13.02ns on average.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
