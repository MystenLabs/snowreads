Yet, the heavy SR DNN\ninference overhead leads to severe deployment challenges. To reduce the\noverhead, existing systems propose to apply DNN-based SR only on carefully\nselected anchor frames while upscaling non-anchor frames via the lightweight\nreusing-based SR approach. However, frame-level scheduling is coarse-grained\nand fails to deliver optimal efficiency. In this work, we propose Palantir, the\nfirst neural-enhanced UHD live streaming system with fine-grained patch-level\nscheduling. Two novel techniques are incorporated into Palantir to select the\nmost beneficial anchor patches and support latency-sensitive UHD live streaming\napplications. Firstly, under the guidance of our pioneering and theoretical\nanalysis, Palantir constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) for lightweight\nyet accurate SR quality estimation under any possible anchor patch set.\nSecondly, to further optimize the scheduling latency, Palantir improves\nparallelizability by refactoring the computation subprocedure of the estimation\nprocess into a sparse matrix-matrix multiplication operation.\n  The evaluation results suggest that Palantir incurs a negligible scheduling\nlatency accounting for less than 5.7% of the end-to-end latency requirement.\nWhen compared to the naive method of applying DNN-based SR on all the frames,\nPalantir can reduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 20 times (or 60 times)\nwhile preserving 54.0-82.6% (or 32.8-64.0%) of the quality gain. When compared\nto the state-of-the-art real-time frame-level scheduling strategy, Palantir can\nreduce the SR DNN inference overhead by 80.1% at most (and 38.4% on average)\nwithout sacrificing the video quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
