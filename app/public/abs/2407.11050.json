While there has been\nsubstantial progress in flexible neural network-based post-processing methods\nover the past years, most station-based approaches still treat every input data\npoint separately which limits the capabilities for leveraging spatial\nstructures in the forecast errors. In order to improve information sharing\nacross locations, we propose a graph neural network architecture for ensemble\npost-processing, which represents the station locations as nodes on a graph and\nutilizes an attention mechanism to identify relevant predictive information\nfrom neighboring locations. In a case study on 2-m temperature forecasts over\nEurope, the graph neural network model shows substantial improvements over a\nhighly competitive neural network-based post-processing method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
