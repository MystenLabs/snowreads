We showed the first experimental\nevidence of the conditions satisfying the same power exponents for extensional\nand shear viscosity, as indicated by the Carreau model. The extensional and\nshear viscosity are respectively measured by capillary breakup extensional\nrheometry dripping-onto-substrate (CaBER-DoS) and by a shear rheometer for\nvarious Ohnesorge number Oh. The viscosity ranges measured were about O(10^0)\nto O(10^4) mPas for shear viscosity and O(10^1) to O(10^3) mPas for extensional\nviscosity. Our experimental results show that, at least for the range of Oh >\n1, the power-law expression for the liquid filament radius, extensional\nviscosity, and shear viscosity holds, even for low-viscosity fluids.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
