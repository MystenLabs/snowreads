This paper provides a review on\nexisting motion measurement methods. In addition to the development of each\nbranch of vision-based motion measurement methods, this paper also discussed\nthe advantages and disadvantages of existing methods. Based on this discussion,\nit was identified that existing methods have a common limitation in optimally\nbalancing accuracy and robustness. To address issue, we developed the Gaussian\nkernel-based motion measurement method. Preliminary study shows that the\ndeveloped method can achieve high accuracy on simple synthesized images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
