This verifies a conjecture of Angarone, Nathanson, and Reiner.\nOur method gives an explicit interpretation to the coefficients of the\nequivariant $\\gamma$-expansion. Applying our theorem to uniform matroids, we\nextend and recover several known results regarding uniform matroids and\nEulerian quasisymmetric functions. Using these results, we are able to answer a\nproblem proposed by Athanasiadis about extending the $\\gamma$-expansion of the\nbinomial Eulerian polynomial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
