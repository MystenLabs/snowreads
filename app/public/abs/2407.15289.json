We compute the memory effect produced at\nthe black hole horizon by a transient gravitational shock wave, which from\nfuture null infinity is seen as a Bondi-Metzner-Sachs supertranslation. This\nresults in a change of the supertransformation charges at infinity between the\nspacetime geometries defined by the black hole before, and after, the shockwave\nscattering. For an extremal Kerr--Newman black hole, we give the complementary\ndescription of this process in the near-horizon limit, as seen by an observer\nhovering over the horizon. In this limit, we compute the supertranformation\ncharges and compare them to those calculated at null infinity. We analyze the\neffect of these transformations on the electromagnetic gauge field and explore\nthe self-interaction between this and the angular momentum of the black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
