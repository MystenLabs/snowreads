In this work, we\nintroduce a human-expert-inspired method to mitigate the hallucination of LLMs\nand improve the performance in HDL code generation. We first let LLMs classify\nthe type of the circuit based on the specifications. Then, according to the\ntype of the circuit, we split the tasks into several sub-procedures, including\ninformation extraction and human-like design flow using Electronic Design\nAutomation (EDA) tools. Besides, we also use a search method to mitigate the\nvariation in code generation. Experimental results show that our method can\nsignificantly improve the functional correctness of the generated Verilog and\nreduce the hallucination of LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wX2aYyf0--JLTuVk2grrGtVi18vjQAIo0Cd7RIe-usg","pdfSize":"372525","objectId":"0xa4f2aa0185b8579180461664bbbc8b98d0c0448e3d3b226542dc769495142a16","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
