This\nis followed by a reformulation of the optimality conditions into an elliptic\nPDE, which is only dependent on the adjoint state and can therefore be solved\ndirectly without the need for e.g. gradient methods or related iterative\nprocedures. Furthermore, we derive an a-posteriori error estimation for this\nsystem as well as its initial condition. We utilize this estimate to formulate\na procedure for the creation of an adaptive grid in time for the adjoint state.\nThis is used for 4D-var data assimilation in order to identify suitable time\npoints to take measurements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
