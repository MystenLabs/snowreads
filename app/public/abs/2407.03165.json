Given that the\ngeneralized winding number (GWN) field generated by a point cloud with globally\nconsistent normals is a solution to a PDE with jump boundary conditions and\npossesses harmonic properties, and the Dirichlet energy of the GWN field can be\ndefined as an integral over the boundary surface, we formulate a boundary\nenergy derived from the Dirichlet energy of the GWN. Taking as input a point\ncloud with randomly oriented normals, we optimize this energy to restore the\nglobal harmonicity of the GWN field, thereby recovering the globally consistent\nnormals. Experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art\napproaches, exhibiting enhanced robustness to noise, outliers, complex\ntopologies, and thin structures.
