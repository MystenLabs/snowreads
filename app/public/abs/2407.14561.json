To alleviate these problems, we introduce NNsight, an\nopen-source Python package with a simple, flexible API that can express\ninterventions on any PyTorch model by building computation graphs. We also\nintroduce NDIF, a collaborative research platform providing researchers access\nto foundation-scale LLMs via the NNsight API.
