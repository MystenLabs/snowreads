We define the finite $p$-entropy related to $\\omega$-plurisubharmonic\nfunctions and demonstrate their inclusion in an appropriate energy class. Our\nstudy is anchored in the analysis of finite entropy measures on compact\nK\\\"ahler manifolds, drawing inspiration from fundamental works of Di Nezza,\nGuedj, and Lu. Utilizing a celebrated result by Darvas on the existence of a\nFinsler metric on the energy classes, we conclude this paper with a stability\nresult for the complex Monge-Amp\\`ere equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
