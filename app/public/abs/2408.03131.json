In this work, we introduce Stochastic Trajectory\nOptimization for Demonstration Imitation (STODI), a trajectory optimization\nframework for robots to imitate the shape of demonstration trajectories with\nimproved dynamic performance. Consistent with the human learning process,\ndemonstration imitation serves as an initial step, while trajectory\noptimization aims to enhance robot motion performance. By generating random\nnoise and constructing proper cost functions, the STODI effectively explores\nand exploits generated noisy trajectories while preserving the demonstration\nshape characteristics. We employ three metrics to measure the similarity of\ntrajectories in both the time and frequency domains to help with demonstration\nimitation. Theoretical analysis reveals relationships among these metrics,\nemphasizing the benefits of frequency-domain analysis for specific tasks.\nExperiments on a 7-DOF robotic arm in the PyBullet simulator validate the\nefficacy of the STODI framework, showcasing the improved optimization\nperformance and stability compared to previous methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
