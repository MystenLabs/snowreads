A hot accretion flow is suggested to match the\nouter cold thin disc at a certain radius in the hard state, which may vary with\nthe accretion rate. In this work, we assume that the magnetic field generated\nin the outer thin disc is advected inwards by the inner hot accretion flow,\nwhich is substantially enhanced near the BH. Such a strong field threading the\nhorizon of a spinning BH is responsible for launching relativistic jets in\nBHXRBs via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Thus, both the jet power and the\nX-ray emission increase with the mass accretion rate, and we find that our\nmodel calculations are able to reproduce the observed radio/X-ray correlation\nquantitatively. For some individual BHXRBs, the slopes of the radio/X-ray\ncorrelations become steeper when the sources are brighter. Our model\ncalculations show that this feature is due to the transition of the outer disc\nwith gas pressure dominated to radiation pressure dominated, which leads to\ndifferent accretion rate dependence of the field strength in the outer disc.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
