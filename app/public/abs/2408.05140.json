The map of the city is described by a network with the edges\nrepresenting at the same time residential areas and communication routes. The\ntwo populations compete for space while interacting through the labour market.\nThe resulting model is described by a two population Mean-Field Game system\ncoupled with an Optimal Transport problem.We prove existence and uniqueness of\nthe solution and we provide several numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YXGu_lBiNFQDel3zo2_7wlxtPyButBTFMEgweCmXCRk","pdfSize":"6064478"}
