Calibrated\nintermolecular interactions from high-level electronic structure calculations,\nvalidated against experiments for the pure solvents were used to carry out\nclassical molecular dynamics simulations corresponding to experimental state\npoints for near-critical isotherms. Computed RER rates in low-density solvent\nof $k_{\\rm rot}^{\\rm Xe} = (3.67\\pm0.25)\\cdot10^{10}$ s$^{-1}$M$^{-1}$ and\n$k_{\\rm rot}^{\\rm SF_6} = (1.25\\pm0.12)\\cdot10^{11}$ s$^{-1}$M$^{-1}$ compare\nwell with rates determined by analysis of 2-dimensional infrared experiments.\nSimulations find that an isolated binary collision (IBC) description is\nsuccessful up to solvent concentrations of $\\sim 4$ M. For higher densities,\nincluding the supercritical regime, the simulations do not correctly describe\nRER, probably due to neglect of solvent-solute coupling in the analysis of the\nrotational motion. For VER, the near-quantitative agreement between simulations\nand pump-probe experiments captures the solvent density-dependent trends.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
