Davenport posed the problem of determining a condition on the\nminimum modulus $m_{0}$ in a finite distinct covering system that would imply\nthat the sum of the reciprocals of the moduli in the covering system is bounded\naway from $1$. In 1973, P. Erdos and J. Selfridge indicated that they believed\nthat $m_{0} > 4$ would suffice. We provide a proof that this is the case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
