Our work is motivated by recent results of\nEtheridge, Freeman, and Penington [EFP2017] and Huang and Durrett [HD2021], who\nproved convergence to classical mean curvature flow (MCF) for certain spatial\nstochastic processes, up until the first time when singularities of MCF form.\nOur arguments rely on the level-set method and the abstract approach to front\npropagation introduced by Barles and Souganidis [BS1998].\n  This approach is amenable to stochastic models equipped with moment duals\nwhich satisfy certain general and verifiable properties. Our main results\nimprove the existing results in several ways, first by removing regularity\nconditions on the initial data, and second by establishing convergence beyond\nthe formation of singularities of MCF. In particular, we obtain a general\nconvergence theorem which holds globally in time. This is then applied to all\nof the models considered in [EFP2017] and [HD2021].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
