We benchmark against\nexisting particle-filter methods by simulating measurement based feedback\ncooling in a two-mode system, whose low-dimensional nature permits a\ncomputation of an exact solution. The advantage of our method is multi-mode\nscalability, which we demonstrate through the first successful simulation of\nmeasurement-based feedback cooling of an incoherent quasi-1D thermal ensemble\nto quantum degeneracy. As the underlying principle of our approach exploits a\ngeneral correspondence between measurement and coherent feedback, we anticipate\nit is also applicable across a broad range of other quantum control scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
