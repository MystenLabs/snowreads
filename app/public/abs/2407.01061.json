To this end, we first obtain a uniform\nboundary H{\\\"o}lder estimate with the oblique boundary condition in an \"almost\n$C^1$-flat\" domain for the equations which is uniformly elliptic only where the\ngradient is far from some point, and then we establish a desired $C^{1,\\alpha}$\nregularity based on perturbation and compactness arguments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"isOy6vqUzYvha2e_2LnvHw97GrIKiUS2pyzvJ4gT1-g","pdfSize":"266755"}
