{"id":"2408.13602","title":"Unconditionally secure key distribution without quantum channel","authors":"Hua-Lei Yin","authorsParsed":[["Yin","Hua-Lei",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2024 15:13:14 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-27","timestamp":1724512394000,"abstract":"  Key distribution plays a fundamental role in cryptography. Currently, the\nquantum scheme stands as the only known method for achieving unconditionally\nsecure key distribution. This method has been demonstrated over distances of\n508 and 1002 kilometers in the measurement-device-independent and twin-field\nconfigurations, respectively. However, quantum key distribution faces\ntransmission distance issues and numerous side channel attacks since the basic\nphysical picture requires the use of quantum channels between users. Even when\nquantum repeater and quantum constellation are used, commercializing quantum\ncryptography on a large scale remains unattainable due to the considerable\nexpense and significant technical hurdles associated with establishing a global\nquantum network and facilitating mobile quantum communication. Here, by\ndiscovering the provable quantum one-way function, we propose another key\ndistribution scheme with unconditional security, named probability key\ndistribution, that promises users between any two distances to generate a fixed\nand high secret key rate. There are no quantum channels for exchanging quantum\nsignals between two legitimate users. Non-local entangled states can be\ngenerated, identified and measured in the equivalent virtual protocol and can\nbe used to extract secret keys. We anticipate that this discovery presents a\nparadigm shift in achieving unconditionally secure cryptography, thereby\nfacilitating its widespread application on a global scale.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
