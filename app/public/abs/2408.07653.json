We examine probability distributions, tail\nbehaviors, and other key stylized facts of the returns for a diverse range of\ntokens, including decentralized exchanges, liquidity pools, and centralized\nexchanges. Despite functional differences, most tokens exhibit well-established\nempirical facts, including unconditional probability density of returns with\nheavy tails gradually becoming Gaussian and volatility clustering. Furthermore,\nwe compare assets traded on centralized (CEX) and decentralized (DEX)\nexchanges, finding that DEXs exhibit similar stylized facts despite different\ntrading mechanisms and often divergent long-term performance. We propose that\nthis similarity is attributable to arbitrageurs striving to maintain similar\ncentralized and decentralized prices. Our study contributes to a better\nunderstanding of the dynamics of Web3 tokens and the relationship between CEX\nand DEX markets, with important implications for risk management, pricing\nmodels, and portfolio construction in the rapidly evolving DeFi landscape.\nThese results add to the growing body of literature on cryptocurrency markets\nand provide insights that can guide the development of more accurate models for\nDeFi markets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UMkLso-GUtqHLa3ruuUNx5nlEvNaSA9rkzft1U12VEc","pdfSize":"4827799"}
