In this paper, we demonstrate that in a phonon laser,\nthe radiation line width can depend on the pumping non-monotonically. This is\nbecause there are two different types of solutions whose spectra depend\ndifferently on the noise amplitude. The first solution is a zero solution,\nwhich is stable before the generation threshold and is nondegenerate. The\nsecond solution is a nonzero solution that is stable above the generation\nthreshold and is degenerate with respect to the phase. The line width of peaks\nin the spectrum of the zero solution does not depend on the noise amplitude.\nWhile, the line width of the peak in the spectrum of the nonzero solution\nincreases with increasing noise amplitude. The noise amplitude increases with\ntemperature, and, as a result, there is a temperature above which the\ntransition from the zero solution to the nonzero solution leads to an increase\nin the radiation line width. In this case, the radiation line width\nnon-monotonically depends on the pumping.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
