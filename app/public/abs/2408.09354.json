Large temporal scale variation of actions is one\nof the most primary difficulties in TAD. Naturally, multi-scale features have\npotential in localizing actions of diverse lengths as widely used in object\ndetection. Nevertheless, unlike objects in images, actions have more ambiguity\nin their boundaries. That is, small neighboring objects are not considered as a\nlarge one while short adjoining actions can be misunderstood as a long one. In\nthe coarse-to-fine feature pyramid via pooling, these vague action boundaries\ncan fade out, which we call 'vanishing boundary problem'. To this end, we\npropose Boundary-Recovering Network (BRN) to address the vanishing boundary\nproblem. BRN constructs scale-time features by introducing a new axis called\nscale dimension by interpolating multi-scale features to the same temporal\nlength. On top of scale-time features, scale-time blocks learn to exchange\nfeatures across scale levels, which can effectively settle down the issue. Our\nextensive experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art on the two challenging benchmarks, ActivityNet-v1.3 and\nTHUMOS14, with remarkably reduced degree of the vanishing boundary problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mXDOpBieqNo4e-KOiT1WYlV8V52zrds3qaiDrl24yy8","pdfSize":"1976805"}
