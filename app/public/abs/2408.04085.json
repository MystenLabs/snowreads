We\nalso construct a canonical strong Calabi-Yau structure on microsheaves\n$\\operatorname{\\mu sh}_\\Lambda(\\Lambda)$. Our approach does not require local\nproperness and hence does not depend on arborealization. We thus obtain a\ncanonical smooth relative Calabi-Yau structure on the Orlov functor for wrapped\nFukaya categories of cotangent bundles with Weinstein stops, such that the\nwrap-once functor is the inverse dualizing bimodule.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
