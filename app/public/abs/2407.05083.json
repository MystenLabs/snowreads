However, the interactions among agents in\nthe comment sections for fake and real news have not been fully explored. In\nthis study, we analyze a dataset comprising both fake and real news from Reddit\nto investigate agent interaction patterns, considering both the network\nstructure and the sentiment of the nodes. Our findings reveal that (i) comments\non fake news are more likely to form groups, (ii) compared to fake news, where\nusers generate more negative sentiment, real news tend to elicit more neutral\nand positive sentiments. Additionally, nodes with similar sentiments cluster\ntogether more tightly than anticipated. From a dynamic perspective, we found\nthat the sentiment distribution among nodes stabilizes early and remains stable\nover time. These findings have both theoretical and practical implications,\nparticularly for the early detection of real and fake news within social\nnetworks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
