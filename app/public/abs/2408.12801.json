These delays, originating from a\nmultitude of sources like varying data transmission dynamics, sensor\ninterferences, and environmental changes, introduce significant complexities.\nTraditional Time Delay Estimation methods, which typically assume a fixed\nconstant time delay, may not fully capture these variabilities, compromising\nthe precision of predictive models in diverse settings. To address this issue,\nwe introduce the Time Series Model Bootstrap (TSMB), a versatile framework\ndesigned to handle potentially varying or even nondeterministic time delays in\ntime series modeling. Contrary to traditional approaches that hinge on the\nassumption of a single, consistent time delay, TSMB adopts a nonparametric\nstance, acknowledging and incorporating time delay uncertainties. TSMB\nsignificantly bolsters the performance of models that are trained and make\npredictions using this framework, making it highly suitable for a wide range of\ndynamic and interconnected data environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
