We utilize both the closed system's method and open\nsystem's method to achieve this goal. To accurately calculate the Krylov\ncomplexity, we purified the thermal state, resulting in a pure state with two\nmodes. Our analysis with both methods indicates that the Krylov complexity will\nincrease during inflation, but will saturate at constant values during the\nradiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods, where the generation of\nparticles via preheating leads to this evolution. Furthermore, our findings\nreveal that inflation behaves as a strong dissipative system, while the\nradiation-dominated and matter-dominated periods act as weak dissipative\nsystems. The chaotic feature during these periods follows a similar trend to\nthe Krylov complexity. This research has the potential to provide new insights\ninto the exploration of Krylov complexity in cosmology.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mwJOIfgXDpvXl-Ib7bdy7QewPb73CwRL4RabPUXUFWk","pdfSize":"2068275"}
