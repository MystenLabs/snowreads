In particular, we show that it\nis always finitely generated over $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ and, whenever $n \\geq 2$, is\nof rank $2$, thereby confirming a prediction made by Hopkins in the early\n1990s. In fact, with the exception of the anomalous case $n=p=2$, we provide a\nfull set of topological generators for these groups. Our arguments rely on\nrecent advances in $p$-adic geometry to translate the problem to a computation\non Drinfeld's symmetric space, which can then be solved using results of\nColmez--Dospinescu--Niziol.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
