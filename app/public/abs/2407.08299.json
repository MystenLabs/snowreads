However, numerous real systems are\nfeatured with a dynamic evolution including network reduction in addition to\nnetwork growth. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for evolving\nnetworks from the perspective of vertex degree. We construct a queueing system\nto describe the increase and decrease of vertex degree, which drives the\nnetwork evolution. In our mechanism, the degree increase rate is regarded as a\nfunction positively correlated to the degree of a vertex, ensuring the\npreferential attachment in a new way. Degree distributions are investigated\nunder two expressions of the degree increase rate, one of which manifests a\n``long tail'', and another one varies with different values of parameters. In\nsimulations, we compare our theoretical distributions with simulation results\nand also apply them to real networks, which presents the validity and\napplicability of our model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
