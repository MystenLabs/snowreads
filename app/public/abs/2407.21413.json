Validators\ntake effort to verify the validity of the announcements, gaining rewards for\nsuccessfully challenging invalid ones, while receiving nothing for valid ones.\nOptimistic Rollup, a Layer 2 blockchain scaling solution, exemplifies such\ngames, offering significant improvements in transaction throughput and cost\nefficiency. We present a game-theoretic model of announcement games to analyze\nthe potential behaviors of announcers and validators. We identify all Nash\nequilibria and study the corresponding system losses for different Nash\nequilibria. Additionally, we analyze the impact of various system parameters on\nsystem loss under the Nash equilibrium. Finally, we provide suggestions for\nmechanism optimization to reduce system losses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
