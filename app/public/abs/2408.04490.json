We\nutilize concepts of chaining like mode of operation and present a block cipher\nwith in-built properties. We prove that SEBQ shows resistance against chosen\nplaintext attack (CPA) and by applying unbalanced Feistel transformation [19],\nit achieves security against chosen ciphertext attacks (CCA). Subsequently, we\nconduct an assessment of the randomness of the proposed scheme by running the\nNIST test suite and we analyze the impact of the initial vector, secret key and\nplaintext on ciphertext through an avalanche effect analysis. We also compare\nthe results with existing schemes based on quasigroups [11,46]. Moreover, we\nanalyze the computational complexity in terms of number of operations needed\nfor encryption and decryption process.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SgMxPJ4QrtYljLO3FGRQNvPRvT4s5i8S1la5dJmSP6o","pdfSize":"313020"}
