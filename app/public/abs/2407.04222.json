By employing the new relations, both the $\\lambda$-trajectories and the\n$\\rho$-trajectories for the tetraquarks $(Qq)(\\bar{Q}\\bar{q}')$ can be\ndiscussed. The masses of the $\\lambda$-mode excited states and the $\\rho$-mode\nexcited states are estimated, and they agree with other theoretical\npredictions. We show that the behaviors of the $\\rho$-trajectories are\ndifferent from those of the $\\lambda$-trajectories. The $\\rho$-trajectories\nbehave as $M{\\sim}x_{\\rho}^{1/2}$ $(x_{\\rho}=n_r,\\,l)$ while the\n$\\lambda$-trajectories behave as $M{\\sim}x_{\\lambda}^{2/3}$\n$(x_{\\lambda}=N_r,\\,L)$. Moreover, the Regge trajectory behaviors for other\ntypes of tetraquarks are investigated based on the spinless Salpeter equation.\nWe show that both the $\\lambda$-trajectories and the $\\rho$-trajectories are\nconcave downwards in the $(M^2,\\,x)$ plane. The Regge trajectories for the\ntetraquarks containing the light diquark and/or the light antidiquark also are\nconcave in the $(M^2,\\,x)$ plane when the masses of the light constituents are\nincluded and the confining potential is linear.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
