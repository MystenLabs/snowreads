A\ndata-driven approach consists on to deduce behaviors that may exist in real\nsituation to obtain different types of trajectories from a large set of\nobservations. The data, and its classification, could then be used to train\nmodels capable to extrapolate such behavior. Cars and two different types of\nVulnerable Road Users (VRU) will be considered by the trajectory clustering\nmethods proposed: pedestrians and cyclists. The results reported here evaluate\nmethods to extract well-defined trajectory classes from raw data without the\nuse of map information while also separating ''eccentric'' or incomplete\ntrajectories from the ones that are complete and representative in any\nscenario. Two environments will serve as test for the methods develop, three\ndifferent intersections and one roundabout. The resulting clusters of\ntrajectories can then be used for prediction or learning tasks or discarded if\nit is composed by outliers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
