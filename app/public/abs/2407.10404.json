It is shown\nthat there exists an isomorphism between the algebra ${\\mathcal A}(n)$ and the\nhigher Askey-Wilson algebra ${\\mathfrak{aw}}(n)$ introduced by Cramp\\'{e},\nFrappat et al. Furthermore, we establish a series of automorphisms of\n${\\mathcal A}(n),$ which satisfy braid group relations and coincide with those\nin ${\\mathfrak{aw}}(n).$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
