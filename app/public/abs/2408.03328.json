To achieve our goal, we first use sentiment\nanalysis techniques to quantify the tone of SBP monetary policy documents and\nsecond, we use short time window, high frequency methodology to approximate the\nimpact of tone on stock market returns. Our results show that positive\n(negative) change in the tone positively (negatively) impacts stock returns in\nKarachi Stock Exchange. Further extension shows that the communication of SBP\nstill has a statistically significant impact on stock returns when controlling\nfor different variables and monetary policy tool. Also, the communication of\nSBP does not have a long term constant effect on stock market.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"2iBH48cbgJCopJWonLCKeqE9W7OFgkUFAbI1P_ULioo","pdfSize":"491896"}
