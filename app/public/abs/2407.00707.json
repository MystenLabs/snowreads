At\nthe heart of chemical and physical sciences is the accurate ab initio\ncalculation of many-body wavefunction, which has become one of the most notable\nexamples to demonstrate the power of deep learning in science. In particular,\nthe introduction of deep learning into quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) has\nsignificantly advanced the frontier of ab initio calculation, offering a\nuniversal tool to solve the electronic structure of materials and molecules.\nDeep learning QMC architectures were initial designed and tested on small\nmolecules, focusing on comparisons with other state-of-the-art ab initio\nmethods. Methodological developments, including extensions to real solids and\nperiodic models, have been rapidly progressing and reported applications are\nfast expanding. This review covers the theoretical foundation of deep learning\nQMC for solids, the neural network wavefunction ansatz, and various of other\nmethodological developments. Applications on computing energy, electron\ndensity, electric polarization, force and stress of real solids are also\nreviewed. The methods have also been extended to other periodic systems and\nfinite temperature calculations. The review highlights the potentials and\nexisting challenges of deep learning QMC in materials chemistry and condensed\nmatter physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
