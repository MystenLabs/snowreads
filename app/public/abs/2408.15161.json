As an application I show how the\nrelation can be used to quickly prove normalization identities for the Weyl\nfunction, and apply the result to Weyl magic and Wigner magic as the\ngeneralization of the recently suggested Renyi Stabilizer entropy to q-dits and\nCV.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
