As the stable limit, we identify the cohomology of\nHilbert schemes of blow-up of a surface as the tensor product of cohomology of\nHilbert schemes on the surface with a Bosonic Fock space. The actions of the\ninfinite-dimensional Clifford algebra and Heisenberg algebra are all given by\ngeometric correspondences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
