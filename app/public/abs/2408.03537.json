The resulting structures are evaluated by\nvarious functionals, including GGA (PBE), meta-GGA (TPSS) and hybrid (B3PW91,\nPBE0, PBEh-3c, M06-L), in conjunction with the Def2TZVP basis set. The results\nbased on these functionals show that two different structures compete for the\nglobal minimum. The structural and electronic properties of the two most stable\nstructures are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
