Traditional diagnostic methods for traumatic injuries,\nsuch as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI, are often time-consuming and dependent on\nmedical expertise, which can delay critical interventions. This study explores\nthe application of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) to\nimprove the speed and accuracy of abdominal trauma diagnosis. We developed an\nadvanced AI-based model combining 3D segmentation, 2D Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNN), and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) to enhance diagnostic\nperformance. Our model processes abdominal CT scans to provide real-time,\nprecise assessments, thereby improving clinical decision-making and patient\noutcomes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrated that our approach\nsignificantly outperforms traditional diagnostic methods, as evidenced by\nrigorous evaluation metrics. This research sets a new benchmark for automated\ntrauma detection, leveraging the strengths of AI and ML to revolutionize trauma\ncare.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
