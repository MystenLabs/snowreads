Kinematic estimates of the age of this association were obtained in\ntwo ways. The first method -- analysis of stellar trajectories integrated back\nin time -- gave an estimate of the age $t=4.9\\pm1.2$ Myr. The second was to\nanalyze the instantaneous velocities of stars and showed that there is a volume\nexpansion of the stellar system with an angular velocity coefficient\n$K_{xyz}=103\\pm12$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. Based on this effect, the time\ninterval that passed from the beginning of the expansion of the TW Hya\nassociation to the present moment was found, $t=9.5\\pm1.1$ Myr. The following\nprincipal semi-axes of the residual velocity ellipsoid are determined:\n$\\sigma_{1,2,3}=(5.25,1.84,0.35)\\pm(0.34,0.63,0.26)$ km s$^{-1}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
