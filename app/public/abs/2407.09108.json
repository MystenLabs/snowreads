The experimental data, corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations,\nreveal a rapid decrease in the local temperature of the carbon atom gas to\napproximately 10~K within tens of microseconds. The findings establish a major\nstep towards novel research utilizing cold and ultracold carbon atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
