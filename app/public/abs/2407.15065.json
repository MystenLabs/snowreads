The Oxygen nucleus ($^{16}$O) is a doubly\nmagic nucleus, where the presence of an $\\alpha$-clustered nuclear structure\ngrants additional nuclear stability. In this study, we exploit the anisotropic\nflow coefficients to discern the effects of an $\\alpha$-clustered nuclear\ngeometry w.r.t. a Woods-Saxon nuclear distribution in O--O collisions at\n$\\sqrt{s_{\\rm NN}}=7$ TeV using a hybrid of IP-Glasma + MUSIC + iSS + UrQMD\nmodels. In addition, we use the multi-particle cumulants method to measure\nanisotropic flow coefficients, such as elliptic flow ($v_{2}$) and triangular\nflow ($v_{3}$), as a function of collision centrality. Anisotropic flow\nfluctuations, which are expected to be larger in small collision systems, are\nalso studied for the first time in O--O collisions. It is found that an\n$\\alpha$-clustered nuclear distribution gives rise to an enhanced value of\n$v_{2}$ and $v_3$ towards the highest multiplicity classes. Consequently, a\nrise in $v_3/v_2$ is also observed for the (0-10)\\% centrality class. Further,\nfor $\\alpha$-clustered O--O collisions, fluctuations of $v_{2}$ are larger for\nthe most central collisions, which decrease towards the mid-central collisions.\nIn contrast, for a Woods-Saxon $^{16}$O nucleus, $v_{2}$ fluctuations show an\nopposite behavior with centrality. This study, when confronted with\nexperimental data may reveal the importance of nuclear density profile on the\ndiscussed observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
