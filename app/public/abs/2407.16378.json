This\nchallenge becomes increasingly critical as IoT deployments continue to expand,\ndemanding robust mechanisms for handling diverse traffic scenarios. In this\nstudy, we propose a novel approach leveraging Successive Interference\nCancellation (SIC) based on adaptive and fixed parameter schemes to address\nthese limitations. By analyzing both throughput and AoI along with access\ndelay, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our adaptive approach compared to\nthe fixed approach, particularly in scenarios featuring heavy and light\ntraffic. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of adaptive approaches in\noptimizing data collection processes in IoT ecosystems, with a particular focus\non minimizing access delay, AoI, and spectral efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
