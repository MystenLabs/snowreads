In 1960, Baumgartner proposed a hypothesis for\nthe illusion based on neural receptive fields, but Geier presented a\ncounterexample in 2008. In 1994, Spillmann devised the scintillating grid\nillusion, an improvement on the Hermann grid illusion. I propose that a\nhypothesis involving blind spots (optic discs) can significantly contribute to\nunraveling the mystery of the grid illusion.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
