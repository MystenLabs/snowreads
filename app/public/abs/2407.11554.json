When the number of\nsimultaneously active users is less than or equal to $w$, a CAC of length $L$\nwith weight $w$ can provide a hard guarantee that each active user has at least\none successful transmission within every consecutive $L$ slots. In this paper,\nwe generalize some previously known constructions of constant-weight CACs, and\nthen derive several classes of optimal CACs by the help of Kneser's Theorem and\nsome techniques in Additive Combinatorics. Another spotlight of this paper is\nto relax the identical-weight constraint in prior studies to study mixed-weight\nCACs for the first time, for the purpose of increasing the throughput and\nreducing the access delay of some potential users with higher priority. As\napplications of those obtained optimal CACs, we derive some classes of optimal\nmixed-weight CACs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
