In the context of applications like cloud computing, ZKPs can be\nused by a client (called the verifier) to verify the service provider (called\nthe prover) is in fact performing the correct computation based on a public\ninput. A recently prominent variant of ZKPs is zkSNARKs, generating succinct\nproofs that can be rapidly verified by the end user. However, proof generation\nitself is very time consuming per transaction. Two key primitives in proof\ngeneration are the Number Theoretic Transform (NTT) and Multi-scalar\nMultiplication (MSM). These primitives are prime candidates for hardware\nacceleration, and prior works have looked at GPU implementations and custom\nRTL. However, both algorithms involve complex dataflow patterns -- standard\nNTTs have irregular memory accesses for butterfly computations from stage to\nstage, and MSMs using Pippenger's algorithm have data-dependent memory accesses\nfor partial sum calculations. We present SZKP, a scalable accelerator framework\nthat is the first ASIC to accelerate an entire proof on-chip by leveraging\nstructured dataflows for both NTTs and MSMs. SZKP achieves conservative\nfull-proof speedups of over 400$\\times$, 3$\\times$, and 12$\\times$ over CPU,\nASIC, and GPU implementations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
