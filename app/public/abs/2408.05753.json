Specifically,\nwe focus on nucleation and phase transitions of the decagonal quasicrystal\n(DQC) based on the Lifshitz-Petrich model. We present the nucleation path of\nDQC from the liquid and demonstrate one- and two-stage transition paths between\nDQC and periodic crystals. We provide a perspective of the group-subgroup phase\ntransition and nucleation rates to understand the nucleation and phase\ntransition mechanisms involving DQC. These results reveal the one-step and\nstepwise modes of symmetry breaking or recovery in the phase transition from\nDQC, where the stepwise modes are more probable.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
