For this aim, we establish decay\nestimates of the fractional heat semigroup in several uniformly local Zygumnd\nspaces. Furthermore, we apply the real interpolation method in uniformly local\nZygmund spaces to obtain sharp integral estimates on the inhomogeneous term and\nthe nonlinear term. This enables us to find sharp sufficient conditions for the\nexistence of solutions to the fractional semilinear heat equation with a\nsingular inhomogeneous term.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
