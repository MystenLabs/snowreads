Existing segmentation techniques, including\nthe Segment Anything Model(SAM), are notably inadequate in addressing the\ncomplex issue of sperm overlap-a frequent occurrence in clinical samples. Our\nexploratory studies reveal that modifying image characteristics by removing\nsperm heads and easily segmentable areas, alongside enhancing the visibility of\noverlapping regions, markedly enhances SAM's efficiency in segmenting intricate\nsperm structures. Motivated by these findings, we present the Cascade SAM for\nSperm Segmentation (CS3), an unsupervised approach specifically designed to\ntackle the issue of sperm overlap. This method employs a cascade application of\nSAM to segment sperm heads, simple tails, and complex tails in stages.\nSubsequently, these segmented masks are meticulously matched and joined to\nconstruct complete sperm masks. In collaboration with leading medical\ninstitutions, we have compiled a dataset comprising approximately 2,000\nunlabeled sperm images to fine-tune our method, and secured expert annotations\nfor an additional 240 images to facilitate comprehensive model assessment.\nExperimental results demonstrate superior performance of CS3 compared to\nexisting methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
