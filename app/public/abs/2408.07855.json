Traditionally formulated using\ncomplementarity models, multi-contact dynamics introduces combinatorial\ncomplexity and non-smoothness, complicating contact-rich planning and control.\nIn this paper, we circumvent these challenges by introducing a novel,\nsimplified multi-contact model. Our new model, derived from the duality of\noptimization-based contact models, dispenses with the complementarity\nconstructs entirely, providing computational advantages such as explicit time\nstepping, differentiability, automatic satisfaction of Coulomb friction law,\nand minimal hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate the effectiveness and\nefficiency of the model for planning and control in a range of challenging\ndexterous manipulation tasks, including fingertip 3D in-air manipulation,\nTriFinger in-hand manipulation, and Allegro hand on-palm reorientation, all\nwith diverse objects. Our method consistently achieves state-of-the-art\nresults: (I) a 96.5% average success rate across tasks, (II) high manipulation\naccuracy with an average reorientation error of 11{\\deg} and position error of\n7.8 mm, and (III) model predictive control running at 50-100 Hz for all tested\ndexterous manipulation tasks. These results are achieved with minimal\nhyperparameter tuning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
