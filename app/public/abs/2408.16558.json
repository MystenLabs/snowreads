Phenomena studied in cavity QED can also be explored using\nsuperconducting artificial atoms and microwave photons in superconducting\nresonators. These circuit QED systems offer the possibility to reach the\nultrastrong coupling regime with individual artificial atoms, unlike their\nnatural counterparts. In this regime, the light-matter coupling rate reaches a\nconsiderable fraction of the bare resonance frequencies in the system. Here, we\nprovide a careful analysis of the emission spectra in circuit QED systems\nconsisting of a flux qubit interacting with an LC resonator. Despite these\nsystems can be described by the quantum Rabi model, as the corresponding cavity\nQED ones, we find distinctive features, depending on how the system is coupled\nwith the output port, which become evident in the ultrastrong coupling regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DqdRM-6o2jTDvxop1L-pqoWlePSKpvV8GqU0dL005Os","pdfSize":"1493676"}
