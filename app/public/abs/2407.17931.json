Denoting with $u$ the\noptimal eigenfunction and with $D$ its super-level set, corresponding to the\npositivity set of the optimal weight, we prove that, as the measure of $D$\ntends to zero, the unique maximum point of $u$, $P\\in \\partial \\Omega$, tends\nto a point of maximal mean curvature of $\\partial \\Omega$. Furthermore, we show\nthat $D$ is the intersection with $\\Omega$ of a $C^{1,1}$ nearly spherical set,\nand we provide a quantitative estimate of the spherical asymmetry, which decays\nlike a power of the measure of $D$.\n  These results provide, in the small volume regime, a fully detailed answer to\nsome long-standing questions in this framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
