The TWPA is built with magnetically flux-tunable superconducting\nnonlinear asymmetric inductive elements (SNAILs) and parallel-plate capacitors.\nIt implements three-wave mixing (3WM) with resonant phase matching (RPM), a\nsmall cutoff frequency for high gain per unitcell and impedance matching\nnetworks for large bandwidth impedance matching. The device has 200 unitcells\nand a physical footprint of only 1.1 mm^2, yet demonstrates an average\nparametric gain of 19 dB over a 3 GHz bandwidth, an average effective\nsignal-to-noise ratio improvement of 10 dB and a clear speedup of qubit readout\ntime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
