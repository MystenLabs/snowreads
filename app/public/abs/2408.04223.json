As a golden testbed, Video Question Answering\n(VideoQA) plays pivotal role in Video-LLM developing. This work conducts a\ntimely and comprehensive study of Video-LLMs' behavior in VideoQA, aiming to\nelucidate their success and failure modes, and provide insights towards more\nhuman-like video understanding and question answering. Our analyses demonstrate\nthat Video-LLMs excel in VideoQA; they can correlate contextual cues and\ngenerate plausible responses to questions about varied video contents. However,\nmodels falter in handling video temporality, both in reasoning about temporal\ncontent ordering and grounding QA-relevant temporal moments. Moreover, the\nmodels behave unintuitively - they are unresponsive to adversarial video\nperturbations while being sensitive to simple variations of candidate answers\nand questions. Also, they do not necessarily generalize better. The findings\ndemonstrate Video-LLMs' QA capability in standard condition yet highlight their\nsevere deficiency in robustness and interpretability, suggesting the urgent\nneed on rationales in Video-LLM developing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"tCe7B2sV4OTOdN9FXjKh-586hWshxwh7oeUQYfWB3Yc","pdfSize":"3950313"}
