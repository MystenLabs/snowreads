Its popularity stems from the interesting properties of the\nmonolayer phase, which can serve as the fundamental block for numerous\napplications. In this paper, we propose an atomistic perspective on the\nmodulation of thermal transport properties in monolayer MoS2 through strategic\ndefect engineering, specifically the introduction of sulfur vacancies. Using a\ncombination of molecular dynamics simulations and lattice dynamics\ncalculations, we show how various distributions of sulfur vacancies -- ranging\nfrom random to periodically arranged configurations -- affect its thermal\nconductivity. Notably, we observe that certain periodic arrangements restore\nthe thermal conductivity of the pristine system, due to a minimized interaction\nbetween acoustic and optical phonons facilitated by the imposed\nsuperperiodicity. This research deepens the understanding of phononic heat\ntransport in two-dimensional materials and introduces a different point-of-view\nfor phonon engineering in nanoscale devices, offering a pathway to enhance\ndevice performance and longevity through tailored thermal management\nstrategies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BlVtzF0MUKtS0WBlJQfH9eev0VGG1Sfmvde8XEBRDLA","pdfSize":"614431"}
