In particular, it is shown that the partition splitting number is\nnot larger than the uniformity of the meagre ideal; not all sets of reals\nhaving the cardinality of an (the?) $\\varepsilon$-almost bisecting number are\nof strong measure zero; no fewer sets of strong measure zero than indicated by\nthe statistically reaping number suffice to cover the reals; the pair-splitting\nnumber is not smaller than the evasion number; and the subseries number is\nneither smaller than the pair-splitting number nor than the minimum of the\nunbounding number and the unbisecting number. Moreover I provide a diagram\nputting these results into context and give a brief historical account.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
