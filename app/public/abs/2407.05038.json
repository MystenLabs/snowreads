Consequently, it is\nessential to understand the carrier dynamics in both the cases at such high\nexcitation densities. In this work, we investigate the carrier dynamics of\nmonolayer and multilayer MoS$_2$ at photo-doping densities around Mott Density.\nIt is observed that, despite the similarity in band structure near K-point and\nformation of A-exciton, a substantial difference in the carrier dynamics is\nobserved reflecting the influence of the entire band structure. The exciton\ndissociation, bandgap renormalization, and intervalley relaxation play a\nconsequential role in dictating the ultrafast transient properties of these\nsamples. The study in this paper provide a substantial understanding of\nfundamental optoelectronic properties of the two-dimensional MoS$_2$, paving a\nway for its potential applications in various photonic and optoelectronic\ndomain.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
