Our\nsolution is a single model per track. We fine-tune Qwen2-72B-Instruct on our\nown training dataset. As the competition released only 96 example questions, we\ndeveloped our own training dataset by processing multiple public datasets or\nusing Large Language Models for data augmentation and synthetic data\ngeneration. We apply wise-ft to account for distribution shifts and ensemble\nmultiple LoRA adapters in one model. We employed Logits Processors to constrain\nthe model output on relevant tokens for the tasks. AWQ 4-bit Quantization and\nvLLM are used during inference to predict the test dataset in the time\nconstraints of 20 to 140 minutes depending on the track. Our solution achieved\nthe first place in each individual track and is the first place overall of\nAmazons KDD Cup 2024.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
