However, the evidence for water ice presented thus far is\nindirect. We aim to directly detect the spectral characteristics of water ice\nin bright deposits present in permanently shadowed regions (PSRs) in polar\ncraters on Ceres. We analyzed narrowband images of four of the largest shadowed\nbright deposits acquired by the Dawn Framing Camera to reconstruct their\nreflectance spectra, carefully considering issues such as in-field stray light\ncorrection and image compression artifacts. The sunlit portion of a polar\ndeposit known to harbor water ice has a negative (blue) spectral slope of $-58\n\\pm 12$ % $\\mu$m$^{-1}$ relative to the background in the visible wavelength\nrange. We find that the PSR bright deposits have similarly blue spectral\nslopes, consistent with a water ice composition. Based on the brightness and\nspectral properties, we argue that the ice is likely present as particles of\nhigh purity. Other components such as phyllosilicates may be mixed in with the\nice. Salts are an unlikely brightening agent given their association with\ncryovolcanic processes, of which we find no trace. Our spectral analysis\nstrengthens the case for the presence of water ice in permanently shadowed\ncraters on Ceres.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
