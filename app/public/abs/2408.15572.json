Safety verification aims to certify the satisfaction of\nthe safety property, which stipulates that the probability of the system,\nstarting from a specified initial state, remaining within a safe set is greater\nthan or equal to a specified lower bound. A sufficient and necessary\nbarrier-like condition is formulated for safety verification. In contrast,\nreach-avoid verification extends beyond safety to include reachability, seeking\nto certify the satisfaction of the reach-avoid property. It requires that the\nprobability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, reaching a\ntarget set eventually while remaining within a safe set until the first hit of\nthe target, is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. Two sufficient\nand necessary barrier-like conditions are formulated under certain assumptions.\nThese conditions are derived via relaxing Bellman equations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
