In this work,\nRydberg-atom graph gadgets are introduced to effectively program $K$-th order\ninteractions within a Rydberg atom system. This approach facilitates the\ndetermination of the ground states of an Ising-type Hamiltonian, encoded to\nsolve higher-order unconstrained optimization problems. A favorable scaling\nbehavior, $O(N^K)$, is expected in terms of the number of atoms required for\n$N$-vertex hypergraph optimization problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LcsFdFcgHd2aISYDQNo7nBJ8D4hYPAvlRkrbgjwLIQE","pdfSize":"1022961","objectId":"0xd8c4833195a7fc2a0164ededb1322faa74464ba8d87d37406f1f7c89ce874fb6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
