However, existing blockchain sharding systems generally\nsuffer from a small number of shards, resulting in limited concurrency. The\nmain reason is that existing sharding systems require large shard sizes to\nensure security. To enhance the concurrency of blockchain sharding securely, we\npropose SpiralShard. The intuition is to allow the existence of some shards\nwith a larger fraction of malicious nodes (i.e., corrupted shards), thus\nreducing shard sizes. SpiralShard can configure more and smaller shards for\nhigher concurrency at the same network size. To ensure security with the\nexistence of corrupted shards, we propose the Linked Cross-shard Endorsement\n(LCE) protocol. According to our LCE protocol, the blocks of each shard are\nsequentially verified and endorsed by a group of shards before being finalized.\nAs a result, a corrupted shard can eliminate forks with the help of the other\nshards. We implement SpiralShard based on Harmony and conduct extensive\nevaluations. Experimental results show that, compared with Harmony, SpiralShard\nachieves around 19x throughput gain under a large network size with 4,000+\nnodes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
