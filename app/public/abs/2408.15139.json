The\ncladding-free design enables low-loss optical propagation in a partially\nmetal-covered waveguide, with the same metal layer serving as an integrated\nheater for rapid phase tuning. The fabricated device exhibits an 8.5 {\\mu}s\nrise time for a {\\pi} phase shift, despite the weak thermo-optic coefficient in\nsilicon nitride. Additionally, the impact of thermal cross-talk is investigated\nand an insertion loss as low as 0.39 dB for a 100-{\\mu}m-long heater-waveguide\nsection is demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
