We then consider the system being gradually isolated from the leads,\nwhich we refer to as the transition from an open to a closed regime. As\nexpected on physical grounds, charge and in-plane components vanish, but the\nout-of-plane spin current remains finite and gives rise to the oscillatory\ninterlayer exchange coupling (IEC) between the magnets. We show that the\nout-of-plane spin current reduces to a set of peaks in momentum space, which\ncorrespond to discrete energy eigenstates of the closed system. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the expression for the IEC in terms of spin current for an\nopen system reduces to an expression in the closed system, which corresponds\nexactly to the definition of IEC in terms of energy difference.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
