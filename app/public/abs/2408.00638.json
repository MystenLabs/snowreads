The sensing mechanisms of most VBTSs can be categorised based\non the type of tactile features they capture. Each category requires specific\nstructural designs to convert physical contact into optical information. The\ncomplex architectures of VBTSs pose challenges for traditional manufacturing\ntechniques in terms of design flexibility, cost-effectiveness, and quality\nstability. Previous research has shown that monolithic manufacturing using\nmulti-material 3D printing technology can partially address these challenges.\nThis study introduces the CrystalTac family, a series of VBTSs designed with a\nunique sensing mechanism and fabricated through rapid monolithic manufacturing.\nCase studies on CrystalTac-type sensors demonstrate their effective performance\nin tasks involving tactile perception, along with impressive cost-effectiveness\nand design flexibility. The CrystalTac family aims to highlight the potential\nof monolithic manufacturing in VBTS development and inspire further research in\ntactile sensing and manipulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
