The inflow undergoes two-stage compression,\nfollowed by uniform mixing with randomly distributed n-heptane droplets before\nentering the combustor. The study examines the effects of droplet breakup\nmodels, gas-liquid ratios, and on-wedge strips on the ODW formation. Results\nindicate that under the pure-droplet condition, the ODW fails to form within\nthe combustor, irrespective of the breakup models used. However, increasing the\nproportion of n-heptane vapor in the fuel/air mixture facilitates the ODW\nformation, because the n-heptane vapor rapidly participates in the gaseous\nreactions, producing heat and accelerating the transition from low- to\nintermediate-temperature chemistry. Additionally, the presence of on-wedge\nstrips enhances ODW formation by inducing a bow shock wave within the\ncombustor, which significantly increases the temperature, directly triggering\nintermediate-temperature chemistry and subsequent heat-release reactions,\nthereby facilitating the formation of ODW.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
