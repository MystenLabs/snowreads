However, a gap always exists between the reduced-order control\nmodel with uncertainties and the real robot, which degrades its performance. To\naddress this issue, we propose the controller of integrating a data-driven\nerror model into traditional MPC for quadruped robots. Our approach leverages\nreal-world data from sensors to compensate for defects in the control model.\nSpecifically, we employ the Autoregressive Moving Average Vector (ARMAV) model\nto construct the state error model of the quadruped robot using data. The\npredicted state errors are then used to adjust the predicted future robot\nstates generated by MPC. By such an approach, our proposed controller can\nprovide more accurate inputs to the system, enabling it to achieve desired\nstates even in the presence of model parameter inaccuracies or disturbances.\nThe proposed controller exhibits the capability to partially eliminate the\ndisparity between the model and the real-world robot, thereby enhancing the\nlocomotion performance of quadruped robots. We validate our proposed method\nthrough simulations and real-world experimental trials on a large-size\nquadruped robot that involves carrying a 20 kg un-modeled payload (84% of body\nweight).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
