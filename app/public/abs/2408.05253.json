Despite widely discussed, there is no agreed definition\nabout the paradigm although there are many concepts proposed by the academy and\nindustry. This work aims to provide an analytical view of the studies conducted\nand published regarding the Big Data paradigm. The approach used is the\nsystematic map of the literature, combining bibliometric analysis and content\nanalysis to depict the panorama of research works, identifying patterns,\ntrends, and gaps. The results indicate that there is still a long way to go,\nboth in research and in concepts, such as building and defining adequate\ninfrastructures and standards, to meet future challenges and for the paradigm\nto become effective and bring the expected benefits.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8z4v92GDXK_XNKztVx7NUpveFpewCGwhLBVlIKji5zQ","pdfSize":"358633"}
