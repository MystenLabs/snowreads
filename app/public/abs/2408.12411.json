We have demonstrated that\nthe answer is no for all practical purposes if only strong nonpostselected\nmeasurements are performed. However, if weak measurements in postselected\nsystems are used, mixed states and quickly oscillating states produce different\nresults. An experimental procedure is proposed which could in principle\ndetermine the nature of mixed states stemming from blackbody radiation,\ndecoherence, thermalization in solid state materials, Unruh radiation and\nHawking radiation, among others. The analysis in this work applies to all fast\noscillations, including those at Planck scale. As such, tabletop weak\nmeasurements can be used to probe (very specific) potential high energy\nbehavior, where strong nonpostselected measurements cannot be applied. This\nwork also demonstrates that weak measurements are not equivalent to a set of\nstrong measurements without postselection since measurements which are\nimpossible for all practical purposes need to be excluded.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
