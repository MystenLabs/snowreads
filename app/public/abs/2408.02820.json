Along the way, we prove general Ext\nvanishing results over Cohen-Macaulay rings and investigate modules which have\nzero class in the reduced Grothendieck group with rational coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
