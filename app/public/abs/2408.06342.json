Despite its significance, the measurement of\ncentral charge has remained elusive thus far. In this work, we present the\nfirst experimental determination of the central charge using a universal\nquantum processor. Using a classically optimized variational quantum circuit\nand employing advanced error mitigation techniques, we successfully prepare\nground states of various $1+1D$ quantum spin chain models at their critical\npoint. Leveraging the heavy-hex structure of IBM quantum processors, we are\nable to implement periodic boundary conditions and mitigate boundary effects.\nWe then extract the central charge from the scaling behavior of the sub-leading\nterm of R{\\'{e}}nyi generalizations of classical Shannon entropy, computed for\nlocal Pauli measurements in the conformal bases ($\\sigma^{z}$ and $\\sigma^x$).\nThe experimental results are consistent with the known central charge values\nfor the transverse field Ising (TFI) chain ($c=0.5$) and the XXZ chain ($c=1$),\nachieving relative errors as low as 5 percent.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
