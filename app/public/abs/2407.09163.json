We prove that microscopic statistics for the mean diagonal\noverlap, near the edge point, are characterized by the iterative erfc\nintegrals, which only depend on the geometric multiplicity of certain\neigenvalue of $X_0$. We also investigate the microscopic statistics for the\nmean diagonal overlap of the outlier eigenvalues. Further we get a phenomenon\nof the phase transition for the mean diagonal overlap, with respect to the\nmodulus of the eigenvalues of $X_0$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
