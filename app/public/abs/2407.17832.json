Our method uses possession sequences, i.e. sequences of\nconsecutive on-ball actions, for deriving estimates for player strengths. On\nthe surface, the methodology is similar to classical adjusted plus-minus rating\nmodels using mainly regularized regression techniques. However, by analyzing\npossessions, our framework is able to distinguish on-ball and off-ball\ncontributions of players to the game. From a methodological viewpoint, the\nframework explores four different penalization schemes, which exploit\nfootball-specific structures such as the grouping of players into position\ngroups as well as into common strength groups. These four models lead to four\nways to rate players by considering the respective estimate of each model\ncorresponding to the player. The ratings are used to analyze the 2017/18 season\nof the Spanish La Liga. We compare similarities as well as particular use cases\nof each of the penalized models and provide guidance for practitioners when\nusing the individual model specifications. Finally, we conclude our analysis by\nproviding a domain-specific statistical evaluation framework, which highlights\nthe potential of the penalized regression approaches for evaluating players.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
