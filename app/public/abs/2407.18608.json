In [8] is shown that this\nsymmetric function arises from a suitable structure of combinatorial Hopf\nalgebra on digraphs. In this paper, we introduce two new combinatorial Hopf\nalgebras of posets and permutations and define corresponding Redei-Berge\nfunctions for them. By using both theories, of symmetric functions and of\ncombinatorial Hopf algebras, we prove many properties of the Redei-Berge\nfunction. These include some forms of deletion-contraction property, which make\nit similar to the chromatic symmetric function. We also find some invariants of\ndigraphs that are detected by the Redei-Berge function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"J8dD4Pe4RWBKjzASEn7wRbVMqYzhn4W683RkVrCbVmQ","pdfSize":"202498","objectId":"0x8eca11efe782c95d0f32a65ddcef1a0997752a8550796b15d825ad1b330ee5d5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
