The\ninclusion of DQs have been shown in the literature to be a key element in\nobtaining error bounds that do not degrade with the number of snapshots. More\nrecently, the inclusion of DQs has allowed to obtain pointwise (as opposed to\naveraged) error bounds that decay with the same convergence rate (in terms of\nthe POD singular values) as averaged ones. In the present paper, for POD\nmethods not including DQs in their data set, we obtain error bounds that do not\ndegrade with the number of snapshots if the function from where the snapshots\nare taken has certain degree of smoothness. Moreover, the rate of convergence\nis as close as that of methods including DQs as the smoothness of the function\nproviding the snapshots allows. We do this by obtaining discrete counterparts\nof Agmon and interpolation inequalities in Sobolev spaces. Numerical\nexperiments validating these estimates are also presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ja9Gzyg5DbSjH3BzvmtCnJzoxiqUAMXs0YMq1oB-VaY","pdfSize":"357825"}
