It\nallows people to transform information and data into exciting and interesting\nvisual narratives. Hosting a public data-art hands-on workshop enables\nparticipants to engage with data and learn fundamental visualisation\ntechniques. However, being a public event, it presents a range of challenges.\nWe outline our approach to organising and conducting a public workshop, that\ncaters to a wide age range, from children to adults. We divide the tutorial\ninto three sections, focusing on data, sketching skills and visualisation. We\nplace emphasis on public engagement, and ensure that participants have fun\nwhile learning new skills.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
