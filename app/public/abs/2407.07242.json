Our approach is based on a\nspectrally-convergent approximation of the skew-adjoint Koopman generator by a\ndiagonalizable, skew-adjoint operator $W_\\tau$ that acts on a reproducing\nkernel Hilbert space $\\mathcal H_\\tau$ with coalgebra structure and Banach\nalgebra structure under the pointwise product of functions. Leveraging this\nstructure, we lift the unitary evolution operators $e^{t W_\\tau}$ (which can be\nthought of as regularized Koopman operators) to a unitary evolution group on\nthe Fock space $F(\\mathcal H_\\tau)$ generated by $\\mathcal H_\\tau$ that acts\nmultiplicatively with respect to the tensor product. Our scheme also employs a\nrepresentation of classical observables ($L^\\infty$ functions of the state) by\nquantum observables (self-adjoint operators) acting on the Fock space, and a\nrepresentation of probability densities in $L^1$ by quantum states. Combining\nthese constructions leads to an approximation of the Koopman evolution of\nobservables that is representable as evaluation of a tree tensor network built\non a tensor product subspace $\\mathcal H_\\tau^{\\otimes n} \\subset F(\\mathcal\nH_\\tau)$ of arbitrarily high grading $n \\in \\mathbb N$. A key feature of this\nquantum-inspired approximation is that it captures information from a tensor\nproduct space of dimension $(2d+1)^n$, generated from a collection of $2d + 1$\neigenfunctions of $W_\\tau$. Furthermore, the approximation is positivity\npreserving. The paper contains a theoretical convergence analysis of the method\nand numerical applications to two dynamical systems on the 2-torus: an ergodic\ntorus rotation as an example with pure point Koopman spectrum and a Stepanoff\nflow as an example with topological weak mixing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
