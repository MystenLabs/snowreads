We also provide an upper bound which is reminiscent of\nthe bounds used for the minimum distance of matrix-product codes. When the\nconstituent codes are two Reed-Solomon codes, we obtain an explicit formula for\nthe generalized Hamming weights of the resulting matrix-product code. We also\ndeal with the non-nested case for the case of two constituent codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
