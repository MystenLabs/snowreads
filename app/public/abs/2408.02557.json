One strategy to reduce this effort involves annotating files\nwith meaningful labels that describe the functionalities contained. However,\nprior research has so far focused on classifying the whole project using README\nfiles as a proxy, resulting in little information gained for the developers.\n  Our objective is to streamline the labelling of files with the correct\napplication domains using source code as input. To achieve this, in prior work,\nwe evaluated the ability to annotate files automatically using a weak labelling\napproach.\n  This paper presents AutoFL, a tool for automatically labelling software\nrepositories from source code. AutoFL allows multi-granular annotations\nincluding: \\textit{file}, \\textit{package}, and \\textit{project} -level.\n  We provide an overview of the tool's internals, present an example analysis\nfor which AutoFL can be used, and discuss limitations and future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gm1YcTR9hcJoDhDOay8tVBQuztD8heKooCvYRCEbnjg","pdfSize":"1211703"}
