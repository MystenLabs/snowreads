Using this result, we derive Cacoullos type\nvariance bounds for the IDD. Applications to some important distributions are\ndiscussed, in addition to the computation of variance bounds for certain\nposterior distributions. As another application, we derive the Stein-type\nidentity for the IDD, which involves the L'evy measure. This result in turn is\nused to derive the Stein-type identity for the CGMY distributions and the\nvariance-gamma distributions (VGD). This approach, especially for the VGD is\nnew and simpler, compared to the ones available in the literature. Finally, as\nanother nontrivial application, we apply the covariance identity in deriving\nknown and some new formulas for the weighted premium calculation principles\n(WPCP) and Gini coefficient for the IDD.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sNJvWmrMgImpaA0HgOuKi09DlElyDCLdZaCPu3fXg4I","pdfSize":"290159"}
