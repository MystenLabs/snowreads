We numerically compute the fidelity and average\ncorrelations to monitor the state evolution and to identify revivals. The\nresults indicate that, on the one hand, the entanglement entropy of PXP scars\nexhibit great sensitivity, in the sense that their profile approaches the ones\nexpected for thermal states already for very small perturbations. On the other\nhand, other scar signatures, such as the revivals of states having large\noverlap with scars, show remarkable robustness. Additionally, we examined the\neffects of minor disturbances on initial states that previously exhibited high\noverlap with scars and consistent revivals. Our analysis revealed that\ndifferent types of disturbances can induce markedly different behaviors, such\nas partially \"freezing\" the chain, leading to sustained oscillations, or\naccelerating the process of thermalization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
