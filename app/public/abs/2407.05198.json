This dataset was then used to construct a socio-semantic network,\nmapping both their identities and key topics, which are crucial for\nunderstanding their impact on public health discourse. To achieve this, we\ndeveloped a few-shot multi-label classifier to identify influencers and their\nnetwork actors' identities, employed BERTopic for extracting thematic content,\nand integrated these components into a network model to analyze their impact on\nhealth discourse. To ensure the reproducibility of our results, we have made\nthe code available at https://github.com/ZhijinGuo/Medinfluencer.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
