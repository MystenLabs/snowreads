The\ntwo transitions of the V-type QE are effectively coupled with two independent\ncavity modes. The system exhibits a strong quantum nonlinear control in the\ntransmission even at the single-photon level, which we refer to as quantum\ncross nonlinearity. The underlying physics can be understood as quantum\ncompetition between the two transitions of the QE sharing a common ground\nstate. By leveraging this quantum cross nonlinearity, we further show\nphoton-number-resolving quantum nondestructive detection. Owing to the\nwidespread nature of this V-type configuration, our approach can be readily\nextended to diverse cavity quantum electrodynamic systems beyond the realm of\noptics, encompassing, e.g., microwave photons and acoustic wave phonons. This\nversatility may facilitate numerous unique applications for quantum information\nprocessing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bZQ4VBlg2RI5Y3lsWiK1w2kE2huc_aBrY7SsqRe9Wvk","pdfSize":"3900776"}
