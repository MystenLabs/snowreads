Many of\nthese sources have red colors and a compact appearance that has led to naming\nthem `Little Red Dots'. In this paper we develop a detailed framework to\nestimate the photometry of AGN embedded in galaxies extracted from the Obelisk\ncosmological simulation to understand the properties of color-selected Little\nRed Dots (cLRDs) in the context of the full AGN and massive black hole\npopulation. We find that using realistic spectral energy distributions (SEDs)\nand attenuation for AGN we can explain the shape of the cLRD SED as long as\ngalaxies host a sufficiently luminous AGN that is not too much or too little\nattenuated. When attenuation is too low or too high, AGN do not enter the cLRD\nselection, because the AGN dominates over the host galaxy too much in blue\nfilters, or it does not contribute to photometry anywhere, respectively. cLRDs\nare also characterized by high Eddington ratios, possibility super-Eddington,\nand/or high ratios between black hole and stellar mass.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ygr7kusRuwq15RU7ubEbv7XbmO3PhqTv9AJk0JJV27Y","pdfSize":"2430944"}
