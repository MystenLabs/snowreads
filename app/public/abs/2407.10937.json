Most existing\nmonocular depth estimation methods may not generalize well to synthesized\nimages or videos, and multi-view-based methods have difficulty controlling the\nhuman appearance and motion. In this work, we present IDOL (unIfied Dual-mOdal\nLatent diffusion) for high-quality human-centric joint video-depth generation.\nOur IDOL consists of two novel designs. First, to enable dual-modal generation\nand maximize the information exchange between video and depth generation, we\npropose a unified dual-modal U-Net, a parameter-sharing framework for joint\nvideo and depth denoising, wherein a modality label guides the denoising\ntarget, and cross-modal attention enables the mutual information flow. Second,\nto ensure a precise video-depth spatial alignment, we propose a motion\nconsistency loss that enforces consistency between the video and depth feature\nmotion fields, leading to harmonized outputs. Additionally, a cross-attention\nmap consistency loss is applied to align the cross-attention map of the video\ndenoising with that of the depth denoising, further facilitating spatial\nalignment. Extensive experiments on the TikTok and NTU120 datasets show our\nsuperior performance, significantly surpassing existing methods in terms of\nvideo FVD and depth accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dzONLR-a1dFcYNrwqVTzewtj8wkWsmOCxakgOlhCGCw","pdfSize":"3230105"}
