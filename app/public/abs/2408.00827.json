However, the\ncanonical FDM model with a mass of $10^{-22}~{\\rm eV}$ encounters challenges in\nreproducing the observed diversity of dwarf galaxies, except for possibly\nscenarios where strong galactic feedback is invoked. The introduction of\nmultiple-field FDM can provide a potential resolution to this diversity issue.\nThe theoretical plausibility of this dark matter model is also enhanced by the\nfact that multiple axion species with logarithmically-distributed mass spectrum\nexist as a generic prediction of string theory. In this paper we consider the\naxiverse hypothesis and investigate non-linear structure formation in the\ntwo-field fuzzy dark matter (2FDM) model. Our cosmological simulation with an\nunprecedented resolution and self-consistent initial conditions reveals the\ndiverse structures of dark matter haloes in the 2FDM model for the first time.\nDepending on the formation time and local tidal activities, late-time haloes\ncan host solitons of nested cores or solitons of one dominant species.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GzEonxpwHZfUYoGs2Za6X1WG78r4WEjYZMXupvRDykU","pdfSize":"4026931"}
