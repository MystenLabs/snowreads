The challenge of developing robust active learning frameworks under\ndynamic adversarial attacks is critical, as these attacks can lead to\ncatastrophic forgetting within the active learning cycle. This paper introduces\nRobust Active Learning (RoAL), a novel approach designed to address this issue\nby integrating Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) into the active learning\nprocess. Our contributions are threefold: First, we propose a new dynamic\nadversarial attack that poses significant threats to active learning\nframeworks. Second, we introduce a novel method that combines EWC with active\nlearning to mitigate catastrophic forgetting caused by dynamic adversarial\nattacks. Finally, we conduct extensive experimental evaluations to demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our approach. The results show that RoAL not only effectively\ncounters dynamic adversarial threats but also significantly reduces the impact\nof catastrophic forgetting, thereby enhancing the robustness and performance of\nactive learning systems in adversarial environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
