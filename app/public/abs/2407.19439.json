These\nbusiness and regulatory challenges are particularly significant given the broad\nreach of AI, as well as the multiple uncertainties surrounding such\ntechnologies and their future development and effects. This article identifies\ntwo promising strategies for meeting the AI challenge, focusing on the example\nof Fintech. First, dynamic regulation, in the form of regulatory sandboxes and\nother regulatory approaches that aim to provide a space for responsible\nAI-related innovation. An empirical study provides preliminary evidence to\nsuggest that jurisdictions that adopt a more proactive approach to Fintech\nregulation can attract greater investment. The second strategy relates to\nso-called innovation ecosystems. It is argued that such ecosystems are most\neffective when they afford opportunities for creative partnerships between\nwell-established corporations and AI-focused startups and that this aspect of a\nsuccessful innovation ecosystem is often overlooked in the existing discussion.\nThe article suggests that these two strategies are interconnected, in that\ngreater investment is an important element in both fostering and signaling a\nwell-functioning innovation ecosystem and that a well-functioning ecosystem\nwill, in turn, attract more funding. The resulting synergies between these\nstrategies can, therefore, provide a jurisdiction with a competitive edge in\nbecoming a regional hub for AI-related activity.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
