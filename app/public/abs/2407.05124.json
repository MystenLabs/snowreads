By passing to global sections, every naive global\n2-ring decategorifies to a multiplicative cohomology theory on global spaces,\ni.e. a naive global ring. We suggest when a naive global 2-ring deserves to be\ncalled \\emph{genuine}. As evidence, we associate to such a global 2-ring a\nfamily of equivariant cohomology theories which satisfy a version of the change\nof group axioms introduced by Ginzburg, Kapranov and Vasserot. We further show\nthat the decategorified multiplicative global cohomology theory associated to a\ngenuine global $2$-ring canonically refines to an $\\mathbb{E}_\\infty$-ring\nobject in global spectra. As we show, two interesting examples of genuine\nglobal 2-rings are given by quasi-coherent sheaves on the torsion points of an\noriented spectral elliptic curve and Lurie's theory of tempered local systems.\nIn particular, we obtain global spectra representing equivariant elliptic\ncohomology and tempered cohomology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
