The generalized Pythagorean theorem in information\ngeometry plays a central role in the construction. An algorithm for obtaining\nthe desired Markov chain is described. Integer-valued autoregressive processes\nare considered for illustration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
