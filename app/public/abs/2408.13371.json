Designing such structures and\nunderstanding how they can be combined to operate synchronously is a key to\ncreating nanoscale functional units. Notable examples recently discovered using\natomistic simulations are pyridine-furan and pyridine-pyrrole nanosprings. When\nslightly stretched in aqueous or organic solutions, these nanosprings exhibit\nbistable dynamics akin to Duffing nonlinear oscillators. Based on these\nfindings, we designed a hybrid system consisting of several pyridine furan\nnanosprings attached to a graphene plate in organic solvent and simulated the\nmolecular dynamics of the construct. Our focus is on how the nanosprings\ncoupled by a graphene plate work together, and whether such a design enables\nthe nanosprings to respond synchronously to random perturbations and weak\nexternal stimuli. Molecular dynamics simulations of this specific construct are\ncomplemented by a theoretical model of coupled bistable systems to understand\nhow the synchronization depends on coupling of bistable units.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
