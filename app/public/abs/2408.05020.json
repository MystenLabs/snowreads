This additional dimension allows for\nthe representation of 4D radar as a 3D point cloud. As a result, existing deep\nlearning methods for 3D object detection, which were initially developed for\nLiDAR data, are often applied to these radar point clouds. However, this\nneglects the special characteristics of 4D radar data, such as the extreme\nsparsity and the optimal utilization of velocity information. To address these\ngaps in the state-of-the-art, we present RadarPillars, a pillar-based object\ndetection network.\n  By decomposing radial velocity data, introducing PillarAttention for\nefficient feature extraction, and studying layer scaling to accommodate radar\nsparsity, RadarPillars significantly outperform state-of-the-art detection\nresults on the View-of-Delft dataset. Importantly, this comes at a\nsignificantly reduced parameter count, surpassing existing methods in terms of\nefficiency and enabling real-time performance on edge devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
