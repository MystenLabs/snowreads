However, when these structures are\ntreated as separate entities, existing methods exhibit inaccuracies, affecting\nthe assessment of structural performance. To address this challenge, we propose\nan enhanced electromagnetic model that enables accurate characteristic mode\nanalysis for regional structures within interconnected metal bodies. Numerical\nresults validate the accuracy of the proposed method, and an antenna design\nexample demonstrates its practical utility.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
