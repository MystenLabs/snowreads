The\nSSIE process produces unbiased state estimates and optimal input gap estimates\nto assess the confidence of the behavior model, defining the ambiguity radius\nfor DR-MPC to handle predictive distribution shifts. This systematic confidence\nevaluation leads to producing safe inputs with an adequate level of\nconservatism. Our algorithm demonstrated a reduced collision rate in autonomous\ndriving simulations through improved state estimation, with a 54% shorter\naverage computation time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r3-aa7uARpYk5dEpdSM45TLBhIg9hdk__HKyf3j7DEA","pdfSize":"668866"}
