Specifically, given a sample from each of\ntwo distributions, I propose statistical inference methods to learn about the\nset of utility functions for which the first distribution has higher expected\nutility than the second distribution. With high probability, an \"inner\"\nconfidence set is contained within this true set, while an \"outer\" confidence\nset contains the true set. Such confidence sets can be formed by inverting a\nproposed multiple testing procedure that controls the familywise error rate.\nTheoretical justification comes from empirical process results, given that very\nlarge classes of utility functions are generally Donsker (subject to finite\nmoments). The theory additionally justifies a uniform (over utility functions)\nconfidence band of expected utility differences, as well as tests with a\nutility-based \"restricted stochastic dominance\" as either the null or\nalternative hypothesis. Simulated and empirical examples illustrate the\nmethodology.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
