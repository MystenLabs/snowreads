The first hypothesis is that the Yukawa coupling between Higgs\nfield and charged leptons is the weak interaction, the Higgs field is a scalar\nintermediate boson which changes the chirality of charged leptons in the weak\ninteraction. The other hypothesis is that the flavor eigenstates of charged\nleptons are the superposition states of left-handed and right-handed elementary\nWeyl spinors before the electroweak symmetry breaking. According to this model,\nthe Yukawa coupling constants between Higgs field and three generations of\ncharged leptons are considered to be a universal constant, and the difference\nof the masses of different charged leptons is due to the different left-right\nmixing angles of their flavor eigenstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
