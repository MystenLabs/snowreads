This generalises previous results in the\nsemisimple context. As an example we study regular F-manifolds with compatible\nconnection $(\\nabla,\\circ,e,E)$ associated with integrable hierarchies obtained\nfrom the solutions of the equation $d\\cdot d_L \\,a_0=0$ by applying the\nconstruction of [27]. We show that $n$-dimensional F-manifolds associated to\noperators $L$ with $r\\le n$ Jordan blocks $L_\\alpha$ of size $m_\\alpha$ are\nclassified by $n$ arbitrary functions of a single variable, where each block\n$L_\\alpha$ contributes with $m_\\alpha$ functions of the variable appearing in\nthe diagonal of the block. In the case of a single Jordan block of arbitrary\nsize we show that flat connections $\\nabla$ correspond to linear solutions\n$a_0$. This generalises part of the construction of [31] where special linear\nsolutions were considered. We illustrate the construction in dimensions $2,3,$\nand $4$ for any choice of Jordan canonical form and any choice of the\ncorresponding solution $a_0$. In these dimensions we have that linear solutions\ndefine bi-flat F-manifolds, and that the special linear solutions studied in\n[31] are related to Riemannian F-manifolds with Killing unit vector field. We\nconjecture that this is true in general.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
