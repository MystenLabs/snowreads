{"id":"2408.13188","title":"Casimir effect of a doubly Lorentz-violating scalar in magnetic field","authors":"Andrea Erdas","authorsParsed":[["Erdas","Andrea",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 16:14:03 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-26","timestamp":1724429643000,"abstract":"  In this work I study the Casimir effect caused by a charged and massive\nscalar field that violates Lorentz symmetry in an aether-like and CPT even\nmanner, by direct coupling between the field derivatives and two fixed\northogonal unit vectors. I call this a \"double\" Lorentz violation. The field\nwill satisfy either Dirichlet or mixed boundary conditions on a pair of plane\nparallel plates. I use the generalized zeta function technique to examine the\neffect of a uniform magnetic field, perpendicular to the plates, on the Casimir\nenergy and pressure. Three different pairs of mutual directions of the unit\nvectors are possible: timelike and spacelike perpendicular to the magnetic\nfield, timelike and spacelike parallel to the magnetic field, spacelike\nperpendicular and spacelike parallel to the magnetic field. I fully examine all\nof them for both types of boundary conditions listed above and, in all cases\nand for both types of boundary conditions, I obtain simple expressions of the\nzeta function, Casimir energy and pressure in the three asymptotic limits of\nstrong magnetic field, large mass, and small plate distance.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
