However,\nits potential is constrained by the \"Blockchain Trilemma,\" which necessitates\nbalancing decentralization, security, and scalability. This study evaluates and\ncompares two leading proof-of-stake (PoS) systems, Algorand and Ethereum 2.0,\nagainst these critical metrics. Our research interprets existing indices to\nmeasure decentralization, evaluates scalability through transactional data, and\nassesses security by identifying potential vulnerabilities. Utilizing\nreal-world data, we analyze each platform's strategies in a structured manner\nto understand their effectiveness in addressing trilemma challenges. The\nfindings highlight each platform's strengths and propose general methodologies\nfor evaluating key blockchain characteristics applicable to other systems. This\nresearch advances the understanding of blockchain technologies and their\nimplications for the future digital economy. Data and code are available on\nGitHub as open source.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Economics","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
