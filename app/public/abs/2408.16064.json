If $G$ is\ntransitive, then a theorem of Jordan states that $G$ has a derangement.\nEquivalently, a finite group is never the union of conjugates of a proper\nsubgroup. If $G$ is intransitive, then $G$ may fail to have a derangement, and\nthis can happen even if $G$ has only two orbits, both of which have size\n$(1/2+o(1))n$. However, we conjecture that if $G$ has two orbits of size\nexactly $n/2$ then $G$ does have a derangement, and we prove this conjecture\nwhen $G$ acts primitively on at least one of the orbits. Equivalently, we\nconjecture that a finite group is never the union of conjugates of two proper\nsubgroups of the same order, and we prove this conjecture when at least one of\nthe subgroups is maximal. The same conjecture was implicitly made by Feldman.\nWe prove other cases of the conjecture, and we highlight connections our\nresults have with intersecting families of permutations and roots of\npolynomials modulo primes. Along the way, we also prove a linear variant on\nIsbell's conjecture regarding derangements of prime-power order.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
