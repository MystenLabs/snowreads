In this study, we derive a\nconvection--diffusion equation in terms of the PDF of the interfacial gap based\non stochastic process theory, as well as the initial and boundary conditions. A\nfinite difference method is developed to numerically solve the partial\ndifferential equation. The predicted PDF of the interfacial gap agrees well\nwith that by Green's Function Molecular Dynamics (GFMD) and other variants of\nPersson's theory of contact at high load ranges. At low load ranges, the\nobvious deviation between the present work and GFMD is attributed to the\noverestimated mean interfacial gap and oversimplified magnification-dependent\ndiffusion coefficient used in the present model. As one of its direct\napplication, we show that the present work can effectively solve the adhesive\ncontact problem under the DMT limit. The current study provides an alternative\nmethodology for determining the PDF of the interfacial gap and a unified\nframework for solving the complementary problem of random contact pressure and\nrandom interfacial gap based on stochastic process theory.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
