We tackle the problem in three\ndifferent cases. Assuming intervening once, we determine the optimal time to\ninstall and the optimal capacity expansions under uncertainty. By assuming the\npossibility of two or multiple interventions, we find that the optimal strategy\nis to intervene only once. We also prove that there are instances where\ncapacity expansions should be delayed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
