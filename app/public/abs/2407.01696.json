Electroweak-charged dark matter\nhas a colored $SO(10)$ partner, whose mass should be much above the dark matter\nmass to avoid cosmological problems arising from the decay of the colored\npartner. The mass hierarchy can be naturally achieved by an $SO(10)\\times CP$\nsymmetry breaking Higgs that has a missing vacuum expectation value. The mass\nhierarchy, via quantum corrections to the gauge coupling constants, lowers the\nunification scale and enhances the proton decay rate. Hyper-Kamiokande will\nprobe the parameter space with precise gauge coupling unification. We derive\nthe range of the top quark mass and the strong coupling constant preferred by\nradiative Parity breaking by the Higgs Parity mechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
