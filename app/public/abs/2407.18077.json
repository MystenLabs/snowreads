First, we show that wFLSAs can always be reformulated as a Generalized\nLASSO problem. With the availability of algorithms tailored to the Generalized\nLASSO, the issue appears to be, in principle, resolved. However, the\ncomputational complexity of these algorithms is high, with a time complexity of\n$O(p^4)$ for a single iteration, where $p$ represents the number of\ncoefficients. To overcome this limitation, we propose an ADMM algorithm\nspecifically tailored for wFLSA-equivalent problems, significantly reducing the\ncomplexity to $O(p^2)$. Our algorithm is publicly accessible through the R\npackage wflsa.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
