The transmitted message is split\ninto a common and a secure message, both of which must be reliably recovered at\nthe legitimate receiver, while the secure message needs to be kept secret from\nthe eavesdropper. The transmitter actions, such as beamforming vector design,\naffect the corresponding state at each channel use. The action sequence is\nmodeled to depend on both the transmitted message and channel output feedback.\nFor perfect channel output feedback, the secrecy-distortion regions are\nprovided for physically-degraded and reversely-physically-degraded secure ISAC\nchannels with transmitter actions. The corresponding rate regions when the\nentire message should be kept secret are also provided. The results are\nillustrated through characterizing the secrecy-distortion region of a binary\nexample.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
