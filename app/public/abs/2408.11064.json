Prompt\nand accurate segmentation is crucial for effective treatment. However,\ncontemporary methods need an exhaustive model that is qualified for both\nclassification and segmentation, especially lightweight ones. In this work, we\ntackle this issue by presenting a new architecture that incorporates U-Net,\nwhich is optimized for both wound classification and effective segmentation. We\ncurated four extensive and diverse collections of wound images, utilizing the\npublicly available Medetec Dataset, and supplemented with additional data\nsourced from the Internet. Our model performed exceptionally well, with an F1\nscore of 0.929, a Dice score of 0.931 in segmentation, and an accuracy of 0.915\nin classification, proving its effectiveness in both classification and\nsegmentation work. This accomplishment highlights the potential of our approach\nto automating wound care management.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
