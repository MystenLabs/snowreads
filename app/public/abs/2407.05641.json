By introducing per-path\ndelay and Doppler compensations, followed by path-based beamforming, it is\npossible to reshape the channel features with significantly reduced channel\ndelay and Doppler spreads. This offers new degrees-of-freedom for waveform\ndesigns such as orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS), since the reshaped\nchannel can significantly relax the constraints on OTFS parameter selection and\nreduce the complexity of signal detection at the receiver. Therefore, in this\npaper, by combing DDAM with OTFS, we propose a novel technique termed\nDDAM-OTFS. Two implementation schemes are introduced for DDAM-OTFS, namely\npath-based alignment and bin-based alignment. Simulation results are provided\nto demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed DDAM-OTFS in terms of\nspectral efficiency (SE) and peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) compared to the\nconventional OTFS.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YGOD7l4TI1DGNKm4whTOo-HbkrfCu0VDZBz0jtxHiz4","pdfSize":"496863"}
