The Bit Slicing Multiplier utilizes Look-Up Tables (LUTs) to execute\nbitwise operations in parallel, offering efficient arithmetic operations\nideally suited for digital signal processing tasks. We extensively investigate\nthe integration of BSM into FFT and linear convolution algorithms, emphasizing\nits advantages in terms of speed and resource utilization. Additionally, we\nintroduce our own innovative ideas for FFT and convolution algorithms,\ncontributing to the broader discourse on efficient signal processing\ntechniques. Experimental validation of our implementations is conducted using\nVivado, a leading FPGA synthesis and implementation tool. Comparative analysis\ndemonstrates the superior performance of our BSM-enhanced approaches,\nshowcasing their potential for real-time signal processing applications. This\nstudy not only advances the understanding of FFT and convolution\nimplementations but also highlights the effectiveness of novel techniques like\nBSM in enhancing computational efficiency in FPGA-based systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
