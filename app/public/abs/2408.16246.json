However, traditional approximate techniques often significantly\ntrade off accuracy for power efficiency, and fail to reduce data transfer\nbetween main memory and CiM banks, which dominates power consumption. This\npaper introduces a novel probabilistic approximate computation (PAC) method\nthat leverages statistical techniques to approximate multiply-and-accumulation\n(MAC) operations, reducing approximation error by 4X compared to existing\napproaches. PAC enables efficient sparsity-based computation in CiM systems by\nsimplifying complex MAC vector computations into scalar calculations. Moreover,\nPAC enables sparsity encoding and eliminates the LSB activations transmission,\nsignificantly reducing data reads and writes. This sets PAC apart from\ntraditional approximate computing techniques, minimizing not only computation\npower but also memory accesses by 50%, thereby boosting system-level\nefficiency. We developed PACiM, a sparsity-centric architecture that fully\nexploits sparsity to reduce bit-serial cycles by 81% and achieves a peak 8b/8b\nefficiency of 14.63 TOPS/W in 65 nm CMOS while maintaining high accuracy of\n93.85/72.36/66.02% on CIFAR-10/CIFAR-100/ImageNet benchmarks using a ResNet-18\nmodel, demonstrating the effectiveness of our PAC methodology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
