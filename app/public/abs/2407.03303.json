Our focus in this work is to solve the Poisson\nequation in the presence of re entrant corners at the vertices of domain where\nsome of the interior angles are greater than 180 degrees. When the domain\nfeatures a re entrant corner, the numerical solution can display singular\nbehavior near the corners. To address this, we propose a graded mesh algorithm\nthat helps us to tackle the solution near singular points. We derive H1 and L2\nerror estimate results, and we use MATLAB to present numerical results that\nvalidate our theoretical findings. By exploring these concepts, we hope to\nprovide new insights into the Poisson problem and inspire future research into\nthe application of numerical methods to solve complex physical scenarios\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
