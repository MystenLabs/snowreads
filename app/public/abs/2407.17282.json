The invariant mass of the\n$\\tau$-lepton pair is chosen close to $Z$-boson mass, in these conditions\n$Z$-boson exchange gives the dominant contribution to the Drell-Yan mechanism.\nThe interaction of $Z$ boson with $\\tau$ lepton, in addition to the Standard\nModel couplings, can include weak anomalous magnetic and electric dipole\nmoments (or form-factors) of the $\\tau$ lepton. Dependence of elements of the\n$pp$ spin-correlation matrix on the weak anomalous moments is determined for\nvarious regions of the rapidity of the $\\tau$-lepton pair. Based on this\ncalculation, we construct a semi-realistic observable built on the momenta of\npions in the $\\tau^\\mp \\to \\pi^\\mp \\nu_\\tau$ and $\\tau^\\pm \\to \\rho^\\pm\n\\nu_\\tau \\to \\pi^\\pm \\pi^0 \\nu_\\tau$ decay channels, and show that this\nobservable can be sensitive to the weak anomalous dipole moments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
