For the latter, field strengths are estimated to be\ncomparable to strong interaction scales. This fact has motivated many studies\nof QCD physics in large magnetic fields, ranging from various model studies to\nlattice QCD computations. We provide a selective overview of results stemming\nfrom chiral perturbation theory. These results are based solely on the pattern\nof spontaneous and explicit symmetry breaking of QCD in a magnetic field;\naccordingly, they constitute low-energy theorems that must be satisfied in any\napproach. A few discrepancies with models and tension with lattice data are\nhighlighted.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
