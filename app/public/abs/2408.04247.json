We use the\nRiemann-Siegel formula for the error term in the approximate functional\nequation and take the products of all the terms into account. We also show\nthat, as a function of imaginary shifts on the critical line, the the second\nmoment behaves like a Fourier-Cauchy type kernel on a class of functions. This\nis reminiscent of orthogonal functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
