The proposed theoretical model is based on\nthe Ricci scalar's non-linear contribution. We use a distinct parameterization\nfor the deceleration parameter and constrain the model parameters by using\nvarious observational data. To determine the best-fit model for the\ncosmological parameters, we use different observational datasets such as the\nHubble Space Telescope, the Pantheon Supernova Survey, the Gold dataset, the\nGamma-Ray Burst (GRB), and the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). Furthermore,\nwe study the late-time cosmic evolution of the Universe in detail and examine\nthe implications of the constraint values on cosmological parameters.\nAdditionally, we conduct a thorough comparison with the standard cosmological\nmodel $ \\Lambda $CDM and other standard models obtained by Odintsov et al.\n\\cite{Odintsov:2023cli, Odintsov:2024lid} to examine the validity of our\nproposed model in the low-redshift regimes. Finally, we find that the proposed\nmodel encapsulates an intriguing transition from early deceleration at high\nredshift to acceleration at low redshift, a quintessence dark energy scenario,\nand convergence towards the well-established $ \\Lambda $CDM model in late-time\nUniverse's evolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
