In our model, the effects of the PKT on lunar\nevolution are considered by initially imposing a region of localized\nradioactive enrichment. The calculated volcanism has two peaks induced by\ndifferent mechanisms. The first peak occurs at 3.5-4 Gyr ago when magma\ngenerated in the deep mantle by internal heating ascends to the surface as\npartially molten plumes. The basaltic blocks in the uppermost mantle formed by\nthis magmatism, then, sink to the deep mantle, triggering further plumes that\ncause the resurgence of volcanism at $\\sim$2 Gyr ago. Our model shows that\nlocalized radioactive enrichment is important for the long-lasting volcanism\nwith a couple of peaks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
