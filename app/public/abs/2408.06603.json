Current approaches usually embed factual knowledge\ninto continuous vector space and apply geometric operations to learn potential\npatterns in temporal knowledge graphs. However, these methods only adopt a\nsingle operation, which may have limitations in capturing the complex temporal\ndynamics present in temporal knowledge graphs. Therefore, we propose a simple\nbut effective method, i.e. TCompoundE, which is specially designed with two\ngeometric operations, including time-specific and relation-specific operations.\nWe provide mathematical proofs to demonstrate the ability of TCompoundE to\nencode various relation patterns. Experimental results show that our proposed\nmodel significantly outperforms existing temporal knowledge graph embedding\nmodels.
