By\nallowing liquid-filled containers to be tilted at higher angles and enabling\nmotion along all axes of end-effector orientation, our work extends the\nreachable space and enhances maneuverability around obstacles, broadening the\nrange of feasible scenarios. Our key contributions include: i) generating\nspill-free paths through the use of RRT* with an informed sampler that\nleverages container properties to avoid spill-inducing states (such as an\nupside-down container), ii) parameterizing the resulting path to generate\nspill-free trajectories through the implementation of a time parameterization\nalgorithm, coupled with a transformer-based machine-learning model capable of\nclassifying trajectories as spill-free or not. We validate our approach in\nreal-world, obstacle-rich task settings using containers of various shapes and\nfill levels and demonstrate an extended solution space that is at least 3x\nlarger than an existing approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ouBtleb-24t5OTzE0wo_6p9x9pFtINKCE8w9qoSPJNQ","pdfSize":"3672832","txDigest":"FLPk7TEskb8iWhV5j7DBCWnf8L9Y4o7zZ9zevAZG9geK","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
