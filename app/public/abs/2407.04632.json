This\nresult also applies to the partial minimization problems for many interesting\nsubclasses of branching programs, such as read-k branching programs and OBDDs.\n  Combining these results with the recent unconditional lower bounds for MCSP\n[Glinskih, Riazanov'22], we obtain an unconditional superpolynomial lower bound\non the size of Read-Once Nondeterministic Branching Programs (1-NBP) computing\nthe total versions of the minimum BP, read-k-BP, and OBDD size problems.\n  Additionally we show that it is NP-hard to check whether a given BP computing\na partial Boolean function can be compressed to a BP of a given size.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
