The model,\nbuilt using the InceptionV3 architecture and optimized through transfer\nlearning, was trained using ECG data obtained from the Ch. Pervaiz Elahi\nInstitute of Cardiology in Pakistan. The dataset includes ECG images\nrepresenting four different cardiac conditions: myocardial infarction, abnormal\nheartbeat, history of myocardial infarction, and normal heart activity. The\ndeveloped model successfully detects MI and other cardiovascular conditions\nwith an accuracy of 93.27%. This study demonstrates that deep learning-based\nmodels can provide significant support to clinicians in the early detection and\nprevention of heart attacks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
