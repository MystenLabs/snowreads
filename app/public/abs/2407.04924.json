We\nconsider the fragment of Datalog where we impose all of these restrictions\nsimultaneously, i.e., we study \\emph{symmetric linear arc monadic (slam)\nDatalog}. We characterise the CSPs that can be solved by a slam Datalog program\nas those that have a gadget reduction to a particular Boolean constraint\nsatisfaction problem. We also present exact characterisations in terms of a\nhomomorphism duality (which we call \\emph{unfolded caterpillar duality}), and\nin universal-algebraic terms (using known minor conditions, namely the\nexistence of quasi Maltsev operations and $k$-absorptive operations of arity\n$nk$}, for all $n,k \\geq 1$). Our characterisations also imply that the\nquestion whether a given finite-domain CSP can be expressed by a slam Datalog\nprogram is decidable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
