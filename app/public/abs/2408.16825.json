We compute several two-point correlation\nfunctions in position space valid along the whole RG flow. This is done by\nusing conformal perturbation theory together with the solution of the\nCallan-Symanzik equation. From the explicit expressions of the two-point\nfunctions of conserved currents and the stress-tensor we extract the change in\nthe central charges between the UV and IR fixed points. This immediately gives\nus $\\Delta c$, the change of the $c-$trace anomaly between the UV and IR fixed\npoints in 4d. We also discuss three-point functions.\n  We couple weakly relevant flows to non-dynamical dilaton and graviton\nbackground fields in 4d. We compute the three-dilaton vertex in terms of the\nscalar two-point function and extract the value of $\\Delta a$, the change of\nthe $a$-trace anomaly between the UV and IR fixed points. We also compute the\ngraviton-graviton-dilaton vertex in terms of the three-point function of two\nstress-tensors and a scalar, and extract the value of $\\Delta c$.\n  The $\\Delta c$ values obtained with the two different methods agree.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WJZ8v1mRvjUtgwQ3A6H0oWwbkN_sfNqDlQeTu0oofFA","pdfSize":"884416"}
