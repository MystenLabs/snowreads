Anytime MAPF solvers based on large neighborhood\nsearch (LNS) have gained prominence recently due to their flexibility and\nscalability. Neighborhood selection strategy is crucial to the success of\nMAPF-LNS and a flurry of methods have been proposed. However, several pitfalls\nexist and hinder a comprehensive evaluation of these new methods, which mainly\ninclude: 1) Lower than actual or incorrect baseline performance; 2) Lack of a\nunified evaluation setting and criterion; 3) Lack of a codebase or executable\nmodel for supervised learning methods. To overcome these challenges, we conduct\na fair comparison across prominent methods on the same benchmark and\nhyperparameter search settings. Additionally, we propose a simple neighborhood\nselection strategy which marks a clear advancement in terms of runtime\nefficiency in large maps with large number of agents. Our benchmarking\nevaluation promotes new challenges for existing learning based methods and\npresents opportunities for future research when machine learning is integrated\nwith MAPF-LNS.
