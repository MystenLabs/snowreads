One benefit is\nthe use of curvature and conjugate points to study the stability of Hamiltonian\nsystems. Another benefit is that this lift unfolds a Hamiltonian system into a\nfamily of ODEs akin to a moduli space. One such family arises from the\nconformal invariance of lightlike geodesics, by which any Hamiltonian system\nunfolds into a \"conformal class\" of non-diffeomorphic ODEs with solutions in\ncommon. By utilizing higher-index versions of pp-waves, a similar lift and\nconformal class are shown to exist for certain second-order complex ODEs.\nAnother such family occurs by lifting to a Riemannian metric that is dual to a\npp-wave, a process that in certain cases yields a \"square root\" for the\nHamiltonian. We prove a two-point boundary result for the family of ODEs\narising from this lift, as well as the existence of a constant of the motion\ngeneralizing conservation of energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y9u2jh2N6Wav5kz6ALNN3bUFsYMmHMDVWhYJ-9gHbtY","pdfSize":"277391"}
