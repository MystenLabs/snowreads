Our evaluation of\nAPI-based and open-sourced LLMs shows that while some commercial LLMs exhibit\nstrong reasoning abilities, open-sourced competitors can demonstrate almost the\nsame level of quality; however, all models still have significant room for\nimprovement. We identify typical reasons for LLM failures and discuss possible\nways to deal with them. Datasets and evaluation code are released\n(https://github.com/altsoph/PLUGH).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"I_jzu-2809UBXKRJGHkQcKkxi0xh_NV1i5gfyJoPsto","pdfSize":"556824"}
