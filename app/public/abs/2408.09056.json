We demonstrate that a pair of intense few-femtosecond\ninfrared laser pulses can be used to selectively tunnel ionize along one of the\ntwo bonds. The first pulse doubly ionizes HOD, inducing rapid bond stretching\nand unbending. Femtoseconds later, the second pulse arrives and further\nionization is selectively enhanced along the OH bond. These conclusions arise\nfrom 3D time-resolved measurements of H$^+$, D$^+$, and O$^+$ momenta following\ntriple ionization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
