In particular, we consider the drift term $b=(b^1, \\ldots,\nb^d)$ in $L_d$ and the source term $f \\in L_p$ for some $p < d$. This provides\nan alternative and analytic proof of a result by N. V. Krylov (2021) concerning\n$L_d$ drifts. The key step involves deriving a Gehring type inequality for\nGreen's functions by using the Fabes-Stroock approach (1984).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
