The initial works focused on real Gaussian designs as a\ntoy model for this problem. However, in medical imaging applications, such as\ncompressive sensing for MRI, the measurement system is represented by a\n(subsampled) complex Fourier matrix. The purpose of this work is to extend the\nmethod to the MRI case in order to construct confidence intervals for each\npixel of an MR image. We show that a sufficient amount of data is $n \\gtrsim\n\\max\\{ s_0\\log^2 s_0\\log p, s_0 \\log^2 p \\}$.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
