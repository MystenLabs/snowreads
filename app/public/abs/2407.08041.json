In this scenario, at each new task, the model has\nto learn new classes from both (few) labeled and unlabeled data without access\nto exemplars from previous classes. In addition to leveraging the capabilities\nof pre-trained models, TACLE proposes a novel task-adaptive threshold, thereby\nmaximizing the utilization of the available unlabeled data as incremental\nlearning progresses. Additionally, to enhance the performance of the\nunder-represented classes within each task, we propose a class-aware weighted\ncross-entropy loss. We also exploit the unlabeled data for classifier\nalignment, which further enhances the model performance. Extensive experiments\non benchmark datasets, namely CIFAR10, CIFAR100, and ImageNet-Subset100\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed TACLE framework. We further\nshowcase its effectiveness when the unlabeled data is imbalanced and also for\nthe extreme case of one labeled example per class.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
