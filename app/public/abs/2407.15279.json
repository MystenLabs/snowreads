Now, the latest identification of polycyclic\naromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at $z=6.71$, together with these earlier\ninconsistencies, makes the time compression problem in this model quite\noverwhelming. We consider the timeline associated with the formation and growth\nof PAH grains based on current astrophysical models and argue that their\nappearance at $z=6.71$ favors the structure formation history in $R_{\\rm h}=ct$\nrather than that of Planck-$\\Lambda$CDM. We estimate the time at which they\nmust have started growing in each case, and then trace their history through\nvarious critical events, such as the end of the `dark ages,' the beginning of\nPop III star formation, and the onset of reionization. Together, these three\ndistinct discoveries by JWST, viz. high-$z$ galaxies, high-$z$ quasars and the\nsurprisingly early appearance of PAHs, all paint a fully consistent picture in\nwhich the timeline in $\\Lambda$CDM is overly compressed at $z\\gtrsim 6$, while\nstrongly supporting the expansion history in the early Universe predicted by\n$R_{\\rm h}=ct$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MpVXv_VhhJTq-i029ddZ5bVnntDD3ShZ3WrwSPgthRI","pdfSize":"331350"}
