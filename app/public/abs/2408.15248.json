This typically\ninvolves a weakness in the hand and forearm muscles, making it difficult to\nperform fine motor tasks such as writing, buttoning a shirt, or gripping\nobjects. This project presents a vision-enabled rehabilitation hand exoskeleton\nto assist disabled persons in their hand movements. The design goal was to\ncreate an accessible tool to help with a simple interface requiring no\ntraining. This prototype is built on a commercially available glove where a\ncamera and embedded processor were integrated to help open and close the hand,\nusing air pressure, thus grabbing an object. An accelerometer is also\nimplemented to detect the characteristic hand gesture to release the object\nwhen desired. This passive vision-based control differs from active EMG-based\ndesigns as it does not require individualized training. Continuing the research\nwill reduce the cost, weight, and power consumption to facilitate mass\nimplementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ltTAMmnVVAUn45ccx2N_NQjm30hDVMVkV_AtF8CNXv4","pdfSize":"2137875"}
