We propose a simple approach, the Two-Step QAOA, which aims to improve\nthe effectiveness of QAOA by decomposing problems with one-hot encoding QUBO\n(Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization) formulations. By identifying and\nseparating the problem into two stages, we transform soft constraints into hard\nconstraints, simplifying the generation of initial conditions and enabling more\nefficient optimization. The method is particularly beneficial for tackling\ncomplex societal problems that often involve intricate constraint structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Lg9ucKf7ZzABq-i2hSOOcVLn_ov2O--Zr8tApViUBlM","pdfSize":"223383"}
