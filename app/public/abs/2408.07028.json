Traditional codecs can tackle this\nproblem by performing rate-distortion optimization (RDO) to minimize the\ndistance at the output of a feature extractor. However, neural network\nnon-linearities can make the rate-distortion landscape irregular, leading to\nreconstructions with poor visual quality even for high bit rates. Moreover, RDO\ndecisions are made block-wise, while the feature extractor requires the whole\nimage to exploit global information. In this paper, we address these\nlimitations in three steps. First, we apply Taylor's expansion to the feature\nextractor, recasting the metric as an input-dependent squared error involving\nthe Jacobian matrix of the neural network. Second, we make a localization\nassumption to compute the metric block-wise. Finally, we use randomized\ndimensionality reduction techniques to approximate the Jacobian. The resulting\nexpression is monotonic with the rate and can be evaluated in the transform\ndomain. Simulations with AVC show that our approach provides bit-rate savings\nwhile preserving accuracy in downstream tasks with less complexity than using\nthe feature distance directly.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
