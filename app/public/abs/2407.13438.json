In such betting pools, participants select\nwinners of games, and their respective score is a weighted sum of the number of\ncorrect selections. Most betting pools have a top-heavy payoff structure, so\nthe paper focuses on strategies that maximize the expected score of the\nbest-performing entry. There is no known closed-formula expression for the\nestimation of this metric, so the paper investigates the challenges associated\nwith the estimation and the optimization of multi-entry solutions. We present\nan exact dynamic programming approach for calculating the maximum expected\nscore of any given fixed solution, which is exponential in the number of\nentries. We explore the structural properties of the problem to develop several\nsolution techniques. In particular, by extracting insights from the solutions\nproduced by one of our algorithms, we design a simple yet effective\nproblem-specific heuristic that was the best-performing technique in our\nexperiments, which were based on real-world data extracted from recent March\nMadness tournaments. In particular, our results show that the best 100-entry\nsolution identified by our heuristic had a 2.2% likelihood of winning a $1\nmillion prize in a real-world betting pool.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
