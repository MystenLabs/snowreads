We\nemploy single-photon counting apparatus to monitor the D1 fluorescence, with an\netalon filter to provide high spectral resolution. By studying the D1\nfluorescence when the D2 excitation laser is scanned, we see that during the\ncollisional transfer process the $m_{J}$ quantum number of the atom changes,\nbut the nuclear spin projection quantum number, $m_{I}$, is conserved. A simple\nkinematic model incorporating a coefficient of restitution in the collision\naccounted for the change in velocity distribution of atoms undergoing\ncollisions, and the resulting fluorescence lineshape. The experiment is\nconducted with a nominally ``buffer-gas free\" vapour cell; our results show\nthat fine structure changing collisions are important with such media, and\npoint out possible implications for quantum-optics experiments in thermal\nvapours producing entangled photon pairs with the double ladder configuration,\nand solar physics magneto-optical filters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
