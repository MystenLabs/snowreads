Originally\nintroduced by Bastide et al. (WG 2023) for triples ($k=3$), this problem\nreceived comprehensive attention in their work, alongside a study by Qi, who\nprovided a complete characterization of graphs uniquely reconstructible via\ntheir connected triples, i.e. no other graphs share the same set of connected\ntriples. Our contribution consists in output-polynomial time algorithms that\nenumerate every triangle-free graph (resp. every graph with bounded maximum\ndegree) that is consistent with a specified set of connected $k$-sets. Notably,\nwe prove that triangle-free graphs are uniquely reconstructible, while graphs\nwith bounded maximum degree that are consistent with the same $k$-sets share a\nsubstantial common structure, differing only locally. We suspect that the\nproblem is NP-hard in general and provide a NP-hardness proof for a variant\nwhere the connectivity is specified for only some $k$-sets (with $k$ at least\n4).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H2RXhWGyFdIxFreA363Ml5gEXa2uRUCT2BoEHlrlD3U","pdfSize":"277618"}
