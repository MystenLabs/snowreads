A\nhealthy lifestyle often varies from individual to individual and cannot be\ndefined in a top-down manner. For example, while moderate exercise is important\nfor almost everyone, how much exercise is needed and at what time of day varies\nfrom person to person. A habit that is easy for one person may be very\ndifficult for another. Habits that are too difficult do not lead to a mentally\nhealthy lifestyle.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
