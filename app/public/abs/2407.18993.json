We find that if the rotation\nrate of the spacetime is made spatially dependent, in certain cases there exist\nsimple approximate timelike geodesics that are also CTCs, provided that the\nvelocity of the warp bubble varies slowly. The second modification is\nessentially the original Alcubierre metric [ 2 ] with a periodic boundary,\nresulting in a cylindrical spacetime which can also be related to the rotating\nAlcubierre metric. Furthermore, this spacetime contains simple exact timelike\ngeodesics that are also CTCs. In both modifications, the CTC geodesics that we\nhave found allow for a simple model of a particle interacting with a CTC for a\nfinite proper time interval, entering and exiting in chronology-respecting\nspace. Given the simplicity of both of these exotic spacetimes, despite their\nquestionable physical realisability, we suggest that they may be useful in\nstudies of quantum fields near CTCs.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
