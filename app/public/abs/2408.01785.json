We initiate a study of the new\ntheory of convex geometry and polytopes associated to polyptych lattices. In\ncertain situations, such a polytope associated to a polyptych lattice encodes a\ncompactification of an affine variety whose coordinate ring can be equipped\nwith a valuation into a certain semialgebra associated to the polyptych\nlattice. We show that aspects of the geometry of the compactification can be\nunderstood combinatorially; for instance, under some hypotheses, the resulting\ncompactifications are arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, and have finitely\ngenerated class group and finitely generated Cox rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
