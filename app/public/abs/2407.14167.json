We identify two\ndistinct mechanisms due electron-electron interactions, namely inelastic\nscattering and screening, to locally affect the internal temperature and\npotential of the device, leading to thermal and thermoelectric rectification\neffects in the presence of an inversion symmetry breaking. We propose resonant\ntunneling samples to efficiently exploit these effects, and find configurations\nacting as bipolar thermoelectric diodes whose current flows in the same\ndirection irrespective of the sign of the temperature difference, either due to\nthermalization or to screening controlled quantum interference.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
