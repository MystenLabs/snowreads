Our theory elucidates the nature of acoustic\nforces and incorporates the effects of interfacial tension, enabling\npredictions of droplet migration, deformation, and splitting under suitable\nconditions. Importantly, we demonstrate droplet deformation and splitting\nthrough bulk acoustic wave (BAW) silicon-glass microscale experiments, which\nvalidate the proposed theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fflSQALdBoXH7qG6zwRQWma-Qq4pksxF6zta0vFJhf4","pdfSize":"1199093"}
