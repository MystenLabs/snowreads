In each iteration of\nthe recurrence, all involved processes can be fully parallelized with tensor\noperations. And the number of iterations is quite small. Based on these\nbenefits, the resulting algorithm fully leverages the power of parallelization\nand GPU, and therefore is extremely efficient on large and densely connected\nconstraint networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
