Recently proposed\nclosure invariants give us a powerful method for extracting information from\nmeasured visibilities which are corrupted by antenna and polarisation dependent\ngains. In this paper, a formalism developed earlier for complete graphs (where\nall visibilities are available) is extended to incomplete graphs. The formalism\nprovides a complete and independent set of closure invariants from the measured\nvisibilities in a general situation where not all visibilities are available.\nWe then show in a simulated, quasi-realistic case that the invariants developed\nhere contain usable information even in the presence of noise.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rADc1Dvp74Vtaw5O2dla1QZJ4aZTXUIxrSZwn7Z7VRU","pdfSize":"2637635","objectId":"0xaec4c6051aa60583b0c507e7d5beee71983a930ec315101831195ec3d28adae9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
