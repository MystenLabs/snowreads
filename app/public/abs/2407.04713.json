The solver is\nbased on a hybrid optoelectronic scheme including a photonic chip and the\ncorresponding electronic driving circuit. The photonic chip is fabricated on\nsilicon on insulator (SOI) substrate and integrates high-speed electro-optic\nmodulators, thermo-optic phase shifters and photodetectors to conduct the\n16-dimensional optical vector-matrix multiplication (OVMM). Due to the parallel\nand low latency propagation of lightwave, the calculation of the QUBO cost\nfunction can be accelerated. Besides, the electronic processor is employed to\nrun the heuristic algorithm to search the optimal solution. In the experiment,\ntwo 16-dimensional randomly generated QUBO problems are solved with high\nsuccessful probabilities. To our knowledge, it is the largest scale of\nprogrammable and on-chip photonic solver ever reported. Moreover, the computing\nspeed of the OVMM on photonic chip is ~2 TFLOP/s. It shows the potential of\nfast solving such optimization problems with integrated photonic systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
