While helicity is conserved in time, chirality is not constant under\ntime evolution for massive particles, yielding the phenomenon of chiral\noscillations. So far, chiral oscillations have been mainly described in the\nframework of single particle relativistic quantum mechanics. In this paper, we\npresent a quantum field theory approach to chiral oscillations in analogy with\nthe one used to describe flavor mixing and oscillations. By taking the\nexpectation value of chiral charges, we obtain the same chiral oscillation\nformula derived via standard relativistic quantum mechanics. We find that\nchiral charges are diagonalized by a Bogoliubov transformation: this implies\nthat the vacuum for particles with definite chirality is orthogonal to the one\nfor those with definite energy. In the case of neutrinos, our results can be\nfurther extended to include also flavor oscillations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
