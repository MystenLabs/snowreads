Implementing Neural Network classifiers can have high\nperformance but can be deemed untrustworthy as they lack transparency, which\nmakes them unreliable for taking high-stakes decisions during mission planning.\nWe address this by proposing Neural Networks with Uncertainty Quantification in\nTerrain Classification. We enable our Neural Networks with Monte Carlo Dropout,\nDropConnect, and Flipout in time series-capable architectures using only\nproprioceptive data as input. We use Bayesian Optimization with Hyperband for\nefficient hyperparameter optimization to find optimal models for trustworthy\nterrain classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
