FlowGPT, an\nemerging platform for sharing AI prompts and use cases, exemplifies this trend,\nattracting many creators who develop and share chatbots with a broader\ncommunity. Despite its growing popularity, there remains a significant gap in\nunderstanding the types and purposes of the AI tools created and shared by\ncommunity members. In this study, we delve into FlowGPT and present our\npreliminary findings on the domain, output modality, and goals of chatbots.
