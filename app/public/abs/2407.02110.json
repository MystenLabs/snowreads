MacMillan and Bartky first gave its general existence in\nthe 1930s and a particular case for its uniqueness. Still, the general case has\nyet to be solved perfectly since it was considered by Sim'{o} and Yoccoz in the\n1980s and was first mentioned by Albouy and Fu in 2008 in the formal\npublication. Using coordinates of mutual distances and Morse's critical point\ntheory, we give the (at most) uniqueness of the planar strictly convex 4-body\ncentral configuration when the angle of one pair of the opposite sides is\ngiven.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
