This approach is demonstrated on ICF-like double shell\nhydrodynamic simulations. The key component of this network is a transformer\nencoder that acts on a sequence of features extracted from noisy radiographs.\nThis encoder includes numerous self-attention layers that act to learn temporal\ndependencies in the input sequences and increase the expressiveness of the\nmodel. This approach is demonstrated to exhibit an excellent ability to\naccurately recover the Richtmyer-Meshkov instability growth rates, even despite\nthe gas-metal interface being greatly obscured by radiographic noise.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uAM-J89-b-ZDg8UofNBkssflXf0ogwfxAGm-MndC7Bo","pdfSize":"5965922"}
