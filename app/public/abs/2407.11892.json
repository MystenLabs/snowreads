This dependency is particularly relevant when the\nneutrino mass matrix has a generic structure, introducing uncertainty in the\nprediction of nucleon decay branching fractions within flipped SU(5). In this\npaper, we demonstrate that this uncertainty can be parametrized using two\nparameters, which can be determined by measuring the partial lifetimes of $p\n\\to \\pi^0 e^+$, $p \\to \\pi^0 \\mu^+$, and $n \\to \\pi^0 \\bar{\\nu}$. In addition,\nwe establish upper limits on the ratios of the decay widths of these channels,\noffering a potential method to test flipped SU(5) in future nucleon decay\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
