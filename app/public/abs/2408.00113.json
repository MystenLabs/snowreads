However,\nevaluating the quality of these SAEs is difficult because we lack a\nground-truth collection of interpretable features that we expect good SAEs to\nrecover. We thus propose to measure progress in interpretable dictionary\nlearning by working in the setting of LMs trained on chess and Othello\ntranscripts. These settings carry natural collections of interpretable features\n-- for example, \"there is a knight on F3\" -- which we leverage into\n$\\textit{supervised}$ metrics for SAE quality. To guide progress in\ninterpretable dictionary learning, we introduce a new SAE training technique,\n$\\textit{p-annealing}$, which improves performance on prior unsupervised\nmetrics as well as our new metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hRcKykzsDozh3G4xnOD30ctkQ132_r4dSemIMORiT-o","pdfSize":"2247999","txDigest":"ARkpBf63aX1sbo7rASFTpN58Gj2wTWjTwdTvYgWW5j4W","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
