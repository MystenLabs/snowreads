In theory, such\ncontext-dependent behaviour can be explained by model-based reinforcement\nlearning models. However, existing models lack structure underlying\ncontext-dependent model selection and thus, a correspondence to neural activity\nand brain regions. Here, we employ interacting sequential and context-inference\nmodules to drive model-based learning as a means to better understand\nexperimental neuronal activity data, lesion studies, and clinical research. We\npropose a neural circuit implementation of the sequential module by the\nhippocampus and the context-inference module by the cortex that together enable\nflexible behaviour. Our model explains a variety of experimental findings,\nincluding impairments in model-based reasoning reported in lesion studies.\nFurthermore, our model predicts the relationship between deficits in\nmodel-based learning and sensory processing, which often co-occur in psychoses\nsuch as schizophrenia (SZ) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD).\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
