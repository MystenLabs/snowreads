We derive analytic matrix elements\nwith these Gaussians -- overlap, kinetic energy, and Coulomb potential -- to be\nused in variational calculations of those systems. We also perform a quick test\nof the derived formulae by applying them to p- and d-waves of the hydrogen\natom.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
