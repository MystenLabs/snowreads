PIP-II will be using EPICS for its control\nsystem. When in operation, it will need to interface with the existing,\nmodernized (see ACORN) legacy control system. Treating EPICS controls at\nFermilab as a green field, we have developed and deployed a software pipeline\nwhich addresses these needs and presents to developers a tested and robust\nsoftware framework, including template IOCs from which new developers can\nquickly deploy new front ends, aka IOCs. In this presentation, motivation for\nthis work, implementation of a continuous integration/continuous deployment\npipeline, testing, template IOCs, and the deployment of user\nservices/applications will be discussed. This new infrastructure of IOCs and\nservices is being developed and used in the PIP-II cryomodule teststand; our\nexperiences and lessons learned will be also be discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_1KMg2se3N6fkyX33TuVzhWq-0E74zOoxBBoTFsX9fw","pdfSize":"942817","txDigest":"D7bxRVG5S9a2evNvNxvkkTEJLQRha3k3Cthpzx4H3mjZ","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
