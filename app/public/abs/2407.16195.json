The cantilever joint is not fixed and can\nitself be moved along an axis perpendicular to the beam. The position of the\ncantilever joint is the control input to the beam. The dynamics of the beam is\ngoverned by a coupled PDE-ODE model with boundary input. On a natural\nstate-space, there exists a unique state trajectory for this beam model for\nevery initial state and each smooth control input which is compatible with the\ninitial state. In this paper, we study the motion planning problem of\ntransferring the beam from an initial state to a final state over a prescribed\ntime interval. We address this problem by extending the generating functions\napproach to flatness-based control, originally proposed in the literature for\nmotion planning of parabolic PDEs, to the beam model. We prove that such a\ntransfer is possible if the initial and final states belong to a certain set,\nwhich also contains steady-states of the beam. We illustrate our theoretical\nresults using simulations and experiments.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
