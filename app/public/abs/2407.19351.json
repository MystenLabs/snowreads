Yet, the\nvisual inspection of the contributed images is inaccessible. To this day, we\nlack mechanisms for data inspection and control that are accessible to the\nblind community. To address this gap, we engage 10 blind participants in a\nscenario where they wear smartglasses and collect image data using an\nAI-infused application in their homes. We also engineer a design probe, a novel\ndata access interface called AccessShare, and conduct a co-design study to\ndiscuss participants' needs, preferences, and ideas on consent, data\ninspection, and control. Our findings reveal the impact of interactive informed\nconsent and the complementary role of data inspection systems such as\nAccessShare in facilitating communication between data stewards and blind data\ncontributors. We discuss how key insights can guide future informed consent and\ndata control to promote inclusive and responsible data practices in AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
