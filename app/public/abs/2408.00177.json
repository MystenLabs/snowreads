One of the most common types of\ncorrelated survival data is clustered survival data, where the survival times\nfrom individuals in a cluster are associated. Our study is motivated by\ninvasive mechanical ventilation data from different intensive care units (ICUs)\nin Ontario, Canada, forming multiple clusters. The survival times from patients\nwithin the same ICU cluster are correlated. To address this association, we\nintroduce a shared frailty log-logistic accelerated failure time model that\naccounts for intra-cluster correlation through a cluster-specific random\nintercept. We present a novel, fast variational Bayes (VB) algorithm for\nparameter inference and evaluate its performance using simulation studies\nvarying the number of clusters and their sizes. We further compare the\nperformance of our proposed VB algorithm with the h-likelihood method and a\nMarkov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. The proposed algorithm delivers\nsatisfactory results and demonstrates computational efficiency over the MCMC\nalgorithm. We apply our method to the ICU ventilation data from Ontario to\ninvestigate the ICU site random effect on ventilation duration.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
