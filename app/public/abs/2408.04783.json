We find that in\nspherically symmetry Schwarzschild AdS black hole, smooth space-like geodesics\ncan connect timelike-separated points by winding around the horizon multiple\ntimes. Similar result will also happen in modified BTZ black hole which\ncontains photon ring in the bulk. According to recent holographic proposal on\ntime-like entanglement entropy, our result suggests that, if there is photon\nring/sphere in the bulk, then the time-like entanglement entropy AdS3/CFT2\nduality may not have an imaginary part and so further understanding may be\nnecessary.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
