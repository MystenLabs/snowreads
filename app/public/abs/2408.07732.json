In 1987\nJohn G. Thompson asked if in this case the solvability of one group implies the\nsolvability of the other group.\n  In 2024 Pawel Piwek gave a negative example. He constructed two groups of\norder $2^{365}\\cdot3^{105}\\cdot7^{104}\\approx7.3\\cdot10^{247}$ of the same\norder type, where only one is solvable.\n  In this note we produce a much smaller example of order\n$2^{13}\\cdot3^4\\cdot7^3=227598336$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UWCllDLiPuQbBYdFlG_Rvg46IDqnqmRD2CqlD8bjZ00","pdfSize":"75809"}
