Our findings indicate that\nfintech advancement substantially enhances the likelihood of MSEs engaging in\ninnovative endeavors and boosts both the investment and outcomes of their\ninnovation processes. The underlying mechanisms are attributed to fintech's\nrole in fostering long-term strategic incentives and investment in human\ncapital. This includes the use of promotions and stock options as rewards,\nrather than traditional perks like gifts or trips, the attraction of a greater\nnumber of university graduates, and the increase in both training expenses and\nthe remuneration of technical staff. Our heterogeneity analysis reveals that\nfintech exerts a more pronounced effect on MSEs situated in economically\ndeveloped areas, those that are five years old or younger, and businesses with\nlimited assets and workforce. Additionally, we uncover that fintech stimulates\nthe innovation of MSEs' independent research and development (R\\&D) efforts.\nThis paper contributes to the understanding of the nuanced ways in which\nfintech impacts MSE innovation and offers policy insights aimed at unleashing\nthe full potential of MSEs' innovative capabilities.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
