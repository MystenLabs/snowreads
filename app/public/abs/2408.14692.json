However, the\nanalysis of the generalized Einstein equations reveals that there are a set of\nmetrics describing two static branes even in the absence of matter fields. The\ntrapping of massive particles on branes is a consequence of the metric\nstructure, which prevents these particles from moving between branes.\n  It is shown that the communication between charged particles located on\ndifferent branes provides by photons. Such positron-electron annihilation could\nbe experimentaly study at the LHC collider.\n  The Higgs field is distributed between the branes in such a way that it can\nserve as a Higgs portal connecting two worlds located on different branes. The\nvalues of the 4D physical parameters depend on the extra metric structure near\nthe branes. A particular metric of the extra space was found to provide the\nobserved value of the Higgs vacuum average.\n  We also found a non-trivial effect of decompactification of the extra space\nwhen the Hubble parameter is varied.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
