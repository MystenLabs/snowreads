The task of taxonomy expansion involves\nintegrating emerging concepts into existing taxonomies by identifying\nappropriate parent concepts for these new query concepts. Previous approaches\ntypically relied on self-supervised methods that generate annotation data from\nexisting taxonomies. However, these methods are less effective when the\nexisting taxonomy is small (fewer than 100 entities). In this work, we\nintroduce \\textsc{CodeTaxo}, a novel approach that leverages large language\nmodels through code language prompts to capture the taxonomic structure.\nExtensive experiments on five real-world benchmarks from different domains\ndemonstrate that \\textsc{CodeTaxo} consistently achieves superior performance\nacross all evaluation metrics, significantly outperforming previous\nstate-of-the-art methods.
