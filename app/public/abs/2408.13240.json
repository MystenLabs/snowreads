We use the problem of predicting human perceptions of pragmatic\nsimilarity among utterance pairs to evaluate the utility of prosodic features\nof different types. We find, for example, that duration-related features are\nmore important than pitch-related features, and that utterance-initial features\nare more important than utterance-final features. Further, failure analysis\nindicates that modeling using pitch features only often fails to handle\nimportant pragmatic functions, and suggests that several generally-neglected\nacoustic and prosodic features are pragmatically significant, including\nnasality and vibrato. These findings can guide future basic research in\nprosody, and suggest how to improve speech synthesis evaluation, among other\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"ZXa6wsN6vLKeoapZnI-BEouiDOLGjTJSEFSPcDHuETU","pdfSize":"194326"}
