In\nparticular, kilonova signals in some long GRB light curves as well as a\nsuggested uptick in the rate density of long GRBs at low redshifts (deviating\nsignificantly from the star formation rate) suggest that compact object mergers\nmay be a non-negligible fraction of the long GRB population. Here we\ninvestigate the contribution of white dwarf-black hole mergers to the long GRB\npopulation. We present evidence for the deviation of the long GRB rate density\nfrom the star formation rate at low redshifts, and provide analytic and\nnumerical arguments for why a white dwarf-black hole merger system may be a\nviable progenitor to explain this deviation. We show the range of parameter\nspace in which the durations, energetics, and rates of these systems can\naccount for a significant sub-population of low-redshift long GRBs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
