Despite its simple structure, this problem becomes\nnon-trivial with a massive number of locations, due to posing a huge branching\nfactor for search algorithms. Limiting the number of successors, such as with\nnearest neighbors, can reduce search efforts but compromises completeness.\nInstead, we propose a novel LaCAS* algorithm, which does not generate\nsuccessors all at once but gradually generates successors as the search\nprogresses. This scheme is implemented with k-nearest neighbors search on a k-d\ntree. LaCAS* is a complete and anytime algorithm that eventually converges to\nthe optima. Extensive evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of LaCAS*, e.g.,\nsolving complex pathfinding instances quickly, where conventional methods\nfalter.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
