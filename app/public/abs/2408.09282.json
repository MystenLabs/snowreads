The potentials arise through\nsymbolic substitution systems that have been recently introduced in this\nsetting. We characterize convergence of spectra of associated Schr\\\"odinger\noperators in the Hausdorff distance via properties of finite graphs. As a\nconsequence, new examples of periodic approximations are obtained. We further\nprove that there are substitution systems that do not admit periodic\napproximations in higher dimensions, in contrast to the one-dimensional case.\nOn the other hand, if the spectra converge, then we show that the rate of\nconvergence is necessarily exponentially fast. These results are new even for\nsubstitutions over $\\mathbb{Z}^d$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
