A gravitational\ndipole moment like contribution, arises in the nonrelativistic Hamiltonian of\nthe system through an exact Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation. This term violates\nthe equivalence principle for the weak interaction that is restored in the\naverage over the spins. Furthermore, it feels the effects of the extra\ndimensions, so that in a Universe with two additional spatial dimensions its\nenergy contribution is amplified by an order of $\\sim 10^{16}\\ \\text{eV}$\nconcerning to the energy of this term for ordinary space. The compactification\nradius for a Universe with two extra dimensions is within the experimental\nlimits, where deviations from the inverse square law are being tested. This\nsuggests that the energy value for the gravitational dipole term in this\nscenario may lead us to search for traces of extra dimensions in atomic\nspectroscopy, as well as experimental constraints for these dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
