Owing to the subtle differences and ambiguous boundaries, COD is\nnot only a remarkably challenging task for models but also for human\nannotators, requiring huge efforts to provide pixel-wise annotations. To\nalleviate the heavy annotation burden, we propose to fulfill this task with the\nhelp of only one point supervision. Specifically, by swiftly clicking on each\nobject, we first adaptively expand the original point-based annotation to a\nreasonable hint area. Then, to avoid partial localization around discriminative\nparts, we propose an attention regulator to scatter model attention to the\nwhole object through partially masking labeled regions. Moreover, to solve the\nunstable feature representation of camouflaged objects under only point-based\nannotation, we perform unsupervised contrastive learning based on differently\naugmented image pairs (e.g. changing color or doing translation). On three\nmainstream COD benchmarks, experimental results show that our model outperforms\nseveral weakly-supervised methods by a large margin across various metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
