This is of particular relevance for the analysis of\nHilbert space valued Mean-Field equations. As an illustration we derive a mild\nIto-formula for Mean-Field stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs),\nwhich provides the basis for a higher order Taylor expansion and higher order\nnumerical schemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"AGGMHKteIqlChtoJCA-wRLfvTWlUQ4JADPfUd6v87HY","pdfSize":"383274"}
