However, since its finite element method is compatible only with\nCentral Processing Units (CPU), the ISSM has limits on further economizing\ncomputational time. Thus, by taking advantage of Graphics Processing Units\n(GPUs), we design a graph convolutional network (GCN) as a fast emulator for\nISSM. The GCN is trained and tested using the 20-year transient ISSM\nsimulations in the Pine Island Glacier (PIG). The GCN reproduces ice thickness\nand velocity with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.998, outperforming\nthe traditional convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally, GCN shows 34\ntimes faster computational speed than the CPU-based ISSM modeling. The\nGPU-based GCN emulator allows us to predict how the PIG will change in the\nfuture under different melting rate scenarios with high fidelity and much\nfaster computational time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C6yIxSTJHEpJMZm1OAMQeygG_ERVIIufGrz1dc0GUtE","pdfSize":"10698874"}
