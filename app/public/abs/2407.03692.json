We will\nfocus on the significant role played by Donaldson's diagonalization theorem and\nthe combinatorics of integral lattices in understanding these embeddings.\nAdditionally, the article introduces a new result concerning the embedding of\namphichiral lens spaces in negative-definite manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
