A group $G$ is said to be an $m$-DCI-group or\nan $m$-CI-group if $G$ has the $k$-DCI property or $k$-CI property for all\npositive integers $k$ at most $m$, respectively. Let $G$ be a dihedral group of\norder $2n$ with $n\\geq 3$. Qu and Yu proved that $G$ is an $m$-DCI-group or\n$m$-CI-group, for every $m\\in \\{1,2,3\\}$, if and only if $n$ is odd. In this\npaper, it is shown that $G$ is a $4$-DCI-group if and only if $n$ is odd and\nnot divisible by $9$, and $G$ is a $4$-CI-group if and only if $n$ is odd.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
