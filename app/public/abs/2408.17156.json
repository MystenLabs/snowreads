In particular, we focus on the challenges of quantized\ncommunications, asynchrony, and stochastic gradients that arise in this set-up.\nWe first discuss how to turn the presence of quantized communications into an\nadvantage, by resorting to a finite-time, quantized coordination scheme. This\nscheme is combined with a distributed gradient descent method to derive the\nproposed algorithm. Secondly, we show how this algorithm can be adapted to\nallow asynchronous operations of the agents, as well as the use of stochastic\ngradients. Finally, we propose a variant of the algorithm which employs\nzooming-in quantization. We analyze the convergence of the proposed methods and\ncompare them to state-of-the-art alternatives.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
