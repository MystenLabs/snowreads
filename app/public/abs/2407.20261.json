The governing system of nonlinear partial\ndifferential equations consists of the stochastic Navier Stokes equations with\nnon homogeneous Navier slip boundary condition coupled with a phase-field\nequation, which is the convective Allen Cahn equation type. We investigate the\nwell posedness of the nonlinear system. More precisely, the existence and\nuniqueness of global strong solution in dimension two is established and we\nprove the existence of an optimal solution to the control problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
