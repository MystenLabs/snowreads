TEL includes primitive temporal\nconstructs such as ``always up to $t$ time later'' ($\\Box_t$), ``sometimes\nbefore $t$ time in the future'' ($\\Diamond_t$), and ``$t$-time later''\n$\\varphi_t$. TEL has been motivated from the requirement for rigor and\nreproducibility for cohort specification and discovery in clinical and\npopulation health research, to fill a gap in formalizing temporal reasoning in\nbiomedicine. Existing logical frameworks such as linear temporal logic are too\nrestrictive to express temporal and sequential properties in biomedicine, or\ntoo permissive in semantic constructs, such as in Halpern-Shoham logic, to\nserve this purpose. In this paper, we first introduce TEL in a general set up,\nwith discrete and dense time as special cases. We then focus on the theoretical\ndevelopment of discrete TEL on the temporal domain of positive integers\n$\\mathbb{N}^+$, denoted as ${\\rm TEL}_{\\mathbb{N}^+}$. ${\\rm\nTEL}_{\\mathbb{N}^+}$ is strictly more expressive than the standard monadic\nsecond order logic, characterized by B\\\"{u}chi automata. We present its formal\nsemantics, a proof system, and provide a proof for the undecidability of the\nsatisfiability of ${\\rm TEL}_{\\mathbb{N}^+}$. We also include initial results\non expressiveness and decidability fragments for ${\\rm TEL}_{\\mathbb{N}^+}$,\nfollowed by application outlook and discussions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
