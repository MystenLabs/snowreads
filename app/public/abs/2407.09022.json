However, operating under\nself-generating-self-receiving (SGSR) method usually results in poor\nsensitivity. But the sensitivity cannot be improved simply by increasing the\nresonant frequency since the frequency of a specific kind of CMUT is designed\nfor specific usage. In this paper, based on one specific type of CMUT,\nmechanical model is built and simulation analysis is demonstrated. A brand-new\nmethod one-generating-multiple-receiving (OGMR) is introduced and a special\ncircuit model has been designed to improve the signal to thermal noise ratio.\nBy increasing the number of receiving capacitors from 1 to 8, we increased the\nsignal-noise ratio to 2.83 times.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
