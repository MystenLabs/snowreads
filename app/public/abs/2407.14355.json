This paper presents a novel\napproach for zero-shot audio classification using automatically generated sound\nattribute descriptions. We propose a list of sound attributes and leverage\nlarge language model's domain knowledge to generate detailed attribute\ndescriptions for each class. In contrast to previous works that primarily\nrelied on class labels or simple descriptions, our method focuses on\nmulti-dimensional innate auditory attributes, capturing different\ncharacteristics of sound classes. Additionally, we incorporate a contrastive\nlearning approach to enhance zero-shot learning from textual labels. We\nvalidate the effectiveness of our method on VGGSound and AudioSet\\footnote{The\ncode is available at \\url{https://www.github.com/wsntxxn/AttrEnhZsAc}.}. Our\nresults demonstrate a substantial improvement in zero-shot classification\naccuracy. Ablation results show robust performance enhancement, regardless of\nthe model architecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
