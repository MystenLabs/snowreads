When using coherent X-rays as\nprobe, this approach overlooks the phase component of the illumination field\n(probe), leading to artifacts in phase-retrieved projection images, which are\nthen propagated to the reconstructed 3D sample representation. The problem\nintensifies in nano-holotomography with focusing optics, that due to various\nimperfections create high-frequency components in the probe function. Here, we\npresent a new iterative reconstruction scheme for holotomography,\nsimultaneously retrieving the complex-valued probe function. Implemented on\nGPUs, this algorithm results in 3D reconstruction resolving twice thinner\nlayers in a 3D ALD standard sample measured using nano-holotomography.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
