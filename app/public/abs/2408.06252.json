We employ a multiorbital\nSlater-Koster tight-binding approach to derive effective k.p-type Hamiltonians\nthat describes the dominant spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effects of the Rashba and\nintrinsic origin at the high {\\Gamma} and S high symmetry points in\nphosphorene. In the absence of SOC effects a minimal admixture of pz and py\natomic orbitals suffices to reproduce the well known anisotropy of highest\nvalence and the lowest conduction bands at the {\\Gamma}-point, consistent with\ndensity functional theory (DFT) and k.p methods. In contrast, the inclusion of\nthe px and s atomic orbitals are rather crucial for an adequate description of\nthe SOC effects in phosphorene at low energies, particularly at the S-point. We\nintroduce useful analytical expressions for the Rashba and intrinsic SOC\nparameters in terms of the relevant Slater-Koster integrals. In addition, we\nreport simple formulas for the interband dipole-strenghts, revealing the nature\nof the strong anisotropic behavior of its lower bands. Our findings can be\nuseful for further studies of electronic and spin transport properties in\nmonolayer phosphorene and its nanoribbons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
