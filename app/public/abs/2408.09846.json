Dialogue State Tracking (DST),\nvital in these systems, often involves learning new services and confronting\ncatastrophic forgetting, along with a critical capability loss termed the\n\"Value Selection Quandary.\" To address these challenges, we introduce the\nReason-of-Select (RoS) distillation method by enhancing smaller models with a\nnovel 'meta-reasoning' capability. Meta-reasoning employs an enhanced\nmulti-domain perspective, combining fragments of meta-knowledge from\ndomain-specific dialogues during continual learning. This transcends\ntraditional single-perspective reasoning. The domain bootstrapping process\nenhances the model's ability to dissect intricate dialogues from multiple\npossible values. Its domain-agnostic property aligns data distribution across\ndifferent domains, effectively mitigating forgetting. Additionally, two novel\nimprovements, \"multi-value resolution\" strategy and Semantic Contrastive\nReasoning Selection method, significantly enhance RoS by generating\nDST-specific selection chains and mitigating hallucinations in teachers'\nreasoning, ensuring effective and reliable knowledge transfer. Extensive\nexperiments validate the exceptional performance and robust generalization\ncapabilities of our method.
