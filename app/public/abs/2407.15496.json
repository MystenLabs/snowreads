This study\nproposes a secure framework for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) backscattering\nnear an eavesdropping vehicle to maximize the sum secrecy rate of V2I\nbackscatter communication over multiple coherence slots. This sustainable\nframework aims to jointly optimize the reflection coefficients at the\nbackscattering vehicle, carrier emitter power, and artificial noise at the\ninfrastructure, along with the target vehicle's linear trajectory in the\npresence of an eavesdropping vehicle in the parallel lane. To achieve this\noptimization, we separated the problem into three parts: backscattering\ncoefficient, power allocation, and trajectory design problems. We respectively\nadopted parallel computing, fractional programming, and finding all the\ncandidates for the global optimal solution to obtain the global optimal\nsolution for these three problems. Our simulations verified the fast\nconvergence of our alternating optimization algorithm and showed that our\nproposed secure V2I backscattering outperforms the existing benchmark by over\n4.7 times in terms of secrecy rate for 50 slots. Overall, this fundamental\nresearch on V2I backscattering provided insights to improve vehicular\ncommunication's connectivity, efficiency, and security.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
