This gravity\nis a generic function of the non-metricity scalar $Q$ and its trace $T$. We\ninvestigate the characteristics of the derived cosmological model using a\nparameterized form of Hubble's parameter, $H(z) = H_0\\left[\\Omega_{0m}(1+z)^3 +\n(1-\\Omega_{0m})\\right]^{\\frac{1}{2}}$ (Mahmood et al. Int. J. Geom. Methods\nMod. Phys., https://doi.org/10.1142/S0219887824502049). Our examination reveals\nhow physical parameters such as energy density, pressure, and the equation of\nstate parameter, among others, in our model accurately describe the physical\nbehavior of the cosmos. Furthermore, we explore the kinematic parameters in our\nmodel, which provide valuable insights into the cosmos's expansion history,\nincluding its acceleration, deceleration, and the evolution of its large-scale\nstructure. By exploring these aspects, we gain a deeper understanding of the\ncosmos's dynamics and evolution within the context of modified gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
