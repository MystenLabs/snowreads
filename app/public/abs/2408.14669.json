However, out of the set of possible randomized assignments, some may\nbe likely to produce poor effect estimates and misleading conclusions.\nRestricted randomization is an experimental design strategy that filters out\nundesirable treatment assignments, but its application has primarily been\nlimited to ensuring covariate balance in two-arm studies where the target\nestimand is the average treatment effect. Other experimental settings with\ndifferent design desiderata and target effect estimands could also stand to\nbenefit from a restricted randomization approach. We introduce\nInspection-Guided Randomization (IGR), a transparent and flexible framework for\nrestricted randomization that filters out undesirable treatment assignments by\ninspecting assignments against analyst-specified, domain-informed design\ndesiderata. In IGR, the acceptable treatment assignments are locked in ex ante\nand pre-registered in the trial protocol, thus safeguarding against $p$-hacking\nand promoting reproducibility. Through illustrative simulation studies\nmotivated by education and behavioral health interventions, we demonstrate how\nIGR can be used to improve effect estimates compared to benchmark designs in\ngroup formation experiments and experiments with interference.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
