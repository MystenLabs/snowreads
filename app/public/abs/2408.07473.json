Interference in a measurement of only the\nparticle is shown to disappear for microscopic yet appear for mesoscopic\nscatterers, contrary to that of a quantum-classical transition. A measurement\nof this threshold can verify quantum correlations in many-body systems by\nmeasuring only the retro-reflected microscopic particle. The decoherence of a\nmesoscopic scatterer is determined by this threshold without it having to\ntraverse slits or beamsplitters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
