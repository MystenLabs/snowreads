When supplemented by appropriate boundary\nconditions, the equation determines one of these objects in terms of the other\nand hence selects ``fiducial'' models for strong SRRT inflation. When the\nscalar potential is given, the equation can be simplified by fixing the\nconformal class of the scalar field metric (equivalently, fixing a complex\nstructure which makes the scalar manifold into a complex Riemann surface). Then\nthe consistency equation becomes a contact Hamilton-Jacobi PDE which determines\nthe scalar field metric within the given conformal class. We analyze this\nequation with standard methods of PDE theory, discuss its approximation near a\nnondegenerate critical point of the scalar potential and extract natural\nasymptotic conditions for its solutions at such points. We also give numerical\nexamples of solutions to a simple Dirichlet problem. For the case of elliptic\ncurves relevant to two-field axion cosmology, we determine the general\nsymmetry-adapted solution of the equation for potentials with a single charge\nvector.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
