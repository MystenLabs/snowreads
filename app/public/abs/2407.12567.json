Once a phase transition occurs, a quantum system presents\ndegenerate eigenstates that lack the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. After\ncrossing the critical point, the system is essentially evolved to a quantum\nsuperposition of these eigenstates until decoherence sets in. Despite the\nfundamental importance and potential applications in quantum technologies, such\nquantum-mechanical SSB phenomena have not been experimentally explored in\nmany-body systems. We here present an experimental demonstration of the SSB\nprocess in the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, governed by the competition between\nthe individual driving and intra-qubit interaction. The model is realized in a\ncircuit quantum electrodynamics system, where 6 Xmon qubits are coupled in an\nall-to-all manner through virtual photon exchange mediated by a resonator. The\nobserved nonclassical correlations among these qubits in the symmetry-breaking\nregion go beyond the conventional description of SSB, shedding new light on\nphase transitions for quantum many-body systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
