XULIA allows you to manage all\nthe functions necessary to control all Windows functions using only your voice.\nAs a voice-to-text transcription system, it uses completely free modules\ncombining the Windows SAPI voice recognition libraries for command recognition\nwith Google's cloud-based voice recognition systems indirectly through a Google\nChrome browser, which allows you to use Google's paid voice-to-text\ntranscription services completely free of charge. XULIA manages multiple\ngrammars simultaneously with automatic activation to ensure that the set of\ncommands to be recognized is reduced to a minimum at all times, which allows\nfalse positives in command recognition to be reduced to a minimum.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EGmOxACnBwT9FGkB41hzZmeF0HiRDHQ9qYAp9M15xEo","pdfSize":"306137"}
