In this work, we present the Magnificent Seven Challenges in\ndomain-specific accelerator design that can guide adventurous architects to\ncontribute meaningfully to novel application domains. Although these challenges\nappear across domains ranging from ML to genomics, we examine them through the\nlens of autonomous systems as a motivating example in this work. To that end,\nwe identify opportunities for the path forward in a successful domain-specific\naccelerator design from these challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y6HYHjd5eWExqScTQc5He7v2F5HtOV-VvCI3khpHfDQ","pdfSize":"533277","objectId":"0x25c65144dda0f6828bdc31b22b1af8138015c6b1cb4269d0e2c7779a51645d61","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
