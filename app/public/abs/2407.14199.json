{"id":"2407.14199","title":"The stable \"Unstable Natural Media\" due to the presence of turbulence","authors":"Ka Wai Ho, Ka Ho Yuen, Alex Lazarian","authorsParsed":[["Ho","Ka Wai",""],["Yuen","Ka Ho",""],["Lazarian","Alex",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 10:50:08 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-22","timestamp":1721386208000,"abstract":"  The term \"unstable neutral media\" (UNM) has traditionally been used to\ndescribe the transient phase formed between the warm and cold neutral hydrogen\n(HI) phases and has not been the focus of HI studies. However, recent\nobservations suggest that the UNM phase not only has a significantly\nlonger-than-expected lifetime but also occupies at least 20\\% to 40\\% of both\nthe volume and mass fraction of HI. In this paper, we argue that the existence\nand dominance of the UNM can be explained by the presence of strong turbulence\nusing an energy balance argument. The mass fraction of UNM is directly\nproportional to the turbulent velocity dispersion $\\sigma_v$: mass fraction of\nUNM $\\propto \\sigma_v^{\\frac{2n}{1+n}}$, where $n$ is the absolute value of the\nadiabatic index in the unstable phase. We discuss the implications of\nlong-lived unstable thermal phases on ISM physics, including cold dense\nfilament formation, cosmic ray acceleration, and measurement of galactic\nforeground statistics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N8c1qZlZNrWRgI3Efd6yjnlPoESQT509bpPzZQZCBlE","pdfSize":"2813588"}
