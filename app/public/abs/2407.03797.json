In this work, we\nexperimentally demonstrate the equivalence of wave-particle duality and\nentropic uncertainty relations using orbital angular momentum (OAM) states of\nlight. Our experiment utilizes an innovative and reconfigurable platform\ncomposed of few-mode optical fibers and photonic lanterns, showcasing the\nversatility of this technology for quantum information processing. Our results\nprovide fundamental insights into the complementarity principle from an\ninformational perspective, with implications for the broader field of quantum\ntechnologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
