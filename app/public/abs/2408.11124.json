The\npresent project examines the precise relation which that propagator has to the\namplitude the Schwarzschild black hole emit a scalar particle in a particular\nmode of positive energy. It is thereby established that the effect of infinite\ntime-dilation on the event horizon results in both, the thermal radiation in\nthe background of a static exterior space-time geometry and the detraction from\nthermality if energy-conservation is properly imposed as a constraint on scalar\npropagation. The derivation of the latter signifies an equivalent approach to\nthe result of Parikh and Wilczek from the semi-classical perspective of the\ndistant observer. From that perspective for that matter, Hawking radiation\nemerges in both contexts as the exclusive consequence of infinite time-dilation\non the event horizon. These results are consistent with Hawking radiation as\nthe exclusive consequence of the causal structure of the Schwarzschild\nblack-hole space-time both, in a static exterior geometry and in such dynamical\nexterior geometry as energy-conservation signifies. The extension of the\nthermal case to other spin-fields and black-hole geometries is discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
