We introduce a\ntwo-dimensional square lattice that confirms the p-wave altermagnet criteria.\nThe $\\alpha$-vector of the altermagnet breaks the inversion symmetry of the\nparabolic dispersion, shifting them in k-space. These shifts alter the\npropagation direction of fermions passing through the junction interface.\nDepending on spin orientation, the transmission process exhibits anisotropic,\nangle-dependent behavior. We also demonstrate a mirror symmetry between\nfermions with opposite spin directions, leading to the emergence of a\ntransverse spin current that flows parallel to the interface. Additionally, we\nshow that the $\\alpha$-vector acts as a source for the dynamics of the\nspin-density wave and observe the formation of an indirect gap in the\nconductance of the junction. Our findings highlight the unique transmission\ncharacteristics and spin transport phenomena in normal metal/p-wave altermagnet\njunctions, paving the way for potential applications in spintronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
