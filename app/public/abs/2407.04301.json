In\nparticular we show that, assuming strong convergence of the sequence of\nsubgroups, the limit sets vary continuously with respect to Hausdorff distance,\nand if the sequence is weakly type-preserving, the sequence of Cannon-Thurston\nmaps also converges uniformly to a limiting Cannon-Thurston map. Our approach\nuses the theory of extended geometrically finite representations, developed\nrecently by the second author.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
