Recent advancements in\nlarge language models (LLMs) offer great opportunities to develop systems with\nautonomous agents to streamline the data storytelling workflow. Though\nmulti-agent systems have benefits such as fully realizing LLM potentials with\ndecomposed tasks for individual agents, designing such systems also faces\nchallenges in task decomposition, performance optimization for sub-tasks, and\nworkflow design. To better understand these issues, we develop Data Director,\nan LLM-based multi-agent system designed to automate the creation of animated\ndata videos, a representative genre of data stories. Data Director interprets\nraw data, breaks down tasks, designs agent roles to make informed decisions\nautomatically, and seamlessly integrates diverse components of data videos. A\ncase study demonstrates Data Director's effectiveness in generating data\nvideos. Throughout development, we have derived lessons learned from addressing\nchallenges, guiding further advancements in autonomous agents for data\nstorytelling. We also shed light on future directions for global optimization,\nhuman-in-the-loop design, and the application of advanced multi-modal LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
