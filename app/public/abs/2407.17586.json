Psychology has been, in recent years, poorly approached\nusing novel computational tools. One of the reasons is the high complexity of\nthe data required for a proper analysis. Moreover, psychology, with a focus on\npsychometry, has few datasets available for analysis and artificial\nintelligence usage. Because of these facts, this study introduces a synthethic\ndatabase of short essays labeled based on the five factor model (FFM) of\npersonality traits.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Other Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
