In general, Quantum Low Density Parity Check\n(QLDPC) decoding is based on Belief Propagation (BP, a variant of\nmessage-passing) and requires time intensive post-processing methods such as\nOrdered Statistics Decoding (OSD). Without using any post-processing, Astra\nachieves higher thresholds and better logical error rates when compared to\nBP+OSD, both for surface codes trained up to distance 11 and Bivariate Bicycle\n(BB) codes trained up to distance 18. Moreover, we can successfully extrapolate\nthe decoding functionality: we decode high distances (surface code up to\ndistance 25 and BB code up to distance 34) by using decoders trained on lower\ndistances. Astra+OSD is faster than BP+OSD. We show that with decreasing\nphysical error rates, Astra+OSD makes progressively fewer calls to OSD when\ncompared to BP+OSD, even in the context of extrapolated decoding. Astra(+OSD)\nachieves orders of magnitude lower logical error rates for BB codes compared to\nBP(+OSD).
