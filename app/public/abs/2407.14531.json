We\ndemonstrate that this procedure can also be applied to derive Maxwell's and\nYang-Mills equations. Additionally, we find that in this boundary approach,\n\\(\\mathcal{CP}\\)-violating dual couplings and spontaneous symmetry breaking\nthrough gauge boson masses emerge in a manner analogous to the appearance of\nthe cosmological constant in the original gravitational context.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
