To this end,\nquantum compilation techniques must scale along with the hardware constraints,\nshifting the current paradigm of obtaining an optimal compilation to relying on\nheuristics that allow for a fast solution, even though the quality of such a\nsolution may not be optimal. Significant concerns arise as the execution time\nof current mapping techniques experiences a notable increase when applied to\nquantum computers with a high number of qubits. In this work, we present\nRoute-Forcing, a quantum circuit mapping algorithm that shows an average\nspeedup of $3.7\\times$ compared to the state-of-the-art scalable techniques,\nreducing the depth of the mapped circuit by $4.7 \\times$ at the expense of\nadding $1.3 \\times$ more SWAP gates. Moreover, the proposed mapping algorithm\nis adapted and tuned for what is expected to be the next generation of quantum\ncomputers, in which different processors are interconnected to increase the\ntotal number of qubits, allowing for more complex computations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
