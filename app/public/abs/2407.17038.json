Considering cultural influences is\nessential not only for the actual set of functional/non-functional\nrequirements, but also for the whole Requirement Engineering (RE) process.\nWithout a clear understanding of cultural influences on RE activities, it's\nhardly possible to elaborate a correct and complete set of requirements. This\nresearch explores the impact of national culture on RE-related activities based\non recent studies. We conducted a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) of studies\npublished in 2019-2023 and compared them to an older SLR covering 2000-2018. We\nidentified 17 relevant studies, extracted 33 cultural influences impacting RE\nactivities, and mapped them to the Hofstede model, widely used for cultural\nanalysis in software development research. Our work highlights the critical\nrole of national culture in RE activities, summarizes current research trends,\nand helps practitioners consider cultural influences for mobile app/software\ndevelopment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
