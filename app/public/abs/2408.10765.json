Such non-linearities are at\nthe heart of many computational tasks, such as data classification and pattern\nrecognition. Quantum neural networks, on the other hand, are necessarily linear\nas they process information via unitary operations. Here we show that effective\nnon-linearities can be implemented in these platforms by exploiting the\nrelationship between information processing and many-body quantum dynamics. The\ncrucial point is that quantum many-body systems can show emergent collective\nbehavior in the vicinity of phase transitions, which leads to an effectively\nnon-linear dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. In the context of quantum\nneural networks, which are necessarily finite, this translates into\nmetastability with transient non-ergodic behavior. By using a quantum neural\nnetwork whose architecture is inspired by dissipative many-body quantum spin\nmodels, we show that this mechanism indeed allows to realize non-linear data\nclassification, despite the underlying dynamics being local and linear. Our\nproof-of-principle study may pave the way for the systematic construction of\nquantum neural networks with emergent non-linear properties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
