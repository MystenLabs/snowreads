In this paper, we\ndevelop a novel ISAC scheme that utilizes the diffusion model to sense the\nelectromagnetic (EM) property of the target in a predetermined sensing area.\nSpecifically, we first estimate the sensing channel by using both the\ncommunications and the sensing signals echoed back from the target. Then we\nemploy the diffusion model to generate the point cloud that represents the\ntarget and thus enables 3D visualization of the target's EM property\ndistribution. In order to minimize the mean Chamfer distance (MCD) between the\nground truth and the estimated point clouds, we further design the\ncommunications and sensing beamforming matrices under the constraint of a\nmaximum transmit power and a minimum communications achievable rate for each\nuser equipment (UE). Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the\nproposed method in achieving high-quality reconstruction of the target's shape,\nrelative permittivity, and conductivity. Besides, the proposed method can sense\nthe EM property of the target effectively in any position of the sensing area.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
