This method is adaptive to all problem parameters,\nincluding smoothness and weak convexity constants. It is assumed that the\nsmooth component of the objective is weakly convex and possibly nonseparable,\nwhile the non-smooth component is convex and block-separable. The proposed\nmethod is tolerant to the inexact solution of its block proximal subproblem so\nit does not require that the non-smooth component has easily computable block\nproximal maps. Each iteration of our adaptive P-ADMM consists of two steps: (1)\nthe sequential solution of each block proximal subproblem, and (2) adaptive\ntests to decide whether to perform a full Lagrange multiplier and/or penalty\nparameter update(s). Without any rank assumptions on the constraint matrices,\nit is shown that the adaptive P-ADMM obtains an approximate first-order\nstationary point of the constrained problem in a number of iterations that\nmatches the state-of-the-art complexity for the class of P-ADMMs. The two\nproof-of-concept numerical experiments that conclude the paper suggest our\nadaptive P-ADMM enjoys significant computational benefits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
