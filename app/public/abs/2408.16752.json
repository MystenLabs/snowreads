In doing so we employ a recently introduced\nstrong coupling $1/S$ spin wave expansion, which effectively describes\nexcitations of the total spin $S\\pm 1/2$ on a given site (i.e., sum of local\nmoment and electron spin). We further make use of the fact that the ground\nstate of Kondo lattice models with quantum spins and a single electron is a\nferromagnet, and that the magnetic excitations of the ferromagnet can be\nexactly determined. We demonstrate that the energies and eigenstates of the\nspin waves are in full agreement with the exact solution order-by-order in\n$1/S$ and $t/J_K$, the strong coupling expansion parameter. In the specific\ncase of antiferromagnetic Kondo coupling, when the exact ground state wave\nfunction describes spin polaron, we show that the electron operators of the\nspin wave formalism precisely correspond to the spin polaron states. More\nbroadly, the study of Kondo-Heisenberg toy models is shown to provide insight\ninto the fundamental distinction between itinerant Kondo magnets and Heisenberg\nmagnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WvOhMyyLDYe7lqxLXP3v2YPuWzcXZsdVs5RCPvq1Vfs","pdfSize":"2900565"}
