To match these\nrequirements, we present a finger design based on series-elastic actuation that\nwe call the everyday finger. Our focus is to make the fingers as compact as\npossible while achieving the desired performance. We evaluated everyday fingers\nby constructing a two-finger robotic hand that was tested on various\nperformance parameters and tasks like picking and placing dishes in a rack,\npicking thin and flat objects like paper and delicate objects such as\nstrawberries.
