However, capturing spatial and temporal information\nefficiently remains challenging. Here, we present a novel photon-detection\ntechnique to achieve a significantly more efficient measurement of\nfrequency-entangled biphoton than conventional photon detectors. We utilize a\ndelay-line-anode single-photon detector (DLD), which consists of a\nposition-sensitive delay line anode sensor behind a microchannel plate.\nBiphotons are obtained from the decay of biexcitons in the copper chloride\nsemiconductor crystal. Two DLDs are coupled with a grating spectrometer exit to\nmeasure the joint spectral distributions of the biphoton. The resulting\nnon-scanning process requires only a few minutes to obtain a temporally and\nspectrally resolved image, which is much quicker than the conventional biphoton\nfrequency measurement. Our technique paves the way for all experiments in\nmulti-mode quantum science requiring coincidence measurement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
