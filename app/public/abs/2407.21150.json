In this paper, we introduce PLANesT-3D; a\nnew annotated dataset of 3D color point clouds of plants. PLANesT-3D is\ncomposed of 34 point cloud models representing 34 real plants from three\ndifferent plant species: \\textit{Capsicum annuum}, \\textit{Rosa kordana}, and\n\\textit{Ribes rubrum}. Both semantic labels in terms of \"leaf\" and \"stem\", and\norgan instance labels were manually annotated for the full point clouds. As an\nadditional contribution, SP-LSCnet, a novel semantic segmentation method that\nis a combination of unsupervised superpoint extraction and a 3D point-based\ndeep learning approach is introduced and evaluated on the new dataset. Two\nexisting deep neural network architectures, PointNet++ and RoseSegNet were also\ntested on the point clouds of PLANesT-3D for semantic segmentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
