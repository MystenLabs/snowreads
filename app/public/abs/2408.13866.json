However, the concept of \\dts lacks a unified definition and faces\nvalidation challenges, partly due to the scarcity of reproducible modules or\nsource codes in existing studies. While many applications are described in case\nstudies, they often lack detailed, re-usable specifications for researchers and\nengineers. In previous research, we defined and formalized the \\dt concept.\nThis paper presents a reproducible laboratory experiment that demonstrates\nvarious \\dt concepts. Our formalized concept encompasses the \\pt, the digital\nmodel, the digital template, the digital thread, the digital shadow, the \\dt,\nand the \\dtp. We illustrate this series of concepts by using a PiCar-X,\nshowcasing the progression from a \\pt to its \\dtp. The entire code base is\npublished as open source, and for each concept, Docker-compose files are\nprovided to facilitate independent exploration, understanding, and extension.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
