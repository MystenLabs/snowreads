The images were methodically collected following\nstandardized methods to assure uniformity and quality. Each image has been\nlabelled and grouped into directories based on binary class labels, which\nindicate whether each streetlight is functional or not. This organized dataset\nis intended to make it easier to train and evaluate deep neural networks,\nallowing for the creation of pre-trained models that have robust feature\nrepresentations. Such models have several potential uses, such as improving\nsmart city surveillance systems, automating street infrastructure monitoring,\nand increasing urban management efficiency. The availability of this dataset is\nintended to inspire future research and development in computer vision and\nsmart city technologies, supporting innovation and practical solutions to urban\ninfrastructure concerns.
