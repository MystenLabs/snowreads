While a robotic\nhand equipped with multiple fingers can execute precise and intricate\nmanipulation tasks, the inherent redundancy stemming from its extensive DoF\noften adds unnecessary complexity. In this paper, we introduce the design of a\ntactile sensor-equipped gripper with two fingers and five DoF. We present a\nnovel design integrating a GelSight tactile sensor, enhancing sensing\ncapabilities and enabling finer control during specific manipulation tasks. To\nevaluate the gripper's performance, we conduct experiments involving two\nchallenging tasks: 1) retrieving, singularizing, and classification of various\nobjects embedded in granular media, and 2) executing scooping manipulations of\ncredit cards in confined environments to achieve precise insertion. Our results\ndemonstrate the efficiency of the proposed approach, with a high success rate\nfor singulation and classification tasks, particularly for spherical objects at\nhigh as 94.3%, and a 100% success rate for scooping and inserting credit cards.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
