Our analysis focuses on a wide range of EoS parameter\nvalues that are still optimal for explaining the latest data from the pulsar\ntiming array (PTA). As a result of our study, the most advantageous window,\n$0.31 \\leq w \\leq 1/3$, is identified as the location of a substantial PBH\nabundance, $f_{\\rm PBH} \\in (10^{-3},1)$ with large mass PBHs, $M_{\\rm PBH}\\sim\n{\\cal O}(10^{-7}-10^{-3})M_{\\odot}$, in the SIGW interpretation of the PTA\nsignal. When confronted with PTA, we find that the overproduction avoiding\ncircumstances are between $1\\sigma-2\\sigma$, while the EoS parameter lies\ninside the narrow window, $0.31<w\\leq 1/3$. We propose a\nregularized-renormalized-resummed (RRR) scalar power spectrum that is large\nenough to produce EoS dependent scalar generated gravitational waves compatible\nwith PTA evidence, while satisfying the perturbativity, causality, and\nunitarity criteria, within the range of $0.88 \\leq c_{s} \\leq 1$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
