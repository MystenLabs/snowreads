We developed a computer-vision-based system that monitors the\ninput of an olive grinder and promptly alerts operators if a foreign object is\ndetected, indicating it by using guided lasers, audio, and visual cues.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
