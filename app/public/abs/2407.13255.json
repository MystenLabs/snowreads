However, achieving replica Bayes optimality with MAMP necessitates\na large-scale right-unitarily invariant transformation, which is prohibitive in\npractical systems due to its high computational complexity and hardware costs.\nTo solve this difficulty, this letter proposes a low-complexity interleaved\nblock-sparse (IBS) transform, which consists of interleaved multiple\nlow-dimensional transform matrices, aimed at reducing the hardware\nimplementation scale while mitigating performance loss. Furthermore, an IBS\ncross-domain memory approximate message passing (IBS-CD-MAMP) estimator is\ndeveloped, comprising a memory linear estimator in the IBS transform domain and\na non-linear estimator in the source domain. Numerical results show that the\nIBS-CD-MAMP offers a reduced implementation scale and lower complexity with\nexcellent performance in IBS-based compressed sensing and interleave frequency\ndivision multiplexing systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
