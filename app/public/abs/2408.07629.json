When these tools are integrated with AI, they can offer\npersonalized support and adaptive interventions, effectively connecting\ncommunity health workers (CHWs) and healthcare facilities. The CHARM (Community\nHealth Access & Resource Management) app is an AI-native mobile app for CHWs.\nDeveloped through a joint partnership of Causal Foundry (CF) and\nmothers2mothers (m2m), CHARM empowers CHWs, mainly local women, by streamlining\ncase management, enhancing learning, and improving communication. This paper\ndetails CHARM's development, integration, and upcoming reinforcement\nlearning-based adaptive interventions, all aimed at enhancing health worker\nengagement, efficiency, and patient outcomes, thereby enhancing CHWs'\ncapabilities and community health.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
