A sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interaction is found\nbetween a carrier and an interlayer exciton trapped at different high symmetry\npoints of the moir\\'e supercell. This interaction at a distance much shorter\nthan the carrier-carrier separation dominates the magnetic order in the\nBose-Fermi mixture, where the carrier sublattice develops ferromagnetism\nopposite to that in the exciton sublattice. We demonstrate the possibility of\nincreasing the Curie temperature of moir\\'e carriers through electrical tuning\nof the exciton density in the ground state. In a trilayer moir\\'e system with a\np-n-p type band alignment, the exciton-carrier interplay can establish a\nlayered antiferromagnetism for holes confined in the two outer layers. We\nfurther reveal a spontaneous nematic order in the Bose-Fermi mixture, arising\nfrom the interference between the Coulomb interaction and p-wave interlayer\ntunneling dictated by the stacking registry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
