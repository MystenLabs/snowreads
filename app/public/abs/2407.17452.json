We performed combined molecular dynamics and\nMonte Carlo simulations in the semi-grand canonical ensemble at 800 {\\deg}C and\nconsidered three quenched disorder states in the Al-Si-O framework ranging from\nfully ordered to fully disordered. The excess Gibbs energy of mixing, excess\nenthalpy of mixing and excess entropy of mixing are in good agreement with\nliterature data. In particular, the notion that increasing disorder in the\nAl-Si-O framework correlates with increasing ideality of Na-K mixing is\nsuccessfully predicted. Finally, a recently proposed short range ordering of Na\nand K in the alkali sublattice is observed, which may be considered as a\nprecursor to exsolution lamellae, a characteristic phenomenon in alkali\nfeldspar of intermediate composition leading to perthite formation during\ncooling.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
