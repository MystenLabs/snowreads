{"id":"2408.06713","title":"Adaptive USVs Swarm Optimization for Target Tracking in Dynamic\n  Environments","authors":"Oren Gal","authorsParsed":[["Gal","Oren",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 08:19:10 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-14","timestamp":1723537150000,"abstract":"  This research investigates the performance and efficiency of Unmanned Surface\nVehicles (USVs) in multi-target tracking scenarios using the Adaptive Particle\nSwarm Optimization with k-Nearest Neighbors (APSO-kNN) algorithm. The study\nexplores various search patterns-Random Walk, Spiral, Lawnmower, and Cluster\nSearch to assess their effectiveness in dynamic environments. Through extensive\nsimulations, we evaluate the impact of different search strategies, varying the\nnumber of targets and USVs' sensing capabilities, and integrating a\nPursuit-Evasion model to test adaptability. Our findings demonstrate that\nsystematic search patterns like Spiral and Lawnmower provide superior coverage\nand tracking accuracy, making them ideal for thorough area exploration. In\ncontrast, the Random Walk pattern, while highly adaptable, shows lower accuracy\ndue to its non-deterministic nature, and Cluster Search maintains group\ncohesion but is heavily dependent on target distribution. The mixed strategy,\ncombining multiple patterns, offers robust performance across varied scenarios,\nwhile APSO-kNN effectively balances exploration and exploitation, making it a\npromising approach for real-world applications such as surveillance, search and\nrescue, and environmental monitoring. This study provides valuable insights\ninto optimizing search strategies and sensing configurations for USV swarms,\nultimately enhancing their operational efficiency and success in complex\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
