In the literature, this problem\nhas been typically tackled by means of open-loop strategies, whose\napplicability is however limited by the need of accurate a priori information\non the game and scarce robustness to uncertainty and noise. Here, we overcome\nthese limitations by adopting a closed-loop approach using an adaptive-gain\ncontrol scheme within a replicator equation -a nonlinear ordinary differential\nequation that models the evolution of the collective behavior of the\npopulation. For most classes of 2-action matrix games we establish sufficient\nconditions to design a controller that guarantees convergence of the replicator\nequation to the desired equilibrium, requiring limited a-priori information on\nthe game. Numerical simulations corroborate and expand our theoretical\nfindings.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
