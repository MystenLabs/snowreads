While this technology could help to\nprotect the privacy of individuals around the globe, current research restricts\nthis by focusing almost exclusively on English data. In this study, we extend a\nstate-of-the-art anonymization system to nine languages by transforming\nlanguage-dependent components to their multilingual counterparts. Experiments\ntesting the robustness of the anonymized speech against privacy attacks and\nspeech deterioration show an overall success of this system for all languages.\nThe results suggest that speaker embeddings trained on English data can be\napplied across languages, and that the anonymization performance for a language\nis mainly affected by the quality of the speech synthesis component used for\nit.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
