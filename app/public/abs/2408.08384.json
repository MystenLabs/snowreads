In this Letter, we generalize the\nLifshitz formula to the Casimir effect originating from quantum fields at\nfinite chemical potential. To demonstrate the versatility of this formula, we\ndiscuss the typical phenomena of the Casimir effect at finite chemical\npotential in various systems, such as some boundary conditions, finite\ntemperatures, arbitrary spatial dimensions, and mismatched chemical potentials.\nThis formula can be applied to the Casimir effect in dense quark matter and\nDirac/Weyl semimetals, where the chemical potential is regarded as a parameter\nto control the Casimir effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
