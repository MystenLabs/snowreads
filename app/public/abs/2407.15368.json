However, in contrast to risk neutral models, their applications\nare still limited due to the lack of efficient solution methods. In particular,\nthe mean $L_p$ semi-deviation is a classic risk minimization model, but its\nsolution is highly challenging due to the composition of concave-convex\nfunctions and the lack of uniform Lipschitz continuity. In this paper, we\ndiscuss some progresses on the design of efficient algorithms for $L_p$ risk\nminimization, including a novel lifting reformulation to handle the\nconcave-convex composition, and a new stochastic approximation method to handle\nthe non-Lipschitz continuity. We establish an upper bound on the sample\ncomplexity associated with this approach and show that this bound is not\nimprovable for $L_p$ risk minimization in general.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
