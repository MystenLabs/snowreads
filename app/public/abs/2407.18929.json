Despite this, the pursuit of optimal solutions in IDS-correcting\ncodes remains an open challenge, drawing interest from both theoretical and\nengineering perspectives. This work introduces a pioneering approach named\nTHEA-code. The proposed method follows a heuristic idea of employing an\nend-to-end autoencoder for the integrated encoding and decoding processes. To\naddress the challenges associated with deploying an autoencoder as an\nIDS-correcting code, we propose innovative techniques, including the\ndifferentiable IDS channel, the entropy constraint on the codeword, and the\nauxiliary reconstruction of the source sequence. These strategies contribute to\nthe successful convergence of the autoencoder, resulting in a deep\nlearning-based IDS-correcting code with commendable performance. Notably,\nTHEA-Code represents the first instance of a deep learning-based code that is\nindependent of conventional coding frameworks in the IDS-correcting domain.\nComprehensive experiments, including an ablation study, provide a detailed\nanalysis and affirm the effectiveness of THEA-Code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
