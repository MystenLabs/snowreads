Besides the Chern number and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant,\nchirality is important to describe the band topology. The model shows the\nnonzero magnon Nernst effect for both the strong and weak topological phases\nwhen a longitudinal temperature gradient exists. Furthermore, we find the\norbital angular momentum induced purely by the topology of magnons, which can\nbe probed by the Einstein-de Haas effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wz7MLbbBls097KxU3G6pvMxP-2E-jR2RORrIAm4wIaI","pdfSize":"3700563"}
