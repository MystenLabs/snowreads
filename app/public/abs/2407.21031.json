In a series of\nrecent publications we investigated whether primordial black holes (PBHs)\nperceiving the dark dimension could constitute all of the dark matter in the\nuniverse. A key assumption of these investigations is that PBHs remain confined\nto the brane during the entire evaporation process. As a consequence, the\nabundance of PBHs evaporating at the present epoch is severely constrained by\nobservations of both the extragalactic and Galactic $\\gamma$-ray backgrounds.\nAs a natural outgrowth of these investigations, herein we relax the assumption\nof brane localized PBHs and reexamine the evaporation process of PBHs which are\nallowed to escape into the dark dimension. We show that the escape of PBHs from\nthe brane is almost instantaneous. Armed with this pivotal finding we reassess\nthe allowed mass range of PBHs to assemble all cosmological dark matter, which\nis estimated to be $10^{11} \\lesssim M_{\\rm BH}/{\\rm g} \\lesssim 10^{21}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
