For such\ndata sources to be made available, however, strict guarantees of privacy would\nbe required. To achieve this, synthetic data methods can be used. Such methods,\nwhen protecting the confidentiality of tabular data (contingency tables), often\nutilise the Poisson or Poisson-mixture distributions, such as the negative\nbinomial (NBI). These distributions, however, are either equidispersed (in the\ncase of the Poisson) or overdispersed (e.g. in the case of the NBI), which\nresults in excessive noise being applied to large low-risk counts. This paper\nproposes the use of the (discretized) gamma family (GAF) distribution, which\nallows noise to be applied in a more bespoke fashion. Specifically, it allows\nless noise to be applied as cell counts become larger, providing an optimal\nbalance in relation to the risk-utility trade-off. We illustrate the\nsuitability of the GAF distribution on an administrative-type data set that is\nreminiscent of the ESC.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"maNn_zvwNJVmgjXFg3EIFTDuhuczx-4aNw16IRQPa3A","pdfSize":"1538145","txDigest":"56sfR5qscjBftTMekaENESG6cV4iuDQd7U7R3XdpBkZj","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
