This observation inspired us:\ncould optimizing the leg length of quadruped robots endow them with similar\nlocomotive capabilities? In this paper, we propose an approach that\nco-optimizes the mechanical structure and control policy to boost the\nlocomotive prowess of quadruped robots. Specifically, we introduce a novel\npretraining-finetuning framework, which not only guarantees optimal control\nstrategies for each mechanical candidate but also ensures time efficiency.\nAdditionally, we have devised an innovative training method for our pretraining\nnetwork, integrating spatial domain randomization with regularization methods,\nmarkedly improving the network's generalizability. Our experimental results\nindicate that the proposed pretraining-finetuning framework significantly\nenhances the overall co-design performance with less time consumption.\nMoreover, the co-design strategy substantially exceeds the conventional method\nof independently optimizing control strategies, further improving the robot's\nlocomotive performance and providing an innovative approach to enhancing the\nextreme parkour capabilities of quadruped robots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
