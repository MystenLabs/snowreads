We hypothesize that the\nrepresentation of objects via their bounding boxes only, can be sufficient to\nsuccessfully identify anomalous events in a scene. The implied value of this\napproach is increased object anonymization, faster model training and fewer\ncomputational resources. This can particularly benefit applications within\nvideo surveillance running on edge devices such as cameras. We design our model\nbased on human reasoning which lends itself to explaining model output in\nhuman-understandable terms. Meanwhile, the slowest model trains within less\nthan 7 seconds on a 11th Generation Intel Core i9 Processor. While our approach\nconstitutes a drastic reduction of problem feature space in comparison with\nprior art, we show that this does not result in a reduction in performance: the\nresults we report are highly competitive on the benchmark datasets CUHK Avenue\nand ShanghaiTech, and significantly exceed on the latest State-of-the-Art\nresults on StreetScene, which has so far proven to be the most challenging VAD\ndataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
