More precisely, we analyze the situation in which the system's\nagents do not transmit information to all the other agents and also agents that\nare linked to each other can suspend their interaction at certain times.\nMoreover, we take into account of possible time lags in the interactions. To\ndeal with the considered \"non-universal\" connection, a graph topology over the\nstructure of the model has to be considered. Under a so-called Persistence\nExcitation Condition, we establish the exponential convergence to consensus for\nboth models whenever the digraph that describes the interaction between the\nagents is strongly connected.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wb_53LpSUs5NUS_qcUQNc_F9i1SqsgZOnQ5d-BxJkj8","pdfSize":"308573"}
