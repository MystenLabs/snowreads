According to the\nclassification results, there are four such Lie algebras. It is shown that one\nof these four Lie algebras admits left-invariant K\\\"{a}hler metrics, and the\nother three admit left-invariant semi-para-K\\\"{a}hler and semi-K\\\"{a}hler\nstructures. The paper also shows that a six-dimensional symplectic Lie algebra\nmust be solvable except in one case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
