For applications such as virtual reality (VR) and teleconferencing,\nobtaining individualized HRTFs can be beneficial yet challenging, the objective\nof this work is therefore to assess whether incorporating HRTFs in a\ndirection-dependent manner could improve localization precision without the\nneed to obtain individualized HRTFs. A localization experiment conducted with a\nVR headset assessed localization errors, comparing an overall best HRTF from a\nset, against selecting the best HRTF based on average performance in each\ndirection. The results demonstrate a substantial improvement in elevation\nlocalization error with the method motivated by direction-dependent HRTF\nselection, while revealing insignificant differences in azimuth errors.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"w1DD51Hnsufs8syZy-3ksshr7K1uNcf1dY8GGtHdAOQ","pdfSize":"1498310"}
