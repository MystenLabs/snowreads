In this work, we check the spatial uniformity of Gaia\nDR3 photometry and BP/RP spectra by comparing the BP, RP and G bands photometry\nwith the synthetic ones from the BP/RP spectra. The discrepancies have a small\ndispersion of 1.07, 0.55 and 1.02 mmag for the BP, RP, and G bands,\nrespectively. However, the discrepancies exhibit obvious spatial patterns,\nwhich are clearly associated with the Gaia's scanning law. The patterns\nobserved in the BP and G bands are similar, with discrepancies between\nphotometry and spectra being more pronounced in these bands compared to the RP\nband. A further independent test with the Dark Energy Survey DR2 photometry\nreveals that the spatial patterns are more likely attributed to the Gaia DR3\nBP/RP spectra, particularly in the BP band. On one hand, our results confirm\nthe high spatial uniformity of Gaia data at the mmag level. On the other hand,\nour results suggest that the spatial uniformity of Gaia DR3 BP/RP spectra is\nnot as good as that of Gaia DR3 photometry, and could be further improved in\nthe future.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"406KUPKgPUc1G-Zmo5pOzGmEl5mrI9fGeSerjHG-Q5o","pdfSize":"4233548"}
