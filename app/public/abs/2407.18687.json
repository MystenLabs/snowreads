Traditional risk measures typically operate on\nspaces of random variables, but SRMs extend this framework to sets of random\nvariables. We establish an axiom scheme for SRMs, similar to classical risk\nmeasures but adapted for set operations. The main technical contribution is an\naxiomatic dual representation of convex SRMs by using regular, finitely\nadditive measures on the unit ball of the dual space of essentially bounded\nrandom variables. We explore worst-case SRMs, which evaluate risk as the\nsupremum of individual risks within a set, and provide a collection of examples\nillustrating the applicability of our framework to systemic risk, portfolio\noptimization, and decision-making under uncertainty. This work extends the\ntheory of risk measures to a more general and flexible setup, accommodating a\nbroader range of financial and mathematical applications.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
