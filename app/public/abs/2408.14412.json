A common approach to constructing CLFs is to consider the family\nof quadratic functions using a diagonal weighting matrix. In this paper, we\nexplore the advantages of using a larger family of quadratic functions. More\nspecifically, we consider positive-definite weighting matrices with non-zero\noff-diagonal elements (hereafter referred to as \"full\" matrices). We propose a\nnovel eigendecomposition method for parameterizing $N$-dimensional weighting\nmatrices that is easy to implement and guarantees positive-definiteness of the\nweighting matrices. We use particle swarm optimization, which is a stochastic\noptimization algorithm, to optimize the parameters and generate near-optimal\nminimum-time low-thrust trajectories. Solutions obtained using a full\npositive-definite matrix are compared to the results from the (standard)\ndiagonal weighting matrix for a number of benchmark problems. Results\ndemonstrate that improvements in optimality are achieved, especially for\nmaneuvers with large changes in orbital elements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XxGy2qxh6vyvYnvf_nDXCtxR05LyhRW59_kNln_BKdc","pdfSize":"3294131"}
