Precisely, we study inflationary models\nfrom Gauss-Bonnet hypergeometric scalar couplings via the falsification\nscenario. We first derive generalized exponential potentials from such\nhypergeometric behaviors. Then, we examine certain selected scalar potentials\nby computing the relevant cosmological quantities using the slow-roll\nmechanism. Choosing specific points in the corresponding moduli space, we\nprovide viable findings corroborated by Planck observational data and checked\nby the swampland criteria.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
