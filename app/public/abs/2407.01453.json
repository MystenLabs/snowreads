Within this framework, we derive the\ngravitational field equations and solve them for a particular model, $f(R,\n{}^*RR)=R+\\beta ({}^*RR)^2$, considering two ansatzes: the slowly rotating\nmetric and first-order perturbations of G\\\"{o}del-type metrics. For the former,\nwe find a first-order correction to the frame-dragging effect boosted by the\nparameter $L$, which characterizes the departures from general relativity\nresults. For the latter, G\\\"{o}del-type metrics hold unperturbed. We conclude\nthis paper by displaying that generalized four-dimensional Chern-Pontryagin\nmodels admit a scalar-tensor representation, whose explicit form presents two\nscalar fields: $\\Phi$, a dynamical degree of freedom, while the second,\n$\\vartheta$, a non-dynamical degree of freedom. In particular, the scalar field\n$\\vartheta$ emerges coupled with the Chern-Pontryagin topological term\n${}^*RR$, i.e., $\\vartheta {}^*RR$, which is nothing more than Chern-Simons\nterm.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
