We investigate the time dependent strength of the\ncurrent as the molecule relaxes from the D6h symmetry of the neutral to the D2h\nsymmetry of the cation due to the Jahn-Teller effect. We explore the effect of\nspontaneous symmetry breaking on persistent ring currents for benzene cation,\nbecause it is one of the most comprehensively studied examples of the\nJahn-Teller effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"APlUAmYnJxE5V0-gLeEoTliD5zh90BsMK76YEd6lTkc","pdfSize":"460798"}
