The method expresses the\ncorrection in terms of a rapidly convergent integral involving the inverse\nFourier-Bessel transform of the nuclear amplitude and a known factor containing\nthe Coulomb phase shift with form-factor corrections. The transform can be\ncalculated analytically for the exponential-type model nuclear amplitudes\ncommonly used in fits to the high-energy data at small momentum transfers, and\ngives very accurate results for the corrections. We examine the possible\neffects of the Martin zero in the real part of the nuclear amplitude, and the\naccuracy of the Bethe-West-Yennie phase approximation for the Coulomb-nuclear\ncorrections. We then apply the method to a redetermination of the ratio $\\rho$\nof the real to the imaginary parts of the forward scattering amplitude in fits\nto high-energy ISR data previously analyzed using an approximate version of the\ncorrection. The only significant changes relative the accuracy of those fits\nare at 52.8 GeV. Our method is applicable more generally, and can be used also\nat lower energies and for proton-nucleus scattering.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
