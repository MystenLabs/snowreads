Over multiple years, its\nalgorithm has been improved considerably, through the collective experiences of\nnumerous research efforts and user feedback. In this technical report, we\ndiscuss the implementation details and design choices of the current default\nalgorithm provided by Open Source Vizier. Our experiments on standardized\nbenchmarks reveal its robustness and versatility against well-established\nindustry baselines on multiple practical modes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
