The main\ntool in the proof is a parameterized version of the Nash-Moser implicit\nfunction theorem established by Donaldson and the second author. We use these\nresults to construct an abundance of new examples of $\\mathbb Z_2$-harmonic\nspinors and 1-forms. In particular, we prove that for every closed 3-manifold\n$Y$, there exist infinitely many $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-harmonic spinors with singular\nsets representing infinitely many distinct isotopy classes of embedded links,\nstrengthening an existence theorem of Doan-Walpuski. Moreover, combining this\nwith previous results, our construction implies that if $b_1(Y) > 0$, there\nexist infinitely many $\\mathrm{spin}^c$ structures on $Y$ such that the moduli\nspace of solutions to the two-spinor Seiberg-Witten equations is non-empty and\nnon-compact.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
