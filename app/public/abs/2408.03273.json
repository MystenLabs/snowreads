We demonstrate that our method has\nwell-controlled errors, stable self-consistent QM convergence, and\nenergy-conserving dynamics. We further describe an application to the catalytic\nkinetics of chorismate mutase. Using an accurate hybrid functional\nreparametrized to coupled cluster energetics, our QM/MM simulations highlight\nthe sensitivity in the calculated rate to the choice of quantum method, quantum\nregion selection, and local protein conformation. Our work is provided through\nthe open-source \\textsc{PySCF} package using acceleration from the\n\\textsc{GPU4PySCF} module.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o9hV09eXVIIk2SDyFQuvdB_ZykPJcCWbG_jXdAjp0t4","pdfSize":"4048083"}
