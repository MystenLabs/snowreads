Although we have an excellent\nunderstanding of the factors that predict participation in protest, we\nunderstand little about the conditions that foster a sustained (versus\ntransient) movement. How do interactions between supporters and authorities\ncombine to influence whether and how people engage (i.e., using conventional or\nradical tactics)? This paper introduces a novel, theoretically-founded and\nempirically-informed agent-based model (DIMESim) to address these questions. We\nmodel the complex interactions between the psychological attributes of the\nprotester (agents), the authority to whom the protests are targeted, and the\nenvironment that allows protesters to coordinate with each other -- over time,\nand at a population scale. Where an authority is responsive and failure is\ncontested, a modest sized conventional movement endured. Where authorities\nrepeatedly and incontrovertibly fail the movement, the population disengaged\nfrom action but evidenced an ongoing commitment to radicalism (latent\nradicalism).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
