Nevertheless, RFF techniques depend on the\nability to extract information from the PHY layer of the radio spectrum by\nresorting to Software Defined Radios (SDR). Previous works have highlighted the\nso-called ``Day-After-Tomorrow'' effect, i.e., an intrinsic issue of SDRs\nleading to a fingerprint mutation following a radio power cycle. In this work,\nwe extend such a study by demonstrating that fingerprint mutations appear every\ntime a new FPGA image is reloaded, i.e., when the SDR initiates a new\ncommunication. In this context, we provide an in-depth analysis of the\nreliability of RFF over multiple FPGA image reloading operations, highlighting\nits ephemeral and mutational nature. We introduce a methodology for abstracting\nfingerprint mutations into a graph and provide a theoretical framework for\nassessing fingerprint reliability. Our results show that the common assumption\nof considering the RF fingerprint as unique and always persistent is incorrect.\nBy combining real-world measurements, high-performance SDRs, and\nstate-of-the-art deep learning techniques, we experimentally demonstrate that\nradio devices feature multiple fingerprints that can be clustered according to\nshared features. Moreover, we show that the RF fingerprint is a\ntime-independent probabilistic phenomenon, which requires the collection of\nmultiple samples to achieve the necessary reliability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"WtW0wpyr5kr8nTO-N4Eyx7cGTKatSqe4wTNjUkuz0DA","pdfSize":"1501023"}
