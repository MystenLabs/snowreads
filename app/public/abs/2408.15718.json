We leave the rest of the theory completely unchanged.\nThis allows avoiding infrared -- and ultraviolet -- divergences in the\ntransition to the adiabatic limit for interacting fields and elimination of the\nfree parameters of the theory, associated with the choice of normalization in\ncomputation of the retarded and advanced parts of causal distributions\n(corresponding to the freedom in the choice of renormalization scheme). This\nenhances the predictive power of the theory, and in particular allows to derive\nnon-trivial mass relations. The approach is general and can be applied to\ninvestigate any perturbative QFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
