The success of this task is influenced by several key factors,\nincluding the accurate localization of human and object instances, as well as\nthe correct classification of object categories and interaction relationships.\nThis paper systematically summarizes and discusses the recent work in\nimage-based HOI detection. First, the mainstream datasets involved in HOI\nrelationship detection are introduced. Furthermore, starting with two-stage\nmethods and end-to-end one-stage detection approaches, this paper\ncomprehensively discusses the current developments in image-based HOI\ndetection, analyzing the strengths and weaknesses of these two methods.\nAdditionally, the advancements of zero-shot learning, weakly supervised\nlearning, and the application of large-scale language models in HOI detection\nare discussed. Finally, the current challenges in HOI detection are outlined,\nand potential research directions and future trends are explored.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
