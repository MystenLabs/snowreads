In particular, for dense design we obtain the $\\sqrt n$-rate of\nconvergence in the supremum norm without additional logarithmic factors which\ntypically occur in the results in the literature. Surprisingly, in the\ntransition from dense to sparse design the rates do not reflect the\ntwo-dimensional nature of the covariance kernel but correspond to those for\nunivariate mean function estimation. Our estimation method can make use of\nhigher-order smoothness of the covariance kernel away from the diagonal, and\ndoes not require the same smoothness on the diagonal itself. Hence, as in\nMohammadi and Panaretos (2024) we can cover covariance kernels of processes\nwith rough sample paths. Moreover, the estimator does not use mean function\nestimation to form residuals, and no smoothness assumptions on the mean have to\nbe imposed. In the dense case we also obtain a central limit theorem in the\nsupremum norm, which can be used as the basis for the construction of uniform\nconfidence sets. Simulations and real-data applications illustrate the\npractical usefulness of the methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
