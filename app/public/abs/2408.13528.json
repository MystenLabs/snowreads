By\nusing a suitable approximation procedure based on the vanishing viscosity\ntechnique and bounded data, we prove the existence of a renormalized entropy\nsolution to the underlying problem. The uniqueness of the solution is settled\nby adapting Kru\\v{z}kov's doubling the variables technique in the presence of\nnoise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
