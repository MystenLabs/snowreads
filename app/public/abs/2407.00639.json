Good\nquality in the R-band light curve is obtained, covering 0.32-19.57 days since\nthe Fermi-GBM trigger. We find that a weak bump emerges fromthe declining\nafterglow at $t \\approx 11$ days; a supernova (SN) may be responsible. We use a\nsmooth broken power-law and $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ model to fit the light curve.\nThe best-fitting results reveal that the SN ejected a total mass of\n$M_\\mathrm{ej} = 3.70 M_\\odot$, a $^{56}\\mathrm{Ni}$ mass of $M_\\mathrm{Ni} =\n0.23 M_\\odot$, and a kinetic energy of $E_\\mathrm{SN,K} = 2.35 \\times 10^{52}\n\\mathrm{erg}$. We also compare GRB 221009A with other GRB-SN events based on a\nGRB-associated SN sample, and find that only SN 2003lw and SN 2011kl can be\nobviously revealed in the afterglow of GRB 221009A by setting these objects at\nits distance. This suggests that a supernova (SN 2022xiw) is possibly obscured\nby the brighter afterglow emission from GRB 221009A.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
