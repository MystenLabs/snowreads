The key challenge in designing this system lies in optimizing parameters\nto enable the haptic device to generate force feedback that closely replicates\nthe most intense force produced by direct water jets while ensuring the user\nremains dry. In this paper, we present the key design parameters of the JetUnit\nwearable device determined through a set of quantitative experiments and a\nperception study. We further conducted a user study to assess the impact of\nintegrating our haptic solutions into virtual reality experiences. The results\nrevealed that, by adhering to the design principles of JetUnit, the water-based\nhaptic system is capable of delivering diverse force feedback sensations,\nsignificantly enhancing the immersive experience in virtual reality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R6h3NLULHO0X4R1ea_hJZ1nuh4FjoKJ6oMTTlx5yzZA","pdfSize":"12947577"}
