Then\nwe report an observation of a character of the topological transition as a\npercolation of the sign of the Berry curvature. The Berry curvature F has peaks\nat the Dirac points, enabling us to divide the Brillouin zone into two regions\ndepending on the sign of the F: one with the same sign with a peak and the\nother with the opposite sign. We observed that when the Chern number is\nnon-zero, the oppositely signed regions are localized. In contrast, in the case\nof a trivial topology, the oppositely signed regions are delocalized\ndominantly. Therefore, the oppositely signed region will percolate under the\ntopological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial. We checked this for\nseveral models including the Haldane model, the extended Haldane model, and the\nQWZ model. Our observation may serve as a novel feature of the topological\nphase transition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
