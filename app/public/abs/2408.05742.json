We have adopted the successful $\\Gamma_2$\nmodular invariant model by Meloni-Parriciatu as the flavor symmetry of leptons.\nSuppose the anomaly of $(g-2)_{\\mu}$, $\\Delta a_{\\mu}$ to be evidence of New\nPhysics (NP), we have related it with the anomalous magnetic moment of the\nelectron $\\Delta a_e$, the electron EDM $d_e$ and the $\\mu\\to e \\gamma$ decay.\nWe found that the NP contributions to $\\Delta a_{e(\\mu)}$ are proportional to\nthe lepton masses squared likewise the naive scaling $\\Delta a_\\ell \\propto\nm^2_\\ell$. The experimental constraint of $|d_e|$ is much tight compared with\nthe one from the branching ratio $\\mathcal{B}(\\mu \\to e \\gamma)$ in our\nframework. Supposing the phase of our model parameter $\\delta_{\\alpha}$ for the\nelectron to be of order one, we have estimated the upper-bound of\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\mu \\to e \\gamma)$, which is at most $10^{-21}-10^{-20}$. If the\nmodel parameters $\\delta_{\\alpha}$, $\\delta_{\\beta}$ (for muon) and\n$\\delta_{\\gamma}$ (for tauon) are real, leptonic EDMs vanish since the CP phase\nof the modular form due to modulus $\\tau$ does not contribute to the EDM.\nHowever, we can obtain $\\mathcal{B}(\\mu \\to e \\gamma)\\simeq 10^{-13}$ with\nnon-vanishing $d_e$, that is the case, only $\\delta_{\\alpha}$ is real while the\nothers are complex. Then, the imaginary part of $\\delta_{\\beta}$ can lead to\n$d_e$ in the next-to-leading contribution. The predicted electron EDM is below\n$10^{-32}$e\\,cm, while $\\mathcal{B}(\\mu \\to e \\gamma)$ is close to the\nexperimental upper-bound. The predicted upper-bound of $|d_\\mu|$ is rather\nlarge, around $10^{-23}$e\\,cm and of $|d_\\tau|$ is $ 10^{-22}$e\\,cm. The\nbranching ratios of $\\tau\\to e\\gamma$ and $\\tau\\to \\mu\\gamma$ are also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
