The main novelty of our approach lies in\nestablishing a close relation between the problem under consideration and the\nasymptotic behavior of the Dirichlet heat content of $\\Omega$. By using this\nrelation we deduce a two-term asymptotic expansion of the principle eigenvalue\nand discuss several applications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jaoBq_aOKvhZglJu6hANTYXWReV6GlplzDh1xbg1pxI","pdfSize":"183653"}
