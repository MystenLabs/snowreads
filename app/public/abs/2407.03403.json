Using an iterative\nprocess, we systematically construct the $L$-loop color space of four-point\namplitudes of fields in the adjoint representation of SU($N$), SO($N$), or\nSp($N$). We define the null space as the orthogonal complement of the color\nspace. For SU($N$), we confirm the existence of four independent null vectors\n(for $L \\ge 2$) and for SO($N$) and Sp($N$), we establish the existence of\nseventeen independent null vectors (for $L \\ge 5$). Each null vector\ncorresponds to a group-theory constraint on the color-ordered amplitudes of the\ngauge theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
