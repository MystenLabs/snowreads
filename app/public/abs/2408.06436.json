In this paper\nwe introduce a solution to these limitations by proposing open WGM (OWGM)\nresonators that effectively reduce the mode density and enable directional\nradiation through a connected waveguide at the expense of some lowering in\nQ-factor. Numerical simulations of two-dimensional metallic and dielectric disk\nresonators with holes reveal a significant increase in intermode distance. The\nstudy also extends to three-dimensional dielectric OWGM resonators,\ndemonstrating the formation of sparse spectra suitable for photonics\napplications. Additionally, the design of a cylindrical Bragg microresonator\nconnected to a single-mode fiber via an optimized topology-based connector\nachieves near-unity transmission and efficient coupling. This approach enhances\nthe development of new photonic devices, addressing the limitations of\ntraditional high Q-factor WGM resonators and offering potential advancements in\nlaser technology and optical communications, where compactness and\nmanufacturability are prioritized over ultra-high Q-factors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
