A prominent\nmethodology for modeling safety and security are attack-fault trees (AFTs),\nwhich combine the well-established fault tree and attack tree methodologies for\nsafety and security, respectively. AFTs can be used for quantitative analysis\nas well, capturing the interplay between safety and security metrics. However,\nexisting approaches are based on modeling the AFT as a priced-timed automaton.\nThis allows for a wide range of analyses, but Pareto analsis is still lacking,\nand analyses that exist are computationally expensive. In this paper, we\ncombine safety and security analysis techniques to introduce a novel method to\nfind the Pareto front between the metrics reliability (safety) and attack cost\n(security) using Markov decision processes. This gives us the full interplay\nbetween safety and security while being considerably more lightweight and\nfaster than the automaton approach. We validate our approach on a case study of\ncyberattacks on an oil pipe line.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
