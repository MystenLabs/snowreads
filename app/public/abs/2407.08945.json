We\ncheck the energy conditions for different values of the new parameter that\nHarada introduced, as alternative for dark energy. We examine the radial\nacceleration to reveal the attractive and repulsive characteristics of the\nthin-shell wormhole throat. We consider the dynamics and stability of the\nwormhole around the static solutions of the linearized radial perturbations at\nthe wormhole throat. Finally, we determine the regions of stability by applying\nthe concavity test on the ''speed of sound'' as a function in the throat radius\nand other spacetime parameters, particularly the new Harada parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
