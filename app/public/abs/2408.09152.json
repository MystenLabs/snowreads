If $P(x)$ has only real\nroots, then it is called real-rooted. It is well-known that the conditions of\nlog-concavity, ultra log-concavity and real-rootedness are ever-stronger.\n  For a graph $G$, a dependent set is a set of vertices which is not\nindependent, i.e., the set of vertices whose induced subgraph contains at least\none edge. The dependence polynomial of $G$ is defined as $D(G,\nx):=\\sum\\limits_{k\\geqslant 0}d_k(G)x^k$, where $d_k(G)$ is the number of\ndependent sets of size $k$ in $G$. Horrocks proved that $D(G, x)$ is\nlog-concave for every graph $G$ [J. Combin. Theory, Ser. B, 84 (2002)\n180--185]. In the present paper, we prove that, for a graph $G$, $D(G, x)$ is\nultra log-concave if $G$ is $(K_2\\cup 2K_1)$-free or contains an independent\nset of size $|V(G)|-2$, and give the characterization of graphs whose\ndependence polynomials are real-rooted. Finally, we focus more attention to the\nproblems of log-concavity about independence systems and pose several\nconjectures closely related the famous Mason's Conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
