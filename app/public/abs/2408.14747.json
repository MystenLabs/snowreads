However, the transfer of\nthese trained models to real-world tasks often presents unavoidable challenges.\nThis research explores the direct training of RL algorithms in controlled yet\nrealistic real-world settings for the execution of dexterous manipulation. The\nbenchmarking results of three RL algorithms trained on intricate in-hand\nmanipulation tasks within practical real-world contexts are presented. Our\nstudy not only demonstrates the practicality of RL training in authentic\nreal-world scenarios, facilitating direct real-world applications, but also\nprovides insights into the associated challenges and considerations.\nAdditionally, our experiences with the employed experimental methods are\nshared, with the aim of empowering and engaging fellow researchers and\npractitioners in this dynamic field of robotics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
