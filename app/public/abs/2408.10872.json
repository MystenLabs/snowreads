This\npaper presents an approach using Vision Language Models (VLMs) for road safety\nassessment, overcoming the limitations of traditional Convolutional Neural\nNetworks (CNNs). We introduce a new task ,V-RoAst (Visual question answering\nfor Road Assessment), with a real-world dataset. Our approach optimizes prompt\nengineering and evaluates advanced VLMs, including Gemini-1.5-flash and\nGPT-4o-mini. The models effectively examine attributes for road assessment.\nUsing crowdsourced imagery from Mapillary, our scalable solution influentially\nestimates road safety levels. In addition, this approach is designed for local\nstakeholders who lack resources, as it does not require training data. It\noffers a cost-effective and automated methods for global road safety\nassessments, potentially saving lives and reducing economic burdens.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P7AgGd_jx85L35kgsQb8hYHipdhFVauTqWwlLCUbMCA","pdfSize":"6903862"}
