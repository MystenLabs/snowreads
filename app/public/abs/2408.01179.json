The C2.8 flare\nshows three successive and repetitive pulsations in soft X-ray (SXR) and\nhigh-temperature extreme ultraviolet (EUV) emissions, which may imply three\nepisodes of energy releases during the solar flare. The QPP period is estimated\nto be as long as about 7.5 minutes. EUV imaging observations suggest that these\nthree pulsations come from the same flare area dominated by the hot loop\nsystem. Conversely, the flare radiation in wavelengths of radio/microwave,\nlow-temperature EUV, ultraviolet (UV), and Ha only reveals the first pulsation,\nwhich may be associated with nonthermal electrons accelerated by magnetic\nreconnection. The other two pulsations in wavelengths of SXR and\nhigh-temperature EUV might be caused by the loop-loop interaction. Our\nobservations indicate that the three episodes of energy releases during the\nC2.8 flare are triggered by different mechanisms, namely the accelerated\nelectron via magnetic reconnection, and the loop-loop interaction in a\ncomplicated magnetic configuration.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
