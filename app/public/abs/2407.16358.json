We show that a construction via global\nsections of a natural cosheaf of A$_\\infty$ categories on a Lagrangian core of\nthe surface is equivalent to a global construction via the (equivariant) orbit\ncategory of a smooth cover. We therefore establish the local-to-global\nproperties of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of orbifold surfaces closely\nparalleling a proposal by Kontsevich for Fukaya categories of smooth Weinstein\nmanifolds.\n  From the viewpoint of Weinstein sectorial descent in the sense of Ganatra,\nPardon and Shende, our results show that orbifold surfaces also have Weinstein\nsectors of type $\\mathrm D$ besides the type $\\mathrm A$ or type\n$\\widetilde{\\mathrm A}$ sectors on smooth surfaces.\n  We describe the global sections of the cosheaf explicitly for any generator\ngiven by an admissible dissection of the orbifold surface and we give a full\nclassification of the formal generators which arise in this way. This shows in\nparticular that the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface\ncan always be described as the perfect derived category of a graded associative\nalgebra. We conjecture that associative algebras obtained from dissections of\norbifold surfaces form a new class of associative algebras closed under derived\nequivalence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
