This problem was motivated by a conjecture due to\nGriggs, which equivalently states that the incomparability graph of the boolean\nalgebra $B_n$ is nice. Stanley introduced the idea of studying the nice\nproperty of a graph by investigating the Schur positivity of its corresponding\nchromatic symmetric functions. Since the boolean algebras form a special class\nof distributive lattices, Stanley raised the question of whether the\nincomparability graph of any distributive lattice is Schur positive. Stanley\nfurther noted that this seems quite unlikely. In this paper, we construct a\nfamily of distributive lattices which are not nice and hence not Schur\npositive. We also provide a family of distributive lattices which are nice but\nnot Schur positive.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
