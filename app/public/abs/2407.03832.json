We\nprove that the time function of a burning is a graph map to a path graph.\nAfterwards, we define a category whose objects are graph burnings and morphisms\nare graph maps which commute with the time functions of the burnings. In this\ncategory we study relations between burnings of different graphs and, in\nparticular, between burnings of a graph and its subgraphs. For every graph, we\ndefine a simplicial complex, arising from the set of all the burnings, which we\ncall a configuration space of the burnings. Further, simplicial structure of\nthe configuration space gives burning homology of the graph. We describe\nproperties of the configuration space and the burning homology theory. In\nparticular, we prove that the one-dimensional skeleton of the configuration\nspace of a graph $G$ coincides with the complement graph of $G$. The results\nare illustrated with numerous examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
