Problem $1\\mid r_j\\mid\\sum w_j U_j$ generalizes both Knapsack\nand Partition, and the simplified setting without release dates was studied by\nHermelin et al. [Annals of Operations Research, 2021] from a parameterized\ncomplexity viewpoint.\n  Our main contribution is a thorough complexity analysis of $1\\mid r_j\\mid\\sum\nw_j U_j$ in terms of four key problem parameters: the number $p_\\#$ of\nprocessing times, the number $w_\\#$ of weights, the number $d_\\#$ of due dates,\nand the number $r_\\#$ of release dates of the jobs. $1\\mid r_j\\mid\\sum w_j U_j$\nis known to be weakly para-NP-hard even if $w_\\#+d_\\#+r_\\#$ is constant, and\nHeeger and Hermelin [ESA, 2024] recently showed (weak) W[1]-hardness\nparameterized by $p_\\#$ or $w_\\#$ even if $r_\\#$ is constant.\n  Algorithmically, we show that $1\\mid r_j\\mid\\sum w_j U_j$ is fixed-parameter\ntractable parameterized by $p_\\#$ combined with any two of the remaining three\nparameters $w_\\#$, $d_\\#$, and $r_\\#$. We further provide pseudo-polynomial\nXP-time algorithms for parameter $r_\\#$ and $d_\\#$. To complement these\nalgorithms, we show that $1\\mid r_j\\mid\\sum w_j U_j$ is (strongly) W[1]-hard\nwhen parameterized by $d_\\#+r_\\#$ even if $w_\\#$ is constant. Our results\nprovide a nearly complete picture of the complexity of $1\\mid r_j\\mid\\sum w_j\nU_j$ for $p_\\#$, $w_\\#$, $d_\\#$, and $r_\\#$ as parameters, and extend those of\nHermelin et al.
