However, commonly available prior maps are still tailored to\ncontrol-and-decision tasks, and the use of these maps for localization remains\nlargely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we propose a lidar-based localization\nand mapping (LOAM) system that can exploit the common HD-maps in autonomous\ndriving scenarios. Specifically, we propose a technique to extract information\nfrom the drivable area and ground surface height components of the HD-maps to\nconstruct 4DOF pose priors. These pose priors are then further integrated into\nthe pose-graph optimization problem to create a globally consistent 3D map.\nExperiments show that our scheme can significantly improve the global\nconsistency of the map compared to state-of-the-art lidar-only approaches,\nproven to be a useful technology to enhance the system's robustness, especially\nin GPS-denied environment. Moreover, our work also serves as a first step\ntowards long-term navigation of robots in familiar environment, by updating a\nmap. In autonomous driving this could enable updating the HD-maps without\nsourcing a new from a third party company, which is expensive and introduces\ndelays from change in the world to updated map.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
