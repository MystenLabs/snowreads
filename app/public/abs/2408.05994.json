Here we present the theory of two-photon absorption\n(TPA) of focused optical vortices by chiral molecules: nonlinear vortex\ndichroism (NVD). We discover that highly distinct features arise in the case of\nTPA with focused vortex beams, including the ability to probe chiral molecular\nstructure not accessible to current methods and that the differential rate of\nTPA is significantly influenced by the orientation of the state of linear\npolarization. This work provides strong evidence that combining nonlinear\noptical activity with structured light provides new and improved routes to\nstudying molecular chirality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"am66pWGV6by-Us88OdJp9Hhn6Yhtz1WQp5a3A9AlLkQ","pdfSize":"7671756"}
