It is discerned that variations in thermodynamic\nquantities at the critical temperature do not exclusively align with pairing\nphase transitions. The presence of an S-shaped heat capacity curve, often\ninterpreted as an indication of such transitions, does not offer a definitive\nconfirmation. Additional factors, including the blocking effect, can modify the\nheat capacity curve and impede the transition process. The pairing phase\ntransition in 161Dy, occurring around 0.7 to 1.0 MeV, is unequivocally\ncharacterized as a first-order transition. Furthermore, an exploration into the\nimpact of varying strengths of pairing correlations on these transitions\nreveals a nonlinear relationship, adding complexity to the transition dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
