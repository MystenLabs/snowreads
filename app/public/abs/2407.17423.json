Given a set of color points, the\nproposed initialization extracts dominant colors that are the most vivid and\ndistinguishable colors. Color points closest to the dominant colors are\nselected as initial centroids in the FCM. To obtain the dominant colors and\ntheir closest color points, we introduce reference colors and define a fuzzy\nmembership model between a color point and a reference color.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zMoYxTGEXiac-8XvRauVukMORoGhFnFVEFglFjX5YIQ","pdfSize":"139712"}
