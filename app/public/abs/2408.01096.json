One of the earliest examples of Jeongganbo, a Korean\nmusical notation system, the remaining version only consists of a rudimentary\nmelody. Our research team, commissioned by the National Gugak (Korean\nTraditional Music) Center, aimed to transform this old melody into a\nperformable arrangement for a six-part ensemble. Using Jeongganbo data acquired\nthrough bespoke optical music recognition, we trained a BERT-like masked\nlanguage model and an encoder-decoder transformer model. We also propose an\nencoding scheme that strictly follows the structure of Jeongganbo and denotes\nnote durations as positions. The resulting machine-transformed version of\nChihwapyeong and Chwipunghyeong were evaluated by experts and performed by the\nCourt Music Orchestra of National Gugak Center. Our work demonstrates that\ngenerative models can successfully be applied to traditional music with limited\ntraining data if combined with careful design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q5llqVsekaheWqL-IOUwbnPgLpmy6iktor_8h2J-nRg","pdfSize":"1601283"}
