While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR)\nhave introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing),\nthey typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby\nlimiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands\nconsiderable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges,\nwe introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and\nvisually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for\ncomplicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based\nself-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion\nmodel to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean,\naesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues\nfrom the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study\nthis problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic\nimages from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can\neffectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves\nas an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct\napplications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in\ngeneral.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-HfhsyYyHLvqRxNtmNmWhPQlnM5ymgcuW5mrna-KsW8","pdfSize":"17660359"}
