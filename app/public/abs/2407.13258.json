However, very\nlittle is known with certainty about TDD's underlying foundations, i.e., the\nway TDD works. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for TDD, with\nthe following characteristics: 1) Each TDD cycle represents a vertical slice of\na (probably also small) user story, 2) vertical slices are captured using\ncontracts, implicit in the developers' minds, and 3) the code created during a\nTDD cycle is a sliced-based specification of a code oracle, using the contracts\nas slicing pre/post-conditions. We have checked the connections among TDD,\ncontracts, and slices using a controlled experiment conducted in the industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
