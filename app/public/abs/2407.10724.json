Unfortunately, this is not\nalways possible to perform formally in highly complex problems. We propose a\nmethodology to extract the similarity variables of a self-similar physical\nprocess directly from data, without prior knowledge of the governing equations\nor boundary conditions, based on an optimization problem and symbolic\nregression. We analyze the accuracy and robustness of our method in four\nproblems which have been influential in fluid mechanics research: a laminar\nboundary layer, Burger's equation, a turbulent wake, and a collapsing cavity.\nOur analysis considers datasets acquired via both numerical and wind-tunnel\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
