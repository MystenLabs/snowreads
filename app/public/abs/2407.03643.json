The first eigenfunction admits a Fourier--Gegenbauer\nseries expansion via the bispherical coordinates, where the\nDirichlet-to-Neumann operator on $\\Gamma_S$ can be recursively expressed in\nterms of the expansion coefficients arXiv:2309.09587. In this paper, we develop\na finite section approach for the Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator to approximate\nthe first Steklov--Dirichlet eigenvalue on eccentric spherical shells. We prove\nthe exponential convergence of this approach by using the variational\ncharacterization of the first eigenvalue. Furthermore, based on the convergence\nresult, we propose a numerical computation scheme as an extension of the\ntwo-dimensional result in [Hong et al., Ann. Mat. Pura Appl., 2022] to general\ndimensions. We provide numerical examples of the first Steklov-Dirichlet\neigenvalue on eccentric spherical shells with various geometric configurations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
