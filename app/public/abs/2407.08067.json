With the\ngrowing ability for modern large language models (LLMs) to role-play, one can\napply LLMs as Wizards in WoZ experiments with better scalability and lower cost\nthan the traditional approach. However, methodological guidance on responsibly\napplying LLMs in WoZ experiments and a systematic evaluation of LLMs'\nrole-playing ability are lacking. Through two LLM-powered WoZ studies, we take\nthe first step towards identifying an experiment lifecycle for researchers to\nsafely integrate LLMs into WoZ experiments and interpret data generated from\nsettings that involve Wizards role-played by LLMs. We also contribute a\nheuristic-based evaluation framework that allows the estimation of LLMs'\nrole-playing ability in WoZ experiments and reveals LLMs' behavior patterns at\nscale.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
