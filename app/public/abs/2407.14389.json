Yet, MnTe was demonstrated experimentally to have no\nmeasurable stray fields and yet controllable by external magnetic filed - a\nwin-win situation. In this paper we unravel the microscopic mechanism of this\nproperty. It appear to emerge from concerted action of three different\nmechanisms. Microscopic understanding of the beneficial properties of MnTe\nopens a road to controllable design of similar altermagnets for spintronics\napplications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HTlnhN7HXv3ylU7glE3IbJgUmtUGV10IMmqguVAw33Q","pdfSize":"2453856"}
