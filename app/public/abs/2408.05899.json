Despite the successes, the safety and interpretability of QML\napplications have not been thoroughly investigated. This work proposes using\nVariational Quantum Circuits (VQCs) for activation mapping to enhance model\ntransparency, introducing the Quantum Gradient Class Activation Map\n(QGrad-CAM). This hybrid quantum-classical computing framework leverages both\nquantum and classical strengths and gives access to the derivation of an\nexplicit formula of feature map importance. Experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant, fine-grained, class-discriminative visual explanations generated\nacross both image and speech datasets.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
