This suggests that the analysis of the\nspectrum on flat background is hindered by strong coupling effects.\n  Such undesirable symmetries are absent already at the leading nontrivial\norder in perturbations on non-flat backgrounds, e.g. de Sitter spacetime, which\nare the appropriate ones for studying the particle dynamics of all these\ntheories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
