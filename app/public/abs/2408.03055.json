This part\nfocuses on the effectiveness of FDA scattered wave (FDA-SW) jamming on the\nspace-time adaptive processing (STAP) for airborne phased-MIMO radar.\nDistinguished from the clutter signals, the ground equidistant scatterers of\nFDA-SW jamming constitute an elliptical ring, whose trajectory equations are\nmathematically derived to further determine the spatial frequency and Doppler\nfrequency. For the phased-MIMO radar with different transmitting partitions,\nthe effects of jamming frequency offset of FDA-SW on the clutter rank and STAP\nperformance are discussed. Theoretical analysis provides the variation interval\nof clutter rank and the relationship between the jamming frequency offset and\nthe improvement factor (IF) notch of phased-MIMO-STAP. Importantly, the\nrequirements of jamming frequency offset for both two-part applications are\ndiscussed in this part. Numerical results verify these mathematical findings\nand validate the effectiveness of the proposed FDA jamming in countering the\nphased-MIMO radar.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
