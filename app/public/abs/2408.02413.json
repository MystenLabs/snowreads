Suppose lines have size s + 1. Then we\nclassify all sets of size s + 1 with the property that no object of opposite\ntype in the corresponding building, is opposite every point of the set. It\nturns out that such sets are either lines, or hyperbolic lines in suitable\nresidues isomorphic to (symplectic) generalised quadrangles (where the\nrestriction in parentheses only holds for rank at least 3; if $\\Gamma$ has rank\n2 then any hyperbolic line of size s + 1 does the job). This is a far-reaching\nextension of a famous and fundamental result of Bose & Burton in the 1960s.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5UZEng0MDOVw1kIY_370cEO7c0vd7dS9uT4pYJJP2sg","pdfSize":"201532","txDigest":"EudutEns6aJy8PL3258navcKPSq1USha8eaHaQt6EVDk","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
