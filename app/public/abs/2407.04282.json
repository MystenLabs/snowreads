It is\nwell-known that there are $n$-vertex graphs with outerplanarity\n$\\tfrac{n}{6}+\\Theta(1)$, and not difficult to show that the outerplanarity can\nnever be bigger. We give here improved bounds of the form\n$\\tfrac{n}{2g}+2g+O(1)$, where $g$ is the fence-girth, i.e., the length of the\nshortest cycle with vertices on both sides. This parameter $g$ is at least the\nconnectivity of the graph, and often bigger; for example, our results imply\nthat planar bipartite graphs have outerplanarity $\\tfrac{n}{8}+O(1)$. We also\nshow that the outerplanarity of a planar graph $G$ is at most\n$\\tfrac{1}{2}$diam$(G)+O(\\sqrt{n})$, where diam$(G)$ is the diameter of the\ngraph. All our bounds are tight up to smaller-order terms, and a planar\nembedding that achieves the outerplanarity bound can be found in linear time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
