However, as LLMs evolve, it\nbecomes challenging to construct evaluation benchmarks for them with accurate\nlabels on hard tasks that approach the boundaries of human capabilities. To\ncredibly conduct evaluation without accurate labels (denoted as poor-supervised\nevaluation), we propose the PoEM framework. We first prove that the capability\nof a model can be equivalently assessed by the consistency between it and\ncertain reference model, when their prediction distributions are independent\nand the sample size is infinite. To alleviate the insufficiencies of the\nconditions in reality, we further introduce an algorithm that treats humans\n(when available) and the models under evaluation as reference models,\nalternately conducting model weights calibration and filtering during E-step\nand M-step. Comprehensive experiments across 3 types of tasks with 16\nmainstream LLMs have shown that PoEM under poor supervision can achieve an\naverage of 0.98 Pearson correlation coefficient with supervised evaluation\nresults, demonstrating good effectiveness, efficiency and generalizability.\nMore generally, PoEM has advanced the evaluation paradigm evolution from\nhuman-centric to human&model-centric by treating both of them as reference\nmodels, mitigating the limitations of human evaluation in the era of LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wchwC44XnX43PhPY6cjp30acefypiBpboq1zbQO2jg4","pdfSize":"704568"}
