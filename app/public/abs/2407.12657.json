We observe that, when gravitational\nand matter action are expanded to quadratic order in gravitational\nperturbations on cosmological backgrounds, the graviton appears to have an\noff-shell mass. We derive a consistent set of two equations for the evolution\nof linear classical and quantum gravitational perturbations on general\ncosmological backgrounds, and demonstrate that the graviton mass disappears at\nthe level of equations of motion (on-shell). In the case we consider the\nexpansion of the Universe is driven by the one-loop backreaction of fermions,\nand the dynamical gravitons evolve on the same background. These equations\ngovern the evolution of linear gravitational perturbations on general\ncosmological matter backgrounds. A concrete one-loop calculation is performed\nfor the simple case of massive Dirac fermions when the temperature of the\ncosmological fluid changes adiabatically when compared with the expansion rate\nof the Universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U6gV_R4zo6fK26IOCHZO6Y9k_dia80ubP3cjvu97QCA","pdfSize":"833852"}
