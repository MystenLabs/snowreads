We report, for the first time, on the\nexistence of a critical height h$_\\mathrm{c}$, which marks the onset of\nvelocity dispersion inside the CME. This height for the studied events lies\nbetween 1.4-1.8 R$_{\\odot}$, in the inner corona. We find the critical heights\nto be relatively higher for gradual CMEs, as compared to impulsive ones,\nindicating that the early initiation of these two classes might be different\nphysically. We find several interesting imprints of the velocity dispersion on\nCME kinematics. The critical height is strongly correlated with the flux-rope\nminor radius and the mass of the CME. Also, the magnitude of velocity\ndispersion shows a reasonable positive correlation with the above two\nparameters. We believe these results will advance our understanding of CME\ninitiation mechanisms and will help provide improved constraints to CME\ninitiation models.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
