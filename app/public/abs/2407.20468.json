The second result is that for any prime p where E has\ngood ordinary reduction, there is a finite extension K of F, depending on p and\nE, such that T_K(A)/p is non-zero.\n  Much of this work was joint with Jacob Murre, and the article is dedicated to\nhis memory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
