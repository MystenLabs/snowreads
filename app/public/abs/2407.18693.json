The ability to predict the occurrence of\ntipping points from time series data remains an outstanding challenge and a\nmajor interest in a broad range of research fields. Particularly, the widely\nused methods based on bifurcation theory are neither reliable in prediction\naccuracy nor applicable for irregularly-sampled time series which are commonly\nobserved from real-world systems. Here we address this challenge by developing\na deep learning algorithm for predicting the occurrence of tipping points in\nuntrained systems, by exploiting information about normal forms. Our algorithm\nnot only outperforms traditional methods for regularly-sampled model time\nseries but also achieves accurate predictions for irregularly-sampled model\ntime series and empirical time series. Our ability to predict tipping points\nfor complex systems paves the way for mitigation risks, prevention of\ncatastrophic failures, and restoration of degraded systems, with broad\napplications in social science, engineering, and biology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
