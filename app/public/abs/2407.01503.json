In this work, we introduce a\nphysical measure of uniformity based on the distribution of distances between\npoints, as an alternative to commonly adopted measures based on interaction\npotentials. We then use this new measure of uniformity to characterize several\nalgorithms available in the literature. We also study the effect of optimizing\nthe position of the points through the minimization of different interaction\npotentials via a gradient descent procedure. In this way, we can classify\ndifferent algorithms and interaction potentials to find the one that generates\nthe most uniform distribution of points on the sphere.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
