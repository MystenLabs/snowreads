We execute this\nidea for chains of $GL_n$-equivariant modules over an infinite field $k$ of\npositive characteristic. We prove the Le--Nagel--Nguyen--R\\\"omer conjectures\nfor such sequences and obtain stability patterns in their resolutions as\ncorollaries of our main result, which is a semiorthogonal decomposition for the\nbounded derived category of $GL_{\\infty}$-equivariant modules over $S = k[x_1,\nx_2, \\ldots, x_n, \\ldots]$. Our method relies on finite generation results for\ncertain local cohomology modules. We also outline approaches (i) to investigate\nKoszul duality for $S$-modules taking the Frobenius homomorphism (of\n$GL_{\\infty}$) into account, and (ii) to recover and extend Murai's results\nabout free resolutions of symmetric monomial ideals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
