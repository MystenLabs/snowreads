The two common assumptions on interacting\nparticle systems are uniform bounds on degrees and jump rates. However, in this\npaper, we relax these assumptions and allow for vertices with high degrees or\nrapid jumps. We introduce new assumptions that ensure that such vertices are\nplaced sufficiently apart from each other and hence the process does not\nexplode. Our proofs use graphical construction involving an analysis of certain\nsubsets of the set of all self-avoiding walks on the $2$-step graph of the\nunderlying graph. For some random graph models, if the jump rates are bounded\nby powers of vertex degrees, we give readily verifiable sufficient conditions\non the underlying graph itself, under which our assumptions hold almost surely.\nThese conditions involve exponential growth of the average number of\nself-avoiding walks from each vertex and that of moments of the vertex degrees.\nUsing these conditions, we show the existence of interacting particle systems\nlike sandpile models on random graphs such as the long-range percolation model\nand the geometric random graph -- models which lack uniform bounds on degrees\nand jump rates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
