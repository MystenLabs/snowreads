We propose an algorithm for updating a decision\ntree while minimising the number of changes to the tree that a human would need\nto audit. We achieve this via a greedy approach that incorporates the number of\nchanges to the tree as part of the objective function. We compare our algorithm\nto existing methods and show that it sits in a sweet spot between final\naccuracy and number of changes to audit.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
