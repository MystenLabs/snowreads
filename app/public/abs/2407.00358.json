Motivated\nby recent work suggesting the need to introduce higher order operators to\nstabilise unregulated potentials, as well as by work indicating that such terms\ncan have significant effects on observable predictions, we explicitly construct\ncorrected versions of the quadratic hilltop potential that are motivated by an\neffective field theory expansion. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\nmethods and optimization techniques to sample viable models and minimize $r$.\nWe find that such potentials can readily lower $r$ values below projected\nCMB-S4 sensitivity, while still remaining within observable constraints on\n$n_s$. Furthermore, we find that the minimum $r$ reached for each order of the\nexpansion considered is well-described by a power law $r_{min}(q) \\propto\nq^{-B}$ before asymptoting to a value of $r_{min} \\sim 10^{-11}$, where $q$ is\nthe order to which the expansion of $V(\\phi)$ is carried out.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
