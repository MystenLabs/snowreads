These models consider a\nstochastic environment influencing each decision maker's choices. Extensive\nresearch has shown that the agents' socioeconomic characteristics, the chosen\noptions' properties, and the conditions characterizing the decision-making\nenvironment all impact these models. However, the complex interactions between\nthese factors, confidentiality concerns, time constraints, and costs, have made\nreal experimentation impractical and undesirable. To address this, simulations\nhave gained significant popularity among academics, allowing the study of these\nmodels in a controlled setting using simulated data. This paper presents\nmultidisciplinary research to bridge the gap between DCMs, experimental design,\nand simulation. By reviewing related literature, the authors explore these\ninterconnected areas. We then introduce a simulation method integrated with\nexperimental design to generate synthetic data based on behavioral models of\nagents. A utility function is used to describe the developed simulation tool.\nThe paper investigates the discrepancy between simulated data and real-world\ndata.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
