Before running out of\nviable nuclear fuel, they can reach a thermodynamic state where\nelectron-positron pair-production robs them of radiation support, triggering\ntheir collapse. Thermonuclear explosion(s) in the core ensue. These have long\nbeen predicted to result in either repeated episodic mass loss (pulsational\npair instability), which reduces the mass available to eventually form a black\nhole, or, if sufficient energy is generated, the complete unbinding of all\nstellar material in one single explosive episode (pair instability supernova),\nwhich leaves behind no black hole. Despite theoretical agreement among\nmodelers, the wide variety of predicted signatures and the rarity of very\nhigh-mass stellar progenitors have so far resulted in a lack of observational\nconfirmation. Nevertheless, because of the impact of pair instability evolution\non black hole masses relevant to gravitational-wave astronomy, as well as the\npresent and upcoming expanded capabilities of time-domain astronomy and high\nredshift spectroscopy, interest in these explosion remains high. We review the\ncurrent understanding of pair instability evolution, with particular emphasis\non the known uncertainties. We also summarize the existing claimed\nelectromagnetic counterparts and discuss prospects for future direct and\nindirect searches.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
