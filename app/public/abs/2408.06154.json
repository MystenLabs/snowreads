Nowadays, several\ntypes of impedance matched parametric amplifiers have been proposed: the first\nis an impedance-matched parametric amplifier based on a Klopfenstein taper, and\nthe second is an impedance-matched parametric amplifier based on auxiliary\nresonators. Here, we present the quantum-limited 3-wave-mixing lumped-element\nSNAIL parametric amplifier with two-units impedance matching transformer. A\ntwo-pole Chebyshev matching network with shunted resonators based on\nparallel-plate capacitors and superconducting planar coil. Operating in a\nflux-pumped mode, we experimentally demonstrate an average gain of $15dB$\nacross a $600MHz$ bandwidth, along with an average saturation power of\n$-107dBm$ and quantum-limited noise temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
