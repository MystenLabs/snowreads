Rev. Lett., Vol. 111(13) (2013)1 ] describes\nthe self-organization of vascular networks for transport of fluids from source\nto sinks. Diameters, and thereby conductances, of vessel segments evolve so as\nto minimize a cost functional E. The cost is the trade-off between the power\nrequired for pumping the fluid and the energy consumption for vessel\nmaintenance. The model has been used to show emergence of cyclic structures in\nthe presence of locally fluctuating demand, i.e. non-constant net flow at sink\nnodes. Under rapid and sufficiently large fluctuations, the dynamics exhibits\nbistability of tree-like and cyclic network structures. We compare these\nsolutions in terms of the cost functional E. Close to the saddle-node\nbifurcation giving rise to the cyclic solutions, we find a parameter regime\nwhere the tree-like solution rather than the cyclic solution is cost-optimal.\nFurther increase of fluctuation amplitude then leads to an additional\ntransition at which the cyclic solution becomes optimal. The findings hold both\nin a small system of one source and two sinks and in an empirical vascular\nnetwork with hundreds of sinks. In the small system, we further analyze the\ncase of slower fluctuations, i.e., on the same time scale as network\nadaptation. We find that the noisy dynamics settles around the cyclic\nstructures even when these structures are not cost-optimal.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
