To address this, we introduce TruVRF, a non-invasive unlearning\nverification framework operating at class-, volume-, and sample-level\ngranularities. TruVRF includes three Unlearning-Metrics designed to detect\ndifferent types of dishonest servers: Neglecting, Lazy, and Deceiving.\nUnlearning-Metric-I checks class alignment, Unlearning-Metric-II verifies\nsample count, and Unlearning-Metric-III confirms specific sample deletion.\nEvaluations on three datasets show TruVRF's robust performance, with over 90%\naccuracy for Metrics I and III, and a 4.8% to 8.2% inference deviation for\nMetric II. TruVRF also demonstrates generalizability and practicality across\nvarious conditions and with state-of-the-art unlearning frameworks like SISA\nand Amnesiac Unlearning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
