However, decoding multilingual NMT\nmodels commonly produces ``off-target'' translations -- yielding translation\noutputs not in the intended language. In this paper, we first conduct an error\nanalysis of off-target translations for a strong multilingual NMT model and\nidentify how these decodings are produced during beam search. We then propose\nLanguage-informed Beam Search (LiBS), a general decoding algorithm\nincorporating an off-the-shelf Language Identification (LiD) model into beam\nsearch decoding to reduce off-target translations. LiBS is an inference-time\nprocedure that is NMT-model agnostic and does not require any additional\nparallel data. Results show that our proposed LiBS algorithm on average\nimproves +1.1 BLEU and +0.9 BLEU on WMT and OPUS datasets, and reduces\noff-target rates from 22.9\\% to 7.7\\% and 65.8\\% to 25.3\\% respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
