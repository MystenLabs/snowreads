The unique emission of RRATs has been proposed to resemble those of\nknown pulsar types, such as extreme nulling pulsars or pulsars with giant\npulses. However, the presence of additional radiation beyond these sporadic\npulses remains unclear. Through high-sensitivity observations and extended\ntracking, we detected the sequential weak emissions in two RRATs with\nrelatively high surface magnetic fields (Bs > 10^13 G): J1846-0257 and\nJ1854+0306. These emissions show peak flux densities of 0.15 and 0.41 mJy, up\nto 687 and 512 times weaker than our detected RRAT single pulses, respectively.\nThe weak emissions contribute small fractions (~ 16% and 5%) to the total radio\npulse energy releases, contrasting significantly with giant-pulse pulsars where\nnormal pulses dominate. Polarization analysis of J1854+0306 suggests that its\nsporadic RRAT pulses may originate from intermittent enhanced sparking\nprocesses due to magnetospheric evolution. Our findings indicate that some\nRRATs may represent a novel class of pulsars, distinct from any previously\nknown subclass. Further observations of sources with similar rotational\nproperties using high-sensitivity instruments could validate the generality of\nthese hidden emissions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
