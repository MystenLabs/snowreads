Although fully convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are\ncommonly employed for segmentation, they are constrained by inductive biases\nand face challenges in establishing long-range dependencies. Transformer-based\nmodels address these limitations but introduce substantial computational\noverhead. Recently, a simple yet efficient Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)\narchitecture was proposed for image classification, achieving competitive\nperformance relative to advanced transformers. However, its effectiveness for\nophthalmic image segmentation remains unexplored. In this paper, we introduce\nMM-UNet, an efficient Mixed MLP model tailored for ophthalmic image\nsegmentation. Within MM-UNet, we propose a multi-scale MLP (MMLP) module that\nfacilitates the interaction of features at various depths through a grouping\nstrategy, enabling simultaneous capture of global and local information. We\nconducted extensive experiments on both a private anterior segment optical\ncoherence tomography (AS-OCT) image dataset and a public fundus image dataset.\nThe results demonstrated the superiority of our MM-UNet model in comparison to\nstate-of-the-art deep segmentation networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
