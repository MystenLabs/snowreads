Commonly, one global numerical\nsensitivity value is computed per simulation parameter. However, when\nconsidering 3D spatial simulations, the analysis of localized sensitivities in\ndifferent spatial regions is of importance in many applications. For analyzing\nthe spatial variation of parameter sensitivity, one needs to compute a spatial\nsensitivity scalar field per simulation parameter. Given $n$ simulation\nparameters, we obtain multi-field data consisting of $n$ scalar fields when\nconsidering all simulation parameters. We propose an interactive visual\nanalytics solution to analyze the multi-field sensitivity data. It supports the\ninvestigation of how strongly and in what way individual parameters influence\nthe simulation outcome, in which spatial regions this is happening, and what\nthe interplay of the simulation parameters is. Its central component is an\noverview visualization of all sensitivity fields that avoids 3D occlusions by\nlinearizing the data using an adapted scheme of data-driven space-filling\ncurves. The spatial sensitivity values are visualized in a combination of a\nHorizon Graph and a line chart. We validate our approach by applying it to\nsynthetic and real-world ensemble data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
