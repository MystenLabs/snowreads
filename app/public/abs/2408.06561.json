However, the implementation of QALUs on near-term quantum\ncomputers remains a substantial challenge, largely due to the limited\nconnectivity of qubits. In this paper, we propose feasible QALUs, including\nquantum binary adders, subtractors, multipliers, and dividers, which are\ndesigned for near-term quantum computers with qubits arranged in\ntwo-dimensional arrays. Additionally, we introduce a feasible quantum\narithmetic operation to compute the two's complement representation of signed\nintegers. The proposed QALUs utilize only Pauli-X gates, CNOT gates, and\n$C\\sqrt{X}$ (CSX) gates, and all two-qubit gates are operated between nearest\nneighbor qubits. Our work demonstrates a viable implementation of QALUs on\nnear-term quantum computers, advancing towards scalable and resource-efficient\nquantum arithmetic operations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
