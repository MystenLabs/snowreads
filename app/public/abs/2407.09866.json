In particular no closed stable geodesic exists. We comment on the\napplication of the Myers method to related problems, including geodesics in\nmoduli spaces of Calabi-Yau 3-folds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
