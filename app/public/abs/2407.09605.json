Despite their success,\nall implementations rely on approximations of the hard thermal loop (HTL)\nscreened matrix elements in the collision terms. In this paper, we present our\nresults for different isotropic screening prescriptions in the elastic\ncollision term for gluons. In particular, we go beyond the simple Debye-like\nscreening form that is used in all current implementations and apply the\nisotropic HTL matrix element instead. For isotropic systems, the evolution is\nnearly unchanged, but when studying the equilibration process in a Bjorken\nexpanding plasma, we find qualitative and quantitative differences in a range\nof moments of the distribution function, such as a decrease in the maximum\npressure anisotropy by up to 50%. In contrast, we find no significant\nqualitative impact on the jet quenching parameter or on the late-time\nhydrodynamization dynamics of anisotropic plasmas but observe systematically\nsmaller values of $\\eta/s$ by about 10% that coincide with perturbative\ncalculations at small couplings. Our study reveals that the choice of the\nscreening prescription can lead to large corrections at early times, but is\nless important close to equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
