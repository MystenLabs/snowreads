Dominance within rodent social structures can determine\naccess to critical resources, such as food and mating opportunities. Yet, many\naspects of the intricate interplay between individual behaviors and the\nresulting group social hierarchy, especially its evolution over time, remain\nunexplored. In this study, we utilized an automated tracking system that\ncontinuously monitored groups of male rats for over 250 days to enable an\nin-depth analysis of individual behavior and the overarching group dynamic. We\ndescribe the evolution of social structures within a group and additionally\ninvestigate how past behaviors influence the emergence of new social\nhierarchies when group composition and experimental area changes. Notably, we\nfind that conventional individual and pairwise tests exhibit a weak correlation\nwith group behavior, highlighting their limited accuracy in predicting\nbehavioral outcomes in a collective context. These results emphasize the\ncontext-dependence of social behavior as an emergent property of interactions\nwithin a group and highlight the need to measure and quantify social behavior\nin more naturalistic environments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
