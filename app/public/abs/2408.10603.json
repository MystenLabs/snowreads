Self-organized coordination\nin such heterogeneous ensemble of excitable and oscillatory cells is therefore\nof clinical importance. We show by varying the strength of intercellular\ncoupling and the electrophysiological diversity, a wide range of collective\nbehavior emerges including clusters of synchronized activity. Strikingly,\nstretch-activated currents allow waves of mechanical deformation to alter the\nactivity of neighboring cells, promoting robust global coherence.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
