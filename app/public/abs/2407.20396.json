First, we derive a chain rule\nbetween smooth min-entropy and smooth max-information, which improves over\nprevious chain rules for characterizing one-shot information leakage caused by\nan additional conditioning register. Second, we derive an ''information\nbounding theorem'' that bounds the R\\'enyi mutual information of a state\nproduced by a sequence of channels, in terms of the R\\'enyi mutual information\nof the individual channel outputs, similar to entropy accumulation theorems. In\nparticular, this yields simple bounds on the smooth max-information in the\npreceding chain rule. Third, we derive chain rules between R\\'enyi entropies\nand R\\'enyi mutual information, which can be used to modify the entropy\naccumulation theorem to accommodate leakage registers sent to the adversary in\neach round of a protocol. We show that these results can be used to handle some\ndevice imperfections in a variety of device-dependent and device-independent\nprotocols, such as randomness generation and quantum key distribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
