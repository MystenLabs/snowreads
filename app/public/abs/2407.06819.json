We show that they are open in the stack of coherent\nsheaves and that they admit good moduli spaces when the field characteristic is\nzero. In addition, in the locally free case we prove that the resulting moduli\nspace is a quasi-projective scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
