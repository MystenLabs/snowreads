This method has three remarkable advantages:~(1) only a\nlinear system with constant coefficients needs to be solved at each Runge-Kutta\nstage, which greatly reduces the time cost and improves the efficiency; (2) the\noptimal rate convergence analysis does not impose any restriction on the\nmagnitude of damping parameter, which is consistent with the third-order\naccuracy in time for 1-D and 3-D numerical examples; (3) its unconditional\nstability with respect to the damping parameter has been verified by a detailed\nnumerical study. In comparison with many existing methods, the proposed method\nindicates a better performance on accuracy and efficiency, and thus provides a\nbetter option for micromagnetics simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
