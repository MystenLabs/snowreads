Such statistical control is essential for the reliability\nof inference. However, knockoff guarantees rely on an exchangeability\nassumption that is difficult to test in practice, and there is little\ndiscussion in the literature on how to deal with unfulfilled hypotheses. This\nassumption is related to the ability to generate data similar to the observed\ndata. To maintain reliable inference, we introduce a diagnostic tool based on\nClassifier Two-Sample Tests. Using simulations and real data, we show that\nviolations of this assumption occur in common settings for classical Knockoffs\ngenerators, especially when the data have a strong dependence structure. We\nshow that the diagnostic tool correctly detects such behavior. To fix knockoff\ngeneration, we propose a nonparametric, computationally-efficient alternative\nknockoff construction, which is based on constructing a predictor of each\nvariable based on all others. We show that this approach achieves asymptotic\nexchangeability with the original variables under standard assumptions on the\npredictive model. We show empirically that the proposed approach restores error\ncontrol on simulated data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"iEXcfQr09yJRv9rKbxW29edvw1awXj7qZ0hN7h980JM","pdfSize":"2221963"}
