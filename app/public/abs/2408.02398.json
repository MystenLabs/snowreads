Template matching is the\nreference method for detecting objects with arbitrary templates. However,\ntemplate matching computational complexity depends on the rotation accuracy,\nbeing a limiting factor for large 3D images (tomograms). Here, we implement a\nnew algorithm called tensorial template matching, based on a mathematical\nframework that represents all rotations of a template with a tensor field.\nContrary to standard template matching, the computational complexity of the\npresented algorithm is independent of the rotation accuracy. Using both,\nsynthetic and real data from tomography, we demonstrate that tensorial template\nmatching is much faster than template matching and has the potential to improve\nits accuracy\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"sjKTfwDlK2lrB6fFA0i7xb-P6CwHwY9csyQ25EmON-g","pdfSize":"4964859","txDigest":"DvnvpKAkedfByK5sjMGHCdV8NHmre4pkhStoegRDd2KJ","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
