Our contribution to this field is a textile robotic\nglove with integrated actuators. These actuators, powered by pneumatic\npressure, guide the user's hand to a desired position. Crafted from textile\nmaterials, our soft robotic glove prioritizes safety, lightweight construction,\nand user comfort. Utilizing the ruffles technique, integrated actuators\nguarantee high performance in blocking force and bending effectiveness.\nAdditionally, we present a participant study confirming the effectiveness of\nour robotic device.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
