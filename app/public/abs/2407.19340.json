This work presents a novel, BiLSTM-based\ntri-modal model-level fusion architecture for the binary classification of\ndepression from clinical interview recordings. The proposed architecture\nincorporates Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients, Facial Action Units, and uses\na two-shot learning based GPT-4 model to process text data. This is the first\nwork to incorporate large language models into a multi-modal architecture for\nthis task. It achieves impressive results on the DAIC-WOZ AVEC 2016 Challenge\ncross-validation split and Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation split,\nsurpassing all baseline models and multiple state-of-the-art models. In\nLeave-One-Subject-Out testing, it achieves an accuracy of 91.01%, an F1-Score\nof 85.95%, a precision of 80%, and a recall of 92.86%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GUc-EX0iXzheqX55yv_Ki5LzujkwbG3KmtIM9nH2sdk","pdfSize":"7383008"}
