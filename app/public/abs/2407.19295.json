The cross section for inclusive production of a $D^+$ in\ndifferent nuclei is evaluated, taking care of the $D^+$ absorption in the\nnucleus, or equivalently, the survival probability of the $D^+$ in its way out\nof the nucleus from the point of production. We use present values of the in\nmedium width of $D$ mesons and calculate ratios of the cross sections for\ndifferent nuclei to the $^{12} \\text{C} $ nucleus as reference. We find ratios\nof the order of $0.6$ for heavy nuclei, a large deviation from unity, which\nindicates that the method proposed is adequate to measure this relevant\nmagnitude, so far only known theoretically.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
