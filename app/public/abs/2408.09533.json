{"id":"2408.09533","title":"AnomalyFactory: Regard Anomaly Generation as Unsupervised Anomaly\n  Localization","authors":"Ying Zhao","authorsParsed":[["Zhao","Ying",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 18 Aug 2024 16:40:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-20","timestamp":1723999211000,"abstract":"  Recent advances in anomaly generation approaches alleviate the effect of data\ninsufficiency on task of anomaly localization. While effective, most of them\nlearn multiple large generative models on different datasets and cumbersome\nanomaly prediction models for different classes. To address the limitations, we\npropose a novel scalable framework, named AnomalyFactory, that unifies\nunsupervised anomaly generation and localization with same network\narchitecture. It starts with a BootGenerator that combines structure of a\ntarget edge map and appearance of a reference color image with the guidance of\na learned heatmap. Then, it proceeds with a FlareGenerator that receives\nsupervision signals from the BootGenerator and reforms the heatmap to indicate\nanomaly locations in the generated image. Finally, it easily transforms the\nsame network architecture to a BlazeDetector that localizes anomaly pixels with\nthe learned heatmap by converting the anomaly images generated by the\nFlareGenerator to normal images. By manipulating the target edge maps and\ncombining them with various reference images, AnomalyFactory generates\nauthentic and diversity samples cross domains. Comprehensive experiments\ncarried on 5 datasets, including MVTecAD, VisA, MVTecLOCO, MADSim and RealIAD,\ndemonstrate that our approach is superior to competitors in generation\ncapability and scalability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
