While several CTP methods have been developed\nfor this problem, we posit that none of these methods (1) jointly considers the\nmutual ternary dependency between three key units (i.e., user, position, and\ncompany) of a career and (2) captures the characteristic shifts of key units in\ncareer over time, leading to an inaccurate understanding of the job movement\npatterns in the labor market. To address the above challenges, we propose a\nnovel solution, named as CAPER, that solves the challenges via sophisticated\ntemporal knowledge graph (TKG) modeling. It enables the utilization of a\ngraph-structured knowledge base with rich expressiveness, effectively\npreserving the changes in job movement patterns. Furthermore, we devise an\nextrapolated career reasoning task on TKG for a realistic evaluation. The\nexperiments on a real-world career trajectory dataset demonstrate that CAPER\nconsistently and significantly outperforms four baselines, two recent TKG\nreasoning methods, and five state-of-the-art CTP methods in predicting one's\nfuture companies and positions-i.e., on average, yielding 6.80% and 34.58% more\naccurate predictions, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
