A\nsingle chiral exciton state, which selectively absorbs circularly polarized\nlight of a specific handedness, dominates the optical sum rule. The chiral\nexciton state comprises two types of interlayer electron-hole transitions,\nwhich cancel out the total out-of-plane dipole moment. The absorption spectrum\nshows nearly perfect magnetic circular dichroism, which can be attributed to\nthe nearly saturated bound $K \\ge |C|$ of the Chern insulator under study. Our\nwork illustrates the potential of using excitonic optical responses to probe\nquantum geometry encoded by $K$ and $C$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
