Utilizing a\nscreened potential model, we compute the spectra and various decay widths for\n$c\\bar{c}$ bound system, comparing our results with experimental data and\nexisting theoretical models. We calculate the decay constants, $E1$ and $M1$\ntransitions, and annihilation decay widths, confirming the consistency of our\nmodel with experimental observations for well-established charmonium states.\nThe interpretation of charmonium-like states, $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, and\n$X(4500)$ as $P$ wave charmonium states and $\\psi(4040)$, $\\psi(3770)$,\n$\\psi(4160)$, $\\psi(4230)$, $\\psi(4360)$, $\\psi(4415)$, $Y(4500)$ and $Y(4360)$\nas $S-D$ mixed charmonium states are carried out.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
