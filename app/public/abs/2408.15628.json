Although\nthese methods are effective, they frequently lead to unsatisfactory\nsegmentation results and require manual annotations. To address these\ndrawbacks, we develop an unsupervised component segmentation technique that\nleverages foundation models to autonomously generate training labels for a\nlightweight segmentation network without human labeling. Integrating this new\nsegmentation technique with our proposed Patch Histogram module and the\nLocal-Global Student-Teacher (LGST) module, we achieve a detection AUROC of\n95.3% in the MVTec LOCO AD dataset, which surpasses previous SOTA methods.\nFurthermore, our proposed method provides lower latency and higher throughput\nthan most existing approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
