Here, we show that this line can be explained as\ndue to pair annihilation in the prompt emission region, and that its temporal\nevolution is naturally explained as the high-latitude emission (emission from\nhigher angles from the line of sight) after prompt emission is over. We\nconsider both the high and low optical depth for pair production regimes, and\nfind acceptable solutions, with the GRB Lorentz factor $\\Gamma \\approx 600$ and\nthe emission radius $r \\gtrsim 10^{16.5}$~cm. We discuss the conditions for the\nappearance of such a line, and show that a unique combination of high\nluminosity and Lorentz factor that is in a fairly narrow range are required for\nthe line detection. This explains why such an annihilation line is rarely\nobserved in GRBs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_mJ2bzw0vCix4ZSR8T7uEbEQnmyhMXC7sZUvNikZw_c","pdfSize":"635835","objectId":"0x37b55e80a6ccb5d174d8e8163d136fe18b84b74f5f2f6f505b4489e6514c5697","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
