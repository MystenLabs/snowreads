This paper presents an alternative to traditional methods for\nsimulating the real-time evolution in QFTs by leveraging Hamiltonian Truncation\n(HT). As a use case, we study the Schwinger model, systematically reducing the\ncomplexity of the Hamiltonian via HT while preserving essential physical\nproperties. For the observables studied in this paper, the HT approach\nconverges quickly with the number of qubits, allowing for the interesting\nphysics processes to be captured without needing many qubits. Identifying the\ntruncated free Hamiltonian's eigenbasis with the quantum device's computational\nbasis avoids the need for complicated and costly state preparation routines,\nreducing the algorithm's overall circuit depth and required coherence time. As\na result, the HT approach to simulating QFTs on a quantum device is well suited\nto Noisy-Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which have a limited number\nof qubits and short coherence times. We validate our approach by running\nsimulations on a NISQ device, showcasing strong agreement with theoretical\npredictions. We highlight the potential of HT for simulating QFTs on quantum\nhardware.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
