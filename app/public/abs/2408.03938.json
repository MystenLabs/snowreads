We prove\nthat large partial sums of $\\lambda_{\\pi}(n)$ strongly repel the low-lying\nzeros of $L(s,\\pi)$ away from the critical line. Our results extend and\nquantitatively improve preceding work of Granville and Soundararajan.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
