To construct the pressure-robust\nnumerical scheme, we use the divergence-free velocity reconstruction operator\nto modify the test function on the right side of the numerical scheme. We prove\nthe error between the velocity function and its numerical solution is\nindependent of the pressure function and viscosity coefficient. Moreover, the\nerrors of the velocity function and the pressure function reach the optimal\nconvergence orders under the energy norm, as validated by both theoretical\nanalysis and numerical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rDua6Mj9uQGk08R6-vOGuiWiTXPkMkvjMhN0TQ9g-1g","pdfSize":"496959"}
