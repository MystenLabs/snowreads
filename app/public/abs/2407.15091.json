We also give the transversal unfoldings of the\ncorresponding normal forms and treat the case where the changes of coordinates\nare tangent to the identity. Thus, a fairly complete description of the $1$--d\ncase is achieved.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
