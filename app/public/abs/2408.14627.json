This article summarizes the outcomes of that discussion and\nsubsequent conversations. We advocate for strategic investments in financial,\nhuman, and technological resources for sustainable data democratization.\nEmphasizing that data is central to scientific discovery and AI deployment, we\nhighlight barriers such as limited access, inadequate financial incentives for\ncross-domain collaboration, and a shortage of workforce development\ninitiatives. Our recommendations aim to guide decision-makers in fostering an\ninclusive research community, breaking down research silos, and developing a\nskilled workforce to advance scientific discovery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
