However, the application of these\ntechnologies in the medical domain is often hindered by data scarcity, both in\nterms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a new\nself-supervised pre-training protocol based on diffusion models for landmark\ndetection in x-ray images. Our results show that the proposed self-supervised\nframework can provide accurate landmark detection with a minimal number of\navailable annotated training images (up to 50), outperforming ImageNet\nsupervised pre-training and state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-trainings for\nthree popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first\nexploration of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark\ndetection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot\nregimes, for mitigating data scarcity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FSzKY3gCbapBi5JCtkNaaK7crmbdBxU3UpUSOxiDWo0","pdfSize":"7356898"}
