In this paper, we propose one efficient method\nto generate such de Bruijn sequences. This solves an open problem asked by\nFredricksen forty years ago for showing the existence of such de Bruijn\nsequences when the odd order $n >1$. Moreover, we refine a characterization of\nde Bruijn sequences with the same complement and reverse sequences and study\nthe number of these de Bruijn sequences, as well as the distribution of de\nBruijn sequences of the maximum linear complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
