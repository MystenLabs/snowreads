Such restrictions hinder their applicability to real-world scenarios.\nIn this paper, we present a novel approach enabling data reconstruction in\nrealistic settings for models trained on high-resolution images. Our method\nadapts the reconstruction scheme of arXiv:2206.07758 to real-world scenarios --\nspecifically, targeting models trained via transfer learning over image\nembeddings of large pre-trained models like DINO-ViT and CLIP. Our work employs\ndata reconstruction in the embedding space rather than in the image space,\nshowcasing its applicability beyond visual data. Moreover, we introduce a novel\nclustering-based method to identify good reconstructions from thousands of\ncandidates. This significantly improves on previous works that relied on\nknowledge of the training set to identify good reconstructed images. Our\nfindings shed light on a potential privacy risk for data leakage from models\ntrained using transfer learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ISSdwbA42t1gtNjETdLqZaNW98WstB2Lc9-HGYRFRJQ","pdfSize":"42036297"}
