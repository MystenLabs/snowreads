In this work, we present a set of models of ALD particle\ncoating to explore the transition from lab scale to manufacturing. Our models\nencompass the main particle coating manufacturing approaches including rotary\nbed, fluidized bed, and continuously vibrating reactors. These models provide\nkey metrics, such as throughput and precursor utilization, required to evaluate\nthe scalability of ALD manufacturing approaches and their feasibility in the\ncontext of energy applications. Our results show that designs that force the\nprecursor to flow through fluidized particles transition faster to a\ntransport-limited regime where throughput is maximized. They also exhibit\nhigher precursor utilization. In the context of continuous processes, our\nmodels indicate that it is possible to achieve self-extinguishing processes\nwith almost 100% precursor utilization. A comparison with past experimental\nresults of ALD in fluidized bed reactors shows excellent qualitative and\nquantitative agreement.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
