The unrestricted alphabet\ncase, $f(\\infty,k)$, is well-studied, known for $f(\\infty,3)$ and\n$f(\\infty,4)$, and, in particular, conjectured to be rational for all $k$. Here\nwe determine $f(2,k)$ for all $k$ and determine $f(3,3)$, which is already\nirrational. We describe an explicit construction for all $s$ which is\nconjectured to yield $f(s,3)$. Using our construction and flag algebra, we\ndetermine $f(4,3),f(5,3),f(6,3)$ up to $10^{-3}$ yet argue that flag algebra,\nregardless of computational power, cannot determine $f(5,3)$ precisely.\nFinally, we prove that for every fixed $k \\ge 3$, the gap between $f(s,k)$ and\n$f(\\infty,k)$ is $\\Theta(\\frac{1}{s})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
