Besides, we find in a pseudo $B$ symmetric spacetime with Codazzi type\nof $B$-tensor the electric part of the Weyl tensor vanishes and has Riemann and\nWeyl compatible vector fields. Furthermore, it is established that the chosen\nspacetime with Codazzi type of $B$-tensor is conformally flat and represents a\nRobertson-Walker spacetime. Also, we calculate the scale factor $\\varPsi (t)$\nfor these spacetimes in a spatially flat Robertson-Walker spacetime. Finally,\nwe study the impact of this spacetime under $f(R)$ gravity scenario and deduce\nseveral energy conditions by considering a new model\n$f\\left(\\mathcal{R}\\right)= e^{(\\alpha \\mathcal{R})}-ln(\\beta \\mathcal{R})$ in\nwhich $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ are positive constants.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
