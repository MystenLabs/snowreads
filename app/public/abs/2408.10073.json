Previous work has focused on isolated signs or\ncomparison against a single reference video to assess Sign Languages (SL). This\npaper introduces a novel SLA tool designed to evaluate the comprehensibility of\nSL by modelling the natural distribution of human motion. We train our pipeline\non data from native signers and evaluate it using SL learners. We compare our\nresults to ratings from a human raters study and find strong correlation\nbetween human ratings and our tool. We visually demonstrate our tools ability\nto detect anomalous results spatio-temporally, providing actionable feedback to\naid in SL learning and assessment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gQMt7Kl2uWYqCOcFDfkJ1rlKgzNxLqQoia8SsC6a0ss","pdfSize":"3665797"}
