An important challenge arises\nwhen one desires derivatives of path-integral quantities--standard\nfinite-difference techniques, for example, yield results of poor accuracy. In\nthis work we present methods for computing derivatives of worldline-type path\nintegrals of scalar fields to calculate forces, energy curvatures, and torques.\nIn Casimir-Polder-type path integrals, which require derivatives with respect\nto the source point of the paths, the derivatives can be computed by a simple\nreweighting of the path integral. However, a partial-averaging technique is\nnecessary to render the differentiated path integral computationally efficient.\nWe also discuss the computation of Casimir forces, curvatures, and torques\nbetween macroscopic bodies. Here a different method is used, involving summing\nover the derivatives of all the intersections with a body; again, a different\npartial-averaging method makes the path integral efficient. To demonstrate the\nefficiency of the techniques, we give the results of numerical implementations\nof these worldline methods in atomplane and plane-plane geometries. Being quite\ngeneral, the methods here should apply to path integrals outside the worldline\ncontext (e.g., financial mathematics).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
