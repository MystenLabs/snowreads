Additionally, we\nintroduce a new forward search algorithm, Information Set Entropy Search\n(ISES), which effectively solves many single-player deduction games. The ISES\nalgorithm, augmented with sampling techniques, allows agents to make decisions\nwithin controlled computational resources and time constraints. Experimental\nresults on eight games within our framework demonstrate the significant\nsuperiority of our method over the Single Observer Information Set Monte Carlo\nTree Search(SO-ISMCTS) algorithm under limited decision time constraints. The\nentropy variation of game states in our framework enables explainable\ndecision-making, which can also be used to analyze the appeal of deduction\ngames and provide insights for game designers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
