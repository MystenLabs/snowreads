The surrogate-based optimization framework employs\nthe Random Forest algorithm and uses a greedy, prediction-based exploration\nstrategy to identify the laser fabrication parameters that minimize the\ndiscrepancy relative to a user-defined target optical characteristics. We\ndemonstrate the approach on two synthetic benchmarks and two specific cases of\nphotonic surface inverse design targets. It exhibits superior performance when\ncompared to other optimization algorithms across all benchmarks. Additionally,\nwe demonstrate a technique of inverse design warm starting for changed target\noptical characteristics which enhances the performance of the introduced\napproach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M6e3AjP3wuJculOpo6Tiuwb7K_3kxFkT-fLVNawvU2k","pdfSize":"18162107"}
