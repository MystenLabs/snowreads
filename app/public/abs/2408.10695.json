It provides information about vulnerabilities\nand further useful resources such as linked advisories and patches. The NVD is\noften considered as the central source for vulnerability information and as a\nhelp to improve the resource-intensive process of vulnerability management.\nAlthough the NVD receives much public attention, little is known about its\nusage in vulnerability management, users' attitudes towards it and whether they\nencounter any problems during usage. We explored these questions using a\npreliminary interview study with seven people, and a follow-up survey with 71\nparticipants. The results show that the NVD is consulted regularly and often\naids decision making. Generally, users are positive about the NVD and perceive\nit as a helpful, clearly structured tool. But users also faced issues: missing\nor incorrect entries, incomplete descriptions or incomprehensible CVSS ratings.\nIn order to identify the problems origins, we discussed the results with two\nsenior NVD members. Many of the problems can be attributed to higher-level\nproblems such as the CVE List or limited resources. Nevertheless, the NVD is\nworking on improving existing problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
