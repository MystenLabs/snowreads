We consider wrapping\nD3-branes to the internal space in this setup. These D3-branes dissolve into\nthe domain wall, which interpolates true vacua and false vacua, forming a bound\nstate. The remnant of the D3-branes can be seen as a background magnetic field\non the domain wall, which appears to an observer in 4D spacetime as a\nmagnetically charged, spherically symmetric shell. This brane shell has finite\nradii due to the nonlinearity peculiar to string theory, even at the probe\nlevel. We demonstrate a new stabilization mechanism of the brane shell in 4D\nspacetime. We add a general relativity-inspired gravitational correction to the\nbrane shells and investigate the influence on its potential. As a result, the\npotential value at the horizon will be relatively larger than the potential\nminimum in parameter regions where the influence of gravity is large, and even\nnon-perturbative instabilities can be removed. Moreover, we show the existence\nof over-extremal states such that $(gQ)^{2}\\geq G_{4}m^{2}$ is satisfied in\nregions where the magnetic field is sufficiently large. At least in our model,\nthis over-extremal shell cannot be completely stabilized by gravitational\ncorrection. This paper also addresses the dilemma between stabilizing and\nachieving an over-extremal state.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
