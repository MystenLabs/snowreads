Our findings lead to\nguidelines for accurately choosing and developing uncertain segmentation\nmodels, that integrate aleatoric and epistemic components. These guidelines are\ndesigned to aid researchers and practitioners in better developing, selecting,\nand evaluating uncertain segmentation methods, thereby facilitating enhanced\nadoption and effective application of segmentation uncertainty in practice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bfh_pXlBz5YOVZ2fiX2R13p5iDOeahmH3S1Il5ZH-Mk","pdfSize":"891778"}
