Our approach involved non-trivial $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\ninvolutions, incorporating both divisor exchanges and multi-divisor reflections\nacting on the Calabi-Yau threefolds. Each proper involution results in an\norientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds and we constructed 320,386,067 such examples.\nWe developed a novel algorithm that significantly reduces the complexity of\ndetermining all the fixed loci under the involutions, and clarifies the types\nof O-planes. Our results show that under proper involutions, the majority of\ncases end up with O3/O7-plane systems, and most of these further admit a naive\nType IIB string vacua. Additionally, a new type of free action was determined.\nWe also computed the smoothness and the splitting of Hodge numbers in the\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$-orbifold limit for these orientifold Calabi-Yau threefolds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
