Battery-Electric Buses (BEBs) often require periodic recharging\nintervals between service trips. The strategic placement and allocation of\ncharging equipment are crucial in facilitating operations, optimizing costs,\nand minimizing downtime. In this study, we develop an optimization framework to\naddress the optimal placement of various charger types at candidate locations\nunder the stochastic charging demand of BEBs. The framework aims to minimize\nlong-term system costs while balancing considerations among station, charger,\nand value of time expenses. Leveraging existing stochastic location literature,\nwe develop a mixed-integer non-linear program (MINLP) to model the problem. We\ndesign an exact solution method to address this computationally challenging\nproblem. The program optimizes the generalized costs associated with building\ncharging stations, allocating charger types, traveling to charging stations,\nand average queueing and charging times. Queueing dynamics are modeled using an\nM/M/s queue, with the number of servers as a decision variable at each\ncandidate location and each charger type. The linearization process, which\nexcludes queueing variables, is succeeded by introducing associated constraints\nthrough cutting planes. This step guarantees global optimality due to the\nconvexity properties of the problem. To enhance scalability, we implement a\ngenetic algorithm and a simulated annealing metaheuristic and devise heuristic\nclustering strategies, facilitating the effective resolution of real-world,\nlarge-scale instances. Then, we conduct comparative analyses across\ngarage-only, other-only, and mixed-location scenarios.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
