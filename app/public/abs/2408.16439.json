Recently, the Belle-II Collaboration observed a $2.8\\sigma$\ndeviation from Standard Model predictions in the branching ratio of the $B \\to\nK \\nu_l \\bar{\\nu_l}$ decay mode. In this context, we investigate the exclusive\nsemileptonic $B_c\\to D_s^{*}\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ decay mode, mediated by $b\\to s$ quark\nlevel transition, using Effective Field Theory formalism. We perform a global\nfit to the new parameters using existing experimental data on $b \\to s \\mu^+\n\\mu^-$. We then estimate the branching ratio and other observables such as\nforward-backward asymmetry, lepton polarisation asymmetry, and the lepton\nnon-universality parameter of the $B_c\\to D_s^{(*)}\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ process.\nAlthough this process has not yet been detected experimentally, we offer\npredictions and discuss the observables for $B_c\\to D_s^{*}\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ in both\nthe Standard Model and potential new physics scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
