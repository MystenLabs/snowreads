In this study, we investigate the impact of K-factors produced\nwith various PDF sets, namely CT18, MSHT20 and NNPDF4.0 on (differential) cross\nsections of top pair production at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC).\nFurthermore, we perform a new fit (otherwise analogous to NNPDF4.0 with MHOUs)\nwhere the exact NNLO corrections are used in the fitting procedure and compare\nthe K-factors obtained from this fit with those obtained from the above\nmentioned PDF sets. We find good agreement amongst K-factors obtained from\nthese different PDF sets.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
