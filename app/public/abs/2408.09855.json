We show that the Harish-Chandra images of the\n$q$-immanants coincide with the Schur polynomials. We also prove quantum\nanalogues of the higher Capelli identities and derive Newton-type identities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
