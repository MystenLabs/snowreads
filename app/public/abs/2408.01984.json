They are observed in systems such as metallic alloys, soft matter,\nand particle simulations. Unlike periodic crystals, which are invariant under\nreal-space symmetry operations, quasicrystals possess symmetry described by a\nspace group in reciprocal space. In this study, we report the self-assembly of\na six-fold chiral quasicrystal using molecular dynamics simulations of a\ntwo-dimensional particle system. These particles interact via the\nLennard-Jones-Gauss pair potential and are subjected to a periodic substrate\npotential. Our findings confirm the presence of chiral symmetry through\ndiffraction patterns and order parameters, revealing unique local motifs in\nboth real and reciprocal space. We demonstrate that the quasicrystal's\nproperties, including the tiling structure and symmetry and the extent of\ndiffuse scattering, are influenced by substrate potential depth and\ntemperature. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of chiral\nquasicrystal formation and the role of external fields in tailoring\nquasicrystal structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
