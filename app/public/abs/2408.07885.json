It\nunifies the conceptual belief update rule of a quantum state observed after a\nforward quantum process, and the operational reverse process that brings the\nfinal state to a recovered state equal to the updated belief, counteracting the\nforward process. Here, we study a higher-order generalization of the quantum\nBayes' rule by considering a quantum process undergoing a quantum supermap. For\na few families of initial beliefs, we show that a similar unification is\npossible -- the rules to update the belief of quantum channels can be\nimplemented via a \"reverse\" quantum supermap, which we call the retrodiction\nsupermap, allowing for applications such as error correction in quantum cloud\ncomputing. Analytical solutions are provided for those families, while a recipe\nfor arbitrary initial beliefs is yet to be found.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
