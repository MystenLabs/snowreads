In the $1 \\times n$ case, we prove that the random\nwalk exhibits cutoff at time $\\dfrac{n q^2 \\log(n)}{8 \\pi^2}$ when $q \\gg n$;\nin the $n \\times n$ case, we establish cutoff for the random walk at time\n$\\dfrac{n^2 q^2 \\log(n)}{8 \\pi^2}$ when $q \\gg n^2$. We also show that a\ngeneral class of random walks on $(\\mathbb{Z}/q\\mathbb{Z})^n$ with a marginal\nincremental variance $\\dfrac{\\sigma^2}{n}$ (when mapped to $( \\mathbb{Z} \\cap\n[-q/2, q/2))^n$) has cutoff at time $\\dfrac{nq^2 \\log(n)}{4\\pi^2 \\sigma^2}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
