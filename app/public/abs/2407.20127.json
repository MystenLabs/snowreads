Machine\nlearning techniques have improved the performance of top tagging algorithms,\nbut the size of the systematic uncertainties for all proposed algorithms has\nnot been systematically studied. This paper presents the performance of several\nmachine learning based top tagging algorithms on a dataset constructed from\nsimulated proton-proton collision events measured with the ATLAS detector at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV. The systematic uncertainties associated with these\nalgorithms are estimated through an approximate procedure that is not meant to\nbe used in a physics analysis, but is appropriate for the level of precision\nrequired for this study. The most performant algorithms are found to have the\nlargest uncertainties, motivating the development of methods to reduce these\nuncertainties without compromising performance. To enable such efforts in the\nwider scientific community, the datasets used in this paper are made publicly\navailable.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JbfW3ull6q3j2k9dHnB85v1a4rHDQvLeZ8lM1O4F2D0","pdfSize":"2094688"}
