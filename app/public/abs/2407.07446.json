We focus on the small-time local controllability (STLC)\naround an equilibrium, when the linearized system is not controllable. We study\nthe second order order term in the Taylor expansion of the state, with respect\nto the control. For scalar input ODEs, quadratic terms never recover\ncontrollability: they induce signed drifts in the dynamics. Thus proving STLC\nrequires to go at least to the third order. Similar results were proved for the\nbilinear Schr\\\"odinger PDE with scalar input controls. In this article, we\nstudy the case of multi-input systems. We clarify among the quadratic Lie\nbrackets, those that allow to recover STLC: they are bilinear with respect to 2\ndifferent controls. For ODEs, our result is a consequence of Sussman's\nsufficient condition $S(\\theta)$ (when focused on quadratic terms), but we\npropose a new proof, designed to prepare an easier transfer to PDEs. This proof\nrelies on a representation formula of the state inspired by the Magnus formula.\nBy adapting it, we prove a new STLC result for the bilinear Schr\\\"odinger PDE.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
