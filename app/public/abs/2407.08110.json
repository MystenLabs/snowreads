However, the calculation of electronic structures in twisted\nmaterial has remained a challenge. To address this, we have developed a general\ncomputational methodology that can generate twisted geometries starting from\nmonolayer structure and obtain the precisely relaxed twisted structure through\na machine learning-based method. Then the electronic structure properties of\nthe twisted material are calculated using tight-Binding (TB) and continuum\nmodel methods, thus the entire process requires minimal computational\nresources. In this paper, we first introduce the theoretical methods for\ngenerating twisted structures and computing their electronic properties. We\nthen provide calculations and brief analyses of the electronic structure\nproperties for several typical two-dimensional materials with different\ncharacteristics. This work serves as a solid foundation for researchers\ninterested in studying twisted systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O_EgzVgENTkmFrVXreSXtKm2MW0LvgWfvab8OPlwh4Q","pdfSize":"31196825","objectId":"0x6bb476a2be5b9bda9eebb7442dda6358e537e11ff6ccc33248bb8aff249b1b98","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
