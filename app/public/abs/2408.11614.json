We\nscan this parameter space in order to look for effects caused by the presence\nof a strong first-order phase transition connecting hadron and quark phases by\nmeans of a Maxwell construction. We found robustly that $\\Delta$ suffers an\nabrupt decrease around the transition point, even reaching large negative\nvalues ($\\Delta\\simeq-0.35$), in marked contrast to current studies pointing\nout a smooth behavior with $\\Delta\\gtrsim 0$ at all densities. Besides, we\ncharacterize the behavior of conformal factor, $d_{c}$, in twin stars for which\nwe perform comparisons with theoretical constraints, e.g. from Bayesian studies\nadjusted to agree with pQCD. All this allows us to infer and hypothesize\nmodifications in the strong QCD coupling in dense nuclear matter with a strong\nthermodynamic discontinuity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
