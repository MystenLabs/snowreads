Recently, Brown and Rizkallah\nextended this translation to higher-order logic. In this paper, we adapt it for\ntheories encoded in higher-order logic in the lambdaPi-calculus modulo theory,\na logical framework that extends lambda-calculus with dependent types and\nuser-defined rewrite rules. We develop a tool that implements Kuroda's\ntranslation for proofs written in Dedukti, a proof language based on the\nlambdaPi-calculus modulo theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
