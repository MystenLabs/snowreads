The hypothesis suggests that doping a Mott insulator reduces the\nHubbard Coulomb interaction, which could slow down the chemical shift and\nresult in enhanced charge storage capabilities compared to classic band\ninsulators. The results support the hypothesis through a systematic comparison\nof selected transition metal oxide-based electrodes (Cu, Mn, Co, and Fe oxide\nelectrodes). Furthermore, a toy model is employed to investigate the shift in\nchemical potential with doping-dependent U using DFT+U calculation, aiming to\nvisualize the chemical potential evolution in Mott-insulators relevant to their\napplication as battery electrodes. This study provides valuable insights into\nhow strongly correlated materials, especially Mott-insulators, contribute to\nthe advancement of energy storage technologies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
