But its\nvalue seems to depend on the epoch at which the measurements are made. The\nPlanck estimate of the Hubble constant from the observations of the cosmic\nmicrowave background radiation in the early universe is about 67 km/s/Mpc,\nwhereas that obtained from the distance indicators at the current epoch is\nabout 73-74 km/s/Mpc. This discrepancy between the two groups of measurement is\ntermed as the Hubble tension which has gained much attention in the past few\ndecades with growing significance as measurements from both, the early and the\nlate universe, studies continue to produce results with increasing precision.\nIn this work, we propose a modification to gravity by considering a finite\nrange gravitational field as an alternate explanation for this discrepancy in\nthe value of the Hubble constant.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
