Many\nauthors proposed systems that either measure friction related parameters or\nestimate the friction coefficient directly via a mathematical model. However\nthese systems can be negatively impacted by environmental factors or require a\nsufficient level of excitation in the form of tire slip, which is often too low\nunder practical conditions. Therefore, this work investigates, if a more robust\nestimation can be achieved by fusing the information of multiple systems using\na Bayesian network, which models the statistical relationship between the\nsensors and the maximum friction coefficient. First, the Bayesian network is\nevaluated over its entire domain to compare the inference process to all\npossible road conditions. After that, the algorithm is applied to data from a\ntest vehicle to demonstrate the performance under real conditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
