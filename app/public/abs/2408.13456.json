In this technique, light-scattering spectroscopy is applied\nto highly turbid fluids containing optical probe particles. The DWS spectrum is\nused to infer the time-dependent mean-square displacement and time-dependent\ndiffusion coefficient $D$ of the probes. From $D$, values for the storage\nmodulus $G'(\\omega)$ and the loss modulus $G''(\\omega)$ are obtained. This\npaper is primarily concerned with the inference of the mean-square displacement\nfrom a DWS spectrum. However, in much of the literature, central to the\ninference that is said to yield $D$ is an invocation $g^{(1)}(t) = \\exp(- 2\nq^{2} \\overline{X(t)^{2}})$ of the Gaussian Approximation for the field\ncorrelation function $g^{(1)}(t)$ of the scattered light in terms of the\nmean-square displacement $\\overline{X(t)^{2}}$ of a probe particle during time\n$t$. Experiment and simulation both show that the Gaussian approximation is\ninvalid for probes in polymeric liquids and other complex fluids. In this\npaper, we obtain corrections to the Gaussian approximation that will assist in\ninterpreting DWS spectra of probes in polymeric liquids. The corrections reveal\nthat these DWS spectra receive contributions from higher moments\n$\\overline{X(t)^{2n}}$, $n >1$, of the probe displacement distribution\nfunction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
