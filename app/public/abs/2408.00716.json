One such\nmethod that has proven to be effective in this field is Deep Learning,\nespecially Natural Language processing models, which are able to extract\nsemantic knowledge from user's text reviews to create more efficient\nrecommendation systems. This can lead to the development of intelligent models\nthat can classify a user's preferences and emotions based on their feedback in\nthe form of text reviews about their hotel stay experience. In this study, we\npropose a Natural Language Processing framework that utilizes customer text\nreviews to provide personalized recommendations for the most appropriate hotel\nbased on their preferences. The framework is based on Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) and a fine-tuning/validation pipeline\nthat categorizes customer hotel review texts into \"Bad,\" \"Good,\" or \"Excellent\"\nrecommended hotels. Our findings indicate that the hotel recommendation system\nwe propose can significantly enhance the user experience of booking\naccommodations by providing personalized recommendations based on user\npreferences and previous booking history.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"llC2-jeVRwB2tXM_9WKPFgqCDKqAGmFI5FYfzIhmPnI","pdfSize":"452985"}
