Our formalism differs from existing ones in that we\nfocus on a strong separation of the formalisms for describing planning problems\nand ontologies, which are only losely coupled by an interface. Moreover, we\npresent a black-box algorithm that supports the full expressive power of OWL\nDL. This goes beyond what existing approaches combining automated planning with\nontologies can do, which only support limited description logics such as\nDL-Lite and description logics that are Horn. Our main algorithm relies on\nrewritings of the ontology-mediated planning specifications into PDDL, so that\nexisting planning systems can be used to solve them. The algorithm relies on\njustifications, which allows for a generic approach that is independent of the\nexpressivity of the ontology language. However, dedicated optimizations for\ncomputing justifications need to be implemented to enable an efficient\nrewriting procedure. We evaluated our implementation on benchmark sets from\nseveral domains. The evaluation shows that our procedure works in practice and\nthat tailoring the reasoning procedure has significant impact on the\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S7dIY9gwIqr7scMDbAL99JeV_nowvL_R3xYPySaXHUA","pdfSize":"268293"}
