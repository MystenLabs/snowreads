Utilizing customer trajectory data, layout diagrams, and retail\nscanner data obtained from a retail store, we trained a GPT-2 architecture from\nscratch to generate indoor trajectories and purchase actions. Additionally, we\nexplored the effectiveness of fine-tuning the pre-trained model with data from\nanother store. Results demonstrate that our method reproduces in-store\ntrajectories and purchase behaviors more accurately than LSTM and SVM models,\nwith fine-tuning significantly reducing the required training data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
