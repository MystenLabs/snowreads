This model represents a natural\nextension of the standard classical particle with kinetic energy being\nquadratic in fractional first derivatives and fractional linear momenta,\nsimilarly to classical mechanics. We derive the corresponding equations of\nmotion and explore the symmetries of the model. Also, we present the\nformulation in terms of fractional potentials. Two important examples are\nanalytically solved: the free particle and the particle subjected to\ngeneralized forces characterized by fractional first derivatives.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
