Linear\ndependencies are very rare in nature. Smoothing numerical series by\nconstructing Fermat-Torricelli points reduces the influence of the random\ncomponent on the final result.\n  The presence of a normal distribution of a random variable for numerical\nseries that relate to long time intervals is an exception to the rule rather\nthan an axiom. The external environment (international economic relations,\nscientific and technological progress, political events) is constantly\nchanging, which in turn, in general, does not give grounds to assert that under\nthese conditions a random variable satisfies the requirements of the\nGauss-Markov theorem.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
