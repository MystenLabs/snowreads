Using realistic\ntwo- and three-body nuclear interactions and consistent one- and two-body\nelectromagnetic currents, we calculate longitudinal and transverse response\ndensities and response functions of $^{12}\\text{C}$. We compare the resulting\ncross sections with experimental data for electron-nucleus scattering, finding\ngood agreement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
