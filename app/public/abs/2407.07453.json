Due to the rapidly increasing scale of PIC chips, high-density\nintegration of waveguide arrays working with low crosstalk over broadband\nwavelength range is highly desired. However, the sub-wavelength regime of such\nstructures has not been adequately explored in practice. Herein, we proposed a\nwaveguide superlattice design leveraging the artificial gauge field (AGF)\nmechanism, corresponding to the quantum analog of field-induced n-photon\nresonances in semiconductor superlattices. This approach experimentally\nachieves -24 dB crosstalk suppression with an ultra-broad transmission\nbandwidth over 500 nm for dual polarizations. The fabricated waveguide\nsuperlattices support high-speed signal transmission of 112 Gbit/s with\nhigh-fidelity signal-to-noise ratio profiles and bit error rates. This design,\nfeaturing a silica upper cladding, is compatible with standard metal back\nend-of-the-line (BEOL) processes. Based on such a fundamental structure that\ncan be readily transferred to other platforms, passive and active devices over\nversatile platforms can be realized with a significantly shrunk on-chip\nfootprint, thus it holds great promise for significant reduction of the power\nconsumption and cost in PICs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
