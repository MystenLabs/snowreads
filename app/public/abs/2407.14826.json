We revisit a lepton portal model with $U(1)'$ gauge symmetry where\nan extra Higgs doublet, a scalar singlet and one $SU(2)_L$ singlet vector-like\nfermion are introduced. In this model, $(g-2)_\\mu$ can be explained by extra\none-loop contributions from the vector-like lepton and the $Z'$ boson, whereas\n$m_{_W}$ can be increased by a tree-level mixing between the $Z$ and $Z'$.\nSetting the $Z'$ and lepton couplings at low energies to account for the SM\nanomalies, we perform a Renormalization Group analysis to investigate on the\nhigh-energy behaviour of the model, in particular on the issue of vacuum\nstability. We find that in the alignment limit for the two Higgs doublets, the\nLandau pole and the scale where perturbativity is lost are of order\n$10-100\\,{\\rm TeV}$, not far from the scales experimentally reached so far, and\nsensibly lower than the stability scale. We show how the Landau pole can be\nincreased up to $\\sim10^9\\,{\\rm GeV}$ in a misaligned scenario where the\nexperimental anomalies are still accommodated and a positive shift of the Higgs\nquartic coupling to improve stability can be achieved.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mGbVcqW1WvCHdKhFFUR8lA2Qb8aoHRPWCXfDEFp2Eug","pdfSize":"1487209","objectId":"0xba08bd54b756edc723a50f2a9d696362039d22a1a5ca20761230c6d3055826a6","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
