We also\nestablish two new finite de Finetti theorems for exchangeable random vectors\ntaking values in arbitrary spaces. These bounds are tight, and they are\nindependent of the size and the dimension of the underlying space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
