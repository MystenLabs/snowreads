We propose\nhere to revisit this paradox by considering the case of a deformable spoon,\nwhich consists of a floating ball attached to a soft string set in circular\nmotion through its other end. Doing so, one introduces some coupling between\nthe ball's trajectory and the flow generated by its motion, leading to\nsurprising effects. At low rotation speeds, we show that the circular\ntrajectory of the ball shrinks when we stir faster, which challenges common\nintuition based on centrifugal force and enriches the original paradox. For\nhigher rotation rates, the ball is either suddenly attracted toward the center,\nor is repulsed away from it, depending on the string length. A model explaining\nthese observations is proposed, and validated using experimental measurements\nof the generated flow. Interestingly, the system exhibits strong hysteretic\nbehavior, showing that the ball can robustly trap itself at the center of the\nflow generated by its past motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
