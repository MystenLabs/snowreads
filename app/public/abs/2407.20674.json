We explored 3D printed icons as\nan equivalent to visual icons for tactile maps addressing these problems. We\ndesigned over 200 tactile icons (TactIcons) for street and park maps. These\nwere touch tested by blind and sighted people, resulting in a corpus of 33\nicons that can be recognised instantly and a further 34 icons that are easily\nlearned. Importantly, this work has informed the creation of detailed\nguidelines for the design of TactIcons and a practical methodology for touch\ntesting new TactIcons. It is hoped that this work will contribute to the\ncreation of more inclusive, user-friendly tactile maps for people who are blind\nor have low vision.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uEr3epKckX2YoFLpILDxbBpyq8xdEQmxeLmDT-mVKZk","pdfSize":"1637151"}
