Such limitations result in the human\nobserver's inability to perceive large-scale changes in a stimulus, a\nphenomenon known as change blindness. In this paper, we started with the\npremise that this phenomenon can be exploited in video coding, especially\nHDR-video compression where the bitrate is high. We designed an HDR-video\nencoding approach that relies on spatially and temporally varying quantization\nparameters within the framework of HEVC video encoding. In the absence of a\nreliable change blindness prediction model, to extract compression candidate\nregions (CCR) we used an existing saliency prediction algorithm. We explored\ndifferent configurations and carried out a subjective study to test our\nhypothesis. While our methodology did not lead to significantly superior\nperformance in terms of the ratio between perceived quality and bitrate, we\nwere able to determine potential flaws in our methodology, such as the employed\nsaliency model for CCR prediction (chosen for computational efficiency, but\neventually not sufficiently accurate), as well as a very strong subjective bias\ndue to observers priming themselves early on in the experiment about the type\nof artifacts they should look for, thus creating a scenario with little\necological validity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
