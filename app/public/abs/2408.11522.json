The inequality that gives the upper\nbound corresponds to the second law of information thermodynamics in our\neffective thermodynamics. In addition, we derive a more general bound that is\ndetermined only by an initial state and the local Hamiltonian. This bound gives\nan explicit relationship between the extractable energy and the entanglement\nstructure of the initial state. We also investigate the tightness of the upper\nbounds and show that the bounds can be achieved in a simple example.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
