We prove the variational equivalence between such\nenergies, Ginzburg-Landau, and Core-Radius for anti-plane screw dislocations\nenergies in dimension two, in the relevant energetic regimes $|\\log\n\\varepsilon|^a$, $a\\geq 1$, where $\\varepsilon$ denotes the linear size of the\nprocess zone near the defects.\n  Further, we remove the \\emph{a priori} restrictive assumptions that the\napproximating order parameters have compact jump set. This is obtained by\nproving a new density result for $\\mathbb S^1$-valued $SBV^p$ functions,\napproximated through functions with essentially closed jump set, in the strong\n$BV$ norm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q63ICHLJpglLWrAXWht0Kr2K1K5BZTbsef2MU5m92Oo","pdfSize":"548052"}
