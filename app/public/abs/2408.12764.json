In this work, we extend simple-pe to produce rapid parameter\nestimates for LISA sources, including the effects of higher order multipole\nmoments. We show that simple-pe infers the source properties of massive black\nhole binaries in zero-noise at least $\\sim 100\\times$ faster than existing\ntechniques; $\\sim 12$ hours on a single CPU. We further demonstrate that\nsimple-pe can be applied before existing Bayesian techniques to mitigate biases\nin multi-modal parameter estimation analyses of MBHBs.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JGPN_S1qfBAWRl8PKqz1n8g0kQy7TeUd0fS1ECHcb24","pdfSize":"1202552"}
