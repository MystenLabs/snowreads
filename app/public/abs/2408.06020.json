Our approach identifies this discrepancy threshold with a novel\nfamily of multicolored uniform hypergraphs and reveals new phenomena not\ncovered in previous studies. In particular, our results address a question of\nBalogh, Treglown and Z\\'arate-Guer\\'en concerning 3-uniform hypergraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
