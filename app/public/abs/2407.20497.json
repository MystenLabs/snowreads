Then, some thermodynamic\nproperties of a system of 3-dimensional harmonic oscillators are investigated\nby calculating the deformed partition functions. According to the equipartition\ntheorem, we show that the number of accessible microstates decreases sharply in\nthe very high temperatures regime. When the thermal de Broglie wavelength is of\nthe order of the Planck length, three degrees of freedom are frozen in this\nsetup. In other words, it is observed that there is an effective reduction of\nthe degrees of freedom from 6 to 3 for a system of 3D harmonic oscillators in\nthis framework. The calculations are carried out using both approximate\nanalytical and exact numerical methods. The results of the analytical method\nare also presented in the form of thermal wavelengths for better understanding.\nFinally, the case of a 2-dimensional harmonic is treated as another example to\ncomprehend the results, leading to a reduction of the degrees of freedom from 4\nto 2.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"XhGX8unlVx5X7UzspmfGQyXKzNlSWAkOhuOQNJWVudM","pdfSize":"316863"}
