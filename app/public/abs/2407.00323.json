Beyond a\nmere technical endeavor, this paper contends that understanding and integrating\nsocial psychology principles into software processes are imperative for\nestablishing robust and secure software systems. Recent studies in related\nfields show the importance of understanding the social psychology of other\nsecurity domains. Finally, we identify critical gaps in software security\nresearch and present a set of research questions for incorporating more social\npsychology into software security research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
