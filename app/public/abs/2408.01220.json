We\nuse a zoom-in simulation of a Milky Way mass dark matter halo, and apply UMAP\non the 6 dimensional phase space in the dark matter field at z = 0. We find\nthat particles in the field are mapped to distinct clusters in the lower\ndimensional space in a way that is closely related to their accretion history.\nThe largest cluster in UMAP space does not contain the entire mass of the Milky\nWay virial region and neatly separates the older halo from the recently\naccreted matter. Particles within this cluster, which only comprise $\\sim 70\\%$\nof the Milky Way particles, have had several pericenter passages and are,\ntherefore, likely to be phase mixed, becoming dynamically uniform. The infall\nregion and recently accreted particle and substructure, even up to splashback,\nform distinct components in the lower dimensional space; additionally, higher\nangular momentum particles also take longer times to mix. Our work shows that\nthe current state of the Milky Way halo retains historical information,\nparticularly about the recent accretion history, and even a relatively old\nstructure is not dynamically uniform. We also explore UMAP as a pre-processing\nstep to find coherent subhalos in dark matter simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
