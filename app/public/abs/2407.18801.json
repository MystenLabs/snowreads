Some sufficient conditions on the usual stochastic\norder of the second-order statistics from dependent and heterogeneous\nobservations are established under the p-larger order and the reciprocally\nmajorization order. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate the\ntheoretical findings. In addition, the results of the Theorem are applied to\ntwo important models. Finally, we use a group of real data for empirical\nanalysis to carry out reliability analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
