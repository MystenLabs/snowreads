The robot utilized conversation\ndata to determine the most appropriate speaker to address. The findings\nindicate that the robot's addressing policy significantly influenced\nconversation dynamics, resulting in more balanced attention to each participant\nand a reduction in subgroup formation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
