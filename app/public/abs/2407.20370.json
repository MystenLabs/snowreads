In lazy burning, a set of vertices in a hypergraph is\ninitially burned, and that burning spreads to neighboring vertices over time\nvia a specified propagation rule. The lazy burning number is the minimum number\nof initially burned vertices that eventually burns all vertices. The\nhypergraphs associated with Latin squares include the $n$-uniform hypergraph,\nwhose vertices and hyperedges correspond to the entries and lines (that is,\nsets of rows, columns, or symbols) of the Latin square, respectively, and the\n$3$-uniform hypergraph, which has vertices corresponding to the lines of the\nLatin square and hyperedges induced by its entries.\n  Using sequences of vertices that together form a vertex cover, we show that\nfor a Latin square of order $n$, the lazy burning number of its $n$-uniform\nhypergraph is bounded below by $n^2-3n+3$ and above by $n^2-3n+2 + \\lfloor\n\\log_2 n \\rfloor.$ These bounds are shown to be tight using cyclic Latin\nsquares and powers of intercalates. For the $3$-uniform hypergraph case, we\nshow that the lazy burning number of Latin squares is one plus its shortest\nconnected chain of subsquares. We determine the lazy burning number of Latin\nsquare hypergraphs derived from finitely generated groups. We finish with open\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
