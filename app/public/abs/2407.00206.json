This calculation is performed on a fine lattice of $a=0.076$~fm at\nphysical pion mass, with the pion boosted to $1.8$~GeV and kaon boosted to\n$2.3$~GeV. We renormalize the matrix elements in the hybrid scheme and match to\n$\\overline{\\rm MS}$ with a subtraction of the leading renormalon in the\nWilson-line mass. The perturbative matching is improved by resumming the large\nlogarithms related to the small quark and gluon momenta in the soft-gluon\nlimit. After resummation, we demonstrate that we are able to calculate a range\nof $x\\in[x_0,1-x_0]$ with $x_0=0.25$ for pion and $x_0=0.2$ for kaon with\nsystematics under control. The kaon DA is shown to be slighted skewed, and\nnarrower than pion DA. Although the $x$-dependence cannot be direct calculated\nbeyond these ranges, we estimate higher moments of the pion and kaon DAs {by\ncomplementing} our calculation with short-distance factorization.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
