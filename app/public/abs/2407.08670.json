We establish global well-posedness and\nshow that the initial bump region will disappear in a time of order one. We\nprove that the function remains close to an explicit function during the\nblow-down. As a consequence, our result shows exponential decay in time of the\nsolution towards equilibrium. The key ingredients of our proof are the explicit\nblow-down function and a novel two-scale linearization in appropriate\ntime-dependent spaces that yields uniform estimates in the perturbation\nparameter.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
