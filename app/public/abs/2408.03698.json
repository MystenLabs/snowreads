Here, we combine\nfluctuational electrodynamics and density functional theory to reveal an\nunconventional thermophotonic effect in CDW-bearing TiSe$_2$, referred to as\nthermophotonic-CDW ($tp$-CDW). The interplay of plasmon polariton and CDW\nelectron excitations give rise to an anomalous negative temperature dependency\nin thermal photons transport, offering an intuitive fingerprint for a\ntransformation of the electron order. Additionally, the demonstrated nontrivial\nfeatures of $tp$-CDW transition hold promise for a controllable manipulation of\nheat flow, which could be extensively utilized in various fields such as\nthermal science and electron dynamics, as well as in next-generation energy\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
