These systems are described by set of\nordinary differential equations which do not explicitly depend on time. Such\nsystems can be found in nature and have applications in modeling chemical\nconcentrations, population dynamics, n-body problems in physics etc. In this\nwork we consider dynamics of states, which explain how the states will evolve\nare unknown to us. We approximate state and dynamics both using neural\nnetworks. We have considered examples of 2D linear/nonlinear and Lorenz\nsystems. We observe that even without knowing all the states information, we\ncan estimate dynamics of certain states whose state information are known.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dWhDWybKSVVW95Zk4j-0hDvxMghQGDEADy4PrVhyMB4","pdfSize":"1140067"}
