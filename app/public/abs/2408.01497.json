The\nmodel includes a $S_3$ family symmetry supplemented by extra cyclic symmetries.\nAs a consequence of our construction, a Dark Matter (DM) candidate is predicted\nand its properties are consistent with the observed cosmic abundances and the\nconstraints imposed by direct and indirect detection experiments. The model\nallows Charged Lepton Flavor Violation (CLFV) processes like $\\mu \\rightarrow\ne\\gamma$ and $\\mu \\rightarrow 3e$, but the predicted branching ratios align\nwith experimental limits. Additionally, our analysis elucidates the generation\nof the active neutrino masses through a one-loop radiative seesaw mechanism\nmatching the observed neutrino oscillation data. The model agrees with\nexperimental data on Higgs Diphoton decay rates and on oblique parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"NW8jPDr2DZpjU6xHjvBipN0On-6BUFyHSEciZJRSFGM","pdfSize":"8793767","txDigest":"4d7tjZ2ow5yY7WSar5N9khdCE6DouVFyLKgDeMwUgKHH","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
