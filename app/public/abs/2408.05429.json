Rare or hard-to-detect processes at the LHC, such as the\nproduction of multiple gauge bosons, become accessible at a TeV muon collider.\nWe present here the prospects of detecting quantum entanglement and the\nviolation of Bell inequalities in H to ZZ to 4l events at a potential future\nmuon collider. We show that the spin density matrix of the Z boson pairs can be\nreconstructed using the kinematics of the charged leptons from the Z boson\ndecays. Once the density matrix is determined, it is straightforward to obtain\nthe expectation values of various Bell operators and test the quantum\nentanglement between the Z boson pair. Through a detailed study based on\nMonte-Carlo simulation, we show that the generalized CGLMP inequality can be\nmaximally violated, and testing Bell inequalities could be established with\nhigh significance.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6pOyKsTyYk8E8xAJobt8Oxq65ac-aPHt0hlw5dtGm50","pdfSize":"591792"}
