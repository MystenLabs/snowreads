We introduce edge-differentially private algorithms that\nachieve nearly optimal performance for these problems.\n  For the multiway cut problem, we first provide a private algorithm with a\nmultiplicative approximation ratio that matches the state-of-the-art\nnon-private algorithm. We then present a tight information-theoretic lower\nbound on the additive error, demonstrating that our algorithm on weighted\ngraphs is near-optimal for constant $k$. For the minimum $k$-cut problem, our\nalgorithms leverage a known bound on the number of approximate $k$-cuts,\nresulting in a private algorithm with optimal additive error $O(k\\log n)$ for\nfixed privacy parameter. We also establish a information-theoretic lower bound\nthat matches this additive error. Additionally, we give an efficient private\nalgorithm for $k$-cut even for non-constant $k$, including a polynomial-time\n2-approximation with an additive error of $\\widetilde{O}(k^{1.5})$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
