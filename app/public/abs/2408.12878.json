However, three-dimensional (3D) VSs with\nhigh topological charges, supported by self-attractive nonlinearities, are\nunstable against fragmentation, which eventually leads to internal blowup\n(supercritical collapse) of the fragments. Here, we propose a scheme for\nrealizing stable 3D VSs with topological charges up to $5$ and $6$ in the two\ncomponents of a binary, Rydberg-dressed Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) with\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC). We show that, if the SOC strength exceeds a critical\nvalue, the rotational symmetry of the VSs in the transverse plane gets broken,\nresulting in separation of the two components. Nevertheless, the VSs with the\nbroken symmetry remain stable. The VS stability domains are identified in the\nsystem's parameter space. Moreover, application of torque to the stable VSs\nsets them in the state of robust gyroscopic precession.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
