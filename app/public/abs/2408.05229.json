A\nthorough study on the original Einstein field equation and its two\nmodifications by Einstein is presented. It is concluded that the cosmological\nconstant and the unimodular condition are independent concepts, and the\nunimodular condition has no direct role in the derivation of the traceless\nfield equation. Unimodular gravity with unambiguous action does not exist, and\nthe derivation of traceless equation from the action principle is an open\nquestion.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
