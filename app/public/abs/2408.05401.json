It is hypothesized that the pulse characteristic directly affects\nthe information present in the reconstructed profile. The ultrasound excitation\nmodes based on pulse-width modifications are studied to estimate the effect on\nreconstruction quality. Studies show that the pulse width affects the response\nof the transducer and, thus, the reconstruction. The ultrasound scanning\nparameters, mainly pulse width, are assessed and optimally set by an Artificial\nIntelligence driven process, according to the object without the requirement of\na-priori information. The optimization study uses a novel intelligent object\nplacement procedure to ensure repeatability of the same region of interest, a\nkey requirement to minimize the error. Further, Kanpur Theorem 1 is implemented\nto evaluate the quality of the acquired projection data and discard inferior\nquality data. Scanning results corresponding to homogeneous and heterogeneous\nphantoms are presented. The image processing step involves deep learning model\nevaluating the dice coefficient for estimating the reconstruction quality if\nprior information about the inner profile is known or a classical error\nestimate otherwise. The models segmentation accuracy is 95.72 percentage and\nintersection over union score is 0.8842 on the validation dataset. The article\nalso provides valuable insights about the development and low-level control of\nthe system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"KAxaoxwJmMQhXV6b7HO6cRZNu4yN9hQ0vcHuXrJDnNY","pdfSize":"2171127"}
