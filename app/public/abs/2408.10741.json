We introduce a locally convex topology on it to study the\ncontinuity of the pullback by smooth maps and generalise the result of\nH\\\"ormander about the pullback on the space of distributions with\n$\\mathcal{C}^{\\infty}$ wave front set in $L$. We employ an idea of G\\'erard\n[18] to extend the Kolmogorov-Riesz compactness theorem to\n$\\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$ and we characterise its relatively compact subsets. We\nstudy the continuity properties of pseudo-differential operators when acting on\n$\\mathcal{D}'^r_L(M;E)$, $r\\in\\mathbb{R}$, and we generalise the Rellich's\nlemma. As an application of our results, we extend the microlocal defect\nmeasures of G\\'erard and Tartar to sequences in $\\mathcal{D}'^0_L(M;E)$ and we\nshow a microlocal variant of the compensated compactness theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bsnG9LLQH_m3QoxcOV3FI1FXL0bFwNNc1OtkOoOnHpM","pdfSize":"1048166"}
