However, they have overlooked the diverse angles present in\nRS objects. This paper proposes the Masked Angle-Aware Autoencoder (MA3E) to\nperceive and learn angles during pre-training. We design a \\textit{scaling\ncenter crop} operation to create the rotated crop with random orientation on\neach original image, introducing the explicit angle variation. MA3E inputs this\ncomposite image while reconstruct the original image, aiming to effectively\nlearn rotation-invariant representations by restoring the angle variation\nintroduced on the rotated crop. To avoid biases caused by directly\nreconstructing the rotated crop, we propose an Optimal Transport (OT) loss that\nautomatically assigns similar original image patches to each rotated crop patch\nfor reconstruction. MA3E demonstrates more competitive performance than\nexisting pre-training methods on seven different RS image datasets in three\ndownstream tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
