We consider the \"prolate-type\" asymmetryic top molecules\nwith the asymmetry parameters $-1 < \\kappa < 0$ and the C2v symmetry in the\nlow-temperature limiting case, which are aligned by using mutually orthogonal\nlinearly polarized double laser pulses. The landscape map for each molecule\nconsists of 6000 pixels, each pixel of which represents the maximum degree of\nalignment achieved by each set of control parameters. After examining ways to\ndeal with the markedly different molecular parameters in a unified manner for\nsuitably training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we train the CNN\nmodel by using 55 training sample molecules to predict the control landscape\nmaps of 35 test sample molecules with reasonably high accuracy. As the\npredicted landscape maps provide a big picture of the alignment control, we\nshow, for example, that the double pulse control scheme is especially effective\nfor a molecule having a polarizability component that is much larger in value\nthan the other two components.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
