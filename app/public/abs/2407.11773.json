Despite its potential, traditional PLPP systems\noften lack adaptability, interactivity, and transparency. This paper proposes a\nnovel approach integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) with prompt engineering\nto address these challenges. By designing prompts that incorporate\nlearner-specific information, our method guides LLMs like LLama-2-70B and GPT-4\nto generate personalized, coherent, and pedagogically sound learning paths. We\nconducted experiments comparing our method with a baseline approach across\nvarious metrics, including accuracy, user satisfaction, and the quality of\nlearning paths. The results show significant improvements in all areas,\nparticularly with GPT-4, demonstrating the effectiveness of prompt engineering\nin enhancing PLPP. Additional long-term impact analysis further validates our\nmethod's potential to improve learner performance and retention. This research\nhighlights the promise of LLMs and prompt engineering in advancing personalized\neducation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
