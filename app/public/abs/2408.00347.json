However, the unique properties of medical imaging make\nclear segmentation difficult,and the high cost and time-consuming task of\nlabeling leads to a coarse-grained representation of ground truth. Facing with\nthese problems, we propose a novel Diffusion Transformer Segmentation (DTS)\nmodel for robust segmentation in the presence of noise. We propose an\nalternative to the dominant Denoising U-Net encoder through experiments\napplying a transformer architecture, which captures global dependency through\nself-attention. Additionally, we propose k-neighbor label smoothing, reverse\nboundary attention, and self-supervised learning with morphology-driven\nlearning to improve the ability to identify complex structures. Our model,\nwhich analyzes the morphological representation of images, shows better results\nthan the previous models in various medical imaging modalities, including CT,\nMRI, and lesion images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"45j1HEaBQnVeNa7GKjsiCZyQ-OnL6SK1PqIVs-1O4Og","pdfSize":"4250699"}
