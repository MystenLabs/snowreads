More specifically, it has altered the\ndiagnostic workflow of pathologists by integrating foundation models (FMs) and\nvision-language models (VLMs) in their assessment and decision-making process.\nThe limitations of existing deep learning approaches in CPath can be overcome\nby FMs through learning a representation space that can be adapted to a wide\nvariety of downstream tasks without explicit supervision. Deploying VLMs allow\npathology reports written in natural language be used as rich semantic\ninformation sources to improve existing models as well as generate predictions\nin natural language form. In this survey, a holistic and systematic overview of\nrecent innovations in FMs and VLMs in CPath is presented. Furthermore, the\ntools, datasets and training schemes for these models are summarized in\naddition to categorizing them into distinct groups. This extensive survey\nhighlights the current trends in CPath and its possible revolution through the\nuse of FMs and VLMs in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
