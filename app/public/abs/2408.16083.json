Despite this, a complete description of triboelectricity remains\nelusive. Here, we analyze the contact between a metal asperity and a\nsemiconductor, including contributions from the depletion zone of the\nsemiconductor and from flexoelectric polarization that arises due to the strain\ngradients at asperity contacts. The free charges involved in charge transfer\nare then discussed and calculated. As a result, we develop a quantitative model\nfor triboelectric charge transfer that details how charge transfer scales with\ncontact parameters, the relative influence of depletion and flexoelectricity,\nand which agrees with various trends in multiple classes of triboelectric\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
