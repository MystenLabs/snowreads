In this\nmodel an agent attains local information about the direct four-neigbourship of\na current grid cell and can also successively build a map of all detected\ncells. Beginning from a starting cell at the boundary of the environment, the\nagent has to visit any cell of the grid environment and finally has to return\nto its starting position. The performance of an online strategy is given by\ncompetitive analysis. We compare the number of overall cell visits (number of\nsteps) of an online strategy to the number of such visits in the optimal\noffline solution under full information of the environment in advance. The\ncorresponding worst-case ratio gives the competitive ratio. The aforementioned\ncontradiction among two publications turns out to be as follows: There is a\njournal publication that claims to present an optimal competitive strategy with\nratio 7/6 and a former conference paper that presents a lower bound of 20/17.\nIn this note we extract the flaw in the upper bound and also present a new\nslightly improved and (as we think) simplified general lower bound of 13/11.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
