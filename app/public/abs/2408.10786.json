We find that, in many cases, GWs from the\ngraviton Bremsstrahlung are buried in the stochastic gravitational wave\nbackground originating from inflation. However, if the superheavy particles are\nas heavy as the Planck scale, the graviton Bremsstrahlung can produce a sizable\namount of GWs, surpassing the inflationary ones.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
