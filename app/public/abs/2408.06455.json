Our focus is particularly on the *strictly sublinear*\nregime of MPC where the space per machine is $O(n^\\delta)$. Here $n$ is the\nnumber of vertices and constant $\\delta \\in (0, 1)$ can be made arbitrarily\nsmall. The MST problem admits a simple and folklore $O(\\log n)$-round algorithm\nin the MPC model. When the weights can be arbitrary, this matches a conditional\nlower bound of $\\Omega(\\log n)$ which follows from a well-known 1vs2-Cycle\nconjecture. As such, much of the literature focuses on breaking the logarithmic\nbarrier in more structured variants of the problem, such as when the vertices\ncorrespond to points in low- [ANOY14, STOC'14] or high-dimensional Euclidean\nspaces [JMNZ, SODA'24].\n  In this work, we focus more generally on metric spaces. Namely, all pairwise\nweights are provided and guaranteed to satisfy the triangle inequality, but are\notherwise unconstrained. We show that for any $\\varepsilon > 0$, a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate MST can be found in $O(\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon}\n+ \\log \\log n)$ rounds, which is the first $o(\\log n)$-round algorithm for\nfinding any constant approximation in this setting. Other than being applicable\nto more general weight functions, our algorithm also slightly improves the\n$O(\\log \\log n \\cdot \\log \\log \\log n)$ round-complexity of [JMNZ24, SODA'24]\nand significantly improves its approximation from a large constant to\n$1+\\varepsilon$.\n  On the lower bound side, we prove that under the 1vs2-Cycle conjecture,\n$\\Omega(\\log \\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ rounds are needed for finding a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximate MST in general metrics. It is worth noting that\nwhile many existing lower bounds in the MPC model under the 1vs2-Cycle\nconjecture only hold against \"component stable\" algorithms, our lower bound\napplies to *all* algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
