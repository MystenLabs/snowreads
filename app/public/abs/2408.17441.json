Our first main result is conditional upon Hooley's\nRiemann hypothesis and imposes the extra condition that the primes have\nprescribed primitive roots. Our second main result is unconditional and imposes\nthe extra condition that the primes have prescribed Artin symbols in given\nGalois number fields. In the appendix we present an application of the second\nresult in inverse Galois theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
