If the fixed point locus is positive dimensional we\nobtain an \\'etale rational map to the cell. We prove Conjecture 4.2 from\narXiv:2309.06871 which we realize as a special case of our construction. We\nalso show examples when the construction provides a rational \\'etale map to the\nHilbert scheme which is not contained in any Bia{\\l}ynicki-Birula cell.\nFinally, we give an explicit description of the formal deformations of any\nideal in the Hilbert scheme of points on the plane.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
