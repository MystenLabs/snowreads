Involved operators are\nassumed to satisfy a generalized monotonicity condition, which is weaker than\nthe standard monotone assumptions. Under mild conditions on parameters, we\nestablish the fixed-time stability of the proposed dynamical system. In\naddition, we consider an explicit forward Euler discretization of the dynamical\nsystem leading to a new forward backward algorithm for which we present the\nconvergence analysis. Applications to other optimization problems such as\nConstrained Optimization Problems (COPs), Mixed Variational Inequalities\n(MVIs), and Variational Inequalities (VIs) are presented and some numerical\nexamples are given to illustrate the theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
