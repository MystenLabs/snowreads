We prove the flexibility\nand nonuniqueness of $L^\\infty L^2$ weak solutions with vorticity in $L^\\infty\nL^p$ for some $p>1$, surpassing for the first time the critical scaling of the\nstandard convex integration technique.\n  To achieve this, we introduce several new ideas, including:\n  (i) A new family of building blocks built from the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole.\n  (ii) A new method to cancel the error based on time averages and\nnon-periodic, spatially-anisotropic perturbations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
