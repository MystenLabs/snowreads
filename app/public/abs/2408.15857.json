Key innovations, including the CSPNet\nbackbone for enhanced feature extraction, the FPN+PAN neck for superior\nmulti-scale object detection, and the transition to an anchor-free approach,\nare thoroughly examined. The paper reviews YOLOv8's performance across\nbenchmarks like Microsoft COCO and Roboflow 100, highlighting its high accuracy\nand real-time capabilities across diverse hardware platforms. Additionally, the\nstudy explores YOLOv8's developer-friendly enhancements, such as its unified\nPython package and CLI, which streamline model training and deployment.\nOverall, this research positions YOLOv8 as a state-of-the-art solution in the\nevolving object detection field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
