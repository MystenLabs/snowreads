If not treated properly, these\nfractures can result in chronic pain, reduced wrist functionality, and other\nlong-term complications. Recently, advancements in object detection have shown\npromise in enhancing fracture detection, with systems achieving accuracy\ncomparable to, or even surpassing, that of human radiologists. The YOLO series,\nin particular, has demonstrated notable success in this domain. This study is\nthe first to provide a thorough evaluation of various YOLOv10 variants to\nassess their performance in detecting pediatric wrist fractures using the\nGRAZPEDWRI-DX dataset. It investigates how changes in model complexity, scaling\nthe architecture, and implementing a dual-label assignment strategy can enhance\ndetection performance. Experimental results indicate that our trained model\nachieved mean average precision (mAP@50-95) of 51.9\\% surpassing the current\nYOLOv9 benchmark of 43.3\\% on this dataset. This represents an improvement of\n8.6\\%.
