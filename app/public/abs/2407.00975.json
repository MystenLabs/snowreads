Specifically, spectral and topological data\nis used to build an appropriate discrete model that accurately replicates these\nproperties. This work is motivated by topological insulator systems that are\noften described by tight-binding models. The problem is formulated as the\nminimization of an appropriate residual (objective) function. Given bulk\nspectral data and a topological index (e.g. winding number), an appropriate\ndiscrete model is obtained to arbitrary precision. A nonlinear least squares\nmethod is used to determine the coefficients. The effectiveness of the scheme\nis highlighted against a Schr\\\"odinger equation with a periodic potential that\ncan be described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
