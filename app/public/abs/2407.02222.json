One of the\nmain causes of these accidents is drivers being sleepy or fatigued. Recently,\nvarious studies have focused on detecting drivers' sleep/wake states using\ncamera-based solutions that do not require physical contact with the driver,\nthereby enhancing ease of use. In this study, besides the eye blink frequency,\na driver adaptive eye blink behavior feature set have been evaluated to detect\nthe fatigue status. It is observed from the results that behavior of eye blink\ncarries useful information on fatigue detection. The developed image-based\nsystem provides a solution that can work adaptively to the physical\ncharacteristics of the drivers and their positions in the vehicle\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"euz_jROl-fGbmuYcINbS1epz8trzXtawUiiqxKs4ovY","pdfSize":"935522"}
