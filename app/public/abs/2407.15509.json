Using\nSpanish data, we show that the share of low-value transactions in the total\nnumber of transactions increased from 9% to 61% in exports and from 14% to 54%\nin imports between 1997 and 2023. The increase in the number of low-value trade\ntransactions is explained by the rise of e-commerce and direct-to-customer\nsales facilitated by online retail platforms, and the fast-fashion strategy\nfollowed by clothing firms.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2sMKcC8VTTgczrqzb6Rhhw_04xK6u7sED1xq2o0YULc","pdfSize":"2505397"}
