In this note, we explain how the assertion of\ngauge triviality of a homologically trivial ambient action relates to the\ncalculus of dendriform, Zinbiel, and Rota-Baxter algebras, and to Eulerian\nidempotents. In particular, we exhibit new relationships between these\nalgebraic structures and the operad of rational functions defined by Loday.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
