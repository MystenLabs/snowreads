For Kepler-34, we rule out coplanar\nstellar masses as low as $0.12 M_\\odot$ at an orbital period of $\\lesssim 52$\nyears. For Kepler-35, we rule out stellar masses of $0.13 M_\\odot$ at orbital\nperiods of $\\lesssim 55$ years. Highly stable, extreme precision RV\ninstruments, as well as improved methodologies in characterizing double-lined\nspectroscopic binaries that come with these new instruments, will provide an\nopportunity to push these mass limits lower in the future.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1W0i2PHGfXO-eXf-igIBLOW1ltuCLFDKVGiNQArvbFo","pdfSize":"1324401"}
