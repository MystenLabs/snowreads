We can form the secant variety\nof $k$-planes through the curve. These are singular varieties, with each secant\nvariety being singular along the last. We study invariants of the singularities\nfor these varieties. In the case of an arbitrary curve, we compute the\nintersection cohomology in terms of the cohomology of the curve. We then turn\nour attention to rational normal curves. In this setting, we prove that all of\nthe secant varieties are rational homology manifolds, meaning their singular\ncohomology satisfies Poincar\\'e duality. We then compute the nearby and\nvanishing cycles for the largest nontrivial secant variety, which is a\nprojective hypersurface.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
