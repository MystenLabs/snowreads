The higher-dimensional quantum-corrected Schwarzschild black hole is\nobtained by the junction condition. It turns out that quantum bounces always\noccur in the collapse thus that the classical gravitational collapse\nsingularities are avoided. The scalar perturbations upon the quantum-corrected\nblack holes are also studied. It turns out that the quantum corrections enhance\nthe oscillation frequency in lower dimensions and decrease it in higher\ndimensions. Moreover, the thermodynamic laws of the quantum-corrected black\nholes imply that the Hawking temperature of quantum-corrected black hole\ndecreases as the mass decreases in contrast to the classical situation. The\nbehaviour of heat capacity indicates that quantum corrections introduce an\nextra phase transition of the black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
