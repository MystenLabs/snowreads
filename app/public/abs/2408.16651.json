The results indicate that the clusters favor low-spin states when\nevaluated with three different functionals: PBE, PBE0, and TPSSh. Additionally,\nthe doped clusters exhibit lower ionization energy and electron affinity\ncompared to the neutral Al$_{13}$ cluster. The density of states show a higher\ndegree of hybridization in Al$_{12}$Cu compared to Al$_{12}$Zn.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
