Based on 14 interviews with executives\nof an automotive company, we identify and categorize HAIC use cases that can\nhelp organizations anticipate and strategically respond to the impact of HAIC.\nFeedback from the case company shows that our systematic mapping of HAIC use\ncases along the value chain and group tasks enables a structured understanding\nof the potential role of AI and underscores the importance of strategic\nforesight when integrating AI into organizational processes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
