In the proposed method, training images are independently\nencrypted by each client where encryption keys can be prepared by each client,\nand ViT is trained by using these encrypted images for the first time. The\nmethod allows clients not only to dispose of the keys but to also reduce the\ncommunication costs between a central server and the clients. In image\nclassification experiments, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed method\non the CIFAR-10 dataset in terms of classification accuracy and the use of\nrestricted random permutation matrices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
