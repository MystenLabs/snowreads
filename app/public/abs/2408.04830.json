By employing Economic Dispatch (ED) with both day-ahead forecasts\nand actual values, we derive two distinct system costs, revealing the financial\nrisks stemming from uncertainty. We present a numerical algorithm inspired by\nthe Integrated Gradients (IG) method to attribute the contribution of\nstochastic components to the difference in system costs. This method,\noriginally developed for machine learning, facilitates the understanding of\nindividual input features' impact on the model's output prediction. By\nassigning numeric values to represent the influence of variability on\noperational costs, our method provides actionable insights for grid management.\nAs an application, we propose a risk-averse unit commitment framework,\nleveraging our cost attribution algorithm to adjust the capacity of renewable\ngenerators, thus mitigating system risk. Simulation results on the RTS-GMLC\ngrid demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving grid reliability and\nreducing operational costs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8Zza3CM17-9Z29Iuh58hyZS__KAzHPSHzm_Fnjc45EA","pdfSize":"1769154"}
