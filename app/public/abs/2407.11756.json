We model higher-order\nterms as tree-shaped motifs, comprising a central node with its neighborhood,\nand apply localized spectral filters on motif Laplacian, weighted by global\nedge Ricci curvatures. We prove our formulation is invariant to neighbor node\npermutation, derive its sensitivity bound, and bound the range of learned graph\npotential. We run regression on graph energies to demonstrate that it scales\nwell with deeper and wider network topology, and run classification on\nsynthetic graph datasets with heterophily and show its consistently high\nDirichlet energy growth.\n  We open-source our code at https://github.com/JThh/Many-Body-MPNN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uTKvHIVYIlt7UBsUaZK4QNY-r0BM8lvheCpV5godylE","pdfSize":"653221","objectId":"0x4a2091c4e38c50c93bdad76f9afa462e746fca13d1aba99ab4ebcb771b8e82a3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
