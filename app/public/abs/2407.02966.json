Our\ndifferentiated version of Geant4 allows computing mean pathwise derivatives of\nuser-defined outputs of Geant4 applications with respect to user-defined\ninputs. This constitutes a major step towards enabling gradient-based\noptimization techniques in high-energy physics, as well as other application\ndomains of Geant4.\n  This is a preliminary report on the technical aspects of applying\noperator-overloading AD to Geant4, as well as a first analysis of some results\nobtained by our differentiated Geant4 prototype. We plan to follow up with a\nmore refined analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
