Despite decades of\nresearch, this goal has only been achieved in the laboratory for a few notable\nexamples such as diamond and boron nitride. An area of significant interest is\nthe transformation under compression of light-element molecular compounds to\nextended-covalently-bonded (polymeric) solids. Among them, CO2 has been\nextensively studied due to its status as the prototypical simple molecular\nsystem with a rich phase diagram and due to its fundamental role in Earth's\nphysics and chemistry. One of its polymeric crystalline phases, accessible at\nextreme pressures and temperatures, have been recently quenched to ambient\npressure, but only at a low temperature. Here we report first principles\ncalculations predicting that isothermal compression of a carbon monoxide and\noxygen mixture (CO+O2), rather than pure CO2, lowers the polymerization-onset\npressure at room temperature from ~118 GPa to ~8 GPa. Moreover, it leads to the\nformation of an intrinsically different polymer with enhanced metastability. We\nshow that this dense phase is an energetic material, which can be recovered to\nambient pressure and temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
