In this paper, we study large-graph limits\nof GL functionals by taking a functional-analytic view of graphs as nonlocal\nkernels. For a graph $W_n$ with $n$ nodes, the corresponding graph GL\nfunctional $\\GL^{W_n}_\\ep$ is an energy for functions on $W_n$. We minimize GL\nfunctionals on sequences of growing graphs that converge to functions called\ngraphons. For such sequences of graphs, we show that the graph GL functional\n$\\Gamma$-converges to a continuous and nonlocal functional that we call the\n\\emph{graphon GL functional}. We also investigate the sharp-interface limits of\nthe graph GL and graphon GL functionals, and we relate these limits to a\nnonlocal total variation. We express the limiting GL functional in terms of\nYoung measures and thereby obtain a probabilistic interpretation of the\nvariational problem in the large-graph limit. Finally, to develop intuition\nabout the graphon GL functional, we compute the GL minimizer for several\nexample families of graphons.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QHMuP-BdD7RpIelEWint7O77PxeriAYwjBv9IBU0w4w","pdfSize":"431016","txDigest":"J9zdGK4WYDMwhWsiruutdnFews5sFSLXfN7vzhC6LVyR","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
