The weight vector\nshould be chosen from among efficient vectors for A. Since the reciprocal\nmatrix is usually not consistent, there is no unique way of obtaining such a\nvector. It is known that all weighted geometric means of the columns of A are\nefficient for A. In particular, any column and the standard geometric mean of\nthe columns are efficient, the latter being an often used weight vector. Here\nwe focus on the study of the efficiency of the vectors in the (algebraic)\nconvex hull of the columns of A. This set contains the (right) Perron\neigenvector of A, a classical proposal for the weight vector, and the Perron\neigenvector of AA^{T} (the right singular vector of A), recently proposed as an\nalternative. We consider reciprocal matrices A obtained from a consistent\nmatrix C by modifying at most three pairs of reciprocal entries contained in a\n4-by-4 principal submatrix of C. For such matrices, we give necessary and\nsufficient conditions for all vectors in the convex hull of the columns to be\nefficient. In particular, this generalizes the known sufficient conditions for\nthe efficiency of the Perron vector. Numerical examples comparing the\nperformance of efficient convex combinations of the columns and weighted\ngeometric means of the columns are provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
