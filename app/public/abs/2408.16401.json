Achieving reasonable results with deep learning typically requires\nlarge datasets which may be difficult to obtain for every\nscenario/configuration in wireless communication. Transfer learning (TL) solves\nthis problem by leveraging knowledge and experience gained from one scenario or\nconfiguration to adapt a system to a different scenario using smaller dataset.\nTL has been studied for various stand-alone parts of the radio receiver where\nindividual receiver components, for example, the channel estimator are replaced\nby a neural network. There has however been no work on TL for receivers where\nthe entire receiver chain is replaced by a neural network. This paper fills\nthis gap by studying the performance of fine-tuning based transfer learning\ntechniques for various configuration mismatch cases using a deep neural\nsingle-input-multiple-output(SIMO) receiver. Simulation results show that\noverall, partial fine-tuning better closes the performance gap between zero\ntarget dataset and sufficient target dataset.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
