Here, we propose to use\nkirigami skins with folding hinges in this same context. These\nrecently-introduced kirigami feature counter-rotating panels connected by\npop-up folding hinges. So far, researchers have only explored auxetic and\nhighly-symmetric versions of such patterns. Yet, some of these attributes have\nto be relaxed in order to explore their full potential as robotic skins. Thus,\nwe parameterize these patterns and relax symmetry constraints, with the goal of\nusing this same platform to obtain a wide range of shape-morphing behaviors. We\nuse a combination of: matrix analysis tools and analytical kinematic formulas\nto thoroughly explore the vast design space that ensues; experiments for\nvalidation purposes; and numerical simulations to explore the mechanics of\nselected planar and tubular patterns. We demonstrate that it is possible to\ntailor parameters to obtain skins that globally expand or contract due to axial\nelongation, and that present asymmetric pop-ups that can yield anisotropic\nfriction -- the most desired attribute for one-way locomotion of soft robots.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
