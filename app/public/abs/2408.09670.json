While KErTe2 represents the\ninitial synthesized telluride member, preserving its triangular spin lattice,\nit was anticipated that the substantial tellurium ions could impart more\npronounced magnetic attributes and electronic structures to this material\nclass. This study delves into the magnetism of KErTe2 at finite temperatures\nthrough magnetization and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements. Based on\nthe angular momentum $\\hat{J}$ after spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and symmetry\nanalysis, we obtain the magnetic effective Hamiltonian to describe the\nmagnetism of Er3+ in R-3m space group. Applying the mean-field approximation to\nthe Hamiltonian, we can simulate the magnetization and magnetic heat capacity\nof KErTe2 in paramagnetic state and determine the crystalline electric field\n(CEF) parameters and partial exchange interactions. The relatively narrow\nenergy gaps between CEF ground state and excited states exert a significant\ninfluence on the magnetism. For example, small CEF excitations can result in a\nsignificant broadening of the ESR linewidth at 2 K. For the fitted exchange\ninteractions, although the values are small, given a large angular momentum J =\n15/2 after SOC, they still have a noticeable effect at finite temperatures.\nNotably, the heat capacity data under different magnetic fields along the\nc-axis direction also roughly match our calculated results, further validating\nthe reliability of our analytical approach. These derived parameters serve as\ncrucial tools for future investigations into the ground state magnetism of\nKErTe2.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
