As an application this extends the a.s. approximation of the\nempirical distribution function of weakly dependent random vectors with\ncontinuous distribution function in [1] and [3] to the general case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
