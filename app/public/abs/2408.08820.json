The Boltzmann-Gibbs-based Bekenstein-Hawking entropy\n$S_{BH}\\propto A/l_P^2$ ($A \\equiv$ area; $l_P \\equiv$ Planck length)\nsystematically plays a crucial theoretical role although it has a serious\ndrawback, namely that it violates the thermodynamic extensivity of\nspatially-three-dimensional systems. Still, its intriguing area dependence\npoints out the relevance of considering the form $W(N)\\sim\n\\mu^{N^\\gamma}\\;\\;(\\mu >1;\\gamma >0)$, $W$ and $N$ respectively being the total\nnumber of microscopic possibilities and the number of components; $\\gamma=1$\ncorresponds to standard Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics. For this\n$W(N)$ asymptotic behavior, we introduce here, on a group-theory basis, the\nentropic functional $S_{\\alpha,\\gamma}=k \\Bigl[ \\frac{\\ln \\Sigma_{i=1}^W\np_i^\\alpha}{1-\\alpha} \\Bigr]^{\\frac{1}{\\gamma}} \\;(\\alpha \\in\n\\mathbb{R};\\,S_{1,1}=S_{BG}\\equiv-k\\sum_{i=1}^W p_i \\ln p_i)$. This functional\nsimultaneously is {\\it extensive} (as required by thermodynamics) and {\\it\ncomposable} (as required for logic consistency), $\\forall (\\alpha,\\gamma)$. We\nfurther show that $(\\alpha,\\gamma)=(1,2/3)$ satisfactorily agrees with\ncosmological data measuring neutrinos, Big Bang nucleosynthesis and the relic\nabundance of cold dark matter particles, as well as dynamical and geometrical\ncosmological data sets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GVXS4lfDyyRmYgXHM7ozRnPSSmH5YVni2vJ37rIOjU0","pdfSize":"350475"}
