Under the IID assumption on\n$(c(x, x+1))_{x \\in \\mathbb{N}}$ with unit inverse expectation\n$\\mathbb{E}[1/c(x, x+1)]=1$, we prove that the spectral gap, denoted by\n$\\mathrm{gap}_{N,k}$, of the process satisfies $\\mathrm{gap}_{N,\nk}=(1+o(1))\\pi^2/N^2$ and the eigenfunction $g_N$ with $g_N(1)=1$ corresponding\nto the spectral gap of one particle case is well approximated by $h_N(x) :=\n\\cos\\left( (x-1/2)\\pi/N \\right)$. Under some further assumptions on $c(x,\nx+1)_{x \\in \\mathbb{N} }$ and $k$, we prove that around time $(1+o(1)) (2\n\\pi^2)^{-1} N^2 \\log k$, the total variation distance to equilibrium drops\nabruptly from $1$ to $0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
