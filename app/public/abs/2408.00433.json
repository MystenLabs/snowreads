In\nparticular, regardless of the significant progress in compiler testing, there\nhas been hardly any work applying automated testing techniques to detect faults\nand vulnerabilities in shell interpreters.\n  To address this important shortcoming, we present ShellFuzzer: a technique to\ntest Unix shell interpreters by automatically generating a large number of\nshell scripts. ShellFuzzer combines grammar-based generation with selected\nrandom mutations, so as to produce a diverse range of shell programs with\npredictable characteristics (e.g., valid according to the language standard,\nand free from destructive behavior).\n  In our experimental evaluation, ShellFuzzer generated shell programs that\nexposed 8 previously unknown issues that affected a recent version of the mksh\nPOSIX-compliant shell; the shell maintainers confirmed 7 of these issues, and\naddressed them in the latest revisions of the shell's open-source\nimplementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
