The extension of Petri\nnets was developed under the assumption of the stationarity of CHTW-system,\nwhen its parameters are constant during the system operation. We consider the\ncase when the main parameters of CHTW-system (threshold functions and rate\nfunctions) change in accordance with the values of the mark-functions\n(multidimensional resource) of some container branes of the same CHTW-system.\nThe modification of the basic CHTW-system was designated as a CHTW(R) system,\nin which (R) means a Resource control of the system parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6Dpm_ec-PZ1ICT2cI0KgDX02MIpokF63kSw_GBRsuxw","pdfSize":"912113","txDigest":"4vPVDpgJz8L9WsV8BboqvV76jM4hr3oKrNP1vbjRLiQ3","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
