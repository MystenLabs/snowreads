We capture\nthe epidemic spreading process using a susceptible-infected-removed (SIR)\nepidemic model and consider isolation as the control strategy. We use a control\nstrategy to remove (isolate) a portion of the infected population. Our goal is\nto maintain the daily infected population below a certain level, while\nminimizing the resource captured by the isolation rate. Distinct from existing\nworks on leveraging control strategies in epidemic spreading, we propose a\nparameter estimation strategy and further characterize the parameter estimation\nerror bound. In order to deal with uncertainties, we propose a robust control\nstrategy by overestimating the seriousness of the epidemic and study the\nfeasibility of the system. Compared to the optimal control strategy, we\nestablish that the proposed strategy under parameter estimation and measurement\nerrors will sacrifice optimality to flatten the curve.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
