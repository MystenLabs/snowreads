Using NeRF as a\n3D-representation prior, the robot's footprint may be extrapolated\ngeometrically and used to train a CNN-based network to extract it online from\nthe robot's appearance alone. The resulting footprint results in a tighter\nbound than a robot-wide bounding box, allowing the robot's controller to\nprescribe more optimal trajectories and expand its safe operational floor area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TYZJox1lVEewGqtbnErAcmflOKCwjUODniADnP05xZA","pdfSize":"1796461","txDigest":"EiqSszhkaRTscLhq26wGk3wS5rvFuef7up84HFbnHSdZ","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
