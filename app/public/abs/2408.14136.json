We performed multi-wavelength spectral and photometric studies to\ndetermine its nature and possible association with the $\\gamma$-ray source. We\nfirmly established its optical counterpart with the Gaia based distance of\nabout 415 pc. Our data show that the object is a cataclysmic variable with an\norbital period of about 1.5 hours, a late type donor star and an accretion disk\naround the white dwarf. SRGe J194401.8+284452 exhibits fast spontaneous\ntransitions between the high and low luminosity states simultaneously in the\noptical and X-rays, remaining relatively stable between the transitions on\nscales of several months/years. This can be caused by an order of magnitude\nchanges in the accretion rate. The brightness of the source is about 17 mag and\n20 mag in the 2000 - 8000~A range and $5\\times 10^{-12}$ and $5\\times 10^{-13}$\nerg/cm$^2$/s in the 0.3 -- 10 keV range in the high and low states,\nrespectively. We constrained the mass of the white dwarf (0.3 -- 0.9 $M_\\odot$)\nand its temperature in the low state (14750 $\\pm$ 1250 K), the mass of the\ndonor star ($\\leq$ 0.08 $\\pm$ 0.01 $M_ \\odot$). In the low state, we detected\nregular optical pulsations with an amplitude of 0.2 mag and a period of 8 min.\nThey are likely associated with the spin of the white dwarf, rather than with\nits non-radial pulsations. In the high state, the object demonstrates only\nstochastic optical brightness variations on time scales of 1 -- 15 minutes with\namplitudes of 0.2 -- 0.6 mag. We conclude, that SRGe J194401.8+284452 based on\nits properties can be classified as an intermediate polar, and its association\nwith the $\\gamma$-ray source is very unlikely.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
