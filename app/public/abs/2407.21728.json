Motivated by\nthis recent discovery, the crystallisation behaviour of such precision PE\nchains, 400 carbons long with CBr2 groups placed regularly at every 21st\ncarbon, is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations. The\nunited-monomer model of PE is extended to include dibromo groups, with steric\nclashes at the bromines reflected in a triple-well bending potential,\ndemonstrating its function as a preferred fold site. Different crystallisation\nprotocols, continuous-cooling and self-seeding, reveal remarkably different\ncrystals. Using self-seeding, the crystalline lamellar thickness increases\nmonotonically with temperature, in quantized multiples of the distance between\ndibromo units. Polymer chains are observed to fold preferentially at the\ndibromo groups and such groups appear to be tolerated within the crystal\nlamellae. On quenching the bromos assemble to form registered layers, not\nunlike Smectic phases observed in liquid crystals, which confirms the\nexperimental observation of competing Form I and Form I' polymorphs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
