The minor\nstructural modification enhances the orbital overlapping and favours its\nelectrical transport properties with Ti doping though the tuning of SOC and U\nwith site dilution opposes it. As a result, metal insulator transition (MIT) is\ndisappeared and resistivity of the system throughout the temperature increases\nwith Ti doping. The nature of the conduction mechanism at low temperature\nfollows power law like variation. As the Ti4+ is nonmagnetic, the introduction\nof Ti at Ir site dilutes the magnetic interaction at Ir octahedral network,\nwhich in turn decreases the magnetic moment and magnetic frustration in the\nsystem though the magnetic irreversibility temperature is hardly affected by\nTi.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
