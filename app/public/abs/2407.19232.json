In this limit the model adequately maps onto a weakly\ncoupled triangular ladder with a potential interchain bias. The low-energy\nproperties of the system are formed due to the interplay of geometrical\nfrustration, correlations and charge imbalance. We derive the effective\nfield-theoretical model to study universal properties of the model in the\nscaling limit. We show that at full dynamical frustration the ground state of\nthe ladder represents a repulsive version of the Luther-Emery liquid with\ndominant orbital antiferromagnetic correlations exhibiting the slowest\npower-law decay in the ground state. Pairing correlations also display\nalgebraic order but are subdominant. At an incomplete dynamical frustration a\nfinite commensurability gap is dynamically generated, and the fluctuating OAF\ntransforms to a long-range ordered state with a spontaneously broken time\nreversal symmetry. The mass gap in the spectrum of relative density\nfluctuations gets suppressed upon increasing the potential bias.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
