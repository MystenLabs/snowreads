This challenge requires robust evaluation to\nprevent the spread of false information. Modern large language models (LLMs)\nhave demonstrated high capability in performing a diverse range of Natural\nLanguage Processing (NLP) tasks. By utilizing proper prompting strategies,\ntheir versatility due to their understanding of large context sizes and\nzero-shot learning ability enables them to simulate human problem-solving\nintuition and move towards being an alternative to humans for solving problems.\nIn this work, we introduce a straightforward framework based on Zero-Shot\nLearning and Key Points (ZSL-KeP) for automated fact-checking, which despite\nits simplicity, performed well on the AVeriTeC shared task dataset by robustly\nimproving the baseline and achieving 10th place.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
