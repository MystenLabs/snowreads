Herein, we report structural and\nmagnetic properties of the Cr-based double trillium lattice material\nKBaCr$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ studied by x-ray diffraction, magnetization, heat\ncapacity, thermal conductivity, and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)\nmeasurements complemented by density-functional band-structure calculations.\nHeat capacity and $^{31}$P NMR measurements reveal the magnetic transition at\n$T_{\\rm N1} \\simeq 13.5$ K in zero field followed by another transition at\n$T_{\\rm N2} \\simeq 7$ K in weak applied fields. The NMR sublattice\nmagnetization confirms that the transition at $T_{\\rm N1}$ is 3D in nature. The\n$^{31}$P spin-lattice relaxation rate in the ordered state follows the $T^3$\nbehavior indicative of the two-magnon Raman process. The spin lattice of\nKBaCr$_2$(PO$_4$)$_3$ comprises two crystallographically nonequivalent\nferromagnetic sublattices that are coupled antiferromagnetically, thus\neliminating frustration in this trillium network.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Onl-3AY2xr42y53ZiDHedTI7NuAPUWiB5DdOIR6njzg","pdfSize":"3331295","objectId":"0xf8084936b80297a98be9557e231b3e5a859cbd489a03f4d17733baa2985d24aa","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
