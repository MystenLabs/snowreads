We check that the map on the total space of the family has\nindeterminacy in the special fiber. However, we show that after blowing-up at\nan indeterminate curve, there is an induced birational map on the exceptional\ndivisor over the indeterminate curve. Moreover, we show that this map has\ndynamical degree 16.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
