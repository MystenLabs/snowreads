We prove that all these\nmeasurements preserve the majorization order under unitary control, enabling\ndirect experimental characterization of the majorization order. Specifically,\nwaves with lower coherence in the majorization order exhibit more restricted\nranges of achievable measurement values. Our results deepen the understanding\nof coherence in transport phenomena.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
