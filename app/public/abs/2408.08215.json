TinyML aims to solve this problem by hosting AI assistants on\nconstrained devices, eliminating connectivity issues by processing data within\nthe device itself, without internet or cloud access. This pilot study explores\nthe use of tinyML to provide healthcare support with low spec devices in low\nconnectivity environments, focusing on diagnosis of skin diseases and the\nethical use of AI assistants in a healthcare setting. To investigate this,\n10,000 images of skin lesions were used to train a model for classifying\nvisually detectable diseases (VDDs). The model weights were then offloaded to a\nRaspberry Pi with a webcam attached, to be used for the classification of skin\nlesions without internet access. It was found that the developed prototype\nachieved a test accuracy of 78% and a test loss of 1.08.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"u_aA08RiIElW4FSYwNVNeXuz0aXsJK14vf9bQE-AzlU","pdfSize":"375630"}
