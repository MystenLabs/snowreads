However, their susceptibility to electric\nnoise poses a challenge that may hinder the effectiveness of these qubits.\nHere, we explore the impact of electric noise on a planar double quantum dot\n(DQD) spin qubit under the influence of AC gates applied to the dot levels,\nfocusing on the flopping-mode spin qubit with spin-orbit interaction. We employ\na rotating wave approximation within a time-dependent effective Hamiltonian to\nderive analytic expressions for the Rabi frequency of spin qubit oscillations\nwith a single electron or hole in a DQD. We find that driving the qubit\noff-resonantly effectively mitigates the influence of charge noise, leading to\na manifestation of a dynamic sweet spot. The proposed mode of operation notably\nimproves the fidelity of quantum gates, particularly within specific ranges of\ndrive parameters and detuning during qubit manipulation. Furthermore, our study\nunveils the potential of inducing a second-order dynamic sweet spot, a\nphenomenon tunable by drive and DQD parameters. Understanding the importance of\ndriving qubits off-resonantly is essential for developing high-coherence planar\nDQD spin qubits, both for electrons in silicon and holes in germanium.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
