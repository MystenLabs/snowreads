We adopt a hybrid effective\nfield theory (HEFT) model that robustly regulates the cosmological information\nobtainable from smaller scales, such that our cosmological constraints are\nreliably derived from the (predominantly) linear regime. We perform an\nextensive set of bandpower- and parameter-level systematics checks to ensure\nthe robustness of our results and to characterize the uniformity of the LRG\nsample. We demonstrate that our results are stable to a wide range of modeling\nassumptions, finding excellent agreement with a linear theory analysis\nperformed on a restricted range of scales. From a tomographic analysis of the\nfour LRG photometric redshift bins we find that the rate of structure growth is\nconsistent with $\\Lambda$CDM with an overall amplitude that is $\\simeq5-7\\%$\nlower than predicted by primary CMB measurements with modest $(\\sim2\\sigma)$\nstatistical significance. From the combined analysis of all four bins and their\ncross-correlations with Planck we obtain $S_8 = 0.765\\pm0.023$, which is less\ndiscrepant with primary CMB measurements than previous DESI LRG cross Planck\nCMB lensing results. From the cross-correlation with ACT we obtain $S_8 =\n0.790^{+0.024}_{-0.027}$, while when jointly analyzing Planck and ACT we find\n$S_8 = 0.775^{+0.019}_{-0.022}$ from our data alone and $\\sigma_8 =\n0.772^{+0.020}_{-0.023}$ with the addition of BAO data. These constraints are\nconsistent with the latest Planck primary CMB analyses at the $\\simeq\n1.6-2.2\\sigma$ level, and are in excellent agreement with galaxy lensing\nsurveys.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
