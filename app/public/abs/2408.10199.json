Here, we present Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter\nArray (ALMA) 1.2 mm full polarized continuum, and H$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2),\nCS(5$-$4), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) line observations with a high angular\nresolution ($\\sim$0.4$''$ or 1100 au). In the 1.2 mm continuum emission, we\nreveal a dusty envelope surrounding the massive protostars, IRAS16547-E and\nIRAS16547-W, with dimensions of $\\sim$10,000 au. This envelope has a bi-conical\nstructure likely carved by the powerful thermal radio jet present in region.\nThe magnetic fields vectors follow very-well the bi-conical envelope. The\npolarization fraction is $\\sim$2.0\\% in this region. Some of these vectors seem\nto converge to IRAS 16547-E, and IRAS 16547-W, the most massive protostars.\nMoreover, the velocity fields revealed from the spectral lines\nH$^{13}$CO$^+$(3$-$2), and HN$^{13}$C(3$-$2) show velocity gradients with a\ngood correspondence with the magnetic fields, that maybe are tracing the\ncavities of molecular outflows or maybe in some parts infall. We derived a\nmagnetic field strength in some filamentary regions that goes from 2 to\n6.1\\,mG. We also find that the CS(5$-$4) molecular line emission reveals\nmultiple outflow cavities or bow-shocks with different orientations, some of\nwhich seem to follow the NW-SE radio thermal jet.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"QDKH_Mnb1Swnpzv4U4Ld9trmZTiKZHPAT9iSvwxyFH0","pdfSize":"8421135"}
