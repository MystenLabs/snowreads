We therefore curated\nand used an open dataset of annual APC list prices from Elsevier, Frontiers,\nMDPI, PLOS, Springer Nature, and Wiley in combination with the number of open\naccess articles from these publishers indexed by OpenAlex to estimate that,\nglobally, a total of \\$8.349 billion (\\$8.968 billion in 2023 US dollars) were\nspent on APCs between 2019 and 2023. We estimate that in 2023 MDPI (\\$681.6\nmillion), Elsevier (\\$582.8 million) and Springer Nature (\\$546.6) generated\nthe most revenue with APCs. After adjusting for inflation, we also show that\nannual spending almost tripled from \\$910.3 million in 2019 to \\$2.538 billion\nin 2023, that hybrid exceed gold fees, and that the median APCs paid are higher\nthan the median listed fees for both gold and hybrid. Our approach addresses\nmajor limitations in previous efforts to estimate APCs paid and offers much\nneeded insight into an otherwise opaque aspect of the business of scholarly\npublishing. We call upon publishers to be more transparent about OA fees.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
