One of the key tasks is envisioning AI\ntechnology uses and risks. Recent studies on the model and data cards reveal\nthat AI practitioners struggle with this task due to its inherently challenging\nnature. Here, we demonstrate that leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM) can\nsupport AI practitioners in this task by enabling reflexivity, brainstorming,\nand deliberation, especially in the early design stages of the AI development\nprocess. We developed an LLM framework, ExploreGen, which generates realistic\nand varied uses of AI technology, including those overlooked by research, and\nclassifies their risk level based on the EU AI Act regulation. We evaluated our\nframework using the case of Facial Recognition and Analysis technology in nine\nuser studies with 25 AI practitioners. Our findings show that ExploreGen is\nhelpful to both developers and compliance experts. They rated the uses as\nrealistic and their risk classification as accurate (94.5%). Moreover, while\nunfamiliar with many of the uses, they rated them as having high adoption\npotential and transformational impact.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
