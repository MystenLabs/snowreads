Using the\ntheory of Bailey pairs and some $q$-series techniques, we establish a number of\ntriple sum Rogers--Ramanujan type identities. These identities confirm the\nmodularity of all of Mizuno's examples except for two non-modular cases. We\nshow that the two exceptional cases of Nahm sums are sums of modular forms of\nweights $0$ and $1$. We also prove Mizuno's conjectural modular transformation\nformulas for two vector-valued functions consisting of Nahm sums with\nsymmetrizers $\\mathrm{diag}(1,1,2)$ and $\\mathrm{diag}(1,2,2)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
