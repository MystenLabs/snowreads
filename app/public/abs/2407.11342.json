While various R\nstatistical software packages have been developed by researchers to estimate\nrequired sample sizes under different assumptions, there has been a notable\nabsence of a standalone R statistical software package that allows researchers\nto comprehensively estimate sample sizes under generalized scenarios. This\npaper introduces the R statistical software package \"GenTwoArmsTrialSize\"\navailable on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), designed for\nestimating the required sample size in two-arm clinical trials. The package\nincorporates four endpoint types, two trial treatment designs, four types of\nhypothesis tests, as well as considerations for noncompliance and loss of\nfollow-up, providing researchers with the capability to estimate sample sizes\nacross 24 scenarios. To facilitate understanding of the estimation process and\nilluminate the impact of noncompliance and loss of follow-up on the size and\nvariability of estimations, the paper includes four hypothetical examples and\none applied example. The discussion encompasses the package's limitations and\noutlines directions for future extensions and improvements.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
