While hierarchical Bayesian methods have been\nwidely adopted in small area estimation, a unified Bayesian approach to\nbenchmarking estimation has not been fully discussed. This work employs an\nentropic tilting method to modify the posterior distribution of the small area\nparameters to meet the benchmarking constraint, which enables us to obtain\nbenchmarked point estimation as well as reasonable uncertainty quantification.\nUsing conditionally independent structures of the posterior, we first introduce\ngeneral Monte Carlo methods for obtaining a benchmarked posterior and then show\nthat the benchmarked posterior can be obtained in an analytical form for some\nrepresentative small area models. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed\nmethod through simulation and empirical studies.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
