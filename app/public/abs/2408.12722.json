We investigate whether the inclusion of data about influenza\nactivity in neighboring states can improve point predictions and distribution\nforecasting of influenza-like illness (ILI) in each US state using statistical\nregression models. Using CDC FluView ILI data from 2010-2019, we forecast\nweekly ILI in each US state with quantile, linear, and Poisson autoregressive\nmodels fit using different combinations of ILI data from the target state,\nneighboring states, and US weighted average. Scoring with root mean squared\nerror and weighted interval score indicated that the variants including\nneighbors and/or the US average showed slightly higher accuracy than models fit\nonly using lagged ILI in the target state, on average. Additionally, the\nimprovement in performance when including neighbors was similar to the\nimprovement when including the US average instead, suggesting the proximity of\nthe neighboring states is not the driver of the slight increase in accuracy.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
