Although the flagella\nrotate individually, they are typically bundled together, enabling the\nbacterium to exhibit three primary modes of motility: push, pull, and wrapping.\nOne key determinant of these modes is the coordination between motor torque and\nrotational direction of motors. The computational variations in this\ncoordination reveal a wide spectrum of dynamical motion regimes, which are\nmodulated by hydrodynamic interactions between flagellar filaments. These\ndynamic modes can be categorized into two groups based on the collective\nbehavior of flagella, i.e., bundled and unbundled configurations. For some of\nthese configurations, experimental examples from fluorescence microscopy\nrecordings of swimming P. putida cells are also presented. Furthermore, we\nanalyze the characteristics of stable bundles, such as push and pull, and\ninvestigate the dependence of swimming behaviors on the elastic properties of\nthe flagella.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
