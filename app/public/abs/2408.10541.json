In this\nwork, we build two instance-centric models and fuse predicted results from\nframe-level and instance-level. First, we introduce instance mask into the\nDETR-based model for query initialization to achieve temporal enhancement and\nemploy SAM for spatial refinement. Secondly, we build an instance retrieval\nmodel conducting binary instance mask classification whether the instance is\nreferred. Finally, we fuse predicted results and our method achieved a score of\n52.67 J&F in the validation phase and 60.36 J&F in the test phase, securing the\nfinal ranking of 3rd place in the 6-th LSVOS Challenge RVOS Track.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
