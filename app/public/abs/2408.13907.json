We show that the essential norm of the Toeplitz operator\n$T(a):H[X]\\to H[X]$ coincides with $\\|a\\|_{L^\\infty}$ for every $a\\in\nC+H^\\infty$ if and only if the essential norm of the backward shift operator\n$T(\\mathbf{e}_{-1}):H[X]\\to H[X]$ is equal to one, where\n$\\mathbf{e}_{-1}(z)=z^{-1}$. This result extends an observation by B\\\"ottcher,\nKrupnik, and Silbermann for the case of classical Hardy spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
