Around $70 billion worth of crypto-currency is traded daily on\nexchanges. Trading crypto-currency is difficult due to the inherent volatility\nof the crypto-market. In this work, we want to test the hypothesis: \"Can\ntechniques from artificial intelligence help with algorithmically trading\ncryptocurrencies?\". In order to address this question, we combine Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) with pair trading. Pair trading is a statistical arbitrage\ntrading technique which exploits the price difference between statistically\ncorrelated assets. We train reinforcement learners to determine when and how to\ntrade pairs of cryptocurrencies. We develop new reward shaping and\nobservation/action spaces for reinforcement learning. We performed experiments\nwith the developed reinforcement learner on pairs of BTC-GBP and BTC-EUR data\nseparated by 1-minute intervals (n = 263,520). The traditional non-RL pair\ntrading technique achieved an annualised profit of 8.33%, while the proposed\nRL-based pair trading technique achieved annualised profits from 9.94% -\n31.53%, depending upon the RL learner. Our results show that RL can\nsignificantly outperform manual and traditional pair trading techniques when\napplied to volatile markets such as cryptocurrencies.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
