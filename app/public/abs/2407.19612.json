Our analysis\nreveals that, apart from the fact that different applications may require\ndifferent retention times, the clock frequency, which is typically ignored in\nmost STT-RAM studies, may also significantly impact applications' retention\ntime needs. Based on our findings, we propose an asymmetric-retention core\n(ARC) design for multicore architectures. ARC features retention time\nheterogeneity to specialize STT-RAM retention times to applications' needs. We\nalso propose a runtime prediction model to determine the best core on which to\nrun an application, based on the applications' characteristics, their retention\ntime requirements, and available DVFS settings. Results reveal that the\nproposed approach can reduce the average cache energy by 20.19% and overall\nprocessor energy by 7.66%, compared to a homogeneous STT-RAM cache design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
