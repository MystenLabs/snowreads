Typically, ASD models\nare trained solely on normal samples due to the scarcity of anomalous data,\nleading to decreased accuracy for unseen samples during inference. AL is a\npromising solution to solve this problem by enabling the model to learn new\nconcepts more effectively with fewer labeled examples, thus reducing manual\nannotation efforts. However, its effectiveness in ASD remains unexplored. To\nminimize update costs and time, our proposed method focuses on updating the\nscoring backend of ASD system without retraining the neural network model.\nExperimental results on the DCASE 2023 Challenge Task 2 dataset confirm that\nour AL framework significantly improves ASD performance even with low labeling\nbudgets. Moreover, our proposed sampling strategy outperforms other baselines\nin terms of the partial area under the receiver operating characteristic score.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
