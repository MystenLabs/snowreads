Through\nthis method, many previously proven $q$-binomial identities, including\n$q$-Saalsch\\\"utz's formula and $q$-Suranyi's formula, are re-fund, and numerous\nnew ones are discovered. Moreover, the generation of the identities is\naccompanied by the corresponding proofs. During the transformation process,\ndifferent ranges of variable values and various combinations of $q$-Pochhammer\nsymbols yield different identities. The algorithm maps variable constraints to\npositive elements in an ordered vector space and employs a backtracking method\nto provide the feasible variable constraints and $q$-binomial coefficient\ncombinations for each step.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
