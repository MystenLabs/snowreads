Fueled by the exponential growth of chemical data and the evolution\nof artificial intelligence, recent years have witnessed remarkable strides in\nMPP. However, the multifaceted nature of molecular data, such as molecular\nstructures, SMILES notation, and molecular images, continues to pose a\nfundamental challenge in its effective representation. To address this,\nrepresentation learning techniques are instrumental as they acquire informative\nand interpretable representations of molecular data. This article explores\nrecent AI/-based approaches in MPP, focusing on both single and multiple\nmodality representation techniques. It provides an overview of various molecule\nrepresentations and encoding schemes, categorizes MPP methods by their use of\nmodalities, and outlines datasets and tools available for feature generation.\nThe article also analyzes the performance of recent methods and suggests future\nresearch directions to advance the field of MPP.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vx_xJGOf8_WWBXzX52YEzAseQzmMAKZwn4ON3D0fK-4","pdfSize":"9606432"}
