A section of the n-type\nmaterial has been converted to p-type by removing dopants and applying a\nvoltage to a gate placed in this region. Controlled electroluminescence from\nboth of the p-n junctions has been demonstrated by varying the applied bias\nvoltages. An emission peak with a width of ~8 nm is observed around 812 nm. The\nelectroluminescence seen from both junctions is considered to originate from\nthe GaAs quantum well layer in the device. The lithographic techniques that we\nhave developed are compatible for further integration of gated quantum devices\nsuch as single-electron pumps to build on-demand single-photon sources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
