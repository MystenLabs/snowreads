Unlike other approaches, e.g., Fully-connected Neural\nNetwork (FCNN) or Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based methods that are used to\nmodel the system states directly, the proposed approach embraces a Neural\nOrdinary Differential Equation (NODE) paradigm that models the derivatives of\nthe system states. A central part of the proposed methodology is its capacity\nto learn the multibody system dynamics from prior physical knowledge and\nconstraints combined with data inputs. This learning process is facilitated by\na constrained optimization approach, which ensures that physical laws and\nsystem constraints are accounted for in the simulation process.
