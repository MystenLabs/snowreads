In the most important case of $F$ being an\n$L_p$-norm with $p=\\infty$, which is a supremum norm, it is well-known that\n$\\mathbf{DI}_F = \\mathbf{BA}\\cup \\mathbb{Q}$, where $\\mathbf{BA}$ is a set of\nbadly approximable numbers. It is also known that $\\mathbf{BA}$ and each\n$\\mathbf{DI}_F$ are of measure zero and of full Hausdorff dimension.\n  Using classification of critical lattices for unit balls in $L_p$, we provide\na complete and effective characterization of\n$\\mathbf{DI}_p:=\\mathbf{DI}_{F^{[p]}}$ in terms of the occurrence of patterns\nin regular continued fraction expansions, where $F^{[p]}$ is an $L_p$-norm with\n$p\\in[1,\\infty)$. This yields several corollaries. In particular, we resolve\ntwo open questions by Kleinbock and Rao by showing that the set\n$\\mathbf{DI}_{p}\\setminus \\mathbf{BA}$ is of full Hausdorff dimension, as well\nas proving some results about the size of the difference\n$\\mathbf{DI}_{p_1}\\setminus \\mathbf{DI}_{p_2}$. To be precise, we show that the\nset difference of Dirichlet improvable numbers in Euclidean norm ($p=2$) minus\nDirichlet improvable numbers in taxicab norm ($p=1$) and vice versa, that is\n$\\mathbf{DI}_{2}\\setminus \\mathbf{DI}_{1}$ and $\\mathbf{DI}_{1}\\setminus\n\\mathbf{DI}_{2}$, are of full Hausdorff dimension.\n  We also find all values of $p$, for which the set\n$\\mathbf{DI}_p^c\\cap\\mathbf{BA}$ has full Hausdorff dimension.\n  Finally, our characterization result implies that the number $e$ satisfies\n$e\\in \\mathbf{DI}_p$ if and only if $p\\in(1,2)\\cup(p_0,\\infty)$ for some\nspecial constant $p_0\\approx2.57$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
