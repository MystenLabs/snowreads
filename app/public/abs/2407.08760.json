Here, we build an effective field theory for SWSSB of a global\nU(1) symmetry; the answer exactly reproduces the Schwinger-Keldysh effective\nfield theory of diffusion for the conserved charge. We conclude that\nhydrodynamics can be understood as a theory of \"superfluidity\" for the broken\nstrong symmetry: a non-vanishing susceptibility is a measurable order parameter\nfor SWSSB, the diffusion mode is the Goldstone boson of the spontaneously\nbroken continuous symmetry, and a generalization of Goldstone's Theorem implies\nthat the diffusion mode is always long-lived. This perspective provides a\ntransparent physical explanation for the unusual \"reparameterization\"\nsymmetries which are a necessary ingredient of Schwinger-Keldysh effective\nfield theories for \"normal fluids\".\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LPSswzrhUMFlS7OwBs4VmG9ZeXEZ_xVJtNLu00SOf1g","pdfSize":"246710"}
