In this context, $\\varepsilon$-chains\nare a finite collection of points with distance at most $\\varepsilon$ between\nconsecutive points. They play the role of discrete versions of curves. Chain\nupper gradients are defined accordingly and the chain Sobolev space is defined\nby letting the size parameter $\\varepsilon$ going to zero. In the complete\nsetting, we prove that the chain Sobolev space is equal to the classical\nnotions of Sobolev spaces in terms of relaxation of upper gradients or of the\nlocal Lipschitz constant of Lipschitz functions. The proof of this fact is\ninspired by a recent technique developed by Eriksson-Bique. In the possible\nnon-complete setting, we prove that the chain Sobolev space is equal to the one\ndefined via relaxation of the local Lipschitz constant of Lipschitz functions,\nwhile in general they are different from the one defined via upper gradients\nalong curves. We apply the theory developed in the paper to prove equivalent\nformulations of the Poincar\\'{e} inequality in terms of pointwise estimates\ninvolving $\\varepsilon$-upper gradients, lower bounds on modulus of chains\nconnecting points and size of separating sets measured with the Minkowski\ncontent in the non-complete setting. Along the way, we discuss the notion of\nweak $\\varepsilon$-upper gradients and asymmetric notions of integral along\nchains.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
