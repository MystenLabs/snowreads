However, achieving the necessary fine\ncontrol over the dynamics and specificity of the bonds between such particles\nremains a challenge. Here we demonstrate such control in bonds mediated by\ndepletion interactions between anisotropic colloids that we 3D-print in the\nshape of half disks with sub-micron resolution. When brought together by\ndiffusion, the particles interact in different configurations but the\ninteraction through the flat faces is by far the longest-lasting. All bonds are\nflexible and transient, and we demonstrate control over their life time through\nthe depletant concentration in quantitative agreement with a simple physical\nmodel. This basic design could be extended to manufacture particles with\nmultiple binding sites to engineer directional assembly with multiple\nparticles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
