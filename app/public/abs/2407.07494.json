LSB imaging reveals many interesting\nstructures, though these are frequently confused with galactic dust\ncontamination, due to a strong local visual similarity. We propose a novel\nunified approach to multi-class segmentation of galactic structures and of\nextended amorphous image contaminants. Our panoptic segmentation model combines\nMask R-CNN with a contaminant specialised network and utilises an adaptive\npreprocessing layer to better capture the subtle features of LSB images.\nFurther, a human-in-the-loop training scheme is employed to augment ground\ntruth labels. These different approaches are evaluated in turn, and together\ngreatly improve the detection of both galactic structures and contaminants in\nLSB images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y_ohm7ExPBCuvKUK0inHb5B6UIfzHTOgS4CAVGs0BH8","pdfSize":"5997026","objectId":"0x6ff4d0062acfa5cec17e055758ae020bd3165c10153a3a7c72083759a254f4c0","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
