The considered\nmodel for the trend and activity features can be written as a Stochastic\nVolterra Equation (SVE) with non-convolutional and non-bounded kernels as well\nas non-Lipschitz coefficients. We first prove the existence and uniqueness of a\nsolution to the SVE under integrability and regularity assumptions on the two\nkernels and under a condition on the second kernel weighting the past squared\nreturns which ensures that the activity feature is bounded from below by a\npositive constant. Then, assuming in addition that the kernel weighting the\npast returns is of exponential type and that an inequality relating the\nlogarithmic derivatives of the two kernels with respect to their second\nvariables is satisfied, we show the positivity of the volatility process which\nis obtained as a non-linear function of the SVE's solution. We show numerically\nthat the choice of an exponential kernel for the kernel weighting the past\nreturns has little impact on the quality of model calibration compared to other\nchoices and the inequality involving the logarithmic derivatives is satisfied\nby the calibrated kernels. These results extend those of Nutz and Valdevenito\n(2023).\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
