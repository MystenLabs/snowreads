Progress towards scalable integration necessitates a high\nquantum efficiency and an efficient photon collection. In this context, we\ncompare the optical characteristics of individual hBN color centers generated\nby electron irradiation, in two different electromagnetic environments. We keep\ntrack of well-identified emitters that we characterize before and after dry\ntransfer of exfoliated crystals. This comparison provides information about\ntheir quantum efficiency - which we find close to unity - as well as their\nvertical position in the crystal with nanometric precision, which we find away\nfrom the flake surfaces. Our work suggests hybrid dielectric-metal planar\nstructures as an efficient tool for characterizing quantum emitters in addition\nto improving the count rate, and can be generalized to other emitters in 2D\nmaterials or in planar photonic structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ISfQpOxrdbaLgZKfcmgFHVscRjxx0XSjLur2NJ5UaQk","pdfSize":"985559"}
