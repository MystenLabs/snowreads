The restoring tool is represented by several\nnonzero Larmor frequencies in the Hamiltonian. To simplify the analysis we use\ntwo approximating models including either step-wise or pulse-type\ntime-dependence of the Larmor frequencies. Restoring in spin chains with up to\n20 nodes is studied. Studying PTZ, we consider the zigzag and rectangular\nconfigurations and optimize the transfer of the 0-order coherence matrix using\ngeometrical parameters of the communication line as well as the special unitary\ntransformation of the extended receiver. Overall observation is that XXZ-chains\nrequire longer time for state transfer than XX-chains, which is confirmed by\nthe analytical study of the evolution under the nearest-neighbor approximation.\nWe demonstrate the exponential increase of the state-transfer time with the\nspin chain length.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
