In particular, the use of symmetric quantum states is\nuseful in many relevant applications. In this work, we analyze the task of\nreconstructing the density matrices of symmetric quantum states generated by a\nquantum processor. For this purpose, we take advantage of an estimation\ntechnique that results to be equivalent to the quantum Maximum Entropy (MaxEnt)\nestimation, and which was recently adapted to quantum states with arbitrary\nsymmetries. The smart use of prior knowledge of the quantum state symmetries\nallows for a reduction in both, the number of measurements that need to be made\non the system, and the size of the computational problem to store and process\nthe data, resulting in a better overall performance of the estimator as well.\nAfter performing numerical simulations, we implement some examples of symmetric\nstates in IonQ quantum processors, and estimate them using the proposed\ntechnique. The results are in a good agreement with numerical simulations,\nshowing that the proposed method is a good estimator that allows to save both,\nexperimental and computational resources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
