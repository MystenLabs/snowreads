While it is a common belief that the major\nenergy consumption of mobile clients comes from the uplink data transmission,\nthis paper presents a novel finding, namely channel decoding also contributes\nsignificantly to the overall energy consumption of mobile clients in FL.\nMotivated by this new observation, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive\nchannel decoding scheme that leverages the intrinsic robustness of FL to model\nerrors. In particular, the robustness is exploited to reduce the energy\nconsumption of channel decoders at mobile clients by adaptively adjusting the\nnumber of decoding iterations. We theoretically prove that wireless FL with\ncommunication errors can converge at the same rate as the case with error-free\ncommunication provided the bit error rate (BER) is properly constrained. An\nadaptive channel decoding scheme is then proposed to improve the energy\nefficiency of wireless FL systems. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method maintains the same learning accuracy while reducing the channel\ndecoding energy consumption by ~20% when compared to an existing approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
