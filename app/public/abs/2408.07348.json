These characters offer extraordinary potential for acceleration\nprecision sensing and have attracted extensive attention in both fundamental\nand applied physics. Although considerable improvements of optical levitation\naccelerometers has been reported, the dynamic testing of the sensing\nperformance remains a crucial challenge before the utilization in practical\napplication scenarios. In this work, we present a dual-beam optical levitation\naccelerometer and demonstrate the test with dynamic inputs for the first time.\nAn acceleration sensing sensitivity of $0.1\\mu g$ and a measurement range of $\n1g$ are achieved. These advancements solidify the potential of optical\nlevitation accelerometer for deployment in practical domains, including\nnavigation, intelligent driving, and industrial automation, building a bridge\nbetween the laboratory systems and real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
