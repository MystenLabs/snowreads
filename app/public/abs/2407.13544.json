We use this\nconstruction to prove that the Brownian annulus is the scaling limit of\nBoltzmann triangulations with two boundaries. We also prove that the space\nobtained by removing hulls centered at the two distinguished points of the\nBrownian sphere is a Brownian annulus. Our proofs rely on a detailed analysis\nof the peeling by layers algorithm for Boltzmann triangulations with a\nboundary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
