Activation maps (AMs) reveal\nthese saliency regions, which are crucial for many Explainable AI (XAI)\nmethods. However, the direct exploitation of raw AMs in CNNs for feature\nattribution remains underexplored in literature. This work revises Class\nActivation Map (CAM) methods by introducing the Label-free Activation Map\n(LaFAM), a streamlined approach utilizing raw AMs for feature attribution\nwithout reliance on labels. LaFAM presents an efficient alternative to\nconventional CAM methods, demonstrating particular effectiveness in saliency\nmap generation for self-supervised learning while maintaining applicability in\nsupervised learning scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a-HpaQpqsdF3RKzDWYbu8zoCnWu72QsMP0LTRhjP_Tk","pdfSize":"2857124"}
