It has many applications and relations to\nother areas of mathematics and sciences. In this paper, we consider this\ndecomposition problem over a field of prime characteristic. We define a\nclassical orthogonal decomposition of a modular Lie algebra and construct it\nfor $\\mathfrak{sl}_n$ under certain sufficient conditions. Additionally, we\nprovide more detailed analysis of the problem when $n = 2$ and $3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
