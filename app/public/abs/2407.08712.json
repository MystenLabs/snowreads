This extends some recent results of McRedmond and Xu (2017),\nJovaleki\\'{c} (2021), and Cygan, \\v{S}ebek, and the first author (2023) from\nthe plane to higher dimensions. Our main result shows that the average time\nrequired for the convex hull in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to attain unit volume is at most\n$n\\sqrt[n]{n!}$. The proof relies on a novel procedure that embeds an\n$n$-simplex of prescribed volume within the convex hull of the Brownian path\nrun up to a certain stopping time. All of our bounds capture the correct order\nof asymptotic growth or decay in the dimension $n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
