However, the commonly used silica fibers\nhave a relatively low numerical aperture (NA) limiting the spatial resolution\nof a probe. On top of that, light propagation within the solid core generates\nauto-fluorescence and Raman background, which interferes with imaging. Here we\npropose to use a hollow-core fiber to solve these problems. We experimentally\ndemonstrate spatial wavefront shaping at the multimode hollow-core fiber output\nwith tunable high-NA. We demonstrate raster-scan and speckle-based compressive\nimaging through a multimode hollow-core fiber.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
