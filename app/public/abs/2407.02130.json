The description of $M$ is given in terms of the\ncorank of the infinitesimal Kobayashi metric of $M$, which is shown to be\nidentically constant on $M$. The main result of this article says that if $M$\nhas full Kobayashi corank, then $M$ can be written as an increasing union of\nthe unit ball; if $M$ has zero Kobayashi corank, then $M$ has a bounded\nrealization with a uniform squeezing constant; and if $M$ has an intermediate\nKobayashi corank, then $M$ has a local weak vector bundle structure. The above\ndescription of $M$ is used to show that the dimension of the Bergman space of\n$M \\subseteq \\mathbb{C}^d$ is either zero or infinity. This settles\nWiegerinck's conjecture for those pseudoconvex domains in higher dimensions\nthat are increasing union of bounded domains with a common uniform squeezing\nconstant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
