The resulting minimax problem is notoriously\ndifficult to solve due to its inherent non-convexity. In this paper, we\ndemonstrate that, under mild conditions, the robust risk evaluation of a given\npolicy can be expressed in an equivalent recursive form. Furthermore, assuming\nstagewise independence, we derive equivalent dynamic programming reformulations\nto find an optimal robust policy that is time-consistent and well-defined on\nunseen sample paths. Our reformulations reconcile two modeling frameworks: the\nmultistage-static formulation (with nested distance) and the multistage-dynamic\nformulation (with one-period Wasserstein distance). Moreover, we identify\ntractable cases when the value functions can be computed efficiently using\nconvex optimization techniques.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jTv-JILtKIyMkNjBFS_qqLXAw_nbbKTVVcRsPjxzvMU","pdfSize":"2198891"}
