We\ndevelop an asymptotic model for the combined effects of rotation and wall\nslippage. Linear stability analysis indicates that wall slippage enhances\ninstability on both surfaces, while rotation has differing impacts: it\namplifies instability due to slip for outer surface flow but reduces it for\ninner surface flow. A weakly nonlinear stability analysis is then conducted to\nexplore the combined impact of rotation and wall slip on flow stability beyond\nthe linear regime, including the bifurcation of the nonlinear evolution\nequation for both surfaces. The traveling wave solution of the model is\nanalyzed, showing how rotation affects nonlinear wave speed with a slippery\nwall. A stability analysis of the traveling wave solutions is also performed.\nNumerical simulations of the nonlinear evolution of the free surface reveal\nthat increasing slip length enhances the choke phenomenon in inner surface\nflow, while rotation can delay this effect. Additionally, simulations show that\nfor flow along the outer surface of a slippery rotating cylinder, the film\ntends to break up into droplets in the presence of rotation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
