FMRC is based on the mathematical principles\nof lumpability and decomposability, which we reformulate into a conditional\nprobability framework for efficient data-driven optimization using deep\ngenerative models. While FMRC does not explicitly learn the well-established\ntransfer operator or its eigenfunctions, it can effectively encode the dynamics\nof leading eigenfunctions of the system transfer operator into its\nlow-dimensional RC space. We further quantitatively compare its performance\nwith several state-of-the-art algorithms by evaluating the quality of Markov\nState Models (MSM) constructed in their respective RC spaces, demonstrating the\nsuperiority of FMRC in three increasingly complex biomolecular systems.\nFinally, we discuss its potential applications in downstream applications such\nas enhanced sampling methods and MSM construction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
