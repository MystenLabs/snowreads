We explain how to construct it from\ncoordinate algebras of quantum $GL_n$ for all $n \\geq 0$. Then we use Donkin's\nwork on Ringel duality for $q$-Schur algebras to make precise the relationship\nbetween the $q$-Schur category and an integral form for the\n$U_q\\mathfrak{gl}_n$-web category of Cautis, Kamnitzer and Morrison. We\nconstruct explicit integral bases for morphism spaces in the latter category,\nand extend the Cautis-Kamnitzer-Morrison theorem to polynomial representations\nof quantum $GL_n$ at a root of unity over a field of any characteristic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
