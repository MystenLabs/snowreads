This work studies coupling\ncomprehension and generation with focus on continually learning from\ninteraction with users. We propose techniques to tightly integrate the two\ncapabilities for both learning and inference. We situate our studies in\ntwo-player reference games, and deploy various models for thousands of\ninteractions with human users, while learning from interaction feedback\nsignals. We show dramatic improvements in performance over time, with\ncomprehension-generation coupling leading to performance improvements up to 26%\nin absolute terms and up to 17% higher accuracies compared to a non-coupled\nsystem. Our analysis also shows coupling has substantial qualitative impact on\nthe system's language, making it significantly more human-like.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
