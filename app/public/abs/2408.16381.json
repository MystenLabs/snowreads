In medicine, clinical events are often monitored\nbetween two clinical visits, making the exact time of the event unknown and\ngenerating outcomes with a range format. As interest in automating healthcare\ndecisions grows, uncertainty quantification via predictive regions becomes\nessential for developing reliable and trusworthy predictive algorithms.\nHowever, the statistical literature currently lacks a general methodology for\ninterval targets, especially when these outcomes are incomplete due to\ncensoring. We propose a uncertainty quantification algorithm and establish its\ntheoretical properties using empirical process arguments based on a newly\ndeveloped class of functions specifically designed for interval data\nstructures. Although this paper primarily focuses on deriving predictive\nregions for interval-censored data, the approach can also be applied to other\nstatistical modeling tasks, such as goodness-of-fit assessments. Finally, the\napplicability of the methods developed here is illustrated through various\nbiomedical applications, including two clinical examples: i) sleep time and its\nlink with cardiovasculuar diseases ii) survival time and physical activity\nvalues.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
