We discuss\ntheorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the\nclassical realm. The notion of a ``semi-classical subspace'' is introduced.\nPartial signals and partial cloning can be executed on quantum states in\nsemi-classical subspaces. The No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says\nseparate and isolated physical systems evolving over time cannot have\nthermodynamic algorithmic entropies that are in synch. We look at future work\ninvolving the Kolmogorov complexity of black holes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
