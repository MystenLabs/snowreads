However, annotating a new dataset for a new task is usually\nunavoidable in real, since 1) a single existing dataset usually does not\ncontain all object categories needed; 2) using multiple datasets usually\nsuffers from annotation incompletion and heterogeneous features. We propose a\nnovel problem as \"Annotation-incomplete Multi-dataset Detection\", and develop\nan end-to-end multi-task learning architecture which can accurately detect all\nthe object categories with multiple partially annotated datasets. Specifically,\nwe propose an attention feature extractor which helps to mine the relations\namong different datasets. Besides, a knowledge amalgamation training strategy\nis incorporated to accommodate heterogeneous features from different sources.\nExtensive experiments on different object detection datasets demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our methods and an improvement of 2.17%, 2.10% in mAP can be\nachieved on COCO and VOC respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lJpPM0SvoHOGrYrVeWVOgZYfObuTP1Lst7pwPrfYGkM","pdfSize":"4981637"}
