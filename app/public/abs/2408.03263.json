In this work, we propose a\nmultiscale model using twin neural networks to investigate the properties of a\nfluid constrained between solid surfaces with complex shapes. The atomic scale\nmodel and the mesoscale model are connected by the coarse-grained potential\nwhich is represented by the first neural network. Then we train the second\nneural network model as a surrogate to predict the velocity profile of the\nconstrained fluid with complex boundary conditions at the mesoscale. The effect\nof complex boundary conditions on the fluid dynamics properties and the\naccuracy of the neural network model prediction are systematically\ninvestigated. We demonstrate that the neural network-enhanced multiscale\nframework can connect simulations at atomic scale and mesoscale and reproduce\nthe properties of a constrained fluid at mesoscale. This work provides insight\ninto multiscale model development with the aid of machine learning techniques\nand the developed model can be used for modern nanotechnology applications such\nas enhanced oil recovery and porous materials design.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Q3lhQ4oR3yJBfV7x8dJiTs6jfzsZW2DZSvt3VyCY8jI","pdfSize":"4813952"}
