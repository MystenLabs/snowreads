This study illustrates that, even if complete\ninformation is not publicly available to all arms but is shared among them, it\nis possible to achieve a similar equilibrium. The primary challenge lies in\ndesigning a communication protocol that incentivizes the arms to communicate\ntruthfully.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
