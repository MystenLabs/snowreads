The data are interpreted with a relativistic quasi-particle cluster\napproach in the mean-field approximation without any prior assumption on the\nthermal parameters of the model. An excellent reproduction is obtained for H\nand He isotope multiplicities, and compatible posterior distributions are found\nfor the unknown thermal parameters.\n  We conclude that the cluster-$\\sigma$-meson coupling is temperature\ndependent, becoming weaker when the temperature increases, in agreement with\nmicroscopic quantum statistical calculations. This implies a faster decrease of\nthe light cluster abundances with temperature than previously estimated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
