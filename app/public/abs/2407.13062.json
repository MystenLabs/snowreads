The Kalman Filter is\nknown for its recursive solution to the linear filtering problem in discrete\ndata, making it ideal for estimating states in dynamic systems by reducing\nnoise in measurements and processes. Our focus is on linear dynamic systems due\nto the LKF's assumptions about system dynamics, measurement noise, and initial\nconditions. We thoroughly explain the principles, assumptions, and mechanisms\nof the LKF, emphasizing its practical application in multi-sensor data fusion.\nThis fusion is essential for integrating diverse sensory inputs, thereby\nimproving the accuracy and reliability of state estimations. To illustrate the\nLKF's real-world applicability and versatility, the paper presents two physical\nexamples where the LKF significantly enhances precision and stability in\ndynamic systems. These examples not only demonstrate the theoretical concepts\nbut also provide practical insights into implementing the LKF in multi-sensor\ndata fusion scenarios. Our discussion underscores the LKF's crucial role in\nfields such as robotics, navigation, and signal processing. By combining an\nin-depth exploration of the LKF's theoretical foundations with practical\nexamples, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive and accessible\nunderstanding of multi-sensor data fusion. Our goal is to contribute to the\ngrowing body of knowledge in this important area of research, promoting further\ninnovations and advancements in data fusion technologies and encouraging their\nwider adoption across various scientific and industrial fields.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
