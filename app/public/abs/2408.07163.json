In this paper, an end-to-end\nflexible and hierarchical lane detector is proposed to precisely predict 3D\nlane lines from point clouds. Specifically, we design a hierarchical network\npredicting flexible representations of lane shapes at different levels,\nsimultaneously collecting global instance semantics and avoiding local errors.\nIn the global scope, we propose to regress parametric curves w.r.t adaptive\naxes that help to make more robust predictions towards complex scenes, while in\nthe local vision the structure of lane segment is detected in each of the\ndynamic anchor cells sampled along the global predicted curves. Moreover,\ncorresponding global and local shape matching losses and anchor cell generation\nstrategies are designed. Experiments on two datasets show that we overwhelm\ncurrent top methods under high precision standards, and full ablation studies\nalso verify each part of our method.
