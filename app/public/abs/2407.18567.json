We find a two-level hierarchy of spin propensity rules at\nzero magnetic field. The primary propensity rule states that nearly all\nmolecular products conserve the total hyperfine spin of reactant atomic pairs,\nwhile molecular products not conserving the total spin are highly suppressed.\nFor the dominant molecular products, there is a secondary propensity to\nconserve certain spin components of the reactant pair such as the atomic\nhyperfine spins, or the total electronic or nuclear spins. The second\npropensity varies across species and depends fundamentally on the interplay\nbetween effective electronic exchange and hyperfine interactions. The spin\nsensitivity of product-state distribution can potentially open up new avenues\nfor controlling state-to-state reaction rates in ultracold three-body\nrecombination.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
