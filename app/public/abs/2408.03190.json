The device performance relies on the bulk heterojunction\n(BHJ) nanomorphology, which develops during the drying process and additional\npost-treatment. This work studies the effect of thermal annealing (TA) on an\nall-small molecule DRCN5T: PC71 BM blend with phase field simulations. The\nobjective is to determine the physical phenomena driving the evolution of the\nBHJ morphology for a better understanding of the posttreatment/morphology\nrelationship. Phase-field simulation results are used to investigate the impact\non the final BHJ morphology of the DRCN5T crystallization-related mechanisms,\nincluding nucleation, growth, crystal stability, impingement, grain coarsening,\nand Ostwald ripening, of the amorphous-amorphous phase separation (AAPS), and\nof diffusion limitations. The comparison of simulation results with\nexperimental data shows that the morphological evolution of the BHJ under TA is\ndominated by dissolution of the smallest, unstable DRCN5T crystals and\nanisotropic growth of the largest crystals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
