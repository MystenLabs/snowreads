Recently, Fernando\net al. introduced a gauge-invariant, quantized interband index. This index may\nimprove the topological classification of material excited states because it is\nintrinsically an inter-level quantity. In this work, we expand on this index to\nintroduce its chiral formulation, and use it to make the selection rules\ngauge-invariant. We anticipate this development to strengthen the theory of\nquantum materials, especially two-dimensional semiconductor photophysics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
