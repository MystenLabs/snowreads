This class\nof matrices contains the totally positive matrices, and was first studied by\nSchoenberg (1930) to characterize Variation Diminution (VD), a fundamental\nproperty in total positivity theory. In this note, we classify all surjective\nlinear mappings $\\mathcal{L}:\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}\\to\\mathbb{R}^{m\\times n}$\nthat preserve: (i) sign regularity and (ii) sign regularity with a given sign\npattern, as well as (iii) strict versions of these.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
