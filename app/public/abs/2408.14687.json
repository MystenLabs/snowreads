Traditionally, drift is\nassumed to occur globally, affecting the entire dataset uniformly. However,\nthis assumption does not always hold true in real-world scenarios where only\nspecific subpopulations within the data may experience drift. This paper\nexplores the concept of localized drift and evaluates the performance of\nseveral drift detection techniques in identifying such localized changes. We\nintroduce a synthetic dataset based on the Agrawal generator, where drift is\ninduced in a randomly chosen subgroup. Our experiments demonstrate that\ncommonly adopted drift detection methods may fail to detect drift when it is\nconfined to a small subpopulation. We propose and test various drift detection\napproaches to quantify their effectiveness in this localized drift scenario.
