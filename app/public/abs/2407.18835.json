However, the\ncommonly employed maximum likelihood (ML) estimator is highly susceptible to\nmisspecification of the polychoric correlation model, for instance through\nviolations of latent normality assumptions. We propose a novel estimator that\nis designed to be robust to partial misspecification of the polychoric model,\nthat is, the model is only misspecified for an unknown fraction of\nobservations, for instance (but not limited to) careless respondents. In\ncontrast to existing literature, our estimator makes no assumption on the type\nor degree of model misspecification. It furthermore generalizes ML estimation\nand is consistent as well as asymptotically normally distributed. We\ndemonstrate the robustness and practical usefulness of our estimator in\nsimulation studies and an empirical application on a Big Five administration.\nIn the latter, the polychoric correlation estimates of our estimator and ML\ndiffer substantially, which, after further inspection, is likely due to the\npresence of careless respondents that the estimator helps identify.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Other Statistics","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
