First, we hope to give an accessible introduction\nto persistent equivariant cohomology. Given a topological group $G$ acting on a\nfiltered space, persistent Borel equivariant cohomology measures not only the\nshape of the filtration, but also attributes of the group action on the\nfiltration, including in particular its fixed points. Second, we give an\nexplicit description of the persistent equivariant cohomology of the circle\naction on the Vietoris-Rips metric thickenings of the circle, using the Serre\nspectral sequence and the Gysin homomorphism. Indeed, if $\\frac{2\\pi k}{2k+1}\n\\le r < \\frac{2\\pi(k+1)}{2k+3}$, then\n$H^*_{S^1}(\\mathrm{VR}^\\mathrm{m}(S^1;r))\\cong\n\\mathbb{Z}[u]/(1\\cdot3\\cdot5\\cdot\\ldots \\cdot (2k+1)\\, u^{k+1})$ where\n$\\mathrm{deg}(u)=2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
