We also review the results, all recently obtained, about the\ncompactness of the associated linearized Boltzmann operator, and briefly\ninvestigate the mixture case. Eventually, with a specific collision kernel, we\npresent a discussion about the physical relevance of the assumptions used to\nobtain the compactness results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
