In this Letter, we introduce an\ninnovative inclusive-tagging scheme that is capable of capturing the\nfour-momentum of an undetected particle on the signal side, such as a neutrino,\nK_L^0, etc., in collider experiments. This proposed scheme, based on an\nasymptotically recursive vector sequence, has the potential to catalyze a\nsignificant transformation in the capabilities of the inclusive tagging method\nand might also have promising applications in other fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
