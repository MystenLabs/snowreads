In this study, we focus on Andreev bound\nstates in multiterminal Josephson junctions with non-hermiticity induced by\nnormal metal or ferromagnetic leads. By investigating several systems of\ndifferent synthetic dimensions and symmetries, we predict fragile and stable\nnon-hermitian topological phases in these engineered superconducting systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
