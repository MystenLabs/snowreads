In this model, the contents of the scalar field and the\nforms of its potential are completely determined by the black hole spacetime.\nThe constant bumblebee field $b_\\mu$ affects a spacetime via the coupling\nconstant $\\ell$ and its motion equations. If $\\ell>-1$, the phantom field is\nadmissible and the conventional scalar field is forbidden; if $\\ell<-1$, the\nphantom field is forbidden and the conventional scalar field is admissible.\nWhen the bumblebee potential is quadratic, we obtain a wormhole solution\nasymptotically to Ellis wormhole, it can be called Ellis-bumblebee-phantom\n(EPB) wormhole which is regular everywhere and has no singularity. An\nSchwarzschild-like wormhole with naked singularity and an asymptotic flat\nphantom black hole solutions are also obtained. When the bumblebee potential is\nlinear, we derive a phantom (anti-)de-Sitter (dS/AdS) black hole solution which\ncan be asymptotic to Schwarzschild dS/AdS black hole. The phantom potential and\nthe Lagrange-multiplier $\\lambda$ behave as a cosmological constant $\\Lambda$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
