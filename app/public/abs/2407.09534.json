Our approach combines the Maximal Hessian Entry filter\nand a Deep-First Search algorithm-based technique to strike a balance between\ncomputational complexity and accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach in detecting the crack structure with predefined\nmisclassification probability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
