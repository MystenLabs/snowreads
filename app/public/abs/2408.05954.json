The systems we consider are well-structured\nwith respect to a specific well-quasi order. This allows us to decide a wide\nrange of verification problems, including control-state reachability,\ncoverability, and target, in a fixed finite abstraction of the infinite\nstate-space, called a 01-counter system. We show that several systems from the\nparameterized verification literature fall into this class, including\nreconfigurable broadcast networks (or systems with lossy broadcast),\ndisjunctive systems, synchronizations and systems with a fixed number of shared\nfinite-domain variables. Our framework provides a simple and unified\nexplanation for the properties of these systems, which have so far been\ninvestigated separately. Additionally, it extends and improves on a range of\nthe existing results, and gives rise to other systems with similar properties.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SQN2v-QoHeWgd9Ci6clz7TUNHi96P1PyNZQNNzi-8Wk","pdfSize":"918169"}
