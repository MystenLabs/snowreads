The General Parton Distributions (GPDs) for gluons which\nare an essential ingredient here, are constructed using double distribution\n(DD) representation. The calculated cross section for few sets of gluon GPDs\n$H_g$ describe fine $J/\\psi$ production experimental data from HERA to LHC\nenergies. Based on this approach we estimate $J/\\psi$ spin asymmetries\ndetermined by $E_g$ and $\\tilde{H}_g$. The GPDs factorization approach can be\nemployed to analyse heavy vector meson production in electron-proton\nscattering. Investigations of this reactions at future electron-ion colliders\nin USA and China can give an essential information on gluon GPDs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
