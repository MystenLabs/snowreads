For example, online shopping networks contain multiple physical\ntypes of consumers and products, as well as multiple relationship types such as\npurchasing and favoriting. More and more scholars pay attention to this\nresearch because heterogeneous graph representation learning shows strong\napplication potential in real-world scenarios. However, the existing\nheterogeneous graph models use data augmentation techniques to enhance the use\nof graph structure information, which only captures the graph structure\ninformation from the spatial topology, ignoring the information displayed in\nthe spectrum dimension of the graph structure. To address the issue that\nheterogeneous graph representation learning methods fail to model spectral\ninformation, this paper introduces a spectral-enhanced graph contrastive\nlearning model (SHCL) and proposes a spectral augmentation algorithm for the\nfirst time in heterogeneous graph neural networks. The proposed model learns an\nadaptive topology augmentation scheme through the heterogeneous graph itself,\ndisrupting the structural information of the heterogeneous graph in the\nspectrum dimension, and ultimately improving the learning effect of the model.\nExperimental results on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate substantial\nadvantages of the proposed model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
