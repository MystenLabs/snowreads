The altermagnetism manifests itself in the magnetic field\ndependence of the low harmonics associated with intra-band dynamics. Spin-orbit\ncoupling leads to additional higher energy peaks and plateau structures\noriginating from inter-band transitions. While the pure altermagnet or\nspin-orbit system exhibits no circular dichroism in the high-harmonic response,\nan altermagnetic system with spin-orbit coupling shows such a dichroism. We\nalso analyze the spin currents and their high harmonic spectrum.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
