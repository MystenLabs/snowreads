As a function of the squared momentum $s,$ the expansion coefficients\nexhibit thresholds that generally delineate regions for their computational\ntechniques. For the problem at hand, a sequence of integrations with a linear\nextrapolation as $\\varepsilon\\rightarrow 0$ may be performed to determine\nleading coefficients of the $\\varepsilon$-expansion numerically. For the\n\"baseball\" Feynman diagram, we have used extrapolation with respect to an\nadditional parameter to improve the accuracy of the $\\varepsilon$-expansion\ncoefficients in case of singularities internal to the domain.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
