Despite\nthe significant effort devoted in understanding how the microscopic structure\ninfluences the material performance, many aspects still remain elusive. If on\nthe one hand \\textit{ab initio} calculations respresent the technique of\nelection to study such a system, they present severe limitations in terms of\nthe size of the system that can be simulated. Such an aspect plays a\ndeterminant role, particularly when amorphous structure are to be investigated,\nas often results depend dramatically on the size of the system. Here, we\novercome this limitation by training a machine-learning (ML) interatomic model\nto \\textit{ab initio} data. We show that molecular dynamics simulations using\nthe ML model on much larger systems can reproduce experimental measurements of\nelastic properties, including elastic isotropy. Our study demonstrates the\nbroader impact of machine-learning potentials for predicting structural and\nmechanical properties, even for complex amorphous structures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
