Such a problem has been\nstudied previously for $\\kappa=1$ (i.e., maxima). However, in many\napplications, a general $\\kappa\\geq1$ is of great interest, which is addressed\nin this paper. We make four contributions: 1) we first show that the\ndistribution of the $\\kappa$th coordinate of a sum of random vectors,\n$\\boldsymbol{X}= (X_{1},\\cdots,X_{p})^{\\sf T}= n^{-1/2}\\sum_{i=1}^n\n\\boldsymbol{x}_{i}$, can be approximated by that of Gaussian random vectors and\nderive their Kolmogorov's distributional difference bound; 2) we provide the\ntheoretical justification for estimating the distribution of the $\\kappa$th\ncoordinate of a sum of random vectors using a Gaussian multiplier procedure,\nwhich multiplies the original vectors with i.i.d. standard Gaussian random\nvariables; 3) we extend the Gaussian approximation result and Gaussian\nmultiplier bootstrap procedure to a more general case where $\\kappa$ diverges;\n4) we further consider the Gaussian approximation for a square sum of the first\n$d$ largest coordinates of $\\boldsymbol{X}$. All these results allow the\ndimension $p$ of random vectors to be as large as or much larger than the\nsample size $n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
