These matrices retain\nmore information about a word than the original Parikh matrix mapping while\npreserving the homomorphic property. We build the generalization by first\nintroducing the Parikh factor matrix mapping and extend it to the Parikh\nsequence matrix mapping. We establish an interesting connection between the\ngeneralized Parikh matrices and the original ones and use it to prove that\ncertain important minors of a Parikh sequence matrix have nonnegative\ndeterminant. Finally, we generalize the concept of subword histories and show\nthat each generalized subword history is equivalent to a linear one.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
