We have\ndeveloped a model, in which Comptonization takes place in this outflowing\ncorona. We are able to reproduce quantitatively five observed correlations: a)\nthe time lag as a function of Fourier frequency, b) the time lag as a function\nof photon energy, c) the time lag as a function of $\\Gamma$, d) the time lag as\na function of the cut-off energy in the spectrum, and e) the long-standing\nradio - X-ray correlation. All of them with only two parameters (optical depth\nand width of the outflow), which vary in the same ranges for all the\ncorrelations. Our model does not require a compact, narrow relativistic jet,\nalthough its presence does not affect the results. The essential ingredient of\nour model is the parabolic shape of the Comptonizing corona. The outflow speed\nalso plays a minor role. Furthermore, the bottom of the outflow, in the hard\nstate, looks like a ``slab'' to the incoming soft photons from the disk, and\nthis can explain the observed X-ray polarization, which is along the outflow.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
