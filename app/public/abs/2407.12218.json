The\nfirst one determines the number of jumps, when traversing the tree in\ndepth-first-search, from a vertex to one closer to the root, and the second\nkeeps tracks of the sum of the jump-distances. He used clever but ad hoc\nhuman-generated arguments to find explicit expressions for their expectations.\nIn this methodological note, we illustrate the power of experimental\nmathematics and symbolic computation to do much more. We derive closed-form\nexpressions for the actual weight-enumerators according to these statistics\n(from which not only the expectations, but also the variances, and as many\nhigher moments as desired, can be obtained). We also actually give the first\neight moments, and conjecture that the first statistic (number of jumps) is\nasymptotically normal, and prove that the second one (sum of jump distances) is\ndefinitely not. In this revised version we are happy to announce that Stephen\nMelczer and Tia Ruza fully proved the asymptotic normality, and we provide a\nlink to their writeup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7coUvt1zItiYIApmxj5ymAYPQ8c6ped8IQ_QS2w_piE","pdfSize":"80441"}
