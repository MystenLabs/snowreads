Therefore, in this paper we propose the\nreconfigurable-intelligent-surface (RIS) assisted OAM scheme, where RIS is\ndeployed to weaken the information acquisition at eavesdroppers by adjusting\nthe OAM beams pointed to the eavesdropper and artificial noise (AN) is applied\nto interfere with the eavesdropper, thus significantly increasing the secrecy\nrates of short-range secure communications. Aiming at obtaining the maximum\nsecrecy rate, we develop the Riemannian manifold conjugate gradient (RMCG)\nbased alternative optimization (AO) algorithm to assign much power to low-order\nOAM-modes and optimize the OAM beams direction with the programmable RIS, thus\nrespectively enhancing and weakening the received signal strength at the\nlegitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Numerical results show that our\nproposed scheme outperforms the existing works in terms of the secrecy rate and\nthe eavesdropper's bit error rate.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
