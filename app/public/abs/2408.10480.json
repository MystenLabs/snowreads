By investigating the decay\nrates of the minimal traveling wave front, we propose a sufficient and\nnecessary condition that reveals the essence of propagation phenomena.\nMoreover, since our argument relies solely on the comparison principle, it can\nbe extended to more general monostable dynamical systems, such as nonlocal\ndiffusion equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
