Here,\nwe used two Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility HPC systems, Andes (a\ncommodity-type Linux cluster) and Frontier (an HPE Cray EX supercomputer),\nalong with quantum computing simulators from PennyLane and IBMQ to evaluate a\nhybrid QML program -- using a \"ground up\" approach. Using 1 GPU on Frontier, we\nfound ~56% and ~77% speedups when compared to using Frontier's CPU and a local,\nnon-HPC system, respectively. Analyzing performance on a larger dataset using\nmultiple threads, the Frontier GPUs performed ~92% and ~48% faster than the\nAndes and Frontier CPUs, respectively. More impressively, this is a ~226%\nspeedup over a local, non-HPC system's runtime using the same simulator and\nnumber of threads. We hope that this proof of concept will motivate more\nintensive hybrid QC/HPC scaling studies in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
