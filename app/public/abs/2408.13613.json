Here, we\nextend the mathematical definition of functions to construct a generalized\none-way function by virtually measuring the qubit of provable quantum one-way\nfunction and randomly assigning the corresponding measurement outcomes with\nidentical probability. Remarkably, using this generalized one-way function, we\nhave developed an unconditionally secure key distribution protocol based solely\non classical data processing, which can then utilized for secure encryption and\nsignature. Our work highlights the importance of information in characterizing\nquantum systems and the physical significance of the density matrix. We\ndemonstrate that probability theory and randomness are effective tools for\ncountering adversaries with unlimited computational capabilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sw6J_giIeT3iwvAXV49Rrz937d2fo514cxe5wJlL7Mw","pdfSize":"1515549"}
