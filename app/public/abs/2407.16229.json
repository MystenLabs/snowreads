For general\n$n\\geq 1$, the $n$-dimensional inverted Kloosterman sums were studied from both\ncomplex and $p$-adic point of view in our previous paper. In this note, we\nstudy the algebraic degree of the inverted $n$-dimensional Kloosterman sum as\nan algebraic integer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
