We give a detailed proof of a theorem of\nHuxley and Sargos, following the account of Bordell\\`es. Along the way we\ncorrect an oversight in the proof, changing some of the explicit values of the\nconstants in the theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RruY9NSS4FwNG75ySu7cQ4dZ_dxdn_km4rdWc45SrmI","pdfSize":"681550"}
