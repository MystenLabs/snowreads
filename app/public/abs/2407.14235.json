Inspired by\nthe work of M. Ludewig and G.C. Thiang, we consider the triviality of a\nprojection in the sense of coarse geometry, i.e. as triviality in the\n$K_0$-theory of the Roe $C^*$-algebra of $\\mathrm{R}^d$. We obtain in Theorem\n2.8 a threshold, depending on the dimension, for the decay rate of the\ngeneralized Wannier functions which implies topological triviality in Roe\nsense. This threshold reduces, for $d = 2$, to the almost optimal threshold\nappearing in the Localization Dichotomy Conjecture.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
