We generalize the celebrated one-axis twisting (OAT)\nHamiltonian for $N$ qubits to qudits by including OAT interactions of equal\nstrengths between every pair of qudit levels, a protocol we call as balanced\nOAT (BOAT). Analogous to OAT for qubits, we find that starting from a product\nstate of an arbitrary number of atoms $N$, dynamics under BOAT leads to the\nformation of GHZ states for qutrits ($d=3$) and ququarts ($d=4$). While BOAT\ncould potentially be realized on several platforms where all-to-all coupling is\npossible, here we propose specific implementations using trapped ion systems.\nWe show that preparing these states with a fidelity above a threshold value\nrules out lower dimensional entanglement than that of the generalized GHZ\nstates. For qutrits, we also propose a protocol to bound the fidelity that\nrequires only global addressing of the ion crystal and single-shot readout of\none of the levels. Our results open a path for the scalable generation and\ncertification of high-dimensional multipartite entanglement on current\natom-based quantum hardware.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
