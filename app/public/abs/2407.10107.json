The game consists of a\nmin-max problem involving a cost functional that depends on the actions and\nresulting solutions to the hybrid system, defined as functions of hybrid time\nand, hence, can flow or jump. A terminal set conviniently defined allows to\nrecast both finite and infinite horizon problems. We present sufficient\nconditions given in terms of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs-like equations to\nguarantee to attain a solution to the game. It is shown that when the players\nselect the optimal strategy, the value function can be evaluated without\ncomputing solutions to the hybrid system. Under additional conditions, we show\nthat the optimal state-feedback laws render a set of interest asymptotically\nstable for the resulting hybrid closed-loop system. Applications of this\nproblem, as presented here, include a disturbance rejection scenario for which\nthe effect of the perturbation is upper bounded, and a security scenario in\nwhich we formulate an optimal control problem under the presence of a\nmaximizing attack.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ycDRagXPhso30mRMgs3-PCrBYn8n7BC9C3krLsBjryM","pdfSize":"1034984"}
