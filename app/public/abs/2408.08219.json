We propose a multiscale\nmethod to bridge this gap. Our method builds upon the general synthetic\niterative scheme for the mesoscopic Boltzmann equation, and integrates the\n$k$-$\\omega$ model in the macroscopic synthetic equation to address turbulent\neffects. We have not only validated this approach using the experimental data\nof turbulent flows, but also confirmed that the turbulence model exerts no\nundue influence on highly rarefied flows. Our method is then applied to\nopposing jet problems in hypersonic flight surrounding by rarefied gas flows,\nshowing that the turbulence could cause significant impacts on the surface heat\nflux, which cannot be captured by the turbulent model nor the laminar Boltzmann\nsolution alone. This study provides a viable framework for advancing our\nunderstanding of the interaction between turbulent and rarefied gas flows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
