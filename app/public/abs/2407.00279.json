No X-ray emission is detected at the location of either\nSN. Upper limits to the luminosity of up to 2 $\\times 10^{40}\\,$ erg s$^{-1}$\nare calculated for each SN, depending on the assumed spectral model,\ntemperature and column density. This luminosity is comparable to that of\nanother low-luminosity Type Ia SN, SN 2018fhw, that was observed with Chandra.\nIt is generally lower than upper limits calculated for Type Ia-CSM SNe observed\nin X-rays, and also below that of SN 2012ca, the only Type Ia-CSM SN to have\nbeen detected in X-rays. Comparisons are made to other Type Ia SN with a H line\nobserved in X-rays. The observations suggest that while the density into which\nthe SN is expanding may have been high at the time the H$\\alpha$ line was\ndetected, it had decreased considerably by the time of X-ray observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
