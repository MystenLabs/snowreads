The semi-discrete result is established via a dyadic\ndecomposition argument and local energy estimates in which the nonsmoothness of\nthe domain can be handled. The fully discrete result for multistep backward\ndifferentiation formulae is proved by utilizing the solution representation via\nthe discrete Laplace transform and the resolvent estimates, which are inspired\nby the analysis of convolutional quadrature for parabolic and fractional-order\npartial differential equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
