Such inequalities were originally studied for analytic\nfunctions by R. M. Gabriel [Proc. London Math. Soc. 28(2), 1928]. We show that\nthese results, unlike in the case of analytic functions, cannot be true in\ngeneral for $0< p \\le 1$. Therefore, we produce an inequality of a slightly\ndifferent type, which deals with the case $0<p<1$. An example is given to show\nthat this result is \"best possible\", in the sense that an extension to $p=1$\nfails. Then we consider the special case when $C$ is a circle, and prove a\nrefined result which surprisingly holds for $p=1$ as well. We conclude with a\nmaximal theorem which has potential applications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ra5h2L_HbJ43KHMhtU8-OAyzHLsOxl4EJi6suLGD1Ig","pdfSize":"155535"}
