Traditional NPUs, though effective for such operations, face\nchallenges in power, cost, and area when integrated into lightweight edge\ndevices. The RISC-V architecture, known for its modularity and open-source\nnature, offers a viable alternative. This paper introduces the RISC-V\nR-extension, a novel approach to enhancing DNN process efficiency on edge\ndevices. The extension features rented-pipeline stages and architectural\npipeline registers (APR), which optimize critical operation execution, thereby\nreducing latency and memory access frequency. Furthermore, this extension\nincludes new custom instructions to support these architectural improvements.\nThrough comprehensive analysis, this study demonstrates the boost of\nR-extension in edge device processing, setting the stage for more responsive\nand intelligent edge applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
