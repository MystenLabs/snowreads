However, their\nmodeling and control present challenges, and real-world deployment is hindered\nby the gap between simulation and reality. Moreover, enhancing situational\nawareness is critical. Several works in the literature proposed integrating UAV\noperation with immersive digital technologies, such as Digital Twin (DT) and\nExtended Reality (XR), to address these challenges. This paper provides a\ncomprehensive overview of current research and developments involving immersive\ndigital technologies for UAVs, including the latest advancements and emerging\ntrends. We also explore the integration of DT and XR with Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) algorithms to create more intelligent, adaptive, and\nresponsive UAV systems. Finally, we provide discussions, identify gaps in\ncurrent research, and suggest future directions for studying the application of\nimmersive technologies in UAVs, fostering further innovation and development in\nthis field. We envision the fusion of DTs with XR will transform how UAVs\noperate, offering tools that enhance visualization, improve decision-making,\nand enable effective collaboration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
