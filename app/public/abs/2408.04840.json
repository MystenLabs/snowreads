In this work, we introduce the versatile multi-modal large language\nmodel, mPLUG-Owl3, which enhances the capability for long image-sequence\nunderstanding in scenarios that incorporate retrieved image-text knowledge,\ninterleaved image-text, and lengthy videos. Specifically, we propose novel\nhyper attention blocks to efficiently integrate vision and language into a\ncommon language-guided semantic space, thereby facilitating the processing of\nextended multi-image scenarios. Extensive experimental results suggest that\nmPLUG-Owl3 achieves state-of-the-art performance among models with a similar\nsize on single-image, multi-image, and video benchmarks. Moreover, we propose a\nchallenging long visual sequence evaluation named Distractor Resistance to\nassess the ability of models to maintain focus amidst distractions. Finally,\nwith the proposed architecture, mPLUG-Owl3 demonstrates outstanding performance\non ultra-long visual sequence inputs. We hope that mPLUG-Owl3 can contribute to\nthe development of more efficient and powerful multimodal large language\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
