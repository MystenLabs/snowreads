We calculate\nthe period integrals of the WKB solution to the ODE along the Pochhammer\ncontour, where the WKB expansions correspond to the classical conserved\ncurrents of the Drinfeld-Sokolov integrable hierarchies. We also compute the\nintegrals of motion for $WA_{r}$($WD_{r}$) algebras on a cylinder. Their\neigenvalues on the vacuum state are confirmed to agree with the period\nintegrals up to the sixth order. These results generalize the ODE/IM\ncorrespondence to higher-order ODEs and can be used to predict higher-order\nintegrals of motion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
