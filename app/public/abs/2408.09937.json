Unlike its classical counterparts, the role of data in\nquantum machine learning has not been fully understood. In this work, we\nquantify the performances of quantum machine learning in the landscape of\nquantum data. Provided that the encoding of quantum data is sufficiently\nrandom, the performance, we find that the training efficiency and\ngeneralization capabilities in quantum machine learning will be exponentially\nsuppressed with the increase in the number of qubits, which we call \"the curse\nof random quantum data\". Our findings apply to both the quantum kernel method\nand the large-width limit of quantum neural networks. Conversely, we highlight\nthat through meticulous design of quantum datasets, it is possible to avoid\nthese curses, thereby achieving efficient convergence and robust\ngeneralization. Our conclusions are corroborated by extensive numerical\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HCISNpiAhBJM3Y58hUzg5Umi0aQO71DbCT65a0t81KE","pdfSize":"3891158"}
