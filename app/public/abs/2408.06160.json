Here, we further reduce the required quantum resources by decomposing\nthe trial wavefunction into classical and quantum parts, respectively treated\nby classical and quantum devices, within the contextual subspace projection\nformalism. Importantly, we show that our algorithm is compatible with the\nrecently developed matchgate shadow protocol for efficient overlap calculation\nin QC-AFQMC. Investigating the nitrogen dimer and the reductive decomposition\nof ethylene carbonate in lithium-based batteries, we observe that our method\noutperforms a number of established algorithm for ground state energy\ncomputations, while reaching chemical accuracy with less than half of the\noriginal number of qubits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
