We address related\nissues by examining the influence of the QD packing fraction (PF) on the charge\ntransport and transmission in QD arrays. Using transfer matrix based algorithms\nand Monte Carlo simulations, we quantify the transmission across disordered QD\nassemblies. Our results indicate a critical packing fraction ($PF_c $) of\n$\\sim$ 0.64, marking a transition from a non-conducting to a conducting state,\naligning well with experimental observations and analytical predictions. This\nstudy enhances the understanding of transport in QD arrays, with implications\nfor designing efficient electronic devices based on disordered nanoscale\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
