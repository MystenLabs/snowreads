We derive a formula for these rates at nonzero\ntemperature, to leading order in the Fermi coupling and exact in the QCD\ncoupling. Utilizing a simple phenomenological holographic model dual to QCD, we\nstudy massless unpaired quark matter at high densities. We numerically compute\nthe rate for small deviations from beta equilibrium and derive an analytic\napproximation for small temperatures. Our findings reveal that, compared to the\nperturbative result, the rate is suppressed by logarithmic factors of the\ntemperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
