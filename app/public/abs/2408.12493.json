For ground-based telescopes, this\ncoupling is limited by atmospheric turbulence. We propose an integrated\nwavefront corrector based on silicon-on-insulator (SOI) photonics, which\nsamples the aberrated wavefront via a microlens array (MLA). The MLA focuses\nthe sampled wavefront onto an array of grating couplers that inject the\nbeamlets into the single-mode waveguides of the corrector. The beams in each\nwaveguide are then shifted in phase using thermo-optic phase shifters before\ncombining the co-phased beams into one single-mode waveguide. In this work, we\nanalyze the external factors that we anticipate will impact the performance of\nthe corrector. Specifically, we study the effects of the telescope pupil\nfunction with obscuration, determine whether the corrector requires tip/tilt\npre-correction, and analyze the impact of scintillation on the correction\nquality.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
