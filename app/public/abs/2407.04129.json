Despite the competition, interactions suppress all\nbut the dominant decay transition, leading to a 'winner takes all' dynamic\nwhere the system primarily settles into the dominant ground state. We prove\nthat, in the presence of permutation symmetry, this problem is exactly solvable\nfor any number of competing channels. Additionally, we develop an approximate\nmodel for the dynamics by mapping the evolution into a continuity equation for\na fluid, and show analytically that the dominant transition ratio converges to\nunity with increasing system size as a power-law, for any branching ratio. This\nnear-deterministic preparation of the dominant ground state has broad\napplicability. As an example we discuss a protocol for molecular\nphotoassociation where collective dynamics effectively acts as a catalyst,\namplifying the yield in a particular final state. Our results open new avenues\nfor many-body strategies in the preparation and control of quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
