In this paper,\nwe explore the performance and design considerations of a linearly multiplexed\nphoton number-resolving single-photon detector array, integrated on a single\nmode waveguide. Our investigation focus on defining and analyzing the fidelity\nof such an array under various conditions and proposing practical designs for\nits implementation. Through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we\nshow how propagation losses and dark counts may have a strong impact on the\nperformance of the system and highlight the importance of mitigating these\neffects in practical implementations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
