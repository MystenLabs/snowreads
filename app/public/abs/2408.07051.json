We\ncharacterise the breakage of meso-scale strands in the gel. Breakage events are\ndistributed homogeneously in space, corresponding to macroscopically ductile\nflow. At the microscale, a spatio-temporal analysis of structural and\nmechanical metrics connects properties of strands before and after they fail,\nindicating that strand breakage is statistically predictable. Using results\nfrom different scales, we discuss the interplay between creeping and aging\ndynamics, and we demonstrate a viscosity bifurcation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
