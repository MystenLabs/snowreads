Much of the light from the star gets scattered or absorbed by dust\nparticles, giving rise to the observed reflection nebula seen at visible and\nnear-IR wavelengths. Precursors to planetary nebulae (PNe), PPNe generally have\nnot yet undergone any ionization by UV radiation from the still-buried stellar\ncore. Bipolar PPNe are a common form of observed PPNe. This study lays the\ngroundwork for future dynamical studies by reconstructing the dust density\ndistribution of a particularly symmetric bipolar PPN, M1-92 (Minkowski's\nFootprint, IRAS 19343$+$2926). For this purpose, we develop an efficient\nsingle-scattering radiative transfer model with corrections for\ndouble-scattering. Using a V-band image from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST),\nwe infer the dust density profile and orientation of M1-92. These results\nindicate that M1-92's slowly expanding equatorial torus exhibits an outer\nradial cutoff in its density, which implicates the influence of a binary\ncompanion during the formation of the nebula.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
