We introduce and study the\nproperties of $(R, S)_\\star$-injective modules and the existences of $(R,\nS)_\\star$-injective envelopes. Besides, we show that every $R$-module has an\n$(R, S)$-injective envelope when $S$ is a pure-semisimple ring.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
