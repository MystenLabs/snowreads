We show that for discrete-variable quantum systems,\nFeynman path integrals take the form of walks on the graph whose weighted\nadjacency matrix is the Hamiltonian. By working out expressions for the\npartition function and transition amplitudes of discretized versions of\ncontinuous-variable quantum systems, and then taking the continuum limit, we\nexplicitly recover Feynman's continuous-variable path integrals.
