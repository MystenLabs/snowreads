To date, narrow-linewidth PL is only achieved in micrometer-sized\nexfoliated TMD flakes encapsulated in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). In this\nwork, we develop a growth strategy to prepare monolayer MoSe$_2$ on hBN flakes\nby molecular beam epitaxy in the van der Waals regime. It constitutes the first\nstep towards the development of large area single crystalline TMDs encapsulated\nin hBN for potential integration in electronic or opto-electronic devices. For\nthis purpose, we define a two-step growth strategy to achieve monolayer-thick\nMoSe$_2$ grains on hBN flakes. The high quality of MoSe$_2$ allows us to detect\nvery narrow PL linewidth down to 5.5 meV at 13 K, comparable to the one of\nencapsulated exfoliated MoSe$_2$ flakes. Moreover, sizeable PL can be detected\nat room temperature as well as clear reflectivity signatures of A, B and\ncharged excitons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KhuaQIwvtq9g0h7cdOlktPP2OdJNoAp8XHYLVljR9QU","pdfSize":"10595601"}
