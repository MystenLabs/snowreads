However, the\npower produced by the solar arrays is a function of the solar array size and\nheliocentric distance to the Sun, which also depends on the to-be-optimized\ntrajectory. The optimization of spacecraft solar array size, thruster modes,\nand trajectory can be performed simultaneously, capitalizing on the inherent\ncouplings. In this work, we co-optimize the spacecraft's solar array size,\nthruster modes, and trajectory using a direct optimization, which allows for\nmaximizing the net delivered mass. A particular challenge arises due to the\nexistence of discrete operating modes. We proposed a method for smoothly\nselecting optimal operation modes among a set of finite possible modes. The\nutility of the proposed method is demonstrated successfully by solving a\nbenchmark problem, i.e., the Earth to Comet 67P fixed-time rendezvous problem.\nThe results indicate that utilizing multiple modes increases the net useful\nmass compared to a single mode and leads to a smaller solar array size for the\nspacecraft.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
