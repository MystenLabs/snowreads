This monoculture is not necessarily\njustified by best performance evaluation, but may inherit from e.g. SW related\nrestrictions on the choice of HW platforms. To avoid running (further) into\npath dependency, alternate HW platforms need to be evaluated for performance\ncompared to existing HPC setup. As a result, it may turn out alternate HW\nplatforms are more efficient for HPC. In any case, even if performance\ndifferences are low, avoiding path dependencies that stem from HW choice\nrestrictions simplifies switching to different HW platforms in future, should\nsuitable systems evolve. Moreover, broadening the perspective to generic HW\nplatforms may trigger cooperation and wield influence on HW platform\ndevelopment, resulting in HW/SW co-design advantages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
