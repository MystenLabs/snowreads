This celebrated result mostly\nfollows from the work of Wilson in 1995 and heavily relies on the\nclassification of finite simple groups (CFSG). It easily follows that G is\nfinite-dimensional with additive and fine dimension and, in particular, that if\ndim(G)=3 then G is isomorphic to PSL(2,F) for some pseudofinite field F. We\ndescribe pseudofinite finite-dimensional groups when the dimension is fine,\nadditive and \\<4 and, in particular, show that the classification G isomorphic\nto PSL(2,F) is independent from CFSG.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
