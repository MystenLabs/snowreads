Therefore, beyond precise control\ndesign, it is crucial that the manipulator be resilient to potential impacts\nwithout relying on contact-force sensors, which mostly cannot be utilized. This\npaper proposes a novel force-sensorless robust impact-resilient controller for\na generic 6-degree-of-freedom (DoF) HHM constituting from anthropomorphic arm\nand spherical wrist mechanisms. The scheme consists of a neuroadaptive\nsubsystem-based impedance controller, which is designed to ensure both accurate\ntracking of position and orientation with stabilization of HHMs upon contact,\nalong with a novel generalized momentum observer, which is for the first time\nintroduced in Pl\\\"ucker coordinate, to estimate the impact force. Finally, by\nleveraging the concepts of virtual stability and virtual power flow, the\nsemi-global uniformly ultimately boundedness of the entire system is assured.\nTo demonstrate the efficacy and versatility of the proposed method, extensive\nexperiments were conducted using a generic 6-DoF industrial HHM. The\nexperimental results confirm the exceptional performance of the designed method\nby achieving a subcentimeter tracking accuracy and by 80% reduction of impact\nof the contact.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
