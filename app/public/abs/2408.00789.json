Digital agriculture approaches can be used to replace all\ntraditional agricultural system at very reasonable costs. It is very effective\nin optimising large-scale management of resources, while traditional techniques\ncannot even tackle the problem. In this paper, we proposed a dynamic management\nzone delineation approach based on Machine Learning clustering algorithms using\ncrop yield data, elevation and soil texture maps and available NDVI data. Our\nproposed dynamic management zone delineation approach is useful for analysing\nthe spatial variation of yield zones. Delineation of yield regions based on\nhistorical yield data augmented with topography and soil physical properties\nhelps farmers to economically and sustainably deploy site-specific management\npractices identifying persistent issues in a field. The use of frequency maps\nis capable of capturing dynamically changing incidental issues within a growing\nseason. The proposed zone management approach can help farmers/agronomists to\napply variable-rate N fertilisation more effectively by analysing yield\npotential and stability zones with satellite-based NDVI monitoring.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
