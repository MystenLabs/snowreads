The first consists of the clusterization\nof neutron and proton pairs; the second involves the tunneling process. A\nrobust protocol for calculating the normalized spectroscopic factor, as defined\nby Fliessbach, and its error is established and used for calculating the\nalpha-width for the $0^+$ states of the nucleus $^{44}$Ti. The Gamow Shell\nModel is used to calculate the structure part of the alpha-decay, while the\nGamow wave function determines the reaction part. The conventional and\nnormalized spectroscopic factors are calculated for the ground and excited\n$0^+$ states of $^{44}$Ti and the alpha-width and half-life of the excited\nstates. A near alpha-threshold state has an alpha half-life of 5 $\\mu$sec. The\nnormalization does not appreciably modify the ground-state clusterization,\nwhile the excited states do. The non-resonant continuum significantly increases\nthe clustering of some of the excited states, particularly the $T=2$ state. The\nnormalized formation amplitude looks like a single-particle wave function.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
