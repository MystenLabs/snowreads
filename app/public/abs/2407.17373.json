The systems are coupled so\nthat one population aims to solve the inner maximization problem, while the\nother aims to solve the outer minimization problem. The dynamics are\ncharacterized by a consensus-type interaction with additional stochasticity to\npromote exploration of the objective landscape. Without relying on convexity or\nconcavity assumptions, we establish theoretical convergence guarantees of the\nalgorithm via a suitable mean-field approximation of the particle systems.\nNumerical experiments illustrate the validity of the proposed approach. In\nparticular, the algorithm is able to identify a global min-max solution, in\ncontrast to gradient-based methods, which typically converge to possibly\nsuboptimal stationary points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-NCQZ1CNTa6wsh9EUGHNmMavcag9YBfPltYZo6fdlZQ","pdfSize":"1279148"}
