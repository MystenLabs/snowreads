Under the\nphysically motivated assumption of positive $\\sum m_{\\nu}$, we study the extent\nto which these limits are tightened by adding other available cosmological\nprobes, and robustly quantify the preference for the normal mass ordering over\nthe inverted one, as well as the tension between cosmological and terrestrial\ndata. Combining DESI data with Cosmic Microwave Background measurements and\nseveral late-time background probes, the tightest $2\\sigma$ limit we find\nwithout including a local $H_0$ prior is $\\sum m_{\\nu}<0.05\\,{\\text{eV}}$. This\nleads to a strong preference for the normal ordering, with Bayes factor\nrelative to the inverted one of $46.5$. Depending on the dataset combination\nand tension metric adopted, we quantify the tension between cosmological and\nterrestrial observations as ranging between $2.5\\sigma$ and $5\\sigma$. These\nresults are strenghtened when allowing for a time-varying dark energy component\nwith equation of state lying in the physically motivated non-phantom regime,\n$w(z) \\geq -1$, highlighting an interesting synergy between the nature of dark\nenergy and laboratory probes of the mass ordering. If these tensions persist\nand cannot be attributed to systematics, either or both standard neutrino\n(particle) physics or the underlying cosmological model will have to be\nquestioned.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
