Previous chapters have already described the breadth of\noutcomes associated with discounting (Odum et al. 2020) and other background\ninformation (Odum 2011). We focus on delay discounting, where indifference\npoints describe the value of a delayed reward that a participant would be\nwilling to accept in order to have the reward immediately for a variety of\ndelays. This chapter describes the two-stage approach to analyzing discounting\ndata, as this is the simplest approach that is also statistically defensible.\nThe two-stage approach first quantifies the discounting rate of each\nparticipant individually, and second stage analyzes these rates as a function\nof relevant variables (e.g., between smokers and non-smokers)\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
