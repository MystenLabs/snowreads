Under such conditions with optimal $\\theta$ depending on $n$ and\n$\\alpha$, we prove two differentiable sphere theorems in dimensions three and\nfour, a homological sphere theorem in higher dimensions, and a curvature\ncharacterization of K\\\"ahler space forms. These results generalize recent works\ncorresponding to $\\theta =0$ of Cao-Gursky-Tran, Nienhaus-Petersen-Wink, and\nthe author. Moreover, examples are provided to demonstrate the sharpness of all\nresults.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
