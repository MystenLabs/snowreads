The Sivers asymmetry has been the focus\nof much attention in QCD phenomenology and is yet to be understood at the quark\nlevel. In this Letter, we present a lattice QCD calculation of the spatial\ndistribution of a colour-Lorentz force acting on the struck quark in a proton.\nWe determine a spin-independent confining force, as well as spin-dependent\nforce distributions with local forces on the order of 3 GeV/fm. These\ndistributions offer a complementary picture of the Sivers asymmetry in\ntransversely polarised deep-inelastic scattering.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p2uaD7TkD-_b2jagObTbM-idzDTj2XVyVHPt8JhHSk4","pdfSize":"2559769"}
