Establishing the relationship between polymer\nrepresentations and their properties is crucial to the computational design and\nscreening of potential polymers via machine learning. The quality of the\nrepresentation significantly influences the effectiveness of these\ncomputational methods. Here, we present a self-supervised contrastive learning\nparadigm, PolyCL, for learning high-quality polymer representation without the\nneed for labels. Our model combines explicit and implicit augmentation\nstrategies for improved learning performance. The results demonstrate that our\nmodel achieves either better, or highly competitive, performances on transfer\nlearning tasks as a feature extractor without an overcomplicated training\nstrategy or hyperparameter optimisation. Further enhancing the efficacy of our\nmodel, we conducted extensive analyses on various augmentation combinations\nused in contrastive learning. This led to identifying the most effective\ncombination to maximise PolyCL's performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"smbUDKqj3FrnKVN7ZRpazYkrwE9X7wj094XPfKfg8-o","pdfSize":"3958963"}
