On the dependence of adsorption strength and\nactivity characterized by Peclet number (Pe), the polymer displays two typical\nstates on the surface: adsorption and desorption states. We find the diffusion\nbehavior of ABPO parallel to the surface yields the \"active Rouse model\" and\nactivity causes the adsorption-desorption transition at a certain adsorption\nstrength. Particular attention is paid to how the desorption time changes with\nthe activity. At intermediate activity, desorption time displays an exponential\ndecay with the inverse of effective temperature. Further, we observed a\nnon-monotonic dependence of desorption time on the rotation diffusion\ncoefficient of the monomer and found it exists a scaling relation with chain\nlength N. Our results highlight the activity can be used to regulate the\npolymer adsorption and desorption behavior.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
