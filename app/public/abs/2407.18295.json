The\ncalculation is valid for general orbits in a general frame, but in a particular\ncoordinate system which is an extension of the Burke-Thorne coordinate system\nat the lowest order. With the radiation-reaction acceleration, we derive (from\nfirst principles) the flux-balance laws associated with the energy, the angular\nand linear momenta, and the center-of-mass position, in a general frame and up\nto 4.5PN order. Restricting our attention to the frame of the center of mass,\nwe point out that the equations of motion acquire a non-local-in-time\ncontribution at the 4.5PN order, made of the integrated flux of linear momentum\n(responsible for the recoil of the source) together with the instantaneous flux\nof center-of-mass position. The non-local contribution was overlooked in the\npast literature, which assumed locality of the radiation-reaction force in the\ncenter of mass frame at 4.5PN order. We discuss the consequences of this\nnon-local effect and obtain consistent non-local equations of motion and flux\nbalance laws at 4.5PN order in the center-of-mass frame.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"URlEmNsiKygL_6g2U5ChWSXMxchtE7s7CFqB7SuUSws","pdfSize":"644377"}
