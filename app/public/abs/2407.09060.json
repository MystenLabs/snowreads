We compute, at\nthe CC3 level of theory, the singlet and triplet vertical transition energies\nassociated with the low-lying excited states. This leads to a collection of\nmore than 120 new highly-accurate excitation energies. Subsequently, we employ\nthese reference values to benchmark a series of lower-order wave function\napproaches, including the popular ADC(2) and CC2 schemes, as well as\ntime-dependent density-functional theory (TD-DFT), both with and without\napplying the Tamm-Dancoff approximation (TDA). At the TD-DFT level, we evaluate\na large panel of global, range-separated, local, and double hybrid functionals.\nAdditionally, we assess the performance of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE)\nformalism relying on both $G_0W_0$ and ev$GW$ quasiparticle energies evaluated\nfrom various starting points. It turns out that CC2 and ADC(2.5) are the most\naccurate models amongst those with respective $\\mathcal{O}(N^5)$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^6)$ scalings with system size. In contrast, CCSD does not\noutperform CC2. The best performing exchange-correlation functionals include\nBMK, M06-2X, M06-SX, CAM-B3LYP, $\\omega$B97X-D, and LH20t, with average\ndeviations of approximately 0.20 eV or slightly below. Errors on vertical\nexcitation energies can be further reduced by considering double hybrids. Both\nSOS-$\\omega$B88PP86 and SOS-$\\omega$PBEPP86 exhibit particularly attractive\nperformances with overall quality on par with CC2, whereas PBE0-DH and PBE-QIDH\nare only slightly less efficient. BSE/ev$GW$ calculations based on Kohn-Sham\nstarting points have been found to be particularly effective for singlet\ntransitions, but much less for their triplet counterparts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
