First, we investigate the behavior of the\nKretschmann scalar and singularities in this modified gravity approach. Next,\nwe introduce a newly defined time coordinate related to a stationary\nasymptotically flat spacetime. We also analyze the scattering effects and\nnumerically calculate and comprehensively examine the partial and total\nabsorption cross sections. At the high--frequency approximation, we find that\nthe absorption cross section tends to the geodesic capture cross section. The\ncontinued fraction method is applied to investigate the quasinormal modes, and\nwe explore the deviations of both the real and imaginary terms of the\nquasinormal modes from the Schwarzschild case in detail. We verify the relation\nbetween the shadow radius and the real part of the quasinormal frequencies at\nthe eikonal limit within this modified gravity framework. Finally, we examine\nthe energy emission rate.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
