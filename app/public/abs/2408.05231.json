The algorithm analyzes univariate time series and\ndetects critical points based on a newly proposed theorem that identifies\ncritical points using a Log Periodic Power Law function fits. Application of a\nnew algorithm for predictive maintenance analysis of industrial data collected\nfrom reciprocating compressor systems is presented. Based on the knowledge of\nthe dynamics of the analyzed compressor system, the proposed algorithm predicts\nvalve and piston rod seal failures well in advance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g6i_93X9svhaF8OHz-mQQstTHVXCsbMK2op6zmCwy6E","pdfSize":"1382606"}
