Group decision-making (GDM)\nsystems play a crucial role by facilitating consensus among participants with\ndiverse preferences. Discussions are one of the main tools people use to make\ndecisions. When people discuss alternatives, they use natural language to\nexpress their opinions. Traditional GDM systems generally require participants\nto provide explicit opinion values to the system. However, in real-life\nscenarios, participants often express their opinions through some text (e.g.,\nin comments, social media, messengers, etc.). This paper introduces a sentiment\nand emotion-aware multi-criteria fuzzy GDM system designed to enhance\nconsensus-reaching effectiveness in group settings. This system incorporates\nnatural language processing to analyze sentiments and emotions expressed in\ntextual data, enabling an understanding of participant opinions besides the\nexplicit numerical preference inputs. Once all the experts have provided their\npreferences for the alternatives, the individual preferences are aggregated\ninto a single collective preference matrix. This matrix represents the\ncollective expert opinion regarding the other options. Then, sentiments,\nemotions, and preference scores are inputted into a fuzzy inference system to\nget the overall score. The proposed system was used for a small decision-making\nprocess - choosing the hotel for a vacation by a group of friends. Our findings\ndemonstrate that integrating sentiment and emotion analysis into GDM systems\nallows everyone's feelings and opinions to be considered during discussions and\nsignificantly improves consensus among participants.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
