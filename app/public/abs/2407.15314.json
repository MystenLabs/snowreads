Here we demonstrate a room temperature, cavity-free,\nall-electric device reaching this regime at radio frequencies, enabled by a\nmechanically compliant parallel-plate capacitor with a nanoscale plate\nseparation and an aspect ratio exceeding 1,000. The device has four orders of\nmagnitude lower insertion loss than a comparable commercial quartz crystal, and\nachieves a position imprecision rivaling an optical interferometer. With the\nhelp of a back-action isolation scheme, we observe radiative cooling of\nmechanical motion by a remote cryogenic load. This work provides a\ntechnologically accessible route to high-precision sensing, transduction, and\nsignal processing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
