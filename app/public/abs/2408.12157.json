Inspired by the idea of large language model Chain of\nThought (CoT), this paper introduces a Sentiment Analysis of Thinking (SAoT)\nframework. The framework first analyzes the implicit aspects and opinions in\nthe text using common sense and thinking chain capabilities. Then, it reflects\non the process of implicit sentiment analysis and finally deduces the polarity\nof sentiment. The model is evaluated on the SemEval 2014 dataset, consisting of\n1120 restaurant reviews and 638 laptop reviews. The experimental results\ndemonstrate that the utilization of the ERNIE-Bot-4+SAoT model yields a notable\nperformance improvement. Specifically, on the restaurant dataset, the F1 score\nreaches 75.27, accompanied by an ISA score of 66.29. Similarly, on the computer\ndataset, the F1 score achieves 76.50, while the ISA score amounts to 73.46.\nComparatively, the ERNIE-Bot-4+SAoT model surpasses the BERTAsp + SCAPt\nbaseline by an average margin of 47.99%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
