Accelerating\nlesion detection from DBT using deep learning is hindered by limited data\navailability and huge annotation costs. A possible solution to this issue could\nbe to leverage the information provided by a more widely available modality,\nsuch as mammography, to enhance DBT lesion detection. In this paper, we present\na novel framework, CoMoTo, for improving lesion detection in DBT. Our framework\nleverages unpaired mammography data to enhance the training of a DBT model,\nimproving practicality by eliminating the need for mammography during\ninference. Specifically, we propose two novel components, Lesion-specific\nKnowledge Distillation (LsKD) and Intra-modal Point Alignment (ImPA). LsKD\nselectively distills lesion features from a mammography teacher model to a DBT\nstudent model, disregarding background features. ImPA further enriches LsKD by\nensuring the alignment of lesion features within the teacher before distilling\nknowledge to the student. Our comprehensive evaluation shows that CoMoTo is\nsuperior to traditional pretraining and image-level KD, improving performance\nby 7% Mean Sensitivity under low-data setting.
