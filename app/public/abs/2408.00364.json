In bulk\nmaterials, this first-order transition involves an invariant habit plane,\nconnecting coexisting phases: austenite and martensite. Theory predicts that\nthis plane should converge to a line in thin films, but experimental evidence\nis missing. Here, we analyze the martensitic and magnetic microstructure of a\nfreestanding epitaxial magnetic shape memory film. We show that the martensite\nmicrostructure is determined by an invariant line constraint using lattice\nparameters of both phases as the only input. This line constraint explains most\nof the observable features, which differ fundamentally from bulk and\nconstrained films. Furthermore, this finite-size effect creates a remarkable\ncheckerboard magnetic domain pattern through multiferroic coupling. Our\nfindings highlight the decisive role of finite-size effects in multiferroics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YKH8CnOp-dq6J9Fx7ilqOir1g8GRMKsLtaMVT-fITgg","pdfSize":"2174084","txDigest":"2ZXAMsfFMjYu3Fw9mbieqgiXCtrgaAYKczz6g8NofVkA","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
