Adherence to\nespecially security regulations -- a major concern in highly regulated domains\n-- renders Continuous Security Compliance of high relevance to industry and\nresearch.\n  Problem: One key barrier to adopting continuous software engineering in the\nindustry is the resource-intensive and error-prone nature of traditional manual\nsecurity compliance activities. Automation promises to be advantageous.\nHowever, continuous security compliance is under-researched, precluding an\neffective adoption.\n  Contribution: We have initiated a long-term research project with our\nindustry partner to address these issues. In this manuscript, we make three\ncontributions: (1) We provide a precise definition of the term continuous\nsecurity compliance aligning with the state-of-art, (2) elaborate a preliminary\noverview of challenges in the field of automated continuous security compliance\nthrough a tertiary literature study, and (3) present a research roadmap to\naddress those challenges via automated continuous security compliance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
