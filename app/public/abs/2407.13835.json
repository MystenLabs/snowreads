For the $\\lambda\\phi^4$\ninteraction in scalar field theory, or any interaction with a polynomial\nexpansion, upper bounds on the contributions of operators of a given sequency\nare derived. For the systems we have examined, observables computed in\nsequency-truncated wavefunctions, including quantum correlations as measured by\nmagic, are found to step-wise converge to their exact values with increasing\ncutoff sequency. The utility of SeqHT is demonstrated in the adiabatic state\npreparation of the $\\lambda\\phi^4$ anharmonic oscillator ground state using\nIBM's quantum computer ${\\textit ibm\\_sherbrooke}$. Using SeqHT, the depth of\nthe required quantum circuits is reduced by $\\sim 30\\%$, leading to\nsignificantly improved determinations of observables in the quantum\nsimulations. More generally, SeqHT is expected to lead to a reduction in\nrequired resources for quantum simulations of systems with a hierarchy of\nlength scales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ml1hZqBDtjXgw244JP11UYhaR6lCcfk7ZiHR19o1e0U","pdfSize":"1586481","objectId":"0x9f2d3571614e0773c7c9b1b71bc880fcaac810a013d2e26ec651fdbee206fcea","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
