The most commonly adopted approach to this task is to\nclassify users into behavior-based categories and analyze each of them\nseparately. However, this approach requires extensive data to fully understand\nuser behavior, presenting challenges in modeling newcomers without historical\nknowledge. In this paper, we propose a novel discrete event prediction\nframework for new users through the lens of causal inference. Our method offers\nan unbiased prediction for new users without needing to know their categories.\nWe treat the user event history as the ''treatment'' for future events and the\nuser category as the key confounder. Thus, the prediction problem can be framed\nas counterfactual outcome estimation, with the new user model trained on an\nadjusted dataset where each event is re-weighted by its inverse propensity\nscore. We demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework with a\nnumerical simulation study and two real-world applications, including Netflix\nrating prediction and seller contact prediction for customer support at Amazon.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
