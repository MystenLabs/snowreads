They often build on regular voxel grids as discrete\nrepresentations of 3D shape functions, such as SDF or radiance fields, either\nas the full shape model or as sampled instantiations of continuous\nrepresentations, as with neural networks. Despite their proven efficiency,\nvoxel representations come with the precision versus complexity trade-off. This\ninherent limitation can significantly impact performance when moving away from\nsimple and uncluttered scenes. In this paper we investigate an alternative\ndiscretization strategy with the Centroidal Voronoi Tesselation (CVT). CVTs\nallow to better partition the observation space with respect to shape occupancy\nand to focus the discretization around shape surfaces. To leverage this\ndiscretization strategy for multi-view reconstruction, we introduce a\nvolumetric optimization framework that combines explicit SDF fields with a\nshallow color network, in order to estimate 3D shape properties over\ntetrahedral grids. Experimental results with Chamfer statistics validate this\napproach with unprecedented reconstruction quality on various scenarios such as\nobjects, open scenes or human.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
