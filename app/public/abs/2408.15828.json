The LQG solution is singularity-free and can possess spin greater\nthan that of a Kerr black hole. The additional black hole hair, arising from\nquantum effects, significantly influences the particle dynamics around the\nblack hole. Under suitable physical conditions, the center-of-mass energy can\ngrow arbitrarily high during the collision of two generic particles in the\nspacetime of an extremal black hole. In the non-extremal case, there exists a\nfinite upper bound on the center-of-mass energy, the maximum value of which\ndepends on the LQG parameter. These results are particularly interesting from\nan astrophysical perspective, especially in the context of probing Planck-scale\nphysics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YiUztKNdhKeOhcIusLY1cSAAUnckBt9bYL2spRi2PvE","pdfSize":"795203"}
