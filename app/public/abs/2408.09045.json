First, we prove that the Cauchy\nproblem is local and global well-posedness in $L^2$ and $H^1$. Next, we\nestablish the existence of ground state solutions. Then we use these solutions\nto study the dichotomy of global existence versus blow-up in finite time.\nSimilar results were presented in the reference Noguera N. and Pastor A. 2022\nhttps://doi.org/10.1142/S0219199720500236 for the special case when the growth\nof the nonlinearities was quadratic. Here we will extend them to systems with\nnolinearities of order $p$ (cubic, quartic and so on). Finally, we recover some\nknown results for two particular systems, one with quadratic and the other with\ncubic growth nolinearities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
