Let G'=O(1,n;R) be the\nLorentz group and H' = O(1,n-1;R) be its subgroup. The authors Olafsson and\nSitiraju have constructed the spherical distributions, which are\n$H'$-invariant, as boundary values of some sesquiholomorphic kernels. In this\nsurvey article we will explore the connections of these kernels with reflection\npositivity and representations of the group G = SO(1,n;R)_e, which is the\nconnected component of the Lorentz group. We will also discuss the\nsingularities of spherical distributions in terms of their wavefront set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
