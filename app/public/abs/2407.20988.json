While\noverlooking the practical and hardware limitations of DMA, previous studies\nhave highlighted DMAs' potential to deliver high data rates while maintaining\nlow power consumption. In this paper, we address this oversight by analyzing\nthe impact of practical hardware limitations such as antenna efficiency, power\nconsumed in required components, processing limitations, etc. Specifically, we\ninvestigate DMA-assisted wireless communications in the uplink and propose a\nmodel which accounts for these hardware limitations. To do so, we propose a\nconcise model to characterize the power consumption of a DMA. For a fair\nassessment, we propose a wave-domain combiner, based on holography theory, to\nmaximize the achievable sum rate of DMA-assisted antennas. We compare the\nachievable sum rate and energy efficiency of DMA antennas with that of a\npartially connected hybrid phased array. Our findings reveal the true potential\nof DMAs when accounting for the limitations of both designs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
