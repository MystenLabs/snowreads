Wildcards (also called \"don't cares\" or \"holes\") are special\ncharacters that match any other character in the alphabet, similar to the\ncharacter \"?\" in Unix commands or \".\" in regular expression engines.\n  We consider the problem parametrized by $G$, the number of maximal contiguous\ngroups of wildcards in the input string. Our main contribution is a simple data\nstructure for this problem that can be built in $O(n (G/t) \\log n)$ time,\noccupies $O(nG/t)$ space, and answers queries in $O(t)$ time, for any $t \\in [1\n.. G]$. Up to the $O(\\log n)$ factor, this interpolates smoothly between the\ndata structure of Crochemore et al. [JDA 2015], which has $O(nG)$ preprocessing\ntime and space, and $O(1)$ query time, and a simple solution based on the\n``kangaroo jumping'' technique [Landau and Vishkin, STOC 1986], which has\n$O(n)$ preprocessing time and space, and $O(G)$ query time.\n  By establishing a connection between this problem and Boolean matrix\nmultiplication, we show that our solution is optimal up to subpolynomial\nfactors when $G = \\Omega(n)$ under a widely believed hypothesis. In addition,\nwe develop a new simple, deterministic and combinatorial algorithm for sparse\nBoolean matrix multiplication.\n  Finally, we show that our data structure can be used to obtain efficient\nalgorithms for approximate pattern matching and structural analysis of strings\nwith wildcards.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
