Using information-theoretic methods to\nrephrase the key idea of Maxwell and Boltzmann, the Sto{\\ss}zahlansatz, a far\nmore general, abstract ansatz is developed. An increase of the\nGibbs-Shannon-von Neumann entropy results without the usual coarse-graining.\nThe mathematical structure of the ansatz also provides avenues for efficient\ncomputation and simulation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
