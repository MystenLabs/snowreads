Conventional methods using encrypted\nimages degrade model performance compared with that of using plain images due\nto the influence of image encryption. In contrast, the proposed encryption\nmethod using restricted random permutation matrices can provide a higher\nperformance than the conventional ones.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
