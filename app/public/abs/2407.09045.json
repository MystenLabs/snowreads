Meanwhile, the\nwidespread use of routers offers new possibilities for ReID. This letter\nintroduces a method using WiFi Channel State Information (CSI), leveraging the\nmultipath propagation characteristics of WiFi signals as a basis for\ndistinguishing different pedestrian features. We propose a two-stream network\nstructure capable of processing variable-length data, which analyzes the\namplitude in the time domain and the phase in the frequency domain of WiFi\nsignals, fuses time-frequency information through continuous lateral\nconnections, and employs advanced objective functions for representation and\nmetric learning. Tested on a dataset collected in the real world, our method\nachieves 93.68% mAP and 98.13% Rank-1.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
