This catalog is four times\nlarger than the original Stripe 82X catalog, by including additional archival\ndata from the Chandra and XMM-Newton telescopes. Now covering $\\sim54.8$\ndeg$^2$ of non-overlapping sky area, the S82-XL catalog roughly doubles the\narea and depth of the original catalog, with limiting fluxes (half-area fluxes)\nof 3.4$\\times 10^{-16}$ (2.4$\\times 10^{-15}$), 2.9$\\times 10^{-15}$\n(1.5$\\times 10^{-14}$), and 1.4$\\times 10^{-15}$ (9.5$\\times 10^{-15}$) erg\ns$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ across the soft (0.5-2 keV), hard (2-10 keV), and full\n(0.5-10 keV) bands, respectively. S82-XL occupies a unique region of flux-area\nparameter space compared to other X-ray surveys, identifying sources with\nrest-frame luminosities from $1.2\\times 10^{38}$ to $1.6\\times 10^{47}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$ in the 2-10 keV band (median X-ray luminosity, $7.2\\times 10^{43}$ erg\ns$^{-1}$), and spectroscopic redshifts up to $z\\sim6$. By using hardness\nratios, we derived Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) obscuration obtaining a median\nvalue of $N_H=21.6_{-1.6}^{+1.0}$, and an overall, obscured fraction ($\\log\nN_H/\\mathrm{cm^{-2}}>22$) of $\\sim 36.9\\%$. S82-XL serves as a benchmark in\nX-ray surveys and, with its extensive multiwavelength data, is especially\nvaluable for comprehensive studies of luminous AGNs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
