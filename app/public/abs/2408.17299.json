In this\nstudy, we demonstrate that the efficiency of this acceleration can be\nsufficiently high to produce populations of relativistic and ultra-relativistic\nelectrons, with energies up to several MeV, which exceeds all previous\ntheoretical and simulation estimates. Using data from the low altitude ELFIN\nand CIRBE CubeSats, we show multiple events of relativistic electron bursts\nwithin the magnetotail, far poleward of the outer radiation belt. These bursts\nare characterized by power-law energy spectra and can be detected during even\nmoderate substorms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ltvn1Wf1VIp4FBw7ZttMJdN4mGmvJaDUuCv-4Gp9i0Y","pdfSize":"4774937"}
