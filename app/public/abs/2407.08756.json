These examples\nand counterexamples do not only illustrate the results obtained in [BS24], but\nshow the limitations of the results and the sharpness of the key assumptions.\nIn particular, we make use of a simple 3-state model in which we are able to\nrecover and illustrate all key results of the paper. This example also shows\nhow our characterization of perfectly cost-efficient claims allows to solve an\nexpected utility maximization problem in a simple incomplete market (trinomial\nmodel) and recover results from [DS06, Chapter 3], there obtained using\nduality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
