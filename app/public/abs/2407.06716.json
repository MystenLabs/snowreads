However, in\nreal-world web search engine environments, the document set is continuously\nupdated and expanded. Addressing these discrepancies and measuring the temporal\npersistence of IR systems is crucial. By investigating the LongEval benchmark,\nspecifically designed for such dynamic environments, our findings demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of a listwise reranking approach, which proficiently handles\ninaccuracies induced by temporal distribution shifts. Among listwise rerankers,\nour findings show that ListT5, which effectively mitigates the positional bias\nproblem by adopting the Fusion-in-Decoder architecture, is especially\neffective, and more so, as temporal drift increases, on the test-long subset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
