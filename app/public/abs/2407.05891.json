Such preferences,\nthat have been studied before in economics and fair division literature,\ncapture a simple and intuitive economic behavior; larger bundles are always\npreferred to smaller ones. We provide a fine-grained analysis for various\nsubclasses of leveled valuations focusing on two extensively studied notions of\nfairness, (approximate) MMS and EFX. In particular, we present a general\npositive result, showing the existence of $2/3$-MMS allocations under\nvaluations that are both leveled and submodular. We also show how some of our\nideas can be used beyond the class of leveled valuations; for the case of two\nsubmodular (not necessarily leveled) agents we show that there always exists a\n$2/3$-MMS allocation, complementing a recent impossibility result. Then, we\nswitch to the case of subadditive and fractionally subadditive leveled agents,\nwhere we are able to show tight (lower and upper) bounds of $1/2$ on the\napproximation factor of MMS. Moreover, we show the existence of exact EFX\nallocations under general leveled valuations via a simple protocol that in\naddition satisfies several natural economic properties. Finally, we take a\nmechanism design approach and we propose protocols that are both truthful and\napproximately fair under leveled valuations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
