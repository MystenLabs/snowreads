The library,\nwritten in C++, simplifies the crucial task of information reconciliation,\nensuring that both communicating parties share the same secret key despite the\nnoise. It offers a comprehensive set of tools, including modules for\nmultidimensional reconciliation, error correction, and data integrity checks.\nDesigned with user-friendliness in mind, the library hides the complexity of\nerror correction, making it accessible even to users without knowledge of\nerror-correcting codes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
