If we want to obtain a deep\ninsight into the formation, evolution, and intervention of cyberbullying in\ndevices at the edge of the Internet, it is necessary to explore more\nfine-grained roles. This paper presents a multi-level method for role feature\nmodeling and proposes a differential evolution-assisted K-means (DEK) method to\nidentify diverse roles. Our work aims to provide a role identification scheme\nfor cyberbullying scenarios for social edge computing environments to alleviate\nthe general safety issues that cyberbullying brings. The experiments on ten\nreal-world datasets obtained from Weibo and five public datasets show that the\nproposed DEK outperforms the existing approaches on the method level. After\nclustering, we obtained nine roles and analyzed the characteristics of each\nrole and their evolution trends under different cyberbullying scenarios. Our\nwork in this paper can be placed in devices at the edge of the Internet,\nleading to better real-time identification performance and adapting to the\nbroad geographic location and high mobility of mobile devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PZgSc0fVeUKfQDhA484ShCpoWGUOF-hpV_yTEqLossA","pdfSize":"840209"}
