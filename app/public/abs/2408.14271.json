It is given by\na system of linear partial differential equations in three variables of rank\nfive. Our results are based on a Jacobian elliptic fibration on Kummer surfaces\nand a GKZ hypergeometric system suited to the elliptic fibration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lvlc7ZyVMAVxXYnM6TnjVdj6vrI8Av08_tLYc1Cef5c","pdfSize":"294676"}
