We call this hypergraph as the associating hypergraph\non a loop $L$. We study certain properites of associating hypergraphs on the\nMoufang loop $M(D_n,2)$, where $D_n$ denotes the dihedral group of order $2n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
