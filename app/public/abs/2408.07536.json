This\nparadigm extends the boundaries of edge computing and remarkably improves the\nquality of services. However, due to the heterogeneous nature of computing and\nbandwidth resources in edge networks, it is challenging to dynamically allocate\ndifferent resources while adapting to the burstiness and high concurrency in\nserverless workloads. This article focuses on serverless function provisioning\nin edge networks to optimize end-to-end latency, where the challenge lies in\njointly allocating wireless bandwidth and computing resources among\nheterogeneous computing nodes. To address this challenge, We devised a\ncontext-aware learning framework that adaptively orchestrates a wide spectrum\nof resources and jointly considers them to avoid resource fragmentation.\nExtensive simulation results justified that the proposed algorithm reduces over\n95% of converge time while the end-to-end delay is comparable to the state of\nthe art.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sz5BCodIz_jzqexy8XQ4Fj709ZGZQt0qSrgM3Q4hb0A","pdfSize":"645261"}
