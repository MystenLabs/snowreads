To address this\nproblem, several states have implemented institutional reforms including the\nestablishment of map-drawing commissions. It is difficult to assess the impact\nof such reforms because each state structures bundles of complex rules in\ndifferent ways. We propose to model redistricting processes as a sequential\ngame. The equilibrium solution to the game summarizes multi-step institutional\ninteractions as a single dimensional score. This score measures the leeway\npolitical actors have over the partisan lean of the final plan. Using a\ndifferences-in-differences design, we demonstrate that reforms reduce partisan\nbias and increase competitiveness when they constrain partisan actors. We\nperform a counterfactual policy analysis to estimate the partisan effects of\nenacting recent institutional reforms nationwide. We find that instituting\nredistricting commissions generally reduces the current Republican advantage,\nbut Michigan-style reforms would yield a much greater pro-Democratic effect\nthan types of redistricting commissions adopted in Ohio and New York.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
