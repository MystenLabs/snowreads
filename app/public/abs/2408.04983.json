To achieve a better trade-off between the effectiveness of TSM\nerasure and model utility in LLMs, our paper proposes a new framework based on\nEntropy Maximization with Selective Optimization (EMSO), where the updated\nweights are chosen with a novel contrastive gradient metric without any\nparticipation of additional model or data. Our analysis shows that training\nwith the entropy maximization loss has a more stable optimization process and\nbetter keeps model utility than existing methods. The contrastive gradient\nmetric localizes the most influential weight for TSM erasure by taking both the\ngradient magnitude and direction into consideration. Extensive experiments\nacross three model scales demonstrate that our method excels in handling\nlarge-scale forgetting requests while preserving model ability in language\ngeneration and reasoning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
