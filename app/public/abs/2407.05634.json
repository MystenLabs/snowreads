We do so by\nintroducing a new algorithm called the Riemann-Hilbert-Weiss algorithm, which\ncan compute any individual phase factor independent of all other phase factors.\nOur algorithm is also the first provably stable numerical algorithm for\ncomputing phase factors of any arbitrary Szeg\\H{o} function. The proof of\nstability involves solving a Riemann-Hilbert factorization problem in nonlinear\nFourier analysis using elements of spectral theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
