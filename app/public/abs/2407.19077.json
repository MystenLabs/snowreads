To tackle this\nlimitation, we introduce Flex-GCN, a flexible graph convolutional network\ndesigned to learn graph representations that capture broader global information\nand dependencies. At its core is the flexible graph convolution, which\naggregates features from both immediate and second-order neighbors of each\nnode, while maintaining the same time and memory complexity as the standard\nconvolution. Our network architecture comprises residual blocks of flexible\ngraph convolutional layers, as well as a global response normalization layer\nfor global feature aggregation, normalization and calibration. Quantitative and\nqualitative results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving\ncompetitive performance on benchmark datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3-EThhv1VQimUIoTjDSxUzjVHqo9tUBqmVm2JLMGAuU","pdfSize":"1056705"}
