Following the\nconfirmation of the enhancement of the PVED by electronic excitation in our\nprevious papers, the present work confirms that electronic excitation enhances\nthe MEC for H$_2$Te$_2$ and H$_2$Se$_2$. The PVED in the first excited state is\nexplained by the contribution from the highest occupied molecular orbital if\nthe PVED contribution from the highest occupied molecular orbital in the ground\nstate dominates over any other contributions. In this paper, it is checked\nwhether this explanation can also be applicable to the MEC. It is also reported\nthat the MEC is not the simple sum of contributions from each atom and the\nmixing by the superposition between atomic orbitals of different atoms is\nimportant.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
