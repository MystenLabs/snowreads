In\ncontinuation of an expository review on this phenomenon published in 2014, an\nalbum of theoretical results is provided in this decadal update. Spectral\nvariations of intensity-dependent and phase-dependent observable quantities in\nthe reflection and transmission half-spaces are provided in relation to the\npolarization state and the direction of propagation of the incident plane wave.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
