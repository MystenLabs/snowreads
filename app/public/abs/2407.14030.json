This suggests overlooked aspects in target validation and drug\noptimization. In order to address this, we introduce HeCiX-KG,\nHetionet-Clinicaltrials neXus Knowledge Graph, a novel fusion of data from\nClinicalTrials.gov and Hetionet in a single knowledge graph. HeCiX-KG combines\ndata on previously conducted clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov, and\ndomain expertise on diseases and genes from Hetionet. This offers a thorough\nresource for clinical researchers. Further, we introduce HeCiX, a system that\nuses LangChain to integrate HeCiX-KG with GPT-4, and increase its usability.\nHeCiX shows high performance during evaluation against a range of clinically\nrelevant issues, proving this model to be promising for enhancing the\neffectiveness of clinical research. Thus, this approach provides a more\nholistic view of clinical trials and existing biological data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"81OcU27IcTwuxNNLPJJ0CwC9uTMEfRFAWdIUbd3tSlo","pdfSize":"690029"}
