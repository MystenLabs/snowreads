Deterministic transfer of transition metal\ndichalcogenide nanomaterials and transparent contacts to the nanomaterials are\nnowadays highly active topics of research, both with fundamental research and\napplications in mind. Contamination from transport agents as well as surface\nadsorbates and surface charges play a critical role for device performance.\nMany techniques have been proposed to address these topics for transition metal\ndichalcogenides in general. Here, we analyse their usage for the transfer based\nfabrication of $\\textrm{MoS}_{2}$ nanotube devices. Further, we compare\ndifferent contact materials in order to avoid the formation of a Schottky\nbarrier.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
