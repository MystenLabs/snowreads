Controlled\nvocabularies provide a promising basis for measuring relatedness because they\naddress issues that arise when using citation or textual similarity to measure\nrelatedness. While several controlled-vocabulary-based relatedness measures\nhave been developed, there exists no comprehensive and direct test of their\naccuracy and suitability for different types of research questions. This paper\nreviews existing measures, develops a new measure, and benchmarks the measures\nusing TREC Genomics data as a ground truth of topics. The benchmark test show\nthat the new measure and the measure proposed by Ahlgren et al. (2020) have\ndiffering strengths and weaknesses. These results inform a discussion of which\nmethod to choose when studying interdisciplinarity, information retrieval,\nclustering of science, and researcher topic switching.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7Y1Q8_TINnkuq7FS1tvHDa6NUBCbMjK7xd0XbEhRvNw","pdfSize":"505158"}
