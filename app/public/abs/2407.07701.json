This completes the enumeration of inversion sequences\navoiding one or two patterns of length 3. Some of our constructions are based\non generating trees. Others involve pattern-avoiding words, which we also count\nusing generating trees. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization of inversion\nsequences, which we call shifted inversion sequences. It is sometimes easier to\nconstruct pattern-avoiding inversion sequences by seeing them as a particular\ncase of shifted inversion sequences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OgOztQTysBZ3xC3FQ6EzZh2QnbxkQWLkp0RGOw7rcGU","pdfSize":"589394"}
