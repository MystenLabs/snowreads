We characterize when such spaces\nare included into one another in terms of growth relations for the defining\nweight sequence and function systems. Our general framework allows for a\nunified treatment of the Gelfand-Shilov spaces $\\mathcal{S}^{[M]}_{[A]}$\n(defined via weight sequences $M$ and $A$) and the Beurling-Bj\\\"orck spaces\n$\\mathcal{S}^{[\\omega]}_{[\\eta]}$ (defined via weight functions $\\omega$ and\n$\\eta$).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
