They can also serve as an\nefficient mathematical tool to represent information extracted from complex\nunstructured data sources, such as text or images. Within financial\napplications, DKGs could be used to detect trends for strategic thematic\ninvesting, based on information obtained from financial news articles. In this\nwork, we explore the properties of large language models (LLMs) as dynamic\nknowledge graph generators, proposing a novel open-source fine-tuned LLM for\nthis purpose, called the Integrated Contextual Knowledge Graph Generator\n(ICKG). We use ICKG to produce a novel open-source DKG from a corpus of\nfinancial news articles, called FinDKG, and we propose an attention-based GNN\narchitecture for analysing it, called KGTransformer. We test the performance of\nthe proposed model on benchmark datasets and FinDKG, demonstrating superior\nperformance on link prediction tasks. Additionally, we evaluate the performance\nof the KGTransformer on FinDKG for thematic investing, showing it can\noutperform existing thematic ETFs.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
