Using the fact that Krylov complexity is computable from\ntwo-point functions, the analysis is performed in the limit where the two-point\nfunction becomes simple and we compare the results with those of other previous\nstudies. We confirm the exponential growth of Krylov complexity in the very low\ntemperature regime. In general, Krylov complexity grows at most linearly at\nvery late times in any system with a bounded energy spectrum. Therefore, we\nhave to focus on the initial growth to see differences in the behaviors of\nsystems or operators. Since the DSSYK model is such a bounded system, its\nchaotic nature can be expected to appear as the initial exponential growth of\nthe Krylov complexity. In particular, the time at which the initial exponential\ngrowth of Krylov complexity terminates is independent of the number of degrees\nof freedom. Based on the above, we systematically and specifically study the\nLanczos coefficients and Krylov complexity using a toy power spectrum and\ndeepen our understanding of those initial behaviors. In particular, we confirm\nthat the overall sech-like behavior of the power spectrum shows the initial\nlinear growth of the Lanczos coefficient, even when the energy spectrum is\nbounded.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
