Each driver aims to minimize the\ntime spent during the trip, making the time spent a measure of cost. The chosen\nroutes and departure times impact the network loading. The goal is to find an\nequilibrium distribution across departure times and routes.\n  For a relatively simplified transportation model we show that an equilibrium\ntraffic distribution can be found as a solution to a linear program. In earlier\nworks linear programming formulations were only obtained for social optimum\ndynamic traffic assignment problems. We also discuss algorithmic approaches for\nsolving the equilibrium problem using time-expanded networks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
