Surprisingly, this question has connections to diverse mathematical\ncontexts, including random matrix theory and discrete Fourier transforms.\nThrough rigorous analysis, we establish that the sequence of the suitably\nrescaled centroids converges to a circularly-symmetric complex normal\ndistribution with variance (\\frac{1}{12}). This result is a manifestation of\ncentral limit behavior in a setting involving sums of heavily dependent random\nvariables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
