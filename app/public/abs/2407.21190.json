This article\nstudies hypothesis tests to simultaneously compare the predictive values of two\nbinary diagnostic tests in the presence of missing data. The hypothesis tests\nwere solved applying two computational methods: the EM and SEM algorithms and\nmultiple imputation. Simulation experiments were carried out to study the sizes\nand the power of the hypothesis tests, giving some general rules of\napplication. Two R programmes were written to apply each method, and they are\navailable as supplementary material for the manuscript. The results were\napplied to the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
