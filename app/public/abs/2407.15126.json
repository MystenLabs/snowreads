To achieve this, we need to investigate the capability of\ncryptographic analysis tools when used by the adversaries with quantum\ncomputers. In this article, we concentrate on truncated differential and\nboomerang cryptanalysis. We first present a quantum algorithm which is designed\nfor finding truncated differentials of symmetric ciphers. We prove that, with a\noverwhelming probability, the truncated differentials output by our algorithm\nmust have high differential probability for the vast majority of keys in key\nspace. Afterwards, based on this algorithm, we design a quantum algorithm which\ncan be used to find boomerang distinguishers. The quantum circuits of both\nquantum algorithms contain only polynomial quantum gates. Compared to classical\ntools for searching truncated differentials or boomerang distinguishers, our\nalgorithms fully utilize the strengths of quantum computing, and can maintain\nthe polynomial complexity while fully considering the impact of S-boxes and key\nscheduling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
