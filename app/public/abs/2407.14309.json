However, what makes an active reading question good, what the\nlinguistic role of these questions is, and what is their impact on human\nreading remains understudied. We introduce GuidingQ, a dataset of 10K in-text\nquestions from textbooks and scientific articles. By analyzing the dataset, we\npresent a comprehensive understanding of the use, distribution, and linguistic\ncharacteristics of these questions. Then, we explore various approaches to\ngenerate such questions using language models. Our results highlight the\nimportance of capturing inter-question relationships and the challenge of\nquestion position identification in generating these questions. Finally, we\nconduct a human study to understand the implication of such questions on\nreading comprehension. We find that the generated questions are of high quality\nand are almost as effective as human-written questions in terms of improving\nreaders' memorization and comprehension.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-2ghd8ZtaIAg6XxgGurdGU9Gx9P3LTAo2sB8nsgFqaE","pdfSize":"1229684"}
