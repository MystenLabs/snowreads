We also investigate the electronic properties of Ta2NiSe5 within\nthe density-functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation in\nthe framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin\norbital band-structure method. While ARPES, dc transport, and optical\nmeasurements indicate that Ta2NiSe5 is a small band-gap semiconductor, DFT\ngives a metallic nonmagnetic solution in Ta2NiSe5 . To obtain the\nsemiconducting ground state in Ta2 NiSe5 we use a self-interaction correction\n(SIC) procedure by introducing an orbital-dependent potential Vl into the\nHamiltonian. We investigate theoretically the x-ray absorption spectroscopy\n(XAS) and RIXS spectra at the Ni and Ta L3 edges and analyze the spectra in\nterms of interband transitions. We investigate the RIXS spectra as a function\nof momentum transfer vector Q and incident photon energy. Because Ta2 NiSe5\npossesses only fully occupied (Ni 3d and Se 4p) and completely empty (Ta 5d)\nshells with the formal valencies Ta5+ (5d0), Ni0 (3d10 ), and Se2- (4p6 ), both\nthe Ni and Ta L3 RIXS spectra belong to a charge transfer type with\nligand-to-metal excitations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
