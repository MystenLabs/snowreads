Using\ncurrently available CMB observations, we give the tightest constraints on\ninflation so far. We discuss the theoretical implications of our results\nincluding the energy scale of inflation, inflaton field excursion, Hubble\nexpansion rate during inflation, equation of state of inflation, primordial\ntensor non-Gaussianity, primordial tensor power spectrum, B-mode anisotropy and\ninflationary gravitational wave background.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
