We begin by introducing the dual formulation and prove the\nexponential convergence of Sinkhorn's algorithm on the dual potential\ncoefficients. Our analysis does not require prior knowledge of the optimal\npotential and confirms that there is no primal-dual gap. Our findings provide a\ntheoretical guarantee for solving the EMOT problem using Sinkhorn's algorithm.\nIn applications, our result provides insight into the calibration of stochastic\nvolatility models, as proposed by Henry-Labordere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
