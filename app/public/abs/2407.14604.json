This study\ninvestigates the resonant effects of ALPs with binary black hole systems, where\ntheir oscillatory nature induces time-dependent forces on the black holes. By\nemploying a detailed Fisher matrix analysis, we not only probe a new parameter\nspace for ALPs, characterized by their mass and decay constants, but also\nassess how these parameters affect gravitational waveforms during black hole\nmergers. Our approach is distinct as it does not assume interactions of ALPs\nwith photons or nucleons. We demonstrate that as binary black holes spiral\ninward and lose energy, their orbital frequencies may resonate with those of\nALPs, producing distinct oscillatory patterns in gravitational waves detectable\nby upcoming experiments such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA).\nThis work broadens the potential of gravitational wave astronomy as a tool for\ndark matter searches, offering a promising avenue for studying elusive\ncomponents of the universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
