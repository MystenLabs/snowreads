ZrX2N4 (X =\nSi, Ge) is a reasonable choice for thermoelectric applications when considering\na favorable value of the figure of merit in two-dimensional (2D) layered\nmaterials. In this study, we examined the thermoelectric characteristics of the\ntwo-dimensional monolayer of ZrX2N4 (where X can be either Si or Ge) using a\ncombination of Density Functional Theory (DFT) and the Boltzmann Transport\nEquation (BTE). A thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of 0.90 was achieved at a\ntemperature of 900 K for p-type ZrGe2N4, while a ZT of 0.83 was reported for\nn-type ZrGe2N4 at the same temperature. In addition, the ZrGe2N4 material\nexhibited a thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) of around 0.7 at room\ntemperature for the p-type. Conversely, the ZrSi2N4 exhibited a relatively\nlower thermoelectric figure of merit (ZT) at ambient temperature. At higher\ntemperatures, the ZT value experiences a substantial increase, reaching 0.89\nand 0.82 for p-type and n-type materials, respectively, at 900 K. Through our\nanalysis of the electronic band structure, we have determined that ZrSi2N4 and\nZrGe2N4 exhibit indirect bandgaps (BG) of 2.74 eV and 2.66 eV, respectively, as\nper the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE) approximation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qGLXZgnnOltizZBAqQ7EKsbtfOcdD026rJGioT7rVkc","pdfSize":"692110"}
