Here the dielectric nanopillar array interacting with microwave acts\nas the electron undulator, in which the near field drives electrons to\noscillate. When an electron beam operates in this nanopillar array in this\nlight source configuration, it is subjected to a periodic transverse near-field\nforce, and will radiate X-ray or even gamma-ray high energy photons after a\nrelativistic frequency up-conversion. Compared with the laser-dielectric\nundulator based on the interaction between strong lasers and nanostructures to\ngenerate a plasmonic near field, this configuration is less prone to damage\nduring operation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
