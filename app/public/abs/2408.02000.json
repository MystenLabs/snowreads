While early\nimplementations of DAG-based protocols such as Narwhal/Bullshark trade high\nthroughput for a low latency, the latest versions of DAG-based protocols such\nas Mysticeti and Shoal++ show that indeed a latency comparable to that of\ntraditional consensus protocols such as HotStuff can be achieve with the\nDAG-based consensus protocols while still maintaining high throughput.\nMysticeti in particular achieves a low latency by implementing a novel approach\nof using an uncertified DAG - a significant breakthrough comparing to the\ncertified DAG used in the previous generations of the protocol. However, the\nuncertified DAG exposes the system to new vectors of attacks by Byzantine\nvalidators that did not exist in the certified DAG protocols. In this paper we\ndescribe those issues and present the Adelie protocol, that addresses issues\nthat comes with an uncertified DAG. We also incorporate some of the techniques\nfrom the Shoal++ to reduce latency even further. This paper also presents an\nimplementation of Adelie protocol - bftd that demonstrates yet another\nbreakthrough in the maximum achieved TPS and low latency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
