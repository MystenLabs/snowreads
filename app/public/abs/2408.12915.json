By\nutilizing the detailed census data, the cohort-based difference-in-differences\ndesign indicates that the HEE increased college attendance and encouraged more\npeople to attend senior high schools and that the effect is more significant in\nrural areas. Then we apply a similar approach to a novel panel data set of\nrural villages and households to examine the effect of education opportunities\non rural areas. We find contrasting impacts on income and life quality between\nvillages and households. Villages in provinces with higher HEE magnitudes\nunderwent a drop in the average income and worse living facilities. On the\ncontrary, households sending out migrants after the HEE experienced an increase\nin their per capita income. The phenomenon where villages experienced a ``brain\ndrain'' and households with migrants gained after the HEE is explained by the\nfact that education could serve as a way to overcome the barrier of rural-urban\nmigration. Our findings highlight the opposed impacts of education\nopportunities on rural development and household welfare in rural areas.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
