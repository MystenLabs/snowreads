We have studied the light rings and shadows of\nthese black holes using the topological method and the backward ray-tracing\nmethod, respectively. We demonstrate that these light rings in both types of\nstatic black holes are standard and unstable according to the classification of\nlight rings. Subsequently, we checked the position of the light rings using the\nphoton trajectory equation. We found that although the quantum parameters do\nnot affect the light rings of these two types of black holes, they do reduce\nthe size of the first type of static black hole in EQG, making it smaller.\nHowever, for the second type of static black hole in EQG, we cannot distinguish\nit from a Schwarzschild black hole based on the shadow alone. Fortunately, the\nquantum parameters shrink the lensing rings of both types of black holes in\nEQG, causing the black hole shadow to occupy a larger proportion within the\nring. This can serve as a basis for distinguishing whether the black hole is in\nEQG or general relativity (GR).\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
