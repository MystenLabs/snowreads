Reactive methods that use only the\nrobot's current sensor data and local information are fast and flexible, but\nprone to getting stuck in local minima. Is there a middle-ground between fully\nreactive methods and map-based path planners? In this paper, we investigate\nfeed forward and recurrent networks to augment a purely reactive sensor-based\nplanner, which should give the robot geometric intuition about how to escape\nlocal minima. We train on a large number of extremely cluttered worlds\nauto-generated from primitive shapes, and show that our system zero-shot\ntransfers to real 3D man-made environments, and can handle up to 30% sensor\nnoise without degeneration of performance. We also offer a discussion of what\nrole network memory plays in our final system, and what insights can be drawn\nabout the nature of reactive vs. map-based navigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
