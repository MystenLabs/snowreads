The\neffect originates from non-locality of electric response to structured\nelectromagnetic field. We develop an analytical theory of such a second\nharmonic generation in conducting two-dimensional systems. For the general type\nof structured radiation, we calculate the emerging electric currents at the\ndouble frequency and the emitted second harmonic radiation. The theory applied\nto twisted light reveals that the angular momentum of light doubles in the\nsecond harmonic emission. Our results pave the way for second harmonic\ngeneration and structuring in two-dimensional materials beyond the constraints\nimposed by crystal symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
