After inflation, the damped oscillations of the inflaton around its\npotential minimum induces damped oscillations of the sound speed of tensor\nmodes, leading to resonant amplification of the latter. Once the inflaton\nstabilizes around the minimum, the tensor sound speed reduces to unity (speed\nof light). In the context of multi-field inflation, the sound speed\noscillations can be followed by a second phase of inflation, resulting in a\ndistinctive stochastic background of Gravitational Waves (GWs). We show that\nthese GW signals can be probed by upcoming experiments such as $\\textbf{SKA}$,\n$\\textbf{DECIGO}$, and $\\textbf{BBO}$ depending on the duration of the second\ninflationary phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
