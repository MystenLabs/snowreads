We do that in a setting in which exact computations are possible: a\ncoin-tossing context where the hypotheses of interest address the success\nprobability of the coin. We obtain exact asymptotic results and conclude that\nthe p-value scales very differently than the likelihood ratio. We also\ninvestigate the p-value of the likelihood ratio, that is, the probability of\nfinding a more extreme likelihood ratio under the various hypotheses. Here we\nalso find explicit asymptotic relations, with similar conclusions. Finally, we\nstudy the expected value of the likelihood ratio in an optional stopping\ncontext. Our results imply, for instance, that in a coin-tossing context, a\np-value of 0.05 cannot correspond to an actual likelihood ratio larger than\n6.8.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
