In modern societies, a growing share of human interactions are\ntaking place online which has been shown to amplify and distort the expression\nand perception of emotions. However, the entanglement across different emotions\nis not fully understood. We use a multivariate Hawkes self-excited point\nprocess to model and calibrate the temporal expressions of six basic emotions\nin YouTube live chats. This allows us to understand interdependencies among\nemotions, but also to disentangle the influence from the video content and\nsocial interactions with peers. Positive emotions are found to be more\ncontagious, while negative emotions tend to leave a longer-lasting impression\non users' memories. Furthermore, we quantify the endogeneity of online emotion\ndynamics and find that peer interactions drive user emotional expressions 3-5\ntimes more than passive content consumption. This underscores the powerful\nincentives of social interactions and the potential risk of emotional\nmanipulation through the use of modern chatbots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
