Their potential for\nnonlinear optics has also drawn great interest recently; yet, to date,\ncontinuous-wave (CW) nonlinearities have remained elusive. Here we demonstrate\nCW nonlinear phenomena in a CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite cavity. We first demonstrate\noptical bistability -- the hallmark of single-mode coherent nonlinear optics.\nNext we exploit the interplay of nonlinearity and birefringence to demonstrate\nnonlinear control over the polarization of light. Finally, by measuring the\noptical hysteresis of our cavity as a function of temperature, we find a\ndramatic enhancement of the nonlinearity around 65 K. This enhancement is\nindicative of a phase transition in CsPbBr$_3$. Our results position CsPbBr$_3$\ncavities as an exceptional platform for nonlinear optics, offering strong CW\nnonlinearity and birefringence which are furthermore tunable. In addition, our\napproach to uncover a phase transition of matter via optical hysteresis\nmeasurements is promising for exploring strongly correlated states of\nlight-matter systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
