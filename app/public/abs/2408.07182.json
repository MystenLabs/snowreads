The algorithmic\nguarantees pertaining to near approximate stationarity rely on a new tracking\nlemma linking the iterates to trajectories of conservative fields. One of the\nnovelties in the analysis consists in handling conservative fields with\nunbounded values.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
