The polarization properties of FRBs\noffer crucial insights into their origins and radiation mechanisms. Significant\ncircular polarization (CP) has been observed in some FRBs. CP may result from\nintrinsic radiation or propagation effects, both within and outside the\nmagnetosphere. Recent observations indicate that polarization properties of FRB\n20201124A can change over short timescales (about tens of milliseconds),\nchallenging models that attribute CP to out-of-magnetosphere emission and\npropagation. Additionally, some magnetospheric radiation models predict that\nbursts with high CP produced by off-axis emission will be systematically\nfainter, which contradicts the observations. We propose that CP arises from\nmagnetospheric propagation effects caused by relativistic plasma. We identify\nthe conditions under which high CP occurs, finding it to be rare. Moreover, our\nmodel accounts for the more commonly observed low CP and the varying handedness\nof CP.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
