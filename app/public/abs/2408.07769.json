Entanglement in these\nstates is detected using entanglement witnesses and the analysis focuses on\nstates exhibiting positive partial transpose (PPT). We then compare the\ndetection capabilities of optimal linear and nonlinear entanglement witnesses.\nIn theory, both linear and nonlinear witnesses produce non-negative values for\nseparable states and negative values for some entangled GHZ diagonal states\nwith PPT, indicating the presence of entanglement. Our experimental results\nreveal that in cases where linear entanglement witnesses fail to detect\nentanglement, nonlinear witnesses are consistently able to identify its\npresence. Optimal linear and nonlinear witnesses were generated on an IBM\nquantum computer and their performance was evaluated using two bound entangled\nstates (Kay and Kye states) from the literature, and randomly generated\nentangled states in the GHZ diagonal form. Additionally, we propose a general\nquantum circuit for generating a three-qubit GHZ diagonal mixed state using a\nsix-qubit pure state on the IBM quantum processor. We experimentally\nimplemented the circuit to obtain expectation values for three-qubit mixed\nstates and compute the corresponding entanglement witnesses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H-Oo3X-Dc-n7zCdp9fDFPE7Nmw5UYMEt--JS3n4ZlVg","pdfSize":"459528"}
