Two types of Minkowski problems in particular\nare an active area of research: $L^p$ Minkowski problems, introduced by Lutwak\nand (Lutwak,Yang, and Zhang), and weighted Minkowski problems, introduced by\nLivshyts. For the latter, the Gaussian Minkowski problem, whose primary\ninvestigators were (Huang, Xi and Zhao), is the most prevalent. In this work,\nwe consider weighted surface area in the $L^p$ setting. We propose a framework\ngoing beyond the Gaussian setting by focusing on rotational invariant measures,\nmirroring the recent development of the Gardner-Zvavitch inequality for\nrotational invariant, log-concave measures. Our results include existence for\nall $p \\in \\mathbb R$ (with symmetry assumptions in certain instances). We also\nhave uniqueness for $p \\geq 1$ under a concavity assumption. Finally, we obtain\nresults in the so-called $small$ $mass$ $regime$ using degree theory, as\ninstigated in the Gaussian case by (Huang, Xi and Zhao). Most known results for\nthe Gaussian Minkowski problem are then special cases of our main theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
