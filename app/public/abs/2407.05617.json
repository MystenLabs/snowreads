However, it suffers from long scan times. Deep learning-based\ntechniques have been successfully applied in accelerated quantitative MR\nparameter mapping. However, most methods require fully-sampled training\ndataset, which is impractical in the clinic. In this study, a novel\nsubject-specific unsupervised method based on the implicit neural\nrepresentation is proposed to reconstruct T1rho-weighted images from highly\nundersampled k-space data, which only takes spatiotemporal coordinates as the\ninput. Specifically, the proposed method learned a implicit neural\nrepresentation of the MR images driven by two explicit priors from the physical\nmodel of T1rho mapping, including the signal relaxation prior and\nself-consistency of k-t space data prior. The proposed method was verified\nusing both retrospective and prospective undersampled k-space data. Experiment\nresults demonstrate that LINEAR achieves a high acceleration factor up to 14,\nand outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of suppressing artifacts\nand achieving the lowest error.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
