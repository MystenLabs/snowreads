Most studies so far have focused on shocks\nhitting a link of the network, while often it is the node and its propensity to\nbe connected that are affected by a shock. Using as starting point the\nconfiguration model, a specific Exponential Random Graph model, we propose a\nvector autoregressive (VAR) framework to analytically compute the Impulse\nResponse Function (IRF) of a network metric conditional to a shock on a node.\nUnlike the standard VAR, the model is a nonlinear function of the shock size\nand the IRF depends on the state of the network at the shock time. We propose a\nnovel econometric estimation method that combines the Maximum Likelihood\nEstimation and Kalman filter to estimate the dynamics of the latent parameters\nand compute the IRF, and we apply the proposed methodology to the dynamical\nnetwork describing the electronic Market of Interbank Deposit (e-MID).\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
