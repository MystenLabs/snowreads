We\nbegin by examining the realization of non-Hermitian quantum systems through the\nLindblad master equation, alongside a review of typical non-Hermitian\nfree-fermion systems that exhibit unique features. A pedagogical discussion is\nprovided on the relationship between entanglement quantities and the\ncorrelation matrix in Hermitian systems. Building on this foundation, we focus\non how entanglement concepts are extended to non-Hermitian systems from their\nHermitian free-fermion counterparts, with a review of the general properties\nthat emerge. Finally, we highlight various concrete studies, demonstrating that\nentanglement entropy remains a powerful diagnostic tool for characterizing\nnon-Hermitian physics. The entanglement spectrum also reflects the topological\ncharacteristics of non-Hermitian topological systems, while unique\nnon-Hermitian entanglement behaviors are also discussed. The review is\nconcluded with several future directions. Through this review, we hope to\nprovide a useful guide for researchers who are interested in entanglement in\nnon-Hermitian quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
