For two-component links with linking number\none, the invariant has been shown to equal a symmetrized multivariable link\nsignature. We extend this result to all two-component links with non-zero\nlinking number. A key ingredient in the proof is an explicit calculation of the\nBenard-Conway invariant for (2, 2l)-torus links with the help of the Chebyshev\npolynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
