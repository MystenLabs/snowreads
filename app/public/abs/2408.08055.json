Most modern methods, however, tend to\nmodel such processes through at most piecewise-continuous trajectories. To\naddress this, we adopt a way of viewing events not as standalone phenomena but\ninstead as observations of a Gaussian Process, which in turn governs the\nactor's dynamics. We propose integrating these obtained dynamics, resulting in\na continuous-trajectory modification of the widely successful Neural ODE model.\nThrough Gaussian Process theory, we were able to evaluate the uncertainty in an\nactor's representation, which arises from not observing them between events.\nThis estimate led us to develop a novel, theoretically backed negative feedback\nmechanism. Empirical studies indicate that our model with Gaussian process\ninterpolation and negative feedback achieves state-of-the-art performance, with\nimprovements up to 20% AUROC against similar architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
