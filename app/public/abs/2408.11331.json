We formulate the problem as a median set partitioning\nproblem and propose a greedy optimization technique. Unlike other approaches\nthat find median set partitions, our algorithm takes graph structure into\naccount and finds a comparable quality solution much faster than the other\napproaches. For graphs with known communities, our consensus partition captures\nthe actual community structure more accurately than alternative approaches. To\nmake it applicable to large graphs, we remove sequential dependencies from our\nalgorithm and design a parallel algorithm. Our parallel algorithm achieves 35x\nspeedup when utilizing 64 processing cores for large real-world graphs from\nsingle-cell experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yRuvmHQikRYVv4GjMa7ZhIYSS95xl1wdO-QGLm79pck","pdfSize":"708161"}
