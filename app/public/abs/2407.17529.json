This communication discusses\nthe importance of \\(\\Lambda\\)-poisedness in DFO and the outliers detected by\nthe Local Outlier Factor (LOF) on the optimization process. We discuss the\nrelationship between \\(\\Lambda\\)-poisedness in derivative-free optimization and\noutliers in local outlier factor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
