We extend this formalism to the\ndetermination of matrix elements from three-point correlation functions. We\ndemonstrate similar advantages over previously available methods in both\nsignal-to-noise and control of excited-state contamination through example\napplications to noiseless mock-data as well as calculations of (bare) forward\nmatrix elements of the strange scalar current between both ground and excited\nstates with the quantum numbers of the nucleon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
