The work first comprises axisymmetric predictions of runaway electron\nbeam formation in a mitigated scenario and of the simultaneous vertical motion\nof the beam due to loss of position control. The subsequent runaway electron\nbeam termination triggered by a burst of MHD activity during the course of the\nvertical motion is then simulated in 3D with the runaway electron fluid\nself-consistently coupled to the MHD modes. Finally, the resulting deposition\npattern of the runaway electrons onto wall structures is calculated with a\nrelativistic test particle approach. This way, the suitability of a possible\nsacrificial limiter concept for the protection of first wall components is\nassessed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
