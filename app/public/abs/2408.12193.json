This knowledge is typically acquired through radio propagation\nsolvers, which however suffer from intrinsic and well-known performance\nlimitations. This article provides a primer on how integrating deep learning\nand conventional propagation modeling techniques can enhance multiple vital\nfacets of wireless network operation, and yield benefits in terms of efficiency\nand reliability. By highlighting the pivotal role that the deep learning-based\nradio propagation models will assume in next-generation wireless networks, we\naspire to propel further research in this direction and foster their adoption\nin additional applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
