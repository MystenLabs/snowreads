However, in recent years, with the increase in student population and\ncourse variety, students perceive that the course scheduling method is unfair.\nCurrent integer programming (IP) methods to the high school scheduling problem\n(HSSP) fall short in addressing these fairness concerns. The purpose of this\nresearch is to develop a solution methodology that generates feasible and fair\ncourse schedules using student preferences. Utilizing principles of fairness,\nwhich have been well studied in market design, we define the fair high school\nscheduling problem (FHSSP), a novel extension to the HSSP, and devise a\ncorresponding algorithm based on integer programming to solve the FHSSP. We\ntest our approach on a real course request dataset from a high school in\nCalifornia, USA. Results show that our algorithm can generate schedules that\nare both feasible and fair. In this paper, we demonstrate that our IP algorithm\nnot only solves the HSSP and FHSSP in the United States but has the potential\nto be applied to various real-world scheduling problems. Additionally, we show\nthe feasibility of integrating human emotions into mathematical modeling.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
