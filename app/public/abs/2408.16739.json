The pseudoachromatic number of a graph is the greatest number of\ncolors possible used in a pseudocomplete coloring. This paper studies\nproperties relating to additivity of the pseudoachromatic number under the\njoin. Errors from the literature are corrected and the notion of weakly\ncritical is introduced in order to study the problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
