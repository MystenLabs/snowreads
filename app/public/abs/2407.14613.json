We demonstrate that if interactions of cavity photon modes\nwith both nuclear and electronic degrees of freedom are treated on the level of\nthe cavity Born-Oppenheimer approximation (CBOA), spectra can be expressed in\nterms of the matter response to electric fields and nuclear displacements which\nare readily available in standard density functional perturbation theory (DFPT)\nimplementations. In this framework, results over a range of cavity parameters\ncan be obtained without the need for additional electronic structure\ncalculations, enabling efficient calculations on a wide range of parameters.\nFurthermore, this approach enables results to be more readily interpreted in\nterms of the more familiar cavity-independent molecular electric field response\nproperties, such as polarizability and Born effective charges which enter into\nthe vibro-polariton calculation. Using corresponding electric field response\nproperties of bulk insulating systems, we are also able to obtain $\\Gamma$\npoint phonon-polariton spectra of two dimensional (2D) insulators. Results for\na selection of cavity-coupled molecular and 2D crystal systems are presented to\ndemonstrate the method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
