Moreover, the class has attractive mathematical characterizations that\ncan be exploited algorithmically. On the other hand, undirected orchard\nnetworks have hardly been studied yet. Here, we prove that deciding whether an\nundirected, binary phylogenetic network is an orchard -- or equivalently,\nwhether it has an orientation that makes it a rooted orchard -- is NP-hard. For\nthis, we introduce a new characterization of undirected orchards which could be\nuseful for proving positive results.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
