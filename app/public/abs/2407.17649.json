They play an important role in\nrepresentation theory and are notoriously hard to compute. We give quantum\nalgorithms that efficiently compute these coefficients whenever the ratio of\ndimensions of the representations is polynomial. Using that the Kostka numbers\nadmit combinatorial interpretation, we show that there is an efficient\nclassical algorithm for polynomially-bounded Kostka numbers and conjecture\nexistence of a similar algorithm for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. We\nargue why the same classical algorithm does not straightforwardly work for the\nPlethysm and Kronecker coefficients, give evidence on how our quantum algorithm\nmay avoid some hardness obstructions in their computation, and conjecture that\nthe problem could lead to superpolynomial quantum speedups on some inputs. We\nfinally use Frobenius reciprocity to derive another quantum algorithm that\nestimates these coefficients using induction and has a different cost-to-input\ndependence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
