As\nextreme weather is a major cause of power outages, the frequency of power\noutages is expected to increase.\n  The lack of privacy is an inherent result of their account-based design or\nthe use of a public ledger.\n  The critical dependency and lack of privacy can be resolved with a Central\nBank Digital Currency that can be used offline.\n  This thesis proposes a design and a first implementation for an offline-first\ndigital euro.\n  The protocol offers complete privacy during transactions using zero-knowledge\nproofs.\n  Furthermore, transactions can be executed offline without third parties and\nretroactive double-spending detection is facilitated.\n  To protect the users' privacy, but also guard against money laundering, we\nhave added the following privacy-guarding mechanism.\n  The bank and trusted third parties for law enforcement must collaborate to\ndecrypt transactions, revealing the digital pseudonym used in the transaction.\n  Importantly, the transaction can be decrypted without decrypting prior\ntransactions attached to the digital euro.\n  The protocol has a working initial implementation showcasing its usability\nand demonstrating functionality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W5RQY6EZt8ktnXYAoRQUSBgwggxa-8Ug7rDctHR-sC4","pdfSize":"542997","objectId":"0x2e8dd32ee1a1ebd3a74bee2aa09c1e342fb5c9998b6101a9aa8badc8219ce5b8","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
