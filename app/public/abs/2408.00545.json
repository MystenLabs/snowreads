Therefore the\nShanghaiTech Mapping Robot was constructed, that features a multitude\nhigh-performance sensors and a 16-node cluster to collect all this data. That\nrobot is based on a Clearpath Husky mobile base with a maximum speed of 1 meter\nper second. This is fine for indoor datasets, but to collect large-scale\noutdoor datasets a faster platform is needed. This system paper introduces our\nhigh-speed mobile platform for data collection. The mapping robot is secured on\nthe rear-steered flatbed car with maximum field of view. Additionally two\nencoders collect odometry data from two of the car wheels and an external\nsensor plate houses a downlooking RGB and event camera. With this setup a\ndataset of more than 10km in the underground parking garage and the outside of\nour campus was collected and is published with this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
