The insulator\nphase is characterized by a unique feature: a nonsymmorphic glide symmetry that\nexists within momentum space, rather than real space. This characteristic\ntransforms the Brillouin zone's fundamental domain into a structure of Klein\nbottle. Here, we report an observation of a Klein bottle topoelectrical model\nunder gauge fields. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the different\ncorner distributions of odd and even unit cells, we present theoretical\ncalculations and demonstrate that the symmetry properties significantly affect\nthe topological nature. These theoretical predictions are confirmed by\nexperimental results, which demonstrate the practical feasibility of such\ntopological configurations in electronic circuits. Our work establishes a vital\nconnection between the realms of condensed matter physics and circuit systems,\nthereby paving a pathway for investigating exotic condensed matter physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"118wohbIdTfwLiaJ0_B2LjU2EF0L6lFKe1vYFrVTGnQ","pdfSize":"1492642"}
