However, using multiple microscope setups increases the\nrisk of misalignment of identical target features across different modalities,\nmaking multimodal image registration crucial. In this work, we build upon\nprevious successes in biological image translation (XAcGAN) and mono-modal\nimage registration (RoTIR) to develop a deep learning model, Dual-Domain RoTIR\n(DD_RoTIR), specifically designed to address these challenges. While GAN-based\ntranslation models are often considered inadequate for multimodal image\nregistration, we enhance registration accuracy by employing a feature-matching\nalgorithm based on Transformers and rotation equivariant networks.\nAdditionally, hierarchical feature matching is utilized to tackle the\ncomplexities of multimodal image registration. Our results demonstrate that the\nDD_RoTIR model exhibits strong applicability and robustness across multiple\nmicroscopy image datasets.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
