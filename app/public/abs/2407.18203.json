In this letter, we\nsettle a systematic framework to deal with beyond leading power corrections at\nsmall-$x$, including the saturation regime, and obtain the $\\gamma^{*}\n\\rightarrow M (\\rho, \\phi, \\omega)$ impact factor with both incoming photon and\noutgoing meson carrying arbitrary polarizations. This is of particular interest\nsince the saturation scale at modern colliders, although entering a\nperturbative regime, is not large enough to prevents higher-twist effects to be\nsizable.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
