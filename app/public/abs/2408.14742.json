The weak convergence approach and the localized time\nincrement estimate plays a crucial role to establish the large deviation\nprinciple. Moreover, based on the Girsanov transformation and the standard\nL2-uniqueness approach, the quadratic transportation cost information\ninequality is proved for the strong solution to the underlying problem which\nthen implies the measure concentration phenomenon.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
