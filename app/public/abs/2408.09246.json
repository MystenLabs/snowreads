The algorithm defines the\nsliding surface, which is the linear combination of command, body, and\nregulating angular velocity, and utilizes the sliding surface to derive the\ncontrol command that guarantees finite time stability. The regulating rate,\nwhich is an angular velocity regulating the attitude error between the command\nand body frame, is defined along the instantaneous eigen-axis between the two\nframes to minimize the rotation angle. In addition, the regulating rate is\nshaped such that the slew rate constraint is satisfied while the time to\nregulation is minimized with consideration of the control constraint. Practical\nscenarios involving Earth observation satellites are used to validate the\nalgorithm's performance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XSPdmbhNYWQsWKTpvC4lnAuqQiovKHKyhv4EZhckNzQ","pdfSize":"1416490"}
