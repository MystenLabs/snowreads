We show that for\nsufficiently small positive values of $\\epsilon,$ many geometric properties\nlike smoothness, norm attainment and extremality of operators are preserved\nunder such approximations. We present examples of pairs of Banach spaces\nsatisfying non-trivial norm preserving uniform $\\epsilon-$BPB approximation\nproperty in the global sense. We also study these concepts in case of bounded\nlinear operators between Hilbert spaces. Our approach in the present article\nleads to the improvement and generalization of some earlier results in this\ncontext.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
