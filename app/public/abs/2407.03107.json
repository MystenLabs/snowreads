It aims to provide a universal platform construction\ndesign process to effectively reduce the learning cost of large-scale scene\nconstruction. Taking an actual project of a unit as an example, the overall\ncycle work of platform building is explained, and the digital twin and data\nvisualization technologies and applications based on UE5 are analyzed. By\nsummarizing the project implementation into a process approach, the\nstandardization and operability of the process pathway is improved.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
