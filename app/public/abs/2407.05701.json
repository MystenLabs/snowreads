The\nuse of convolutional neural network (CNN) for comprehensive classification of\nboth typical and atypical serotonergic neurons is an interesting one, but the\nkey challenge is often given by the limited experimental data available for\ntraining. This study presents a procedure for synthetic data generation that\ncombines smoothed spike waveforms with heterogeneous noise masks from real\nrecordings. This approach expanded the training set while mitigating\noverfitting of background noise signatures. CNN models trained on the augmented\ndataset achieved high accuracy (96.2% true positive rate, 88.8% true negative\nrate) on non-homogeneous test data collected under different experimental\nconditions than the training, validation and testing data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
