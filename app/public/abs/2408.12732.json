The high-throughput quickly\nchanging research environment makes zero-shot generalization an incredibly\ndesirable feature. For this reason, we explore the application of Meta's\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) to this problem. We first analyze the\nout-of-the-box use of SAM. Then we discuss opportunities and strategies for\nimprovement under the assumption of minimal labeled data availability.\nOut-of-the-box SAM shows promising accuracy at property distribution\nextraction. We are able to identify four potential areas for improvement and\nshow preliminary gains in two of the four areas.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
