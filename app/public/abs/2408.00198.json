Using a combinatorial method of\nGekeler and Nonnengardt, we obtain a genus formula for these curves. In cases\nwhen the genus is one, we compute the Weierstrass equation of the corresponding\ncurve.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
