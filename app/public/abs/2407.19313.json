A better approach\nis to diagonalize a phase-space electronic Hamiltonian, $\\hat H_{\\rm PS}(\\bm\nR,\\bm P)$, which is parameterized by both nuclear position $\\bm R$ and nuclear\nmomentum $\\bm P$. The foundation of such a non-perturbative phase-space\nelectronic Hamiltonian can be made rigorous using a partial Wigner transform\nand the method has exactly the same cost as BO for a semiclassical calculation\n(and only a slight increase in cost for a quantum nuclear calculation). For a\nthree-particle system, with two heavy particles and one light particle,\nnumerical results show that a phase space electronic Hamiltonian produces not\nonly meaningful electronic momenta (which are completely ignored by BO theory)\nbut also far better vibrational energies. As such, for high level results\nand/or systems with degeneracies and spin degrees of freedom, we anticipate\nthat future electronic structure and quantum chemistry packages will need to\ntake as input not just the positions of the nuclei but also their momenta.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
