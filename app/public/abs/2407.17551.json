We confirm the high-$z$ nature of 10 out of 19\nobserved primary targets through low-resolution prism observations, with the\nrest revealing themselves unsurprisingly to be $z\\sim1-3$ interlopers, brown\ndwarfs, or yielding inconclusive results. From the MSA observations, we confirm\nan additional 9 filler sources at $z>5$, highlighting the large abundance of\nhigh-redshift galaxies even in individual WFC3 pointings. The primary sample\nspan an absolute magnitude range $-20.4<M_{\\rm UV}<-22.4$ mag and harbour UV\ncontinuum slopes of $\\beta\\simeq-2.5$ to $-2.0$, representing some of the most\nluminous $z>7$ sources currently known and comparable to the brightest sources\nat $z>10$. Prominent [O III]+H$\\beta$ lines are found across the full sample,\nwhile a stack of sources reveals a plethora of other rest-optical lines and\nadditional rest-UV C III]1909 \\r{A} emission. Despite their luminosities, none\nof the low-resolution spectra display evidence for Type 1 AGN activity based on\na search for broad-line emission. Lastly, we present a spectroscopic data\nrelease of 188 confirmed $0.5\\lesssim z\\lesssim5.0$ sources from filler MSA\nobservations, highlighting the legacy value of the survey and a representative\nbenchmark for comparisons to deep field observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
