This paper establishes $\\textit{transversal}$ generalizations of these\nclassical results. For a collection $\\mathbf{T}=\\{T_1,\\dots,T_m\\}$ of\nnot-necessarily distinct tournaments on the common vertex set $V$, an $m$-edge\ndirected subgraph $\\mathcal{D}$ with the vertices in $V$ is called a\ntransversal if there exists an bijection $\\varphi\\colon E(\\mathcal{D})\\to [m]$\nsuch that $e\\in E(T_{\\varphi(e)})$ for all $e\\in E(\\mathcal{D})$. We prove that\nfor sufficiently large $n$, there exist transversal Hamilton cycles of all\npossible orientations possibly except the consistently oriented one. We also\nobtain a similar result for the transversal Hamilton paths of all possible\norientations. These results generalize the classical theorem of Thomason, and\nour approach provides another proof of this theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zuGkozNRGgxfOW3t-9QDZwtaNgVU6bWFTIbwbBX_EXw","pdfSize":"831131"}
