However, obtaining accurate segmentations often requires\nlabor-intensive annotations and specialized models. Recently, Meta AI Research\nreleased a general Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2), which has demonstrated\npromising performance in several segmentation tasks. In this manuscript, we\nevaluate the performance of SAM 2 in segmenting polyps under various prompted\nsettings. We hope this report will provide insights to advance the field of\npolyp segmentation and promote more interesting work in the future.
