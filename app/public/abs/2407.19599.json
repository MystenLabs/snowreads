We consider\ndifferent finite-element discretizations and illustrate how not only does such\na stabilized scheme provide numerical solutions that are free of non-physical\noscillations, but it also allows one to iterate the fluid and mechanics\nproblems in a fashion similar to the well-known fixed-stress split method. The\nresulting solution method is convergent without the necessity for additional\nterms to stabilize the iteration. Finally, we present numerical results\nillustrating the robust behavior of both the stabilization and iterative solver\nwith respect to the physical and discretization parameters of the model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
