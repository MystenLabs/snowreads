Constraints on black hole parameters are derived\nfrom subextremality condition and energy conditions. The Keplerian orbits, the\ntime-averaged energy flux, the local temperature, the specific luminosity and\nthe conversion efficiency of accreting mass into radiation are obtained and\ncompared with Schwarzschild and Gibbons-Maeda-Garfinkle-Horowitz-Strominger\nblack holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
