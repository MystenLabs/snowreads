Our\nfirst goal is to determine conditions that result in the identification of\nprobabilities that are at the same time $\\sigma$-invariant and\n$\\Phi$-invariant, where $\\sigma$ is the full shift. Via the use of versions of\nthe Ruelle operator $\\mathcal{L}_{A,\\sigma}$ and $\\mathcal{L}_{B,\\Phi}$ we will\nshow that there is an abundant set of measures with this property; they will be\nequilibrium probabilities for different Lispchitz potentials $A,B$ and for the\ncorresponding dynamics $\\sigma$ and $\\Phi$. Via the use of a version of the\ninvolution kernel $W$ for a $(\\sigma,\\Phi)$-mixed skew product $\\hat{\\Phi}:\n\\{1,2,...,r\\}^\\mathbb{Z}\\circlearrowright$, given $A$ one can determine $B$, in\nsuch way that the integral kernel $e^W$ produce a duality between\neigenprobabilities $\\rho_A$ for $(\\mathcal{L}_{A,\\sigma})^*$ and eigenfunctions\n$\\psi_B$ for $\\mathcal{L}_{B,\\Phi}$. In another direction, considering the\nnon-mixed extension $\\hat{\\Phi}_n : \\{1,2,...,r\\}^\\mathbb{Z}\\circlearrowright$\nof $\\Phi$, given a Lispchitz potential $\\hat{A} : \\{1,2,...,r\\}^\\mathbb{Z}\\to\n\\mathbb{R}$, we can identify a Lipschitz potential $A:\\{1,2,...,r\\}^\\mathbb{N}\n\\to \\mathbb{R} $, in such away that relates the variational problem of\n$\\hat{\\Phi}_n$-Topological Pressure for $\\hat{A}$ with the $\\Phi$-Topological\nPressure for $A$. We also present a version of Livsic's Theorem. Whether or not\n$\\Phi$ (or $\\hat{\\Phi})$ can eventually be conjugated with another shift of\nfinite type is irrelevant in our context.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability","Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
