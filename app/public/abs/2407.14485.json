Thus, if there is private\ninformation, lotteries or other mechanisms that do not always allocate to a\nhighest-value bidder are not sybil-proof or not incentive compatible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
