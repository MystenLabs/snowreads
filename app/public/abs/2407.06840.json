In\nparticular, we obtain the global existence, uniqueness and the Feller property\nfor stochastic 3D Navier-Stokes equations, which provide positive answers to\nsome longstanding open problems in this field.\n  Moreover, we discover a new phenomenon that for a potentially explosive\ndeterministic system, an appropriate intervention of nonlinear noise can not\nonly prevent blow-up but also lead to the finite time extinction of the\nassociated stochastic system. Our main results have broad applications,\nincluding stochastic $p$-Laplace equations with heat sources, stochastic\nsurface growth models and stochastic quasi-geostrophic equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
