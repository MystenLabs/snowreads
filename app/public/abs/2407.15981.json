In the case of half-planes cuts, we\npresent a deterministic algorithm running in $O(n^2)$ time and a randomized\nalgorithm running in $O(n^{3/2+\\varepsilon})$ expected time for any\n$\\varepsilon>0$. In the case of cuts defined by sweeps of infinite rays, we\npresent an algorithm running in $O(n^5)$ time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
