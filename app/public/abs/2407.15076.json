Motivated by these considerations, we study the\nsteepening and dissipation of a strongly magnetized fast magnetosonic wave\npropagating in a declining background magnetic field, by means of\nparticle-in-cell simulations that encompass MHD scales. Our analysis confirms\nthe formation of a monster shock as $B^2-E^2 \\to 0$, that dissipates about half\nof the fast magnetosonic wave energy. It also reveals, for the first time, the\ngeneration of a high-frequency precursor wave by a synchrotron maser\ninstability at the monster shock front, carrying a fraction of $\\sim 10^{-3}$\nof the total energy dissipated at the shock. The spectrum of the precursor wave\nexhibits several sharp harmonic peaks, with frequencies in the GHz band under\nconditions anticipated in magnetars. Such signals may appear as fast radio\nbursts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
