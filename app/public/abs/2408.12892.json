The corresponding rate coefficients are calculated for total and\npartial ionization cross sections using the Maxwell's velocity distribution\nfunction. Our data for partial and total ionization along with the rate\ncoefficient showed good agreement with the existing data in the literature. The\ntargets studied are important for plasma applications and are used in gas-based\ndetectors at high-energy physics experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
