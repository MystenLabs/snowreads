Applications are increasingly\nbeing developed in this way. Software engineers can usually rely on a plethora\nof supporting information on how to use and implement any given technology. For\nAI-based systems, however, such information is scarce. Specifically, guidance\non how to securely design the architecture is not available to the extent as\nfor other systems. We present 16 architectural security guidelines for the\ndesign of AI-based systems that were curated via a multi-vocal literature\nreview. The guidelines could support practitioners with actionable advice on\nthe secure development of AI-based systems. Further, we mapped the guidelines\nto typical components of AI-based systems and observed a high coverage where 6\nout of 8 generic components have at least one guideline associated to them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
