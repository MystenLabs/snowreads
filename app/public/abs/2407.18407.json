The healthcare cyber-physical systems (HCPS) combine physical and\ncyber components to improve the healthcare industry. While HCPS has many\nadvantages, it also has some drawbacks, such as a lengthy data entry process, a\nlack of real-time processing, and limited real-time patient visualization. To\novercome these issues, this paper represents an innovative approach to\nintegrating large language model (LLM) to enhance the efficiency of the\nhealthcare system. By incorporating LLM at various layers, HCPS can leverage\nadvanced AI capabilities to improve patient outcomes, advance data processing,\nand enhance decision-making.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
