The new\nupper bound was obtained using the flag algebra method, and the lower bounds\ncome from constructions discovered using tabu search.\n  We also explore generalized Ramsey numbers using similar methods. Let\n$GR(r,K_s,t)$ denote the minimum number of vertices $n$ such that any\n$r$-edge-coloring of $K_n$ has a copy of $K_s$ with at most $t$ colors. We\nestablish $GR(3,K_4,2) = 10$, $GR(4,K_4,3) = 10$, and some additional bounds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
