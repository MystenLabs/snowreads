However, the recent proliferation of increasingly capable sensors and\na surge in the number deployed, has led to a substantial growth in the volume\nof data that needs to be transmitted via satellites. In response to this\ngrowing demand, free space optical communication systems have been proposed, as\nthey allow for the use of large bandwidths of unlicensed spectrum, enabling\nhigh data rates. However, optical communications are highly vulnerable to\nweather-induced disruptions, thereby limiting their high potential. This paper\nproposes the use of high altitude platform station (HAPS) systems in\nconjunction with delay-tolerant networking techniques to increase the amount of\ndata that can be transmitted to the ground from satellites when compared to the\nuse of traditional ground station network architectures. The architectural\nproposal is evaluated in terms of delivery ratio and buffer occupancy, and the\nsubsequent discussion analyzes the advantages, challenges and potential areas\nfor future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
