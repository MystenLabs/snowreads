For the toric\ndegeneration $\\mathcal{X}$, we study the real Monge--Amp\\`{e}re equation\ncorresponding to the non-archimedean Monge--Amp\\`{e}re equation that yields the\nnon-archimedean Calabi--Yau metric. Our main theorem describes the real\nMonge--Amp\\`{e}re equation in terms of tropical geometry and proves the metric\nSYZ conjecture for the toric degeneration $\\mathcal{X}$ supposing the existence\nof its solution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
