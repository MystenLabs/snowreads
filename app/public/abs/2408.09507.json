The model incorporates (1) ion diffusion inside the\nchannel that governs the electronic conductivity, (2) horizontal electron\ntransport, and (3) the external elements (capacitance, ionic resistance) of the\nion dynamics in the electrolyte. We find a general expression of two different\ntime constants that determine the vertical insertion process in terms of the\nkinetic parameters, in addition to the electronic transit time. We thus obtain\na generalization of Bernards-Malliaras model for the exponential transient, as\nwell as a more general set of nonlinear equations that explain the large\nperturbation effects. The basic model is confirmed by detailed simulations that\nenable to visualize the different ions distributions and dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FmeYbujRRp_tUDKniDw0-SKa-2kwqphoFjsYgpEWhoE","pdfSize":"1770359"}
