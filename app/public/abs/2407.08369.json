Using first-principles electronic structure theory, we compute\nthe evolution across the ferroaxial transitions of the local electric toroidal\ndipole moments, defined both in terms of the vortices formed by local dipoles,\nas well as as the cross product of orbital and spin angular momenta. Our\ncalculations confirm that the electric toroidal dipole acts as the order\nparameter for these ferroaxial transitions and highlight the importance of\nspin-orbit coupling in generating a non-zero atomic-site electric toroidal\ndipole moment. We find that, while the ferroaxial phases of NiTiO$_3$ and\nK$_2$Zr(PO$_4$)$_2$ preserve global inversion symmetry, they contain\ninversion-symmetry-broken sub-units that generate vortices of local electric\ndipole moments. In addition to causing the net electric toroidal dipole moment,\nthese vortices induce a hidden spin polarization in the band structure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V1ijrUErT8JSFiZqDK_LA-ExqRlIxkwlaNBFpMAb91s","pdfSize":"4039108"}
