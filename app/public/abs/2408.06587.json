Although the maturity level of\nthe short distance (less than 100 km) quantum-secured channels is at a\ndeployment level, instituting such channels over long distance faces\ntechnological challenges, which is the subject of a world-wide research. In\nthis article an industry perspective on establishing quantum-secured channels\nin large-scale optical networks in operational environments will be discussed,\nincluding the vision, requirements, and technical analysis of different\napproaches for establishing such channels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
