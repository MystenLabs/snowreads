We study a thermally driven parametric amplifier based on a\nsuperconductor-insulator-graphene-insulator-superconductor (SIGIS) junction\ncoupled to a superconducting microwave cavity. The strong non-linearity in the\ntemperature dependence of our device leads to thermal self-modulation that\nproduces impedance oscillations at frequencies around twice the angular cavity\nresonance frequency $\\omega_\\mathrm{r}$. In particular, reactance modulation of\nthe effective capacitance yields a gain of 18.6 dB over a frequency span of 125\nkHz with a minimum noise temperature of $T_\\mathrm{N} = 1.4$ K. Our theoretical\nmodelling gives insight into the exact mixing processes, confirmation of the\nelectron-phonon coupling parameter and possible improvements of the studied\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"xpFPfoSjckqCuGFq54sdKv_C-BTE6VKxSsJlWIaFQ7o","pdfSize":"2228699"}
