However, the magnon current in\nthree-dimensional magnetic materials remains orders of magnitude too small for\napplications. In contrast, magnon numbers in two-dimensional systems exhibit\nsignificant enhancement and are markedly influenced by external magnetic\nfields. Here, we investigate the magnon current in a two-dimensional easy-axis\nferromagnet and find a colossal magnon magnetoresistance (CMMR) effect, wherein\nthe change of the magnon conductance can reach as high as a thousand percent in\na moderate magnetic field. Moreover, the magnitude of the CMMR exhibits\nsignificant dependence on the orientation of the magnetic field due to the\ninterplay between magnon- conserving and non-conserving scattering. We propose\na non-local magnon-mediated electrical drag experiment for the possible\nexperimental observation of the predicted effect. With the CMMR effect and a\nmuch larger magnon number, magnon current in 2D materials shows promise as a\nprimary source for spin transport in spintronics devices.9\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2m6axbOclkhobjW0gtn7DlfUHavrpFM7frLsqfiGFJ4","pdfSize":"684909"}
