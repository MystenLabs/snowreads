It is also\ndecomposable and completely free of adjustable hyperparameters. For practical\ncomputations, we identify a remarkably accurate approximation proposed earlier\nby Szpankowski and Weinberger. Experiments on both simulated and real data\ndemonstrate that the new criterion leads to parsimonious models with good\npredictive accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
