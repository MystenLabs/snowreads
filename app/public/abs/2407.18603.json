One of them was shown to\nhold in ZFC by Shelah. A stronger one was shown to follow from several\nconsequences of the continuum hypothesis by Inamdar and Rinot. Here we prove\nthat the stronger one may consistently fail. Specifically, starting with a\nsupercompact cardinal and an inaccessible cardinal above it, we devise a notion\nof forcing consisting of finite working parts and finitely many two types of\nmodels as side conditions, to violate this analog of $\\mho$ at the second\nuncountable cardinal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
