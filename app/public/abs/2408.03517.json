To start with, an improved global Carleman\nestimate for linear backward stochastic fourth order parabolic equations with\n$L^2$-valued source terms is derived, which is based on a new fundamental\nidentity for a stochastic fourth order parabolic operator. Based on it, we\nestablish a new global Carleman estimate for linear backward stochastic fourth\norder parabolic equations with $H^{-2}$-valued source terms, which, together\nwith a fixed point argument, derive the desired null controllability for the\nstochastic Cahn-Hilliard type equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
