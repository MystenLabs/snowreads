Even though the accumulation of\ncontamination is predictable within a certain degree, there are currently no\neffective ways to identify the risk of the insulator flashover in order to plan\nits replacement. This paper presents a novel machine learning (ML) based method\nfor estimating the flashover probability of the cup-and-pin glass insulator\nstring. The proposed method is based on the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)\nsupervised ML model, in which the leakage current (LC) features and applied\nvoltage are used as the inputs. The established model can estimate the critical\nflashover voltage (U50%) for various designs of OHL insulators with different\nvoltage levels. The proposed method is also able to accurately determine the\ncondition of the insulator strings and instruct asset management engineers to\ntake appropriate actions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
