The exponential growth of the media industry has\nheightened concerns regarding the anonymization of individuals captured in\nvideo footage. Traditional methods, such as blurring or pixelation, are\ncommonly employed, while recent advancements have introduced generative\nadversarial networks (GAN) to redraw faces in videos. In this study, we propose\na novel approach that employs a significantly smaller model to achieve\nreal-time full-body anonymization of individuals in videos. Unlike conventional\ntechniques that often fail to effectively remove personal identification\ninformation such as skin color, clothing, accessories, and body shape while our\nmethod successfully eradicates all such details. Furthermore, by leveraging\npose estimation algorithms, our approach accurately represents information\nregarding individuals' positions, movements, and postures. This algorithm can\nbe seamlessly integrated into CCTV or IP camera systems installed in various\nindustrial settings, functioning in real-time and thus facilitating the\nwidespread adoption of full-body anonymization technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GvBpTCVdrjmaRoIq4LDhSN42gDSp4P7I7ffkJ_c3qMQ","pdfSize":"2715301"}
