For\na representation $\\pi$ of $GL_{4}(\\mathfrak{o}_2)$, the degenerate Whittaker\nspace $\\pi_{N, \\psi}$ is a representation of $GL_2(\\mathfrak{o}_2)$. We\ndescribe $\\pi_{N, \\psi}$ explicitly for an irreducible strongly cuspidal\nrepresentation $\\pi$ of $GL_4(\\mathfrak{o}_2)$. This description verifies a\nspecial case of a conjecture of Prasad. We also prove that $\\pi_{N, \\psi}$ is a\nmultiplicity free representation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
