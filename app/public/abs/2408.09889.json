It relies on stochastic estimates of prior volumes enclosed\nby likelihood contours, which limits the accuracy of the log-evidence\ncalculation. We propose to transform the prior volume estimation into a\nBayesian inference problem, which allows us to incorporate a smoothness\nassumption for likelihood-prior volume relations. As a result, we aim to\nincrease the accuracy of the volume estimates and thus improve the overall\nlog-evidence calculation using NS. The method presented works as a\npost-processing step for NS and provides posterior samples of the\nlikelihood-prior-volume relation, from which the log-evidence can be\ncalculated. We demonstrate an implementation of the algorithm and compare its\nresults with plain NS on two synthetic datasets for which the underlying\nevidence is known. We find a significant improvement in accuracy for runs with\nless than one hundred active samples in NS, but are prone to numerical problems\nbeyond this point.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
