Thus, using the $r$ largest order\nstatistics (rLOS) instead of the block maxima is encouraged. Based on the\nfour-parameter kappa model for the rLOS (rK4D), we introduce a new distribution\nfor the rLOS as a special case of the rK4D. That is the generalized logistic\nmodel for rLOS (rGLO). This distribution can be useful when the generalized\nextreme value model for rLOS is no longer efficient to capture the variability\nof extreme values. Moreover, the rGLO enriches a pool of candidate\ndistributions to determine the best model to yield accurate and robust quantile\nestimates. We derive a joint probability density function, the marginal and\nconditional distribution functions of new model. The maximum likelihood\nestimation, delta method, profile likelihood, order selection by the entropy\ndifference test, cross-validated likelihood criteria, and model averaging were\nconsidered for inferences. The usefulness and practical effectiveness of the\nrGLO are illustrated by the Monte Carlo simulation and an application to\nextreme streamflow data in Bevern Stream, UK.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"TCVR3Da858-GZ3cXifC4EgY6WgBGt7BR2qrurPcrlzQ","pdfSize":"862599"}
