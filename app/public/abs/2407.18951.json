Digital Twins (DT) are one such\ntransformational technology that leverages software systems to replicate\nphysical process behavior, representing the physical process in a digital\nenvironment. This paper aims to explore the use of photogrammetry (which is the\nprocess of reconstructing physical objects into virtual 3D models using\nphotographs) and 3D Scanning techniques to create accurate visual\nrepresentation of the 'Physical Process', to interact with the ML/AI based\nbehavior models. To achieve this, we have used a readily available consumer\ndevice, the iPhone 15 Pro, which features stereo vision capabilities, to\ncapture the depth of an Industry 4.0 system. By processing these images using\n3D scanning tools, we created a raw 3D model for 3D modeling and rendering\nsoftware for the creation of a DT model. The paper highlights the reliability\nof this method by measuring the error rate in between the ground truth\n(measurements done manually using a tape measure) and the final 3D model\ncreated using this method. The overall mean error is 4.97\\% and the overall\nstandard deviation error is 5.54\\% between the ground truth measurements and\ntheir photogrammetry counterparts. The results from this work indicate that\nphotogrammetry using consumer-grade devices can be an efficient and\ncost-efficient approach to creating DTs for smart manufacturing, while the\napproaches flexibility allows for iterative improvements of the models over\ntime.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2HSilEBpU1KyZV4ceVY26Zx_KwH-Ue_pnxRw7K_15W4","pdfSize":"15910272"}
