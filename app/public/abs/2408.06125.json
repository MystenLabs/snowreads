We show that\nthe dynamical equation for the excitations of Bose-Einstein condensates at zero\ntemperature can be expressed in an eigenvalue form that resembles the\ntime-independent Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of\nthis equation correspond to the dispersions of the collective modes and the\namplitudes of the density oscillations. This alikeness opens the way for the\nsimulation of different tight-binding models with arrays of condensates. We\ndemonstrate, in particular, how we can model a one-dimensional\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice supporting topological edge modes and a\ntwo-dimensional Lieb lattice with flat-band excitations with superlattices of\nBose-Einstein condensates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
