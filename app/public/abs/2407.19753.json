However, accurately\nrecognizing predefined gestures within a closed set is still inadequate in\npractice; a robust open-set system needs to effectively reject unknown gestures\nwhile correctly classifying known ones. To handle this challenge, we first\nreport prediction inconsistency discovered for unknown classes due to ensemble\ndiversity, which can significantly facilitate the detection of unknown classes.\nBased on this insight, we propose an ensemble learning approach, PredIN, to\nexplicitly magnify the prediction inconsistency by enhancing ensemble\ndiversity. Specifically, PredIN maximizes the class feature distribution\ninconsistency among ensemble members to enhance diversity. Meanwhile, it\noptimizes inter-class separability within an individual ensemble member to\nmaintain individual performance. Comprehensive experiments on various benchmark\ndatasets demonstrate that the PredIN outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a\nclear margin.Our proposed method simultaneously achieves accurate closed-set\nclassification for predefined gestures and effective rejection for unknown\ngestures, exhibiting its efficacy and superiority in open-set gesture\nrecognition based on sEMG.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
