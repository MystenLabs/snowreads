By performing experiments on a\ndigital quantum computer consisting of fully-connected optically-controlled\ntrapped ions, we study the role of entanglement in the thermalization dynamics\nof a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Using\nrandomized-measurement protocols, we efficiently learn a classical\napproximation of non-equilibrium states that yields the gap-ratio distribution\nand the spectral form factor of the entanglement Hamiltonian. These observables\nexhibit universal early-time signals for quantum chaos, a prerequisite for\nthermalization. Our work, therefore, establishes quantum computers as robust\ntools for studying universal features of thermalization in complex many-body\nsystems, including in gauge theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
