We characterize the region of achievable\npairs of costs in three scenarios: (i) causal encoding and causal decoding,\n(ii) causal encoding and causal decoding with channel feedback, and (iii)\ncausal encoding and noncausal decoding with channel feedback. In these\nvector-valued versions of the problem, the optimal coding schemes must rely on\na time-sharing strategy, since the region of achievable pairs of costs might\nnot be convex in the scalar version of the problem. We examine the role of the\nchannel feedback when the encoder is causal and the decoder is either causal or\nnon-causal, and we show that feedback improves the performance, only when the\ndecoder is non-causal.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"y9k_zNo5gpjW2nK0kuJ6DpfZ5l-TJST8zsh4pF6gyZ8","pdfSize":"162971"}
