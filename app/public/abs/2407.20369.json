In this work, we extend the application space by\ndemonstrating a Rydberg atom rf polarimeter. Using rf heterodyne with three\nindependent and orthogonal local oscillators, we are able to extract the\npolarization ellipse of the field in three dimensions, in addition to the total\namplitude of the field. We use the relative phases and amplitudes of the three\ngenerated heterodyne signals to measure the field amplitudes and phases along\nthree cardinal axes giving the full three-dimensional polarization. We\ndemonstrate this polarization measurement for incoming fields at different\nangles around the sensor. Lastly, we investigate the reception of data symbols\nencoded in the horizontal and vertical signal field polarizations and the phase\nbetween them. Our measurements yield an amplitude noise of 57\n$\\mu$V/m/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ for horizontal polarization, 66\n$\\mu$V/m/$\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ for vertical polarization, and a standard deviation\nof 0.094 rad in the phase between the field components.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
