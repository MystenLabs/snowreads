To\neliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system,\noptimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between\neconomical and equity considerations. However, the resulting optimization\nproblem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and\nthus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this\nchallenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to\nenable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding\nproblem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC\nsystem have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm\nfor delivering equitable and real-time load shedding decisions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
