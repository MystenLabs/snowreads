We focus\non the S-wave $D^{*-}K^{*+}$ and $D_s^+D_s^-$ molecular states, which can be\nrelated to the $X_0(2900)$ and $\\chi_{c0}(3930)$, respectively. Using effective\nLagrangians, we construct the potential kernel of the\n$D^{*-}K^{*+}$$-$$D^{-}K^{+}$ and $D_s^+D_s^-$$-$$D^+D^-$ interactions with a\none-boson-exchange model, and determine the scattering amplitudes and their\npoles through a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. By\nincorporating the potential kernel into the three-body decay process\n$B^+$$\\to$$D^+ D^- K^+$, we evaluate the $D^-K^+$ and $D^+D^-$ invariant mass\nspectra, as well as the Dalitz plot, with Monte Carlo simulation. A\nsatisfactory fit to the $D^-K^+$ and $D^+D^-$ invariant mass spectra is\nachieved after introducing additional Breit-Wigner resonances, the $X_1(2900)$,\n$\\psi(3770)$, and $\\chi_{c2}(3930)$ states. Prominent signals of the\n$X_0(2900)$ and $\\chi_{c0}(3930)$ states appear as peaks in the $D^-K^+$ and\n$D^+D^-$ invariant mass spectra near 2900 and 3930 MeV, respectively. Clear\nevent concentration of the $X_0(2900)$ and $\\chi_0(3930)$ states is evident as\nstrips in the Dalitz plot. The results suggest that both $X_0(2900)$ and\n$\\chi_{c0}(3930)$ can be interpreted as molecular states, with the inclusion of\n$X_1(2900)$ and $\\chi_2(3930)$ necessary to describe structures in the regions\nnear 2900 and 3930 MeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
