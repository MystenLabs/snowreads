Ferromagnetic\norder is observed near $T_C \\simeq$ 306 K on warming and $T_C \\simeq$ 302 K on\ncooling, which is consistent with previously-reported values for stoichiometric\nMnAs samples. In contrast, the second-order structural phase transition is\nobserved at $T_S \\simeq$ 353 K, which is nearly 50 K lower than in the\nstoichiometric compound. We observe differences in the thermal expansion of our\nsamples when compared to reports of stoichiometric MnAs including: (1) the\n$\\sim$1.5% volume decrease at $T_C$ is smaller than the expected value of 1.9%,\n(2) the lattice parameters perpendicular to the basal plane exhibit a\ndiscontinuous jump of $\\sim$1.1% at $T_C$ instead of being continuous across\n$T_C$, and (3) thermal expansion perpendicular to the basal plane for $T_C \\le\nT \\le$ 315 K is negative rather than positive. We also observe a correlation\nbetween the ratio of hexagonal lattice parameters, $c/a$, and $T_S$, strongly\nsuggesting that the degree of structural anisotropy in MnAs could play an\nimportant role in tuning $T_S$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
