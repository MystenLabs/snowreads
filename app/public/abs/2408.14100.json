The phenomenon\nhas recently drawn significant attention because of a connection to some fast\nradio bursts that has been reported. Understanding magnetar outbursts may\nprovide the key to mysterious transient events. The elastic deformation of the\nsolid crust due to magnetic field evolution accumulates over a secular\ntimescale. Eventually, the crust fractures or responds plastically beyond a\nparticular threshold. Determination of the critical limit is required to obtain\nthe shear strain tensor in response to magnetic stress. In some studies, the\ntensor was substituted with an approximate expression determined algebraically\nfrom the magnetic stress. This study evaluated the validity of the\napproximation by comparing it with the strain tensor obtained through\nappropriate calculations. The differential equations for the elastic\ndeformation driven by the magnetic field were solved. The results indicated\nthat the approximation did not represent the correct strain tensor value, both\nin magnitude and spatial profile. Previous evolutionary calculations based on\nspurious criteria are likely to overestimate the magnitude of the strain\ntensor, and crustal failure occurs on a shorter timescale. Therefore,\nrevisiting evolutionary calculations using the correct approach is necessary.\nThis study is essential for developing the dynamics of crustal fractures and\nthe magnetic-field evolution in a magnetar.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
