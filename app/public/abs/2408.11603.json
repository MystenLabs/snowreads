The light deflection angles in both the weak field limit and the\nstrong field limit are calculated. Furthermore, we use the data of the\nsupermassive black holes SgrA* and M87* and calculate the lensing observables\nin the strong field limit. We find that the quantum parameter plays a role\nanalogous to the electric charge in the weak gravitational lensing, whereas in\nthe strong field limit, the effect of the quantum parameter on the deflection\nangle, the angular separation and the relative magnification is opposite to\nthat of the electric charge, the scalar charge and the quantum parameters in\nsome gravity theories. The results indicate the discrepancies between the\nclassical black holes and the two quantum-modified black hole models that\ndepend on the quantum correction, making them a valuable tool for\ndifferentiating between these black hole models.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
