Within the framework of the generalized\ntime-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations we demonstrate the induction of the\ncoherent vortex pairs that are moving in phase with electormagnetic wave\noscillations. The overall vorticity of the superconductor remain zero\nthroughout the cycle. Our results uncover rich multiscale dynamics of SC\nvorticity and suggest new optical applications for various types of structured\nlight. In departure from classical laser printing, the laser printing proposed\nhere can be viewed as quantum print where we induce quantum excitations in the\nSC liquid.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
