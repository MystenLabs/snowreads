An emergent symmetry maps the quantum dynamics into a\nclassical stochastic process. Thus we are able to study many dynamical\nproperties at finite N on an arbitrary graph structure. A comprehensive study\nof operator size growth with or without spatial locality is presented. We will\nshow universal behaviors emerge at large N limit, and compare them with field\ntheory method. We also design simple stochastic processes as an intuitive way\nof thinking about many-body chaotic behaviors. Other properties including\nentanglement growth and other variants of this solvable models are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
