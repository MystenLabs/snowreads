However, we observe that EWSs detect\nan impending tipping past bifurcation points when control parameters are varied\nfast; this questions the applicability of EWSs in real-world systems. When a\ncontrol parameter is changed at a finite rate, the tipping is also delayed,\nproviding a borrowed stability (in the parameter space) before the system tips.\nIn this study, we use the Hurst exponent as EWS in a thermoacoustic system - a\nhorizontal Rijke tube. We find that upon receiving an EWS alert, a quick\nreversal of the control parameter within the region of borrowed stability\ncannot always prevent tipping in real-world systems. We show this failure is\ndue to the (i) delay in receiving the EWS alert and (ii) dispersion observed in\nthe warning points received. For fast variation of parameters, where preventive\nmeasures fall short, we demonstrate EWS-based control actions to rescue the\nsystem after tipping. Our results in a real-world system for a fast variation\nof parameter highlight the limits of applicability of EWSs in preventing\ntipping.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wl2AMi3vFJqHqIGpSJV5t6yJ-xSG-aB3TvGQB0_B4qE","pdfSize":"1638161"}
