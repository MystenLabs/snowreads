However, these\nsolutions often necessitate vast amounts of manually labeled or synthetic data.\nAddressing this challenge, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has gained attention\nby utilizing large datasets of unlabeled data to train DNN, thereby generating\nmeaningful and robust representations. Although SSL was initially overlooked in\nTR because of its unique characteristics, recent years have witnessed a surge\nin the development of SSL methods specifically for this field. This rapid\ndevelopment, however, has led to many methods being explored independently,\nwithout taking previous efforts in methodology or comparison into account,\nthereby hindering progress in the field of research. This paper, therefore,\nseeks to consolidate the use of SSL in the field of TR, offering a critical and\ncomprehensive overview of the current state of the art. We will review and\nanalyze the existing methods, compare their results, and highlight\ninconsistencies in the current literature. This thorough analysis aims to\nprovide general insights into the field, propose standardizations, identify new\nresearch directions, and foster its proper development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
