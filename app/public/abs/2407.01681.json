We demonstrate that nonreciprocal superconductivity can be detected\nby Andreev reflection. In particular, a transparent junction between a normal\nmetal and a nonreciprocal superconductor generally exhibits an asymmetric\ncurrent-voltage characteristic, which serves as a defining feature of\nnonreciprocal superconductivity. Unlike the superconducting diode effects, our\ndetection scheme has the advantage of avoiding large critical currents that\nturn the superconducting state to normal. Finally, we discuss candidates for\nnonreciprocal superconductivity, including graphene, UTe2, as well as\nengineered platforms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
