To bridge the gap, this paper introduces the task\nof EXplainable GEC (EXGEC), which focuses on the integral role of both\ncorrection and explanation tasks. To facilitate the task, we propose EXCGEC, a\ntailored benchmark for Chinese EXGEC consisting of 8,216 explanation-augmented\nsamples featuring the design of hybrid edit-wise explanations. We benchmark\nseveral series of LLMs in multiple settings, covering post-explaining and\npre-explaining. To promote the development of the task, we introduce a\ncomprehensive suite of automatic metrics and conduct human evaluation\nexperiments to demonstrate the human consistency of the automatic metrics for\nfree-text explanations. All the codes and data will be released after the\nreview.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
