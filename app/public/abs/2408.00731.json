While service\nproviders can optimize their machine utilization, tenants only need to pay for\nthe resources they use. To maximize resource utilization, these serverless\nsystems co-run numerous short-lived functions, bearing frequent system\ncondition shifts. When the system gets overcrowded, a tenant's function may\nsuffer from disturbing slowdowns. Ironically, tenants also incur higher costs\nduring these slowdowns, as commercial serverless platforms determine costs\nproportional to their execution times.\n  This paper argues that cloud providers should compensate tenants for losses\nincurred when the server is over-provisioned. However, estimating tenants'\nlosses is challenging without pre-profiled information about their functions.\nPrior studies have indicated that assessing tenant losses leads to heavy\noverheads. As a solution, this paper introduces a new pricing model that offers\ndiscounts based on the machine's state while presuming the tenant's loss under\nthat state. To monitor the machine state accurately, Litmus pricing frequently\nconducts Litmus tests, an effective and lightweight solution for measuring\nsystem congestion. Our experiments show that Litmus pricing can accurately\ngauge the impact of system congestion and offer nearly ideal prices, with only\na 0.2% price difference on average, in a heavily congested system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
