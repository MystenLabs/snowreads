TSN and private 5G will co-exist in industrial systems;\nhence, converged operation of the two is crucial to achieving end-to-end\ndeterministic performance. This work conducts a testbed-based evaluation of a\nhybrid 5G and TSN system with over-the-air transmission of scheduled real-time\nTSN traffic (based on IEEE 802.1Qbv standard). The main objective is to bring\nthe dynamics of hybrid 5G and TSN deployments to spotlight. The testbed\ncomprises off-the-shelf TSN and 5G devices and a near product-grade 5G system.\nThe results show the impact of 802.1Qbv parameters and 5G system capabilities\non end-to-end deterministic performance. The findings of this study have\nsignificance for design and optimization of 3GPP-defined bridge model (black\nbox model) for 5G/TSN integration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
