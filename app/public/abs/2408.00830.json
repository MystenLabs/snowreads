For toroidal compactifications,\nattractor points are related to (degenerate) masses of the Laplacian on the\ntarget space, and also to the Laplacian on the moduli space. We also explore\ncompactifications of M-Theory to $5$D on a Calabi-Yau threefold and argue that\ngeodesics are unique in a special set of classes, providing further evidence\nfor a recent conjecture by Raman and Vafa. Finally, we describe the role of the\nmarked moduli space in $4$d $\\mathcal{N} = 2$ compactifications. We study split\nattractor flows in an explicit example of the one-parameter family of quintics\nand discuss setups where flops to isomorphic Calabi-Yau manifolds exist.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
