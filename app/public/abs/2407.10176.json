This approach has been demonstrated to\nbe superior to approximate Riemann solvers in a recent comparison (Puri &\nRamachandran 2014). The Cullen & Dehnen (2010) switch is regarded as the state\nof the art. But are we missing something? I will present a novel approach to\nshock capturing in SPH that utilises the philosophy of approximate Riemann\nsolvers but provides a direct improvement on the ability to reduce excess\ndissipation away from shocks while preserving the fidelity of the shock itself.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
