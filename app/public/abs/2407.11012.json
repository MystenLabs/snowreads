To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce a speech-based approach for automatic suicide risk\nassessment. Our study involves a novel dataset comprising speech recordings of\n20 patients who read neutral texts. We extract four speech representations\nencompassing interpretable and deep features. Further, we explore the impact of\ngender-based modelling and phrase-level normalisation. By applying\ngender-exclusive modelling, features extracted from an emotion fine-tuned\nwav2vec2.0 model can be utilised to discriminate high- from low- suicide risk\nwith a balanced accuracy of 81%. Finally, our analysis reveals a discrepancy in\nthe relationship of speech characteristics and suicide risk between female and\nmale subjects. For men in our dataset, suicide risk increases together with\nagitation while voice characteristics of female subjects point the other way.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
