In applications such as design optimization or uncertainty\nquantification, solutions of those PDEs need to be evaluated at numerous points\nin the parameter space. While physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have\nemerged as a new strong competitor as a surrogate, their usage in this scenario\nremains underexplored due to the inherent need for repetitive and\ntime-consuming training. In this paper, we address this problem by proposing a\nnovel extension, parameterized physics-informed neural networks (P$^2$INNs).\nP$^2$INNs enable modeling the solutions of parameterized PDEs via explicitly\nencoding a latent representation of PDE parameters. With the extensive\nempirical evaluation, we demonstrate that P$^2$INNs outperform the baselines\nboth in accuracy and parameter efficiency on benchmark 1D and 2D parameterized\nPDEs and are also effective in overcoming the known \"failure modes\".\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
