To address these\nissues, we propose a semi-supervised method based on latent mean-teacher and\nGaussian process, named LMT-GP. We first design a latent mean-teacher framework\nthat integrates both labeled and unlabeled data, as well as their latent\nvectors, into model training. Meanwhile, we use a mean-teacher-assisted\nGaussian process learning strategy to establish a connection between the latent\nand pseudo-latent vectors obtained from the labeled and unlabeled data. To\nguide the learning process, we utilize an assisted Gaussian process regression\n(GPR) loss function. Furthermore, we design a pseudo-label adaptation module\n(PAM) to ensure the reliability of the network learning. To demonstrate our\nmethod's generalization ability and effectiveness, we apply it to multiple LLIE\ndatasets and high-level vision tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves high generalization performance and image quality.
