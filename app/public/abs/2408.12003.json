However, existing large language models\n(LLMs) face challenges in personalized recommendation capabilities and the\ngeneration of content that can sometimes produce hallucinations. This study\nproposes an optimization scheme for Tibet tourism LLMs based on\nretrieval-augmented generation (RAG) technology. By constructing a database of\ntourist viewpoints and processing the data using vectorization techniques, we\nhave significantly improved retrieval accuracy. The application of RAG\ntechnology effectively addresses the hallucination problem in content\ngeneration. The optimized model shows significant improvements in fluency,\naccuracy, and relevance of content generation. This research demonstrates the\npotential of RAG technology in the standardization of cultural tourism\ninformation and data analysis, providing theoretical and technical support for\nthe development of intelligent cultural tourism service systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RqFqEJh35BSh4udR0tW8QL1FctNO6Y-NCbRTUkjV56Y","pdfSize":"1563079"}
