However, recently discovered\nexotic properties of quantum entanglement have motivated us to reconsider\nShannon's theorem in the quantum regime. In this work we design a quantum\nencryption method that overcomes Shannon's theorem to achieve perfect secrecy\nwith reusable keys. The mechanism used is fundamentally quantum, demonstrating\nsubtle but critical differences in how information is processed in quantum\nversus classical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
