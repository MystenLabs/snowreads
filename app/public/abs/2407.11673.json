Indeed, the\nintrinsically unstable nature of the open-loop dynamics of locomotion systems\nrenders naive learning from scratch prone to catastrophic failures in the real\nworld. In this work, we investigate the use of iterative algorithms to safely\nlearn locomotion skills from model predictive control (MPC). In our framework,\nwe use MPC as an expert and take inspiration from the safe data aggregation\n(SafeDAGGER) framework to minimize the number of failures during training of\nthe policy. Through a comparison with other standard approaches such as\nbehavior cloning and vanilla DAGGER, we show that not only our approach has a\nsubstantially fewer number of failures during training, but the resulting\npolicy is also more robust to external disturbances.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
