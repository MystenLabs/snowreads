Despite advances in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, they\nstill exhibit significant biases and uncertainties, especially at high spatial\nand temporal resolutions. To address these limitations, we explore\nuncertainty-aware deep learning models for post-processing daily cumulative\nquantitative precipitation forecasts to obtain forecast uncertainties that lead\nto a better trade-off between accuracy and reliability. Our study compares\ndifferent state-of-the-art models, and we propose a variant of the well-known\nSDE-Net, called SDE U-Net, tailored to segmentation problems like ours. We\nevaluate its performance for both typical and intense precipitation events.\n  Our results show that all deep learning models significantly outperform the\naverage baseline NWP solution, with our implementation of the SDE U-Net showing\nthe best trade-off between accuracy and reliability. Integrating these models,\nwhich account for uncertainty, into operational forecasting systems can improve\ndecision-making and preparedness for weather-related events.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ByP67csvdrSoxVNpER7wPmrAMlefCr3-E7zT5NZj5Qo","pdfSize":"638546"}
