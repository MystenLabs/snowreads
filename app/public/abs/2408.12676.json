Metadata extracted from\nbehavioural simulation could be used to optimise and/or speed up subsequent\nsteps in the hardware design flow. In this paper, we propose Simopt, a tool\nflow that extracts simulation metadata to improve the timing performance of the\ndesign by introducing latency awareness during the placement phase and\nsubsequently improving the routing time of the post-placed netlist using vendor\ntools. For our experiments, we adapt the open-source Yosys flow to perform\nSimopt-aware placement. Our results show that using the Simopt-pass in the\ndesign implementation flow results in up to 38.2% reduction in timing\nperformance (latency) of the design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
