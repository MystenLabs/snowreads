Standard-compliant WiFi provides a cost effective,\neasy and backward-compatible approach to Joint Communication and Sensing and\nenables a seamless transfer of results from experiments to practical\napplications. However, most WiFi sensing research is conducted on channel state\ninformation (CSI) data from current-generation devices, which are usually not\nmeant for sensing applications and thus lack sufficient spatial diversity or\nphase synchronization. With ESPARGOS, we previously developed a phase-coherent,\nreal-time capable many-antenna WiFi channel sounder specifically for wireless\nsensing. We describe how we use ESPARGOS to capture large CSI datasets that we\nmake publicly available. The datasets are extensively documented and labeled,\nfor example with information from reference positioning systems, enabling\ndata-driven and machine learning-based research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
