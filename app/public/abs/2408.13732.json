A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by\ndirectly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without\nappealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines\nmoving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\\'enic trajectories\ncorrespond to the dynamical system $\\dot{\\bf x}(t)={\\bf B}$, where $\\bf B$\nsolves the induction equation, with phase space $(\\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of\nthis phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby\nwave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\\pm \\delta t$,\nunless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions\nfor magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories,\ni.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change\nmagnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry\nbreaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows,\nthe separation of Alfv\\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to\ntheir initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by\ndissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence,\ntrajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial\nseparation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent\ndiffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results\nstrongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its\nreformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HOEAYDmyr-XACJFdo2qmuQPfzIizqyVp4sJ92E28o9o","pdfSize":"796544"}
