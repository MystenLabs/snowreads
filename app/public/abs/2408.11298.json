These eigenstates are determined for\nthe three-quark, three-quark-gluon, and three-quark-quark-antiquark Fock\nrepresentations, making them suitable for low-resolution probes. From this, we\ncalculate the nucleon's quark and gluon matter densities, helicity, and\ntransversity distributions, which show qualitative consistency with\nexperimental extractions. We also compute the contributions of quark and gluon\nhelicity to the proton spin and the tensor charges. The obtained light-front\nwave functions represent a significant advancement towards a unified\ndescription of various hadron distribution functions in both longitudinal and\ntransverse momentum space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
