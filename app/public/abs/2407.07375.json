However, ensuring stability and\nefficiency remains a challenge, especially in scenarios involving nonlinear and\ntime-dependent equations. Methodology: This paper introduces novel\nresidual-based architectures, namely the Simple Highway Network and the Squared\nResidual Network, designed to enhance stability and accuracy in\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs). These architectures augment\ntraditional neural networks by incorporating residual connections, which\nfacilitate smoother weight updates and improve backpropagation efficiency.\nResults: Through extensive numerical experiments across various examples\nincluding linear and nonlinear, time-dependent and independent PDEs we\ndemonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architectures. The Squared Residual\nNetwork, in particular, exhibits robust performance, achieving enhanced\nstability and accuracy compared to conventional neural networks. These findings\nunderscore the potential of residual-based architectures in advancing deep\nlearning for PDEs and computational physics applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
