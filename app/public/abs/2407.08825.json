This can introduce unusual behaviour\nin galaxy phenomenology by affecting galaxies' components differently. Here we\nuse the SDSS-IV-MaNGA dataset to search for a systematic excess of gas circular\nvelocity over stellar circular velocity, expected in thin-shell-screened\ntheories in the partially screened regime. Accounting for asymmetric drift and\ncalibrating our model on screened subsamples, we find no significant evidence\nfor a screened fifth force. We bound the fifth-force strength to $\\Delta\nG/G_\\text{N} < 0.1$ for all astrophysical ranges, strengthening to $\\sim$0.01\nat Compton wavelength of 3 Mpc for the Hu-Sawicki model, for instance. This\nimplies a stringent constraint on scalar-tensor theories, for example\n$f_{\\mathcal{R}0} \\lesssim 10^{-8}$ in Hu-Sawicki $f(\\mathcal{R})$ gravity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gYJXozaJHG_Xt4kox71FMuH6NwLiaYng-J5t1dq9uWw","pdfSize":"1060217","objectId":"0x605bcba21c50b01f2617730a529eecc2b08e520ee96915c01287722cabac0f39","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
