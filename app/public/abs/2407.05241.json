Despite the\nincrease in statistical methods designed to identify spatially variable genes,\nthey are mostly based on marginal analysis and share the limitation that the\ndependence (network) structures among genes are not well accommodated, where a\nbiological process usually involves changes in multiple genes that interact in\na complex network. Moreover, the latent cellular composition within spots may\nintroduce confounding variations, negatively affecting identification accuracy.\nIn this study, we develop a novel Bayesian regularization approach for spatial\ntranscriptomic data, with the confounding variations induced by varying\ncellular distributions effectively corrected. Significantly advancing from the\nexisting studies, a thresholded graph Laplacian regularization is proposed to\nsimultaneously identify spatially variable genes and accommodate the network\nstructure among genes. The proposed method is based on a zero-inflated negative\nbinomial distribution, effectively accommodating the count nature, zero\ninflation, and overdispersion of spatial transcriptomic data. Extensive\nsimulations and the application to real data demonstrate the competitive\nperformance of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
