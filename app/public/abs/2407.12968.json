Many studies, however, are limited to\nspecific media or networks, disregarding the importance of cross-platform\ndiffusion. This study overcomes that limitation by conducting a multi-platform\nframing analysis on Twitter, YouTube, and traditional media analyzing the 2019\nKoran burning in Kristiansand, Norway. It examines media and policy frames and\nuncovers network connections through shared URLs. The findings show that online\nnews emphasizes the incident's legality, while social media focuses on its\nmorality, with harsh hate speech prevalent in YouTube comments. Additionally,\nYouTube is identified as the most self-contained community, whereas Twitter is\nthe most open to external inputs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
