This is in contrast to hydrodynamic simulations in which\nthe size of vortices is only limited by the system size. We propose and develop\nan approach to model the effect of friction close to a surface in a particle\nbased hydrodynamic simulation method in two dimensions, in which the friction\ncoefficient can be related to the system parameters and to the emergence of a\ndamping length. This length limits the size of the emergent vortices, and\ninfluences other relevant system properties such as the actuated velocity,\nrotational diffusion, or the cutoff of the energy spectra. Comparison of\nsimulation and experimental results show a good agreement which demonstrates\nthe predictive capabilities of the approach, which can be applied to a wider\nclass of quasi-two-dimensional systems with friction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MdK6t4Bte93lg0feRNN-Jg_KMwSiX3NvxScmVzJccFE","pdfSize":"3976272"}
