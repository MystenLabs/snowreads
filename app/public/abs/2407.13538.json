However,\ndue to data collection costs and privacy concerns, such data is often\nunavailable or insufficient for downstream tasks. Data synthesis is a potential\nsolution for this data scarcity. With the recent development of generative AI,\nwe propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time\nseries data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion\nprobabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to\nhigh-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration\ntechnique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff\nachieves significant improvement in capturing temporal dependencies and\nmarginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute\nresolution. Additionally, EnergyDiff consistently generates high-quality time\nseries data across diverse energy domains, time resolutions, and at both\ncustomer and transformer levels with reduced computational need.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
