In\ngeneral, the LRT only determines the solenoidal part of a symmetric tensor\nfield, but elastic strain fields additionally satisfy mechanical equilibrium,\nan extra condition that allows for full reconstruction in many cases. Our\nmethod provides full reconstruction for general elastic strain fields in\nconnected objects whose boundary only contains one component, while previous\nresults included other requirements such as no residual stress, or zero\nboundary traction. This allows for full reconstruction in energy resolved\nneutron transmission imaging for simple objects. Along the way, we prove that\nthe LRT of a potential rank-2 tensor restricted to a bounded set determines the\npotential on the boundary of the set up to infinitesimal rigid motions on each\ncomponent of the boundary. The method is demonstrated with numerical examples\nin two dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V44nq30CDH9wc48f8B16IQnkzMpEtMYN4MvWCvrX6qY","pdfSize":"18871313"}
