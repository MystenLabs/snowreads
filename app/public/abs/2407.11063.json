But what exactly is this mathematical tool, and how\ndoes it function? In this article, we will explore the fundamentals of\ntransforms, their properties, and their applications. Let's dive into one of\nthe key concepts of modern signal processing. Additionally, we will discuss\nZ-transforms and integrated Z-transforms, highlighting their roles in signal\nprocessing. Moreover, to demonstrate the practical application of transforms,\nwe will introduce a novel concept involving fuzzy random variables.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
