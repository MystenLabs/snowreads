The motion-force controller performs\ntrajectory tracking, maneuvering the manipulator's end-effector through desired\nposition, orientations and rates. When contacting an obstacle or target object,\nthe force module of the controller restricts the manipulator movements with a\nnovel force exertion method, which prevents damage to the manipulator, the\nend-effector, and the objects during the contact or collision. The core\nstrategy presented in this paper is to design the linear acceleration for the\nend-effector which ensures both trajectory tracking and restriction of any\ncontact force at the end-effector. The design of the controller is validated\nthrough numerical simulations and digital twin validation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RyhLvMqU6jrbHHu5jisKD6Egvn4n40cmfyWVPoyzRR0","pdfSize":"3300502"}
