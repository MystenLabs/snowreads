In\nthe recent years, different variants of DDoS attacks have been on the rise in\nIoT devices. Failure to detect DDoS attacks at the right time can result in\nfinancial and reputational loss for victim organizations. These attacks\nconducted with IoT devices can cause a significant downtime of applications\nrunning on the Internet. Although researchers have developed and utilized\nspecialized models using artificial intelligence techniques, these models do\nnot provide the best accuracy as there is always a scope of improvement until\n100% accuracy is attained. We propose a hybrid feature selection algorithm that\nselects only the most useful features and passes those features into an XGBoost\nmodel, the results of which are explained using feature importances. Our model\nattains an accuracy of 99.993% on the CIC IDS 2017 dataset and a recall of\n97.64 % on the CIC IoT 2023 dataset. Overall, this research would help\nresearchers and implementers in the field of detecting IoT DDoS attacks by\nproviding a more accurate and comparable model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hEAdNc2W_IhsjbgBOZPE7Vmo2esJ125GxUTyHVheEZ0","pdfSize":"686378"}
