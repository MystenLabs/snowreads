By solving the energetic particle transport\nequation in large-scale MHD simulations, we study the compression acceleration\nof protons and heavier ions in the reconnecting HCS. We find that the\nacceleration of multi-species ions results in nonthermal power-law\ndistributions with spectral index consistent with the PSP observations. Our\nstudy shows that the high-energy cutoff of protons can reach $E_{max} \\sim 0.1$\n- $1$ MeV depending on the particle diffusion coefficients. We also study how\nthe high-energy cutoff of different ion species scales with the charge-to-mass\nratio $E_{max} \\propto (Q/M)^\\alpha$. When determining the diffusion\ncoefficients from the quasilinear theory with a Kolmogorov magnetic power\nspectrum, we find that $\\alpha \\sim 0.4$, which is somewhat smaller than\n$\\alpha \\sim 0.7$ observed by PSP.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
