However, few research focused on untethered robotic\nfish experiments. Imitating the behaviour of real tuna, we developed a\nfree-swimming bionic tuna with a foldable dorsal fin. The erection of dorsal\nfin, at proper conditions, can reduce head heave by 50%, enhance linear\nacceleration by 15.7%, increase turning angular velocity by 32.78%, and turning\nradius decreasing by 33.13%. Conversely, erecting the dorsal fin increases the\nwetted surface area, resulting in decreased maximum speed and efficiency during\nsteady swimming phase. This finding partially explains why tuna erect their\nmedian fins during maneuvers or acceleration and fold them afterward to reduce\ndrag. In addition, we verified that folding the median fins after acceleration\ndoes not significantly affect locomotion efficiency. This study supports the\napplication of morphing median fins in undulating underwater robots and helps\nto further understand the impact of median fins on fish locomotion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
