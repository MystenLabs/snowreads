Analogous suppression of fluctuations in\nthe space-time domains to retain a consistent output should also exist for\nSTML. However, experimental evidence of such a resistance remains elusive, to\nour knowledge. Here, we report experimental observation of such a\nspatiotemporal stabilizer in STML, by embedding a spatial light modulator (SLM)\ninto a multi-mode fibre (MMF) laser. Mode decomposition reveals the mode\ncontent remains steady for an STML state when applying phase perturbations on\nthe SLM. Conversely, the mode content changes significantly for a non-STML\nlasing state. Numerical simulations confirm our observation and show that\nspatial filtering and saturable absorber mainly contribute to the observed\nstability. The capability to resist the spatial phase fluctuations is observed\nto depend on the intracavity pulse energy as well as the modal pulse energy\ncondensed in the low-order modes. Our work constitutes another building block\nfor the concept of STML in multi-mode photonic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GvJYt7Nx2Q_VQyH5eo6RQk4UGW6T5D3wpdNjgeisRLk","pdfSize":"2528785"}
