We show that every Enriques\nsurface has precisely 527 isomorphism classes of elliptic fibrations when\ncounted with the appropriate multiplicity. Their reducible singular fibers and\nthe multiplicities can be calculated explicitly. The same statements hold over\nany algebraically closed field of characteristic not two. To explain these\nresults, we construct a moduli space of complex elliptic Enriques surfaces and\nstudy the ramification behavior of the forgetful map to the moduli space of\nunpolarized Enriques surfaces. Curiously, the ramification indices of a similar\nmap compute the hyperbolic volume of the rational polyhedral fundamental domain\nappearing in the Morrison-Kawamata cone conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
