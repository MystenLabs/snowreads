In this paper, we proposed a novel deringing model for\nvibroseis data using deep convolutional neural network (CNN). In this model we\nuse end-to-end training strategy to obtain the deringed data directly, and skip\nconnections to improve model training process and preserve the details of\nvibroseis data. For real vibroseis deringing task we synthesize training data\nand corresponding labels from real vibroseis data and utilize them to train the\ndeep CNN model. Experiments are conducted both on synthetic data and real\nvibroseis data. The experiment results show that deep CNN model can attenuate\nthe ringing effect effectively and expand the bandwidth of vibroseis data. The\nSTA/LTA ratio method for first-break picking also shows improvement on deringed\nvibroseis data using deep CNN model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vDRPNpOLPu1Uvpn_Z3Q8CARc7wIYBh217lSiLVnV9LU","pdfSize":"5210458","txDigest":"ESGkfRegRfo19K19VJeWSW3meyPsRVUQf9cDrbJ7td4N","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
