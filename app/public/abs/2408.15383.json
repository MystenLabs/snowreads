We gather evidence from the\ntechnology powering the Fediverse (especially the ActivityPub protocol),\ncurrent statistical data regarding Fediverse user distribution over instances,\nand the status of two older, similar, decentralized technologies: e-mail and\nthe Web. Our findings suggest that Fediverse will face significant challenges\nin fulfilling its decentralization promises, potentially hindering its ability\nto positively impact the social Web on a large scale.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
