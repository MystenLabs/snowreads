Specifically, we consider the\nclass of networked susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemics where a\nlarge population of agents strategically choose whether to adopt partially\neffective protection. We define the utilities of the agents which depends on\nthe degree of the agent, its individual infection status and action, as well as\nthe the overall prevalence of the epidemic and strategy profile of the entire\npopulation. We further present the coupled dynamics of epidemic evolution as\nwell as strategy update which is assumed to follow the replicator dynamics. By\nrelying on timescale separation arguments, we first derive the optimal strategy\nof protection adoption by the agents for a given epidemic state, and then\npresent the reduced epidemic dynamics. The existence and uniqueness of endemic\nequilibrium is rigorously characterized and forms the main result of this\npaper. Finally, we present extensive numerical results to highlight the impacts\nof heterogeneous node degrees, infection rates, cost of protection adoption,\nand effectiveness of protection on the epidemic prevalence at the equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fotl6yGl6emtak6mKLbhKsMMTnbx74ukCMRzPzfE8Zk","pdfSize":"741656"}
