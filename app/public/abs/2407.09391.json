Our\nquantum Monte Carlo approach goes beyond the limits of the established\neffective mean-field theories for dipolar quantum gases, revealing small\ndroplets produced by strong dipolar interactions outside known stable regimes.\nThe simulations include realistic molecular interactions and therefore have\ndirect relevance for current and future experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
