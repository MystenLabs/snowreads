This\nstudy introduces a plasmonic Brownian ratchet designed for the directed\ntransport of dielectric nanometer-sized particles at low optical powers.\nThrough numerical simulations, the ratchet geometry was optimized to enhance\nelectric fields, optical forces, and trapping potentials. Experimentally, the\nplasmonic ratchet demonstrated the ability to rectify random thermal motion of\n40 nm polysterene spheres over extended distances in a specific direction,\nachieving velocities up to 2.4 $\\mu$m/s at excitation powers as low as 0.785\nkW/cm^2. This plasmonic ratchet offers a robust and efficient solution for the\ntargeted delivery and concentration of nanoscale analytes on chips, with\nsignificant implications for advancing applications in the life sciences.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"voQwWh4OLNodDkrz2A_eqPiZM53oJSlm10vPn38ivJA","pdfSize":"15225779","txDigest":"AVbWxYbM88sEqMm21vYXjk7nVjG9DovJNyR5fSBFjfVD","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
