The obtained\ncapture cross section is systematically lower than those in the latest versions\nof the major general purpose nuclear data libraries, and the reduction from the\nJENDL-5 library is close to 50% around 20 keV. The newly evaluated cross\nsection was benchmarked against 166 criticality experiments chosen from the\nICSBEP handbook by performing Monte Carlo neutron transport calculation with\nthe JENDL-5 library, and slight reduction of the cumulative chi-square value\nwas achieved by adoption of the newly evaluated capture cross section.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fw4njyrzH1-bFaVFpWCn3RzakqR75_CfP7eEy-QKLr4","pdfSize":"192769"}
