We categorize features into syntactic, semantic,\nand contextual dimensions, including lexicons, structural statistics, Word2Vec,\nWordNet, and phonetic style. Our proposed model, Colbert, utilizes BERT\nembeddings and parallel hidden layers to capture sentence congruity. By\ncombining syntactic, semantic, and contextual features, we train Colbert for\nhumor detection. Feature engineering examines essential syntactic and semantic\nfeatures alongside BERT embeddings. SHAP interpretations and decision trees\nidentify influential features, revealing that a holistic approach improves\nhumor detection accuracy on unseen data. Integrating linguistic cues from\ndifferent dimensions enhances the model's ability to understand humor\ncomplexity beyond traditional computational methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
