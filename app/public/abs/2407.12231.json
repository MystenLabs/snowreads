Furthermore, this decomposition into idempotents of $A$ also holds\nwhen $B$ is an invertible matrix and $R$ is a GE ring (defined by Cohn [New\nmathematical monographs: {\\bf 3}, Cambridge University Press (2006)]). As a\nconsequence, it follows that if there exists an example of a von Neumann\nregular ring $R$ over which the matrix\n  $\n  A=\\begin{pmatrix}\n  B & 0\n  0 & 0\n  \\end{pmatrix} \\in M_{n+r}(R)\n  $\n  where $B\\in M_n(R)$, $r\\ge 1$ , cannot be expressed as a product of\nidempotents, then $R$ is not separative, thus providing an answer to an open\nquestion whether there exists a von Neumann regular ring which is not\nseparative.\n  The paper concludes with an example of an open question whether every totally\nnonnegative matrix is a product of nonnegative idempotent matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
