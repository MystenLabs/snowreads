We show that in a 2-category C satisfying these axioms, the\n\"discrete opfibration (DOF) classifier\" S is always an internal elementary\n1-topos, in an appropriate sense. The axioms introduced for this purpose are\nclosure conditions on the DOFs having \"S-small fibres\". Among these closure\nconditions, the most interesting one asserts that a certain DOF, analogous to\nthe \"subset fibration\" over Set, has small fibres.\n  The remaining new axioms concern \"groupoidal\" objects in a 2-category, which\nare seen to play a significant role in the general theory. We prove two results\nto the effect that a 2-category C satisfying these axioms is \"determined by\"\nits groupoidal objects: the first shows that C is equivalent to a 2-category of\ninternal categories built out of groupoidal objects, and the second shows that\nthe groupoidal objects are dense in C.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
