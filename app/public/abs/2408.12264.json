In the previous study, this property has been\nverified under the assumption that $\\mathfrak{g}$ is either\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_\\ell$, $\\mathfrak{so}_{2\\ell -1}$, or $\\mathfrak{sp}_{2\\ell}$\nfor any sufficiently small positive integer $\\ell$. The purpose of the present\npaper is to prove the generic \\'{e}taleness for one of the remaining cases,\ni.e., $\\mathfrak{g} = \\mathfrak{so}_{2\\ell}$. As an application of this result,\nwe obtain a factorization formula for computing the generic degree induced from\npull-back along various clutching morphisms between moduli spaces of pointed\nstable curves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"qQkiJpQ9V3NS9eoS5IXFoudtWaURnwJ4fA5Q1B7hACw","pdfSize":"352005"}
