Most prior research has focused on\nvarious technical features and traditional representations of text to\ncharacterize phishing emails. There is a significant knowledge gap about the\nqualitative traits embedded in them, which could be useful in a range of\nphishing mitigation tasks. In this paper, we dissect the structure of phishing\nemails to gain a better understanding of the factors that influence human\ndecision-making when assessing suspicious emails and identify a novel set of\ndescriptive features. For this, we employ an iterative qualitative coding\napproach to identify features that are descriptive of the emails. We developed\nthe ``Phishing Codebook'', a structured framework to systematically extract key\ninformation from phishing emails, and we apply this codebook to a publicly\navailable dataset of 503 phishing emails collected between 2015 and 2021. We\npresent key observations and challenges related to phishing attacks delivered\nindirectly through legitimate services, the challenge of recurring and\nlong-lasting scams, and the variations within campaigns used by attackers to\nbypass rule-based filters. Furthermore, we provide two use cases to show how\nthe Phishing Codebook is useful in identifying similar phishing emails and in\ncreating well-tailored responses to end-users. We share the Phishing Codebook\nand the annotated benchmark dataset to help researchers have a better\nunderstanding of phishing emails.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bOcJWjh13EJF_DNZ_OEZFMlB4-RwUbXCnkAipPmz84I","pdfSize":"1109080"}
