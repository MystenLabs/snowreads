At the critical point of the Anderson transition, wave functions\nexhibit multifractal behavior, and energy levels display a universal\ndistribution, indicating non-trivial correlations in the eigenstates. Recent\nstudies have shown that proteins, traditionally considered as insulators,\nexhibit much higher conductivity than previously assumed. In this paper, we\ninvestigate several proteins known for their efficient electron transport\nproperties. We compare their energy level statistics, eigenfunction\ncorrelation, and electron return probability to those expected in metallic,\ninsulating, or critical states. Remarkably, these proteins exhibit properties\nof critically disordered metals in their natural state without any parameter\nadjustment. Their composition and geometry are self-organized into the critical\nstate of the Anderson transition, and their fractal properties are universal\nand unique among critical systems. Our findings suggest that proteins' wave\nfunctions fulfill \"holographic\" area laws, and the correlation fractal\ndimension is precisely $d_2=2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
