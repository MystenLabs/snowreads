The\nvan Hove singularities (VHSs) are special points in the band dispersion where\nthe density of states (DOS) diverge. Considering a lattice chain with hopping\nof a finite range $n$, we find a direct fundamental connection between VHSs and\nexceptional points (EPs) of TM, both of arbitrary order. In particular, we show\nthat VHSs are EPs of TM of the same order, thereby connecting two different\ntypes of critical points usually studied in widely different branches of\nphysics. Consequently, several properties of band dispersion and VHSs can be\nanalyzed in terms of spectral properties of TM. We further provide a general\nprescription to generate any order EP of the TM and therefore corresponding\nVHS. For a given range of hopping $n$, our analysis provides restrictions on\nallowed orders of EPs of TM. Finally, we exemplify all our results for the case\n$n=3$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SEXYYsdekVqUO0qPsE_iuSqvAw1PZMiKoxzpTQdrXSM","pdfSize":"993402"}
