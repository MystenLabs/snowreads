In the recent past, however, it has become apparent that they face\nchallenges stemming from datasets that span more spatial dimensions. In fact,\nthe best-performing clustering algorithms scale linearly in the number of\npoints, but quadratically with respect to the local density of points. In this\nwork, we introduce qLUE, a quantum clustering algorithm that scales linearly in\nboth the number of points and their density. qLUE is inspired by CLUE, an\nalgorithm developed to address the challenging time and memory budgets of Event\nReconstruction (ER) in future High-Energy Physics experiments. As such, qLUE\nmarries decades of development with the quadratic speedup provided by quantum\ncomputers. We numerically test qLUE in several scenarios, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and proving it to be a promising route to handle complex data\nanalysis tasks -- especially in high-dimensional datasets with high densities\nof points.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
