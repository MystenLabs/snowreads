However, for ordinary people, the\nextremely short preparation time, a few hours of notice from friends or social\nmedia, and the lack of observation equipment often hinder safe and effective\neclipse viewing. Some individuals directly observe the sun with their naked\neyes, risking vision damage. To enable ordinary people to safely observe\neclipses in very little preparation and reduce the risk of vision damage, we\npresent a simple and safe method that almost anyone can use under very basic\nconditions, known as the \"Okay\" observation method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
