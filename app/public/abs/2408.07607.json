The ambiguity surrounding\nwhat constitutes data management and its associated activities complicates\nefforts to explain its importance and ensure data are collected, stored and\nused in a way that maximizes value and avoids failures. This paper aims to\naddress these shortcomings by presenting a simple framework for understanding\ndata management, referred to as MAGIC. MAGIC encompasses five key activities:\nModeling, Acquisition, Governance, Infrastructuring, and Consumption support\ntasks. By delineating these components, the MAGIC framework provides a clear,\naccessible approach to data management that can be used for teaching, research\nand practice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
