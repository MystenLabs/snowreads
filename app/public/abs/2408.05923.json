Specifically, the green channel usually has twice the\nsampling rate in raw data. To handle noise variances and leverage such\nchannel-wise prior information, we propose a simple and effective green channel\nprior-based image denoising (GCP-ID) method, which integrates GCP into the\nclassic patch-based denoising framework. Briefly, we exploit the green channel\nto guide the search for similar patches, which aims to improve the patch\ngrouping quality and encourage sparsity in the transform domain. The grouped\nimage patches are then reformulated into RGGB arrays to explicitly characterize\nthe density of green samples. Furthermore, to enhance the adaptivity of GCP-ID\nto various image contents, we cast the noise estimation problem into a\nclassification task and train an effective estimator based on convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs). Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the\ncompetitive performance of the proposed GCP-ID method for image and video\ndenoising applications in both raw and sRGB spaces.
