We provide a comprehensive theoretical framework\nto address the analysis and the derivation of a system of first-order\noptimality conditions that characterizes the solution of the control problem.\nWe take advantage of an adequate treatment of the Dirichlet control through the\nstudy of the reduced functional. Despite the fact that this approach is quite\ncommon, a detailed analysis for the case of mixed boundary conditions with is\nstill lacking. Finally, solution-finding algorithms of descent type are\nproposed and illustrated with several simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
