Yes! We introduce a mechanism of baryogenesis\n(and dark matter production) that can generate the entire observed baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe using $\\textit{only}$ the CP violation within\nStandard Model systems -- a f\\^ete which no other mechanism currently proposed\ncan achieve. Baryogenesis proceeds through a Mesogenesis scenario but with well\nmotivated additional dark sector dynamics: a $\\textit{morphon}$ field generates\npresent day mass contributions for the particle mediating the decay responsible\nfor baryogenesis. The effect is an enhancement of baryon production whilst\nevading present day collider constraints. The CP violation comes entirely from\nStandard Model contributions to neutral meson systems. Meanwhile, the dark\ndynamics generate gravitational waves that may be searched for with current and\nupcoming Pulsar Timing Arrays, as we demonstrate with an example. This\nmechanism, $\\textit{Mesogenesis with a Morphing Mediator}$, motivates probing a\nnew parameter space as well as improving the sensitivity of existing\nMesogenesis searches at hadron and electron colliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
