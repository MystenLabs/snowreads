The search is\nconducted in the region of phase space where at least one of the pairs is\nhighly Lorentz-boosted and is reconstructed as a single large-area jet. The\nother pair may be either similarly merged or resolved, the latter reconstructed\nusing two b-tagged jets. The data are found to be consistent with standard\nmodel processes and are interpreted as 95% confidence level upper limits on the\nproduct of the cross sections and the branching fractions of the spin-0 radion\nand the spin-2 bulk graviton that arise in warped extradimensional models. The\nlimits set are in the range 9.74-0.29 fb and 4.94-0.19 fb for a narrow radion\nand a graviton, respectively, with masses between 1 and 3 TeV. For a radion and\nfor a bulk graviton with widths 10% of their masses, the limits are in the\nrange 12.5-0.35 fb and 8.23-0.23 fb, respectively, for the same masses. These\nlimits result in the exclusion of a narrow-width graviton with a mass below 1.2\nTeV, and of narrow and 10%-width radions with masses below 2.6, and 2.9 TeV,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
