AutoMarks's novel automated watermark\nsearch is accomplished by (i) constructing novel graph and node features with\nphysical, semantic, and design constraint-aware representation; (ii) designing\na data-efficient sampling strategy for watermarking fidelity label collection;\nand (iii) leveraging a graph neural network to learn the connectivity between\ncells and predict the watermarking fidelity on unseen layouts. Extensive\nevaluations on ISPD'15 and ISPD'19 benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed\nautomated methodology: (i) is capable of finding quality-preserving watermarks\nin a short time; and (ii) is transferable across various designs, i.e.,\nAutoMarks trained on one layout is generalizable to other benchmark circuits.\nAutoMarks is also resilient against potential watermark removal and forging\nattacks\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zqd0lAob-JJjE-JVjoGraa5sPl-ecFxLh69TDz9rfLo","pdfSize":"2756488"}
