The mirror's vibration induces\nan opto-mechanical sideband in the control field, affecting the behavior of the\ncold gas and subsequently influencing the output radiation of the engine. The\nmodel incorporates mirror vibration while omitting cavity confinement,\nestablishing a bridge between a multi-level atom-laser interacting system that\nplays with coherences and the mechanical vibration of the nanomechanical\nmirror, which jointly function as heat engines. Three distinct heat engine\nconfigurations are proposed: the first involves a vibration-free three-level\n$\\Lambda$-type system, the second introduces nanomechanical vibration to the\nthree-level $\\Lambda$-type system, and the third constitutes a composite engine\nthat combines the previous setups along with nanomechanical vibration. The\nspectral brightness of a three-level heat engine is diminished with mirror\nvibration, whereas for a composite heat engine, there is a slight enhancement\nin the brightness peak. However, the maximum brightness is attained when there\nis no vibration. Comparisons between the proposed model and an ideal system are\nmade regarding entropy balance, adhering to the constraints of the second law\nof thermodynamics. The model observed that when subjected to mirror vibration,\nthe proposed heat engines diverged from the characteristics expected in an\nideal heat engine.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
