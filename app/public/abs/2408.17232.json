We define a bridge to be a chord\njoining a vertex interior to a bubble to one exterior to it. Building on\nearlier work, we investigate the distribution of bridges in the limit of large\nbubbles and diagrams, and show that the number of bridges is asymptotically\nnormal, obtaining expressions for the associated mean and variance as a\nfunction of bubble size. We introduce the notion of a crystallized diagram,\ndefined by the criteria that all its chords are either short or are bridges. We\ncount the number of crystallized diagrams by the number of short chords they\ncontain, and provide the asymptotic distribution in the limit of large\ncrystallized diagrams. We show that for very large diagrams, the number of\nshort chords is normal, and sharply peaked at $\\sqrt{2n/\\log\n  n}$, where $n$ is the total number of chords in the diagram.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
