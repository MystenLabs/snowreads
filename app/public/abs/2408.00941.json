Recent advancements in\nhigh-fidelity sensor technologies have improved the ability to capture detailed\ntraffic dynamics, yet such systems remain scarce and costly. In contrast,\nconventional traffic sensors are widely deployed but suffer from relatively\ncoarse-grain data resolution, potentially impeding accurate analysis of\nstop-and-go waves. This article explores whether generative AI models can\nenhance the resolution of conventional traffic sensor to approximate the\nquality of high-fidelity observations. We present a novel approach using a\nconditional diffusion denoising model, designed to reconstruct fine-grained\ntraffic speed field from radar-based conventional sensors via iterative\nrefinement. We introduce a new dataset, I24-WaveX, comprising 132 hours of data\nfrom both low and high-fidelity sensor systems, totaling over 2 million vehicle\nmiles traveled. Our approach leverages this dataset to formulate the traffic\nmeasurement enhancement problem as a spatio-temporal super-resolution task. We\ndemonstrate that our model can effectively reproduce the patterns of\nstop-and-go waves, achieving high accuracy in capturing these critical traffic\ndynamics. Our results show promising advancements in traffic data enhancement,\noffering a cost-effective way to leverage existing low spatio-temporal\nresolution sensor networks for improved traffic analysis and management. We\nalso open-sourced our trained model and code to facilitate further research and\napplications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
