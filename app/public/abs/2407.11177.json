A Statistical Query (SQ)\nalgorithm for trace reconstruction is an algorithm which can only access\nstatistical information about the distribution of random traces of $x$ rather\nthan individual traces themselves. Such an algorithm is said to be $\\ell$-local\nif each of its statistical queries corresponds to an $\\ell$-junta function over\nsome block of $\\ell$ consecutive bits in the trace. Since several -- but not\nall -- known algorithms for trace reconstruction fall under the local\nstatistical query paradigm, it is interesting to understand the abilities and\nlimitations of local SQ algorithms for trace reconstruction.\n  In this paper we establish nearly-matching upper and lower bounds on local\nStatistical Query algorithms for both worst-case and average-case trace\nreconstruction. For the worst-case problem, we show that there is an\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{1/5})$-local SQ algorithm that makes all its queries with\ntolerance $\\tau \\geq 2^{-\\tilde{O}(n^{1/5})}$, and also that any\n$\\tilde{O}(n^{1/5})$-local SQ algorithm must make some query with tolerance\n$\\tau \\leq 2^{-\\tilde{\\Omega}(n^{1/5})}$. For the average-case problem, we show\nthat there is an $O(\\log n)$-local SQ algorithm that makes all its queries with\ntolerance $\\tau \\geq 1/\\mathrm{poly}(n)$, and also that any $O(\\log n)$-local\nSQ algorithm must make some query with tolerance $\\tau \\leq\n1/\\mathrm{poly}(n).$\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"haTcTpTp_8T0Zux2Bt0_AsOAZgmDJ8KTsrRdhia8nf0","pdfSize":"380767"}
