Recent models describe how\nmesoscopic Larmor frequency shifts depend on induced magnetic fields by axons,\ndescribed by an orientation distribution function. Using Monte-Carlo\nsimulations of MRI signals in mesoscopic white matter axon substrates, we show\nMRI can estimate this mesoscopic frequency shift and dMRI can estimate its\norientation dependence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
