It draws inspiration from QA, which\nutilizes adiabatic time evolution to determine the global minimum of a given\nobjective function. In the original LQA, the classical Hamiltonian is minimized\nvia gradient descent. The performance of LQA depends on the choice of the\nparameters. Owing to the non-convex nature of the original cost function, LQA\noften becomes trapped in local minima, limiting its effectiveness. To address\nthis challenge, we combine LQA with a deep unfolding scheme, which enables us\nto tune the parameters from the training data via back-propagation. Our\nfindings demonstrate that deep unfolded LQA outperforms the original LQA,\nexhibiting remarkable convergence speed and performance improvement. As the\ntrained parameters can be generalized to unknown instances and different system\nsizes, our results have significant practical implications and provide valuable\ninsights for real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dFLuF17N5O7TWVcerrVt0ykFUPNNRVoTWI62PxN9W4A","pdfSize":"604107"}
