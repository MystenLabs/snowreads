The\nchromatic polynomial of a graph is an important notion in algebraic\ncombinatorics that was introduced by Birkhoff in 1912; denoted $P(G,m)$, it\nequals the number of proper $m$-colorings of graph $G$. Counting function\nanalogues of chromatic polynomials have been introduced for list colorings:\n$P_{\\ell}$, list color functions (1990); DP colorings: $P_{DP}$, DP color\nfunctions (2019), and $P^*_{DP}$, dual DP color functions (2021). For any graph\n$G$ and $m \\in \\mathbb{N}$, $P_{DP}(G, m) \\leq P_\\ell(G,m) \\leq P(G,m) \\leq\nP_{DP}^*(G,m)$. In 2022 (improving on older results) Dong and Zhang showed that\nfor any graph $G$, $P_{\\ell}(G,m)=P(G,m)$ whenever $m \\geq |E(G)|-1$.\nConsequently, the list color function of a graph is a polynomial for\nsufficiently large $m$. One of the most important and longstanding open\nquestions on DP color functions asks: for every graph $G$ is there an $N \\in\n\\mathbb{N}$ and a polynomial $p(m)$ such that $P_{DP}(G,m) = p(m)$ whenever $m\n\\geq N$? We show that the answer to the analogue of this question for dual DP\ncolor functions is no. Our proof reveals a connection between a dual DP color\nfunction and the balanced chromatic polynomial of a signed graph introduced by\nZaslavsky in 1982.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
