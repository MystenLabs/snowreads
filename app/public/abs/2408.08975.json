These problems arise naturally when considering an algebra of\nnon-commutative operators that is deeply rooted in quantum physics as well as\nin Gabor analysis. Quantum packing and quantum covering show similarities with\nenergy minimization and the dual problem of polarization. Quantum paving, in\nturn, aims to simultaneously optimize both quantum packing and quantum\ncovering. Classical sphere packing and covering hint the optimal configurations\nfor our new problems. We present solutions in certain cases, state several\nconjectures related to quantum paving and discuss some applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
