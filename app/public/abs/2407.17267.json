However, existing MIL methods predominantly focus on\nsingle-task learning, resulting in not only overall low efficiency but also the\noverlook of inter-task relatedness. To address these issues, we proposed an\nadapted architecture of Multi-gate Mixture-of-experts with Multi-proxy for\nMultiple instance learning (M4), and applied this framework for simultaneous\nprediction of multiple genetic mutations from WSIs. The proposed M4 model has\ntwo main innovations: (1) utilizing a mixture of experts with multiple gating\nstrategies for multi-genetic mutation prediction on a single pathological\nslide; (2) constructing multi-proxy expert network and gate network for\ncomprehensive and effective modeling of pathological image information. Our\nmodel achieved significant improvements across five tested TCGA datasets in\ncomparison to current state-of-the-art single-task methods.
