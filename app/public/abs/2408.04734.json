A leading scientific user facility, LCLS is the world's first hard\nx-ray free electron laser, operated by the SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory\nfor the U.S. Department of Energy. As the world's first x-ray free electron\nlaser, LCLS is in high demand and heavily oversubscribed. Our overall project\nemploys cognitive engineering methodologies to improve experimental efficiency\nand scientific productivity by refining experimental interfaces and workflows,\nsimplifying tasks, reducing errors, and improving operator safety and stress\nlevels. Our model simulates aspects of human cognition at multiple cognitive\nand temporal scales, ranging from seconds to hours, and among agents playing\nmultiple roles, including instrument operator, real time data analyst, and\nexperiment manager. The model can predict impacts stemming from proposed\nchanges to operational interfaces and workflows. Because the model code is open\nsource, and supplemental videos go into detail on all aspects of the model and\nresults, this approach could be applied to other experimental apparatus and\nprocesses. Example results demonstrate the model's potential in guiding\nmodifications to improve operational efficiency and scientific output. We\ndiscuss the implications of our findings for cognitive engineering in complex\nexperimental settings and outline future directions for research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
