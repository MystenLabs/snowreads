However, the presence of multiple competing deep learning\narchitectures, each with its own unique advantages and disadvantages, makes it\nchallenging to select an architecture best suited for a specific application.\nAs such, we present a comprehensive comparison of common models. Here, we focus\non the task of segmentation assuming the typically small training dataset sizes\navailable from biophysics experiments and compare the following four commonly\nused architectures: convolutional neural networks, U-Nets, vision transformers,\nand vision state space models. In doing so, we establish criteria for\ndetermining optimal conditions under which each model excels, thereby offering\npractical guidelines for researchers and practitioners in the field.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
