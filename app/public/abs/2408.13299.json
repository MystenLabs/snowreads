Effective molecular features are crucial for accurate\nmachine learning predictions, and advanced mathematics plays a key role in\ndesigning these features. Persistent homology theory, which equips topological\ninvariants with persistence, provides valuable insights into molecular\nstructures. The calculation of Betti numbers is based on differential that\ntypically satisfy \\(d^2 = 0\\). Our recent work has extended this concept by\nemploying Mayer homology with a generalized differential that satisfies \\(d^N =\n0\\) for \\(N \\geq 2\\), leading to the development of persistent Mayer homology\n(PMH) theory and richer topological information across various scales. In this\nstudy, we utilize PMH to create a novel multiscale topological vectorization\nfor molecular representation, offering valuable tools for descriptive and\npredictive analysis in molecular data and machine learning prediction.\nSpecifically, benchmark tests on established protein-ligand datasets, including\nPDBbind-2007, PDBbind-2013, and PDBbind-2016, demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our Mayer homology models in predicting protein-ligand binding\naffinities.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
