However, the Retinex-based decomposition techniques in\nsuch models introduce corruptions which limit their enhancement performance. In\nthis paper, we propose a Latent Disentangle-based Enhancement Network (LDE-Net)\nfor low light vision tasks. The latent disentanglement module disentangles the\ninput image in latent space such that no corruption remains in the disentangled\nContent and Illumination components. For LLIE task, we design a Content-Aware\nEmbedding (CAE) module that utilizes Content features to direct the enhancement\nof the Illumination component. For downstream tasks (e.g. nighttime UAV\ntracking and low-light object detection), we develop an effective light-weight\nenhancer based on the latent disentanglement framework. Comprehensive\nquantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate that our LDE-Net\nsignificantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on various LLIE benchmarks.\nIn addition, the great results obtained by applying our framework on the\ndownstream tasks also demonstrate the usefulness of our latent disentanglement\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
