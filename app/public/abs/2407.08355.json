The dynamically assisted Sauter-Schwinger effect on the pair\nproduction is found by using the computational quantum field theory. The\nenhanced pair production is found to be significant at about one order\nincreasing for multiple potentials rather than single potential. In case of\ndominated by Schwinger mechanism, the obvious time effect leads to electrons\nconcentrating at the two edges of the potential, meanwhile, the momentum\nlocates at the zero nearby. In contrary, however, for the multiphoton\nprocesses, the pair generation makes the electrons distributing outside the\npotential and the momentum appearing multiple peaks far away from zero and\nevenly evolving toward a step-like structure. An interesting finding is that\nthe particles of pair produced in the alternating potential has a\nquasi-monoenergetic structure compared to the oscillating potential well or/and\npotential barrier, which is helpful to achieve the high quality positron\nsource.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
