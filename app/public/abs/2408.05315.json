We design and develop a low-cost mobile robot that\nperiodically searches the house for the person being monitored and sends an\nemail to a set of designated responders if a fall is detected. In this project,\nwe make three novel design decisions and contributions. First, our\ncustom-designed low-cost robot has advanced features like omnidirectional\nwheels, the ability to run deep learning models, and autonomous wireless\ncharging. Second, we improve the accuracy of fall detection for the\nYOLOv8-Pose-nano object detection network by 6% and YOLOv8-Pose-large by 12%.\nWe do so by transforming the images captured from the robot viewpoint (camera\nheight 0.15m from the ground) to a typical human viewpoint (1.5m above the\nground) using a principally computed Homography matrix. This improves network\naccuracy because the training dataset MS-COCO on which YOLOv8-Pose is trained\nis captured from a human-height viewpoint. Lastly, we improve the robot\ncontroller by learning a model that predicts the robot velocity from the input\nsignal to the motor controller.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
