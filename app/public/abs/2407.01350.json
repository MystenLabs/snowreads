The method successfully terminates in O(N log(N))\noperations for Fourier measurements with cardinality N. The algorithm is\nguaranteed to succeed for a large class of objects, which we term \"Schwarz\nobjects\". We further present an easy-to-calculate and well-conditioned diagonal\noperator that transforms any feasible phase-retrieval instance into one that is\nsolved by our method. We derive our method by combining techniques from\nclassical complex analysis, algebraic topology, and modern numerical analysis.\nConcretely, we pose the phase retrieval problem as a multiplicative Cousin\nproblem, construct an approximate solution using a modified integral used for\nthe Schwarz problem, and refine the approximate solution to an exact solution\nvia standard optimization methods. We present numerical experimentation\ndemonstrating our algorithm's performance and its superiority to existing\nmethod. Finally, we demonstrate that our method is robust against Gaussian\nnoise.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"DdwyWphScGazxopVNqqmUV2HVW8q_j8wm7qv9ttjgxk","pdfSize":"957050","objectId":"0x42eb29dd60b9bbbd8fefca8014fda25837e486f1a14941a3eacdb8cdd9f3256e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
