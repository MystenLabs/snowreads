However such measurements are limited at higher\nredshifts (z>1). Recently, we proposed an analogous diagram of the\noxygen-to-argon abundance ratio, log(O/Ar), vs Ar abundance, 12+log(Ar/H), as a\nnew diagnostic window for emission nebulae. In this Letter, using robust line\nflux measurements including temperature sensitive auroral lines, we present\ndirect determination of O and Ar abundances in nine SFGs from JWST/NIRSPEC\nspectra at z$\\sim$1.3-7.7, and two more with Keck/MOSFIRE spectra at\nz$\\sim$2.2. Utilising their positions on the log(O/Ar) vs 12+log(Ar/H) plane,\nwe present the first inference of galaxy chemical enrichment mechanisms from an\nensemble of galaxies. The SFGs at z$\\sim$1.3-3.4 are consistent with the solar\nneighbourhood galactic chemical enrichment models of the Milky Way Galaxy that\nare driven by core-collapse and Type Ia supernovae. Such enrichment mechanisms\nthus occur at least out to z$\\sim$3.4. However, the highest-redshift SFGs\n(z$\\sim$3.6-7.7) have very low log(O/Ar) values, revealing a different\nenrichment process at z>3.6. Such low log(O/Ar) values may be caused by a rapid\nbut intermittent star-formation and/or additional sources. The new diagnostic\nwindow for SFGs enables us to reveal the unique fingerprints of galaxy chemical\nenrichment out to cosmic dawn.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
