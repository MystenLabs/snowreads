Exploiting gauge freedom\ninvolving only time reparametrizations, we write down classical background\nsolutions analytically, for an arbitrary number of fluid components. We then\nshow that the time evolution of scalar and tensor adiabatic perturbations are\ngoverned by Schr\\\"odinger-like differential equations of generalized Heun type.\nAfter recovering known analytic results for a single-component fluid, we\ndiscuss more general situations with two and three different fluid components,\nwith special attention to the combination of radiation, matter and vacuum\nenergy, which is supposed to describe the $\\Lambda$CDM model. The evolution of\nlinear perturbations of a flat $\\Lambda$CDM universe is described by a\ntwo-transient model, where the transitions from radiation to matter and matter\nto vacuum energy are governed by a Heun equation and a Hypergeometric equation,\nrespectively. We discuss an analytic approach to the study of the general case,\ninvolving generalized Heun equations, that makes use of (quantum)\nSeiberg-Witten curves for ${\\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories and has\nproven to be very effective in the analysis of Black-Hole, fuzzball and ECO\nperturbations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
