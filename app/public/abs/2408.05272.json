Through a quantum capacitance model\napproach, we simulate realistic devices capable of imposing periodic potentials\non graphene. By means of both tight-binding and continuum models, we analyze\nthe electronic structure across varied patterning geometries, including\ntriangular, kagome, and square configurations. We explicitly explore the\ninfluence of device parameters such as the superlattice potential strength,\ngeometry, and periodicity on the electronic properties of graphene. By\nintroducing a long-range Coulomb interaction, we found an emergent periodic\npotential strong enough to open a mass gap, thereby generating a Chern band.\nOur study highlights the robustness and versatility of patterned dielectric\nsuperlattices for band engineering in graphene systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w06MCCqOEhv8kIQ0ickLjgHQOcWyaRh9TjS6pKkYeH4","pdfSize":"35534114"}
