A multi-cathode counter with an iron cathode is\nused in these measurements. In both series we have observed some excess in\ncount rates in sidereal time while no excess has been observed in terrestrial\ntime. In the first series from 27.12.22 to 24.07.23 we have observed the excess\nin the period between 8 a.m. and 12 a.m. of sidereal time with a confidence\nlevel more than 6 \\sigma, in the second series from 21.09.23 to 03.04.24 in the\nperiod between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. of sidereal time with a confidence level more\nthan 4 \\sigma. The fact that in terrestrial time we do not observe a similar\neffect as in sidereal time suggests that probably this effect is of galactic\norigin and that this may be caused by dark photons. Future steps are suggested\nto validate these results.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
