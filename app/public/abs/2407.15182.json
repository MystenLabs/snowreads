However, most existing methods\nface a computational exponential bottleneck. Recently, a thermometry method\nbased on bichromatic driving was theoretically proposed by Ivan Vybornyi et al.\nto overcome this obstacle, which allows the computational complexity to remain\nconstant with the increase of ion numbers. In this paper, we provide a detailed\nstatistical analysis of this method and prove its robustness to several\nimperfect experimental conditions using Floquet theory. We then experimentally\nverify its good performance on a linear segmented surface-electrode ion trap\nplatform for the first time. This method is proven to be effective from near\nthe motional ground state to a few mean phonon numbers. Our theoretical\nanalysis and experimental verification demonstrate that the scheme can\naccurately and efficiently measure the temperature in ion crystals.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NoxuXxUoOjGUKe6ANa8ip6fUeBSxFIE96EvZfoTcgE4","pdfSize":"507844","objectId":"0x71c275dfa82bf903ef8aae9883dd6176524cdd5594a4739cb9faf524163b730a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
