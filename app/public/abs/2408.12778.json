Specifically, we consider\nthe task of training a minimal architecture network to learn the transition\nrules of Game of Life for a given number of steps ahead, which is known to be\nchallenging due to restrictions on the allowed number of trainable parameters.\nAn extensive quantitative analysis showcases the benefits of utilizing a\nstrategically designed training dataset, with its advantages persisting\nregardless of other parameters of the learning configuration, such as network\ninitialization weights or optimization algorithm. Importantly, our findings\nhighlight the integral role of domain expert insights in creating effective\nmachine learning applications for constrained real-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
