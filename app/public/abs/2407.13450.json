When the\nnumber of these polynomials is one more than the dimension of the ambient\nspace, we obtain a formula for computing the sparse resultant as the\ndeterminant of a Koszul type complex.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J04r8AX4UMv8QZm00HsWcTim3_p8iGfAhanKflTaCDc","pdfSize":"331037"}
