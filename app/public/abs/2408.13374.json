However,\nthis requires robust, scalable, industrialized production to meet demand and\nprovide affordable patient access, which has thus far failed to materialize.\nClosing the chasm between demand and supply requires innovation in\nbiomanufacturing to achieve the essential step change in rAAV product yield and\nquality. Omics provides a rich source of mechanistic knowledge that can be\napplied to HEK293, the prevailing cell line for rAAV production. In this\nreview, the findings from a growing number of disparate studies that apply\ngenomics, epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics to HEK293\nbioproduction are explored. Learnings from CHO-Omics, application of omics\napproaches to improve CHO bioproduction, provide context for the potential of\n\"HEK-Omics\" as a multiomics-informed approach providing actionable mechanistic\ninsights for improved transient and stable production of rAAV and other\nrecombinant products in HEK293.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NxRQEuIUwMaiNCY_Nnon4YWoeUoSCtTyb2HMIfr-OX0","pdfSize":"2152659"}
