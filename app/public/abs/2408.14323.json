If this is the case, the\nalgorithm computes such a transformation explicitly. The algorithm can compute\nthat all Gaussian graphical models on five vertices that are not initially\ntoric cannot be made toric by any linear change of coordinates. The same holds\nfor all Gaussian conditional independence ideals of undirected graphs on six\nvertices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
