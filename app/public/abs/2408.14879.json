However, their vulnerability to practical adversarial attacks is a\nsignificant concern. This paper presents a novel adversarial attack using\npractical patches that mimic manhole covers to deceive MDE and SS models. The\ngoal is to cause these systems to misinterpret scenes, leading to false\ndetections of near obstacles or non-passable objects. We use Depth Planar\nMapping to precisely position these patches on road surfaces, enhancing the\nattack's effectiveness. Our experiments show that these adversarial patches\ncause a 43% relative error in MDE and achieve a 96% attack success rate in SS.\nThese patches create affected error regions over twice their size in MDE and\napproximately equal to their size in SS. Our studies also confirm the patch's\neffectiveness in physical simulations, the adaptability of the patches across\ndifferent target models, and the effectiveness of our proposed modules,\nhighlighting their practical implications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
