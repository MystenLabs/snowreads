{"id":"2408.04868","title":"ChatGPT Meets Iris Biometrics","authors":"Parisa Farmanifard and Arun Ross","authorsParsed":[["Farmanifard","Parisa",""],["Ross","Arun",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2024 05:13:07 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-12","timestamp":1723180387000,"abstract":"  This study utilizes the advanced capabilities of the GPT-4 multimodal Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) to explore its potential in iris recognition - a field\nless common and more specialized than face recognition. By focusing on this\nniche yet crucial area, we investigate how well AI tools like ChatGPT can\nunderstand and analyze iris images. Through a series of meticulously designed\nexperiments employing a zero-shot learning approach, the capabilities of\nChatGPT-4 was assessed across various challenging conditions including diverse\ndatasets, presentation attacks, occlusions such as glasses, and other\nreal-world variations. The findings convey ChatGPT-4's remarkable adaptability\nand precision, revealing its proficiency in identifying distinctive iris\nfeatures, while also detecting subtle effects like makeup on iris recognition.\nA comparative analysis with Gemini Advanced - Google's AI model - highlighted\nChatGPT-4's better performance and user experience in complex iris analysis\ntasks. This research not only validates the use of LLMs for specialized\nbiometric applications but also emphasizes the importance of nuanced query\nframing and interaction design in extracting significant insights from\nbiometric data. Our findings suggest a promising path for future research and\nthe development of more adaptable, efficient, robust and interactive biometric\nsecurity solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
