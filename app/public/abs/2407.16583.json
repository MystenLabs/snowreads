A dynamical map is eEB-divisible if any propagator\nbecomes entanglement breaking in finite time. It turns out that any completely\npositive dynamical semigroup with a unique faithful stationary state enjoys\nthis property. Interestingly, it is shown that eEB-divisibility is quite\ngeneral and holds for a pretty large class of quantum evolutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
