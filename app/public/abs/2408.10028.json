The\nproof is based on the concept of \\textit{integrated-by-parts strong solution},\nwhich generalizes the classical notion of strong solution, and on\nfrequency-restricted estimates. Moreover, we extend the known global\nwell-posedness result to regularities $k,s>1/2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
