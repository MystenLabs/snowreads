{"id":"2407.06299","title":"A Theory for Coloring Walks in a Digraph","authors":"Seth Chaiken","authorsParsed":[["Chaiken","Seth",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2024 18:08:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-10","timestamp":1720462091000,"abstract":"  Consider edge colorings of digraphs where edges $v_1 v_2$ and $v_2 v_3$ have\ndifferent colors. This coloring induces a vertex coloring by sets of edge\ncolors, in which edge $v_1 v_2$ in the graph implies that the set color of\n$v_1$ contains an element not in the set color of $v_2$, and conversely. We\ngeneralize to colorings of $k$(vertex)-walks, defined so two walks have\ndifferent colors if one is the prefix $c_1$ and the other is the suffix $c_2$\nof a common $(k+1)$-walk. Further, the colors can belong to a poset $P$ where\n$c_1$, $c_2$ must satisfy $c_1 \\not\\leq c_2$. This set construction generalizes\nthe lower order ideal in $P$ from a set of $k$-walk colors; these order ideals\nare partially ordered by containment. We conclude that a $P$ coloring of\n$k$-walks exists iff there is a vertex coloring by $A$ iterated $k-1$ times on\n$P$, where Birkhoff's $A$ maps a poset to its poset of lower order ideals. Thus\nthe directed chromatic index problem is generalized and reduced to poset\ncoloring of vertices. This work uses ideas, results and motivations due to Cole\nand Vishkin on deterministic coin tossing and Becker and Simon on vertex covers\nfor subsets of $(n-2)$-cubes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
