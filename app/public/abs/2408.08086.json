This paper introduces a method to obtain a globally\nconsistent 3D reconstruction of interacting objects and people from a single\nimage. Our contributions include: 1) an optimization framework, featuring a\ncollision loss, tailored to handle human-object and human-human interactions,\nensuring spatially coherent scene reconstruction; and 2) a novel technique to\nrobustly estimate 6 degrees of freedom (DOF) poses, specifically for heavily\noccluded objects, exploiting image inpainting. Notably, our proposed method\noperates effectively on images from real-world scenarios, without necessitating\nscene or object-level 3D supervision. Extensive qualitative and quantitative\nevaluation against existing methods demonstrates a significant reduction in\ncollisions in the final reconstructions of scenes with multiple interacting\nhumans and objects and a more coherent scene reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
