We begin by recapitulating the work of Nauenberg\nfor an ordered Ising chain, namely the decimation approach. We extend this work\nto certain non-trivial situation namely, the Alternate Ising Chain and\nFibonacci Ising chain. Our approach is pedagogical and accessible to\nundergraduate students who have had a first course in statistical mechanics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
