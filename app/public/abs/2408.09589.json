Later\nwork by S\\'arkozy, Selkow and Szemer\\'edi showed that in fact Dirac graphs have\nmany Hamilton cycles and perfect matchings, culminating in a result of Cuckler\nand Kahn that gives a precise description of the numbers of Hamilton cycles and\nperfect matchings in a Dirac graph G (in terms of an entropy-like parameter of\nG).\n  In this paper we extend Cuckler and Kahn's result to perfect matchings in\nhypergraphs. For positive integers d < k, and for n divisible by k, let\n$m_{d}(k,n)$ be the minimum d-degree that ensures the existence of a perfect\nmatching in an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph. In general, it is an open\nquestion to determine (even asymptotically) the values of $m_{d}(k,n)$, but we\nare nonetheless able to prove an analogue of the Cuckler-Kahn theorem, showing\nthat if an n-vertex k-uniform hypergraph G has minimum d-degree at least\n$(1+\\gamma)m_{d}(k,n)$ (for any constant $\\gamma>0$), then the number of\nperfect matchings in G is controlled by an entropy-like parameter of G. This\nstrengthens cruder estimates arising from work of\nKang-Kelly-K\\\"uhn-Osthus-Pfenninger and Pham-Sah-Sawhney-Simkin.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
