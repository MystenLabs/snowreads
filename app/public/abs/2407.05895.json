Current deterministic and probabilistic methods primarily\nfocus on modeling individual trips, assuming independence among trips. However,\nin real-world scenarios, we often observe strong inter-trip correlations due to\nfactors such as weather conditions, traffic management, and road works. In this\npaper, we propose to model trip-level link travel time using a Gaussian\nhierarchical model, which can characterize both inter-trip and intra-trip\ncorrelations. The joint distribution of travel time of multiple trips becomes a\nmultivariate Gaussian parameterized by learnable link representations. To\neffectively use the sparse GPS trajectories, we also propose a data\naugmentation method based on trip sub-sampling, which allows for fine-grained\ngradient backpropagation in learning link representations. During inference, we\nestimate the probability distribution of the travel time of a queried trip\nconditional on the completed trips that are spatiotemporally adjacent. We refer\nto the overall framework as ProbTTE. We evaluate ProbTTE on two real-world GPS\ntrajectory datasets, and the results demonstrate its superior performance\ncompared to state-of-the-art deterministic and probabilistic baselines.\nAdditionally, we find that the learned link representations align well with the\nphysical geometry of the network, making them suitable as input for other\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
