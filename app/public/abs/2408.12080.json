By integrating and standardizing heterogeneous sensor data\nfrom smartphones, IoT devices, and dedicated systems such as Ultra-Wideband\n(UWB), our study ensures data compatibility and improves positioning accuracy\nusing the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF). The core components include the\nIntelligent Data Standardization Module (IDSM), which employs a fine-tuned LLM\nto convert varied sensor data into a standardized format, and the\nTransformation Rule Generation Module (TRGM), which automates the creation of\ntransformation rules and scripts for ongoing data standardization. Evaluated in\nreal-time environments, our study demonstrates adaptability and scalability,\nenhancing operational efficiency and accuracy in seamless navigation. This\nstudy underscores the potential of advanced LLMs in overcoming sensor data\nintegration complexities, paving the way for more scalable and precise IoT\nnavigation solutions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UcD3tSHuEPofLqf9gVNBfLcluO3d1Gihpij5Ffiplow","pdfSize":"8902241"}
