Gerth's conjecture was proved by\nFouvry and Kluners in 2007. In this paper, we generalize their result by\nobtaining lower bounds for the average value of $|{\\rm Cl}^2_{\\L}/{\\rm\nCl}^4_{\\L}|^m$, where $\\L$ varies over an infinite family of quadratic\nextensions of certain Galois number fields. As a special case of our theorem,\nwe obtain lower bounds for the average value when the base field is any Galois\nnumber field with class number $1$ in which $2\\Z$ splits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
