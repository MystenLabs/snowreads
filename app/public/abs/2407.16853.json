The deformed action is designed to allow a Lax connection for the\nequations of motion, similar to the undeformed model. For this to work, we\nidentify a set of constraints that the deformation operator, which is\nincorporated into the action, must fulfil. After defining the deformation, we\nexplore simple solutions to these constraints and describe the resulting\ndeformed backgrounds. Specifically, we find flat space in Cartesian coordinates\nwith arbitrary constant $H$-flux or linear $H$-flux in a light cone coordinate.\nAdditionally, we find the Nappi-Witten background along with various\nNappi-Witten-like backgrounds with near arbitrary constant $H$-flux. Finally,\nwe discuss the symmetries of the deformed models, finding that the deformed\nsymmetries will always include a set of symmetries that in the undeformed limit\nbecomes the total set of translations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
