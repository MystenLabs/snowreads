This method considers the matching between\neach candidate video and the query, but it incurs a significant time cost and\nwill increase notably with the increase of candidates. Generative models are\ncommon in natural language processing and computer vision, and have been\nsuccessfully applied in document retrieval, but their application in multimodal\nretrieval remains unexplored. To enhance retrieval efficiency, in this paper,\nwe introduce a model-based video indexer named T2VIndexer, which is a\nsequence-to-sequence generative model directly generating video identifiers and\nretrieving candidate videos with constant time complexity. T2VIndexer aims to\nreduce retrieval time while maintaining high accuracy. To achieve this goal, we\npropose video identifier encoding and query-identifier augmentation approaches\nto represent videos as short sequences while preserving their semantic\ninformation. Our method consistently enhances the retrieval efficiency of\ncurrent state-of-the-art models on four standard datasets. It enables baselines\nwith only 30\\%-50\\% of the original retrieval time to achieve better retrieval\nperformance on MSR-VTT (+1.0%), MSVD (+1.8%), ActivityNet (+1.5%), and DiDeMo\n(+0.2%).
