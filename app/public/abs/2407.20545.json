In\nthis work, we propose to use the Human-Object Offset between anchors which are\ndensely sampled from the surface of human mesh and object mesh to represent\nhuman-object spatial relation. Compared with previous works which use contact\nmap or implicit distance filed to encode 3D human-object spatial relations, our\nmethod is a simple and efficient way to encode the highly detailed spatial\ncorrelation between the human and object. Based on this representation, we\npropose Stacked Normalizing Flow (StackFLOW) to infer the posterior\ndistribution of human-object spatial relations from the image. During the\noptimization stage, we finetune the human body pose and object 6D pose by\nmaximizing the likelihood of samples based on this posterior distribution and\nminimizing the 2D-3D corresponding reprojection loss. Extensive experimental\nresults show that our method achieves impressive results on two challenging\nbenchmarks, BEHAVE and InterCap datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
