In top down (i.e., stringy) realizations of this structure, the QFT\nin question is localized in a higher-dimensional bulk. In many cases of\ninterest, however, the associated $(d+1)$-dimensional bulk is not fully gapped\nand one must instead consider a filtration of theories to reach a gapped bulk\nin $D = d+m$ dimensions. Overall, this leads us to a nested structure of\nrelative symmetry theories which descend to coupled edge modes, with the\noriginal QFT degrees of freedom localized at a corner of this $D$-dimensional\nbulk system. We present a bottom up characterization of this structure and also\nshow how it naturally arises in a number of string-based constructions of QFTs\nwith both finite and continuous symmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
