When compared\nagainst a 778 nm reference signal extracted from a frequency-doubled\ncavity-stabilized telecom laser, the short-term stability of the microcell\nfrequency standard is 3.5 $\\times$ 10$^{-13}$ $\\tau^{-1/2}$ until 200~s, in\ngood agreement with a phase noise level of $+$ 43 dBrad$^2$/Hz at 1~Hz offset\nfrequency. The two main contributions to the short-term stability of the\nmicrocell reference are currently the photon shot noise and the intermodulation\neffect induced by the laser frequency noise. With still a relevant margin of\nprogress, these results show the interest of this spectroscopic approach for\nthe demonstration of high-stability miniaturized optical vapor cell clocks.\nSuch clocks are poised to be highly beneficial for applications in navigation,\ncommunications, and metrology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
