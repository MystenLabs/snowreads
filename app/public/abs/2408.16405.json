However, most current sources utilized in Kibble balances\nto date are homemade and not commercially available. In this paper, we\nintroduce a digital-feedback, two-stage current source designed for the\nTsinghua tabletop Kibble balance, relying solely on commercially available\nsources and voltmeters. A high-resolution, small-range current source is\nemployed to digitally compensate for current output fluctuations from a\nlarge-range current source. Experimental tests show the proposal can offer an\neasy realization of a current source with nA/A stability to support Kibble\nbalance measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
