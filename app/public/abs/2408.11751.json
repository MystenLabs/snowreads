In the domain of autonomous multi-robot\nexploration, reinforcement learning agents play a central role, offering\nadaptability to complex terrains and facilitating collaboration among robots.\nHowever, modifying the fleet composition results in changes in the learned\nbehavior, and training multi-robot systems using multi-agent reinforcement\nlearning is expensive. Therefore, an exhaustive evaluation of each potential\nfleet design is infeasible. To tackle these hurdles, we introduce Bayesian\nOptimization for Fleet Design (BOFD), a framework leveraging multi-objective\nBayesian Optimization to explore fleets on the Pareto front of performance and\ncost while accounting for uncertainty in the design space. Moreover, we\nestablish a sub-linear bound for cumulative regret, supporting BOFD's\nrobustness and efficacy. Extensive benchmark experiments in synthetic and\nsimulated environments demonstrate the superiority of our framework over\nstate-of-the-art methods, achieving efficient fleet designs with minimal fleet\nevaluations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
