The augmentation method\nreduces label noise by mixing multiple audio clips and joining their labels,\nwhile being compatible with multiple active labels. We additionally show that\nperformance can be improved by a self-label correction method using the same\npretrained model. Finally, we show that it is feasible to use a strong\nzero-shot model such as CLAP to generate labels for unlabeled data and improve\nthe results using the proposed training and label enhancement methods. The\nresulting model performs similar to CLAP while being an efficient mobile device\nfriendly architecture and can be quickly adapted to unlabeled sound classes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
