In\nthis paper, we define a new version $\\mathrm{sc}_{r}$ of shadow-complexity\ndepending on an extra parameter $r\\geq0$, and we investigate the relationship\nbetween this complexity and the trisection genus $g$. More explicitly, we prove\nan inequality $g(W) \\leq 2+2\\mathrm{sc}_{r}(W)$ for any closed $4$-manifold $W$\nand any $r\\geq1/2$. Moreover, we determine the exact values of\n$\\mathrm{sc}_{1/2}$ for infinitely many $4$-manifolds, and also we classify all\nthe closed $4$-manifolds with $\\mathrm{sc}_{1/2}\\leq1/2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
