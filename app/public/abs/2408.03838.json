The\nkey to our method is to utilize the entirety of information encoded in raw\ntime-of-flight data captured by off-the-shelf distance sensors. We provide an\nanalysis of the problem in which we identify the key ambiguity between geometry\nand surface photometrics. To overcome this challenging ambiguity, we fit a\nGaussian mixture model to a small dataset of planar surface measurements. This\nmodel implicitly captures the expected geometry and distribution of\nphotometrics of the planar surface and is used to identify measurements that\nare likely to contain deviations. We characterize our method on a variety of\nsurfaces and planar deviations across a range of scenarios. We find that our\nmethod utilizing raw time-of-flight data outperforms baselines which use only\nderived distance estimates. We build an example application in which our method\nenables mobile robot obstacle and cliff avoidance over a wide field-of-view.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
