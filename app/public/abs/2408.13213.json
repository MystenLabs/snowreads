We consider the\npolarization dependence of the nuclear wave function of the deuteron, which\nresults in an azimuthal angular dependence of the produced vector meson when\nthe deuteron is transversely polarized. The Fourier coefficients extracted from\nthe azimuthal angular dependence of the vector meson differential cross-section\nexhibit notable differences between longitudinally and transversely polarized\ndeuterons. The angular dependence of the extracted effective deuteron radius\nprovides direct insight into the structure of the polarized deuteron wave\nfunction. Furthermore, we observe slightly increased gluon saturation effects\nwhen the deuteron is longitudinally polarized compared to the transversely\npolarized case. The small-$x$ observables studied in this work will be\naccessible at the future Electron-Ion Collider.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
