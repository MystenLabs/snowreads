In this paper, we study the existence of Laplacian perfect pair state\ntransfer in the Q-graph of an $r$-regular graph for $r\\ge2$. We prove that the\nQ-graph of an $r$-regular graph does not have Laplacian perfect pair state\ntransfer when $r+1$ is prime or a power of $2$. We also give a sufficient\ncondition for Q-graph to have Laplacian pretty good pair state transfer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
