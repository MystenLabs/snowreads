Marginal and mixed-effects models are two common approaches. The\ndistributional assumptions induce specific mean-variance relationships,\nhowever, in many instances, the observed variability is greater than assumed by\nthe model. This characterizes overdispersion, whose identification is crucial\nfor choosing an appropriate modeling framework to make inferences reliable. We\npropose an initial exploration of constructing a longitudinal multinomial\ndispersion index as a descriptive and diagnostic tool. This index is calculated\nas the ratio between the observed and assumed variances. The performance of\nthis index was evaluated through a simulation study, employing statistical\ntechniques to assess its initial performance in different scenarios. We\nidentified that as the index approaches one, it is more likely that this\ncorresponds to a high degree of overdispersion. Conversely, values closer to\nzero indicate a low degree of overdispersion. As a case study, we present an\napplication in animal science, in which the behaviour of pigs (grouped in\nstalls) is evaluated, considering three response categories.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
