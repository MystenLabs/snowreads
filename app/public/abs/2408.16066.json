Two $n \\times n$ matrices $A$ and $B$ form a\nparallel pair with respect to the $k$-numerical radius $w_k$ if $w_k(A + \\mu B)\n= w_k(A) + w_k(B)$ for some scalar $\\mu$ with $|\\mu| = 1$; they form a TEA\n(triangle equality attaining) pair if the preceding equation holds for $\\mu =\n1$. We classify linear bijections on $\\mathbb M_n$ and on $\\mathbb H_n$ which\npreserve parallel pairs or TEA pairs. Such preservers are scalar multiples of\n$w_k$-isometries, except for some exceptional maps on $\\mathbb H_n$ when\n$n=2k$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fy2-h00RsIWdjCLgezuXHnjG-fWd95CNLJrpd-Gr2kw","pdfSize":"228895"}
