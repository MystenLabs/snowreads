Research should prioritize both the efficient design\nof quantum architectures and the development of learning strategies to optimize\nresource usage. We propose a framework called quantum curriculum learning\n(Q-CurL) for quantum data, where the curriculum introduces simpler tasks or\ndata to the learning model before progressing to more challenging ones. We\ndefine the curriculum criteria based on the data density ratio between tasks to\ndetermine the curriculum order. We also implement a dynamic learning schedule\nto emphasize the significance of quantum data in optimizing the loss function.\nEmpirical evidence shows that Q-CurL significantly enhances the training\nconvergence and the generalization for unitary learning tasks and improves the\nrobustness of quantum phase recognition tasks. Our framework provides a general\nlearning strategy, bringing QML closer to realizing practical advantages.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
