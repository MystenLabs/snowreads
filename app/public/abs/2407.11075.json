KAN, with its\nunique architecture and flexible activation functions, excels in handling\ncomplex data patterns and nonlinear relationships, demonstrating wide-ranging\napplication potential. While challenges remain, KAN is poised to pave the way\nfor innovative solutions in various fields, potentially revolutionizing how we\napproach complex computational problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LS6KttNm1uY2qPPJ0qvuKzpOqjRe8JGNqb8Kp37S4q8","pdfSize":"493813"}
