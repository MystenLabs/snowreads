A major obstacle\nis the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated\nlarge deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case\nof linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure\nthat introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show\nthat the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at\narbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs)\nsomewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering\nproblems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the\ncorresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify\nthe generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time\nlimit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant\ngenerating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the\neffective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created\ndynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits\nof the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation\nrelations for the heat and the entropy production.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
