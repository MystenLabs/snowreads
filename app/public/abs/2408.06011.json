When the Bohr radius and the\nscattering length are much larger than the potential range, low-energy physics\nof the system becomes independent from details of the short-range potential. We\ndevelop the zero-range theory to describe such universal physics in terms of\nthe Bohr radius and the scattering length by generalizing the Bethe-Peierls\nboundary condition, which is then applied to two charged particles to reveal\ntheir bound states and resonances. Infinite resonances are found for a\nrepulsive Coulomb potential, one of which turns into a bound state with\nincreasing inverse scattering length, whereas infinite bound states exist for\nan attractive Coulomb potential with no resonances at any scattering length.\nThe zero-range theory is also applied to three equally charged particles at\ninfinite scattering length under the variational Born-Oppenheimer\napproximation. We find that the effective potential between two heavy particles\ninduced by a light particle is an inverse-square attraction at distances\nshorter than the Bohr radius, leading to infinite deep bound states, whereas\nshallow ones successively turn into resonances with increasing Coulomb\nrepulsion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
