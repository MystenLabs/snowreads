Unlike existing studies on hybrid\nNOMA that focus on combining NOMA with time-division multiple access (TDMA),\nthis work considers hybrid NOMA assisted orthogonal frequency-division multiple\naccess (OFDMA). In particular, the impact of a unique feature of hybrid NOMA\nassisted OFDMA, i.e., the availability of users' dynamic channel state\ninformation, on the system performance is analyzed from the following two\nperspectives. From the optimization perspective, analytical results are\ndeveloped which show that with hybrid NOMA assisted OFDMA, the pure OMA mode is\nrarely adopted by the users, and the pure NOMA mode could be optimal for\nminimizing the users' energy consumption, which differs from the hybrid TDMA\ncase. From the statistical perspective, two new performance metrics, namely the\npower outage probability and the power diversity gain, are developed to\nquantitatively measure the performance gain of hybrid NOMA over OMA. The\ndeveloped analytical results also demonstrate the ability of hybrid NOMA to\nmeet the users' diverse energy profiles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
