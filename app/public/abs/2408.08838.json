The XREC method is the only one that allows studying EAS trunks with a\nhigh coordinate resolution of about 100 microns. EAS trunks contain the most\ncomplete information about primary acts of nuclear interactions, as a result of\nwhich all unusual events recorded by the XREC method are of great scientific\ninterest. Several types of unusual events recorded by the XREC method were\nexplained within the SM.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9QwpxYnVpEOTvgyuHayfZuTd_3a7Vfv6R9_0meFGJpw","pdfSize":"1542182"}
