We present a versatile method for\ncreating a squeezed thermal reservoir for quantum systems. By coupling the\nsystem to a lossy mode within a normal thermal environment, we can emulate the\neffect of a squeezed reservoir characterized by reduced fluctuations in one\nquadrature. We demonstrate this approach through two illustrative cases: one\nfor two-level systems, such as qubits or atoms, and another for bosonic modes,\nlike photons or phonons. This method leverages constant linear interactions\nwithin a normal thermal environment, ensuring experimental feasibility without\nrequiring squeezed light inputs or time-dependent modulations. This technique\nholds promise for various applications, including the enhancement of\ndissipative squeezing, stabilization of entanglement, advancement of quantum\nsimulations, exploration of quantum thermodynamics and phase transitions, and\nimprovement of precision measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
