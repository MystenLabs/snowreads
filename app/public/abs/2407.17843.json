However, the role of text embedding in the editing process\nhas not been thoroughly investigated. A significant aspect that remains\nunexplored is the interaction between text and image embeddings. In this study,\nwe show that during the progressive editing of an input image in a diffusion\nmodel, the text embedding remains constant. As the image embedding increasingly\ndiverges from its initial state, the discrepancy between the image and text\nembeddings presents a significant challenge. Moreover, we found that the text\nprompt significantly influences the dragging process, particularly in\nmaintaining content integrity and achieving the desired manipulation. To\nutilize these insights, we propose DragText, which optimizes text embedding in\nconjunction with the dragging process to pair with the modified image\nembedding. Simultaneously, we regularize the text optimization process to\npreserve the integrity of the original text prompt. Our approach can be\nseamlessly integrated with existing diffusion-based drag methods with only a\nfew lines of code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rk8qgMVERoEHni51g12awYRVd58PFTuSioDQrGps-1I","pdfSize":"14822647"}
