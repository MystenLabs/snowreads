HyperCAN integrates an input convex network\nthat models the nonlinear stress-strain map of a truss lattice, while ensuring\nadherence to fundamental mechanics principles, along with a hypernetwork that\ndynamically adjusts the parameters of the convex network as a function of the\nlattice topology and geometry. This unified framework demonstrates robust\ngeneralization in predicting the mechanical behavior of previously unseen\nmetamaterial designs and loading scenarios well beyond the training domain. We\nshow how HyperCAN can be integrated into multiscale simulations to accurately\ncapture the highly nonlinear responses of large-scale truss metamaterials,\nclosely matching fully resolved simulations while significantly reducing\ncomputational costs. This offers new efficient opportunities for the multiscale\ndesign and optimization of truss metamaterials.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
