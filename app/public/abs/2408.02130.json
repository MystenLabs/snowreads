The core of this work is an\nalgorithm that takes an ontology and returns a structure describing the user\ninterface. The component also provides functions for populating the ontology\nand editing existing individuals. Unlike previous approaches, this method can\nbe implemented without any configuration. Additionally, it offers an\neasy-to-use configuration mechanism that allows irrelevant classes to be hidden\nand automatically populated. What distinguishes this work is that, instead of\nexploring the ontology using syntactic methods or queries, our algorithm\nemploys services that implement description logic inference mechanisms. This\nwork illustrates the proposed approach using the well-known wine ontology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
