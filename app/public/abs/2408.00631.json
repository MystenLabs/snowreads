By means of direct numerical simulations of the\nincompressible Navier-Stokes equations, we show that transverse structure\nfunctions exhibit an anomalous scaling, in contrast to the self-similar\nbehavior of longitudinal ones. We argue that the intermittency of transverse\nstructure functions explains the one observed for velocity circulation\nstatistics, although they are driven by different turbulent structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
