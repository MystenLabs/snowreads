We frame our observations with respect to\nnotions of responsible innovation (RI) and the emerging problem of how to do RI\nin practice. In contribution to the ongoing discourse surrounding trustworthy\nautonomous system (TAS) [29], we illuminate practical challenges inherent in\ndeploying novel AS within existing governance structures, including domain\nspecific regulations and policies, and rigorous testing and development\nprocesses, and discuss the implications of these for the distribution of\nresponsibility in novel AI deployment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
