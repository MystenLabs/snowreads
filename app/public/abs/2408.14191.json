In this paper,\nwe complement Bertrand's theorem showing the existence of an infinite\ndimensional space of central force potentials on the plane which are Zoll at a\ngiven energy level, meaning that all non-collision orbits with given energy are\nclosed and of the same length. We also determine all natural systems on the\n(not necessarily flat) plane which are invariant under rotations and Zoll at a\ngiven energy and prove several existence and rigidity results for systems which\nare Zoll at multiple energies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
