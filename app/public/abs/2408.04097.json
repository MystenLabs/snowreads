Focusing on parallel simulation,\noptimal grid partitioning minimizes the idle time caused by different\nsimulation times for the sub-networks and their components and reduces the\noverhead required to simulate the cuts. Partitioning a graph into two parts\nsuch that, for example, the cut is minimal and the subgraphs have equal size is\nan NP-hard problem. In this paper we show how optimal partitioning of a graph\ncan be obtained using quantum annealing (QA). We show how to map the\nrequirements for optimal splitting to a quadratic unconstrained binary\noptimization (QUBO) formulation and test the proposed formulation using a\ncurrent D-Wave QPU. We show that the necessity to find an embedding of the QUBO\non current D-Wave QPUs limits the problem size to under 200 buses and notably\naffects the time-to-solution. We finally discuss the implications on near-term\nimplementation of QA in combination to traditional CPU or GPU based simulation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
