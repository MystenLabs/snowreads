{"id":"2407.15998","title":"Public Perception of AI: Sentiment and Opportunity","authors":"Jayshree Seth","authorsParsed":[["Seth","Jayshree",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 22 Jul 2024 19:11:28 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-24","timestamp":1721675488000,"abstract":"  As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly influences various aspects of\nsociety, there is growing public interest in its potential benefits and risks.\nIn this paper we present results of public perception of AI from a survey\nconducted with 10,000 respondents spanning ten countries in four continents\naround the world. The results show that currently an equal percentage of\nrespondents who believe AI will change the world as we know it, also believe AI\nneeds to be heavily regulated. However, our findings also indicate that despite\nthe general sentiment among the global public that AI will replace workers, if\na company were to use AI to innovate to improve lives, the public would be more\nlikely to think highly of the company, purchase from them and even be\ninterested in a job in that company. Our results further reveal that the global\npublic largely views AI as a tool for problem solving. These nuanced results\nunderscore the importance of AI directed towards challenges that the public\nwould like science and technology-based innovations to address. We draw on a\nmulti-year 3M study of public perception of science to provide further context\non what the public perceives as important problems to be solved.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mjBZwtwyR6yxkC6eIYwqSsZa2U3yMCl5kKHKCsBkaMc","pdfSize":"13156697"}
