In this paper, we introduce\nthe definitions of transitivity, weakly mixing and mixing of multiple mappings\n$(X,F)$ from a set-valued perspective, which is the semigroup generated by $F$\nbased on iterated function system. Firstly, we prove that for multiple\nmappings, mixing implies distributional chaos in a sequence, Li-Yorke chaos and\nKato's chaos. Besides, we demonstrate that $F$ is Kato's chaos if and only if\n$F^k$ is Kato's chaos for any $k \\in \\mathbb{N}$. Finally, we construct a\nsymbolic dynamical system to show that distributional chaos may be generated by\nonly two strongly non-wandering points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
