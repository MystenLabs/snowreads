Under the framework of Lagrangian coordinates, a unique global\nsolution exists in the half-space provided that the norm of the initial data in\nthe critical homogeneous Besov space $\\dot{B}_{p,\n1}^{-1+N/p}(\\mathbb{R}_{+}^N)$ is sufficiently small, where $p \\in [N, 2N-1)$.\nBuilding upon prior work such as (Danchin and Mucha, J. Funct. Anal. 256 (2009)\n881--927) and (Ogawa and Shimizu, J. Differ. Equations 274 (2021) 613--651) in\nthe half-space setting, we establish maximal $L^{1}$-regularity for both the\nStokes equations without surface stress and the linearized equations of the\nmagnetic field with zero boundary condition. The existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions to the nonlinear problems are proven using the Banach contraction\nmapping principle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
