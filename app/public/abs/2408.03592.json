This emerging discipline has the\npotential to serve as a foundation for developing tools to design precision\nmedicines. However, due to the higher costs and expertise required for such\nexperiments, its translation into a regular clinical practice might be\nchallenging. Despite the implementation of modern deep learning to enhance\ninformation obtained from histological images using AI, efforts have been\nconstrained by limitations in the diversity of information. In this paper, we\ndeveloped a model, HistoSPACE that explore the diversity of histological images\navailable with ST data to extract molecular insights from tissue image. Our\nproposed study built an image encoder derived from universal image autoencoder.\nThis image encoder was connected to convolution blocks to built the final\nmodel. It was further fine tuned with the help of ST-Data. This model is\nnotably lightweight in compared to traditional histological models. Our\ndeveloped model demonstrates significant efficiency compared to contemporary\nalgorithms, revealing a correlation of 0.56 in leave-one-out cross-validation.\nFinally, its robustness was validated through an independent dataset, showing a\nwell matched preditction with predefined disease pathology.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
