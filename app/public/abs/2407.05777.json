PSMs are brought in contexts where\ndeterministic computation is insufficient, such as randomized algorithms. By\nallowing transitions to multiple possible states with certain probabilities,\nPSMs can solve problems and make decisions based on probabilistic outcomes,\nhence expanding the variety of possible computations. We provide an overview of\nPSMs, detailing their formal definitions as well as the computation mechanism\nand their equivalence with Non-deterministic Shoenfield Machines (NSM).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
