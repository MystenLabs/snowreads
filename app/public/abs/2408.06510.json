In particular, we show that for Carnot groups, i.e., stratified\nnilpotent Lie groups equipped with certain left-invariant homogeneous metrics,\nall horofunctions are piecewise-defined using Pansu derivatives. For higher\nHeisenberg groups and filiform Lie groups, two families which generalize the\nstandard 3-dimensional real Heisenberg group, we study the dimensions and\ntopologies of their horofunction boundaries. In doing so, we find that filiform\nLie groups $L_n$ of dimension $n\\geq 8$ provide the first-known examples of\nCarnot groups whose horofunction boundaries are not full-dimensional, i.e., of\ncodimension 1.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j115wccp1q4hRgr-ikw05YvpeEHql0tqWWhnFcSG5u8","pdfSize":"1491380"}
