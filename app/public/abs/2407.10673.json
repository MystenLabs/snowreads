From\nindependent and identically distributed observations we construct a kernel\nestimator with non-constant bandwidth, in particular in the vicinity of\nirregularities. It attains faster rates, for the risk $L_{p}, p\\geq 1$, than\nusual estimators with a fixed global bandwidth. Optimality of the rate found is\nestablished by a lower bound result. We then propose an adaptive method\ninspired by Lepski's method for automatically selecting the variable bandwidth,\nwithout any knowledge of the regularity of the density nor of the points where\nthe regularity breaks down. The procedure is illustrated numerically on\nexamples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
