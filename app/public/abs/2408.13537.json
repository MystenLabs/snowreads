It is proved that for $1\\leq p<\\infty$, the Fock projection $P_{\\alpha}$\nis bounded on $L^p_{\\alpha,W}(\\mathbb{C}^n;\\mathbb{C}^d)$ if and only if $W$\nsatisfies a restricted $\\mathbf{A}_p$-condition. In particular, when $p=1$, our\nresult establishes a strong (1,1) type estimate for the Fock projections, which\nis quite different with the case of Calder\\'{o}n--Zygmund operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
