It was recently proved that there are infinitely many orders\n$v$ for which, given any pair $(k,r)$ with $k\\geq3$ odd, a $(v,k;r)$ Heffter\nspace exists. This was obtained by imposing a point-regular automorphism group.\nHere we relax this request by asking for a point-semiregular automorphism\ngroup. In this way the above result is extended also to the case $k$ even.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jKuKZtIdKQBifhU-IQsRjlD9igt_BOincvGmC4lSrn0","pdfSize":"165624"}
