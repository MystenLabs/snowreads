To create safer alternatives,\nmulti-modality medical image translation aims to synthesize CE-MRI images from\nother available modalities. Although existing methods can generate promising\npredictions, they still face two challenges, i.e., exhibiting over-confidence\nand lacking interpretability on predictions. To address the above challenges,\nthis paper introduces TrustI2I, a novel trustworthy method that reformulates\nmulti-to-one medical image translation problem as a multimodal regression\nproblem, aiming to build an uncertainty-aware and reliable system.\nSpecifically, our method leverages deep evidential regression to estimate\nprediction uncertainties and employs an explicit intermediate and late fusion\nstrategy based on the Mixture of Normal Inverse Gamma (MoNIG) distribution,\nenhancing both synthesis quality and interpretability. Additionally, we\nincorporate uncertainty calibration to improve the reliability of uncertainty.\nValidation on the BraTS2018 dataset demonstrates that our approach surpasses\ncurrent methods, producing higher-quality images with rational uncertainty\nestimation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
