There are two important aspects of\nnon-perfect photon-counting receivers, namely, (i) dead time which results in\nblocking loss, and (ii) non-photon-number-resolving, which leads to counting\nloss during the gate-ON interval. These factors introduce nonlinear distortion\nto the detected photon counts. The detected photon counts depend not only on\nthe optical intensity but also on the signal waveform, and obey a Poisson\nbinomial process. Using the discrete Fourier transform characteristic function\n(DFT-CF) method, we derive the probability mass function (PMF) of the detected\nphoton counts. Furthermore, unlike conventional methods that assume an ideal\nrectangle wave, we propose a novel signal estimation and decision method\napplicable to arbitrary waveform. We demonstrate that the proposed method\nachieves superior error performance compared to conventional methods. The\nproposed algorithm has the potential to become an essential signal processing\ntool for photon-counting receivers.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"WRDUNsCT0CrAtwe8G2295TXn-j_Y1v0IHI8cmU65Dkw","pdfSize":"1008671"}
