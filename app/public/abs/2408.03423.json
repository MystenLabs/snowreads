The criterion\nis an inequality formulated in terms of the lattice covolume, the dimension of\nthe underlying Euclidean space, and the index of an associated subgroup\nmeasuring the degree of non-integrality of the lattice. For arbitrary lattices\nwe also give an upper bound on the number of windows in the Schwartz class\nneeded for a multi-window Gabor frame.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
