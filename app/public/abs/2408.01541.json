This paper presents a comprehensive\nbenchmarking study of various defense mechanisms in response to the rise in\nadversarial attacks on IQA. We systematically evaluate 25 defense strategies,\nincluding adversarial purification, adversarial training, and certified\nrobustness methods. We applied 14 adversarial attack algorithms of various\ntypes in both non-adaptive and adaptive settings and tested these defenses\nagainst them. We analyze the differences between defenses and their\napplicability to IQA tasks, considering that they should preserve IQA scores\nand image quality. The proposed benchmark aims to guide future developments and\naccepts submissions of new methods, with the latest results available online:\nhttps://videoprocessing.ai/benchmarks/iqa-defenses.html.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KIDx4cvC4c-lktsYRXUcfjSb-iL5NJ9GU_l_jqYXA2M","pdfSize":"1154944"}
