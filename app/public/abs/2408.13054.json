Generally, it is extremely difficult or even\nimpossible for morphing quadrotors to establish an accurate mathematical model\ndescribing their complex flight dynamics. To figure out the issue of flight\ncontrol design for morphing quadrotors, this paper resorts to a combination of\nmodel-free control techniques (e.g., deep reinforcement learning, DRL) and\nconvex combination (CC) technique, and proposes a convex-combined-DRL (cc-DRL)\nflight control algorithm for position and attitude of a class of morphing\nquadrotors, where the shape change is realized by the length variation of four\narm rods. In the proposed cc-DRL flight control algorithm, proximal policy\noptimization algorithm that is a model-free DRL algorithm is utilized to\noff-line train the corresponding optimal flight control laws for some selected\nrepresentative arm length modes and hereby a cc-DRL flight control scheme is\nconstructed by the convex combination technique. Finally, simulation results\nare presented to show the effectiveness and merit of the proposed flight\ncontrol algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
