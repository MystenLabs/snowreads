However, the static construction of traditional neural networks\ninhibits dynamic intelligence. This makes them inflexible to temporal changes\nin data and unfit to capture complex dependencies. With the advent of quantum\ntechnology, there has been significant progress in creating quantum algorithms.\nIn recent years, researchers have developed quantum neural networks that\nleverage the capabilities of qubits to outperform classical networks. However,\ntheir current formulation exhibits a static construction limiting the system's\ndynamic intelligence. To address these weaknesses, we develop a Liquid Quantum\nNeural Network (LQNet) and a Continuous Time Recurrent Quantum Neural Network\n(CTRQNet). Both models demonstrate a significant improvement in accuracy\ncompared to existing quantum neural networks (QNNs), achieving accuracy\nincreases as high as 40\\% on CIFAR 10 through binary classification. We propose\nLQNets and CTRQNets might shine a light on quantum machine learning's black\nbox.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
