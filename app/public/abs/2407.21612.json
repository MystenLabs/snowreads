Here as a representative and typical member of the\ngroup, an inverse obstacle problem governed by the Helmholtz equation with a\nfixed wave number in a bounded domain is considered. It is assumed that the\nsolutions of the Helmholtz equation outside the set of unknown obstacles\nsatisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions on each\nsurface of obstacles. This is the case when two extreme types of obstacles are\nembedded in a medium. By considering this case, not only a concise technique\nfor IPS is introduced but also a general correspondence principle from IPS to\nthe probe method is suggested. Besides, as a corollary it is shown that the\nprobe method together with the singular sources method reformulated in terms of\nthe probe method has the Side B under a smallness conditions on the wave number\n$k$, which is the blowing up property of a sequence computed from the\nassociated Dirichlet-to-Neumann map.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
