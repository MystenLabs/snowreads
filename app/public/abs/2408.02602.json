The RG is based on a coarse-graining over the eigenvalues of\nmatrix-like disorder, viewed as an effective kinetic whose eigenvalue\ndistribution undergoes a deterministic law in the large $N$ limit. We focus our\ninvestigation on perturbation theory and vertex expansion for effective average\naction, which proves more amenable than standard nonperturbative approaches due\nto the distinct non-local temporal and replicative structures that emerge in\nthe effective interactions following disorder integration. Our work entails the\nformulation of rules to address these non-localities within the framework of\nperturbation theory, culminating in the derivation of one-loop\n$\\beta$-functions. Our explicit calculations focus on the cases $p=3$,\n$p=\\infty$, and additional analytic material is given in the appendix.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
