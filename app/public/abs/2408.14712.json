The high quality of synthesized speech\nand the availability of low-cost VC services have given rise to many potential\nabuses of this technology. Several detection methodologies have been proposed\nover the years that can detect voice spoofs with reasonably good accuracy.\nHowever, these methodologies are mostly evaluated on clean audio databases,\nsuch as ASVSpoof 2019. This paper evaluates SOTA Audio Spoof Detection\napproaches in the presence of laundering attacks. In that regard, a new\nlaundering attack database, called the ASVSpoof Laundering Database, is\ncreated. This database is based on the ASVSpoof 2019 (LA) eval database\ncomprising a total of 1388.22 hours of audio recordings. Seven SOTA audio spoof\ndetection approaches are evaluated on this laundered database. The results\nindicate that SOTA systems perform poorly in the presence of aggressive\nlaundering attacks, especially reverberation and additive noise attacks. This\nsuggests the need for robust audio spoof detection.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
