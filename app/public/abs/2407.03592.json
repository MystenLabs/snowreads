In a\ncrescent-shaped area, part of the boundary is subject to an oblique derivative\nboundary condition, while the other part of the boundary is subject to a\nDirichlet boundary condition. We show that, as the crescent-shaped area\ncollapses into a segment under suitable conditions, the boundary value problem\nobeys uniform Schauder estimates and induces an asymptotic estimate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
