This\nreport introduces a discriminative spatial-temporal VOS model that utilizes\ndiscriminative object features as query representations. The semantic\nunderstanding of spatial-semantic modules enables it to recognize object parts,\nwhile salient features highlight more distinctive object characteristics. Our\nmodel, trained on extensive VOS datasets, achieved first place\n(\\textbf{80.90\\%} $\\mathcal{J \\& F}$) on the test set of the 6th LSVOS\nchallenge in the VOS Track, demonstrating its effectiveness in tackling the\naforementioned challenges.
