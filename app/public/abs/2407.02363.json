The proposed framework utilizes\ndiscretized representation of the robot and the environment to calculate 3D\nEuclidean distance transform for task-priority based kinematic control. The\nenvironment scene is represented using a 3D GPU-voxel map created and updated\nfrom a live pointcloud data while the robotic link model is converted into a\nvoxels offline and inserted into the voxel map according to the joint state of\nthe robot to form the self-obstacle map. The proposed approach is evaluated\nusing the Tiago robot, showing that all obstacle and self collision avoidance\nconstraints are respected within one framework even with fast moving obstacles\nwhile the robot performs end-effector pose tracking in real time. A comparison\nof related works that depend on GPU and CPU computed distance fields is also\npresented to highlight the time performance as well as accuracy of the GPU\ndistance field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
