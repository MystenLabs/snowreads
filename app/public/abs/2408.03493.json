For a relativistic description of the nuclear dynamics, we employ\nthe relativistic mean-field model, which has been proven to describe the data\nnicely in the quasielastic region. In the present work, we analyze the\ninfluence beyond the Standard Model by considering the neutrino magnetic and\nelectric dipole form factors and charge radius on the neutrino electroweak\ninteractions within $^{12}$C. To this end, we use the values of the neutrino\ncharge radius and the magnetic moment at the squared four momentum transfer\n$Q^2=0$ obtained from the recent experiments and calculate the neutrino\ndifferential cross section of the neutrino-$^{12}$C scattering. We find that\nthe effect of the charge radius and the electric dipole form factor is very\nsmall, but the role of the magnetic dipole form factor is sensitive to $Q^2$\nand becomes sizable at small momentum transfer.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1xdfqAlrksYDzb5F_DR_SpIkNQk8XT9dl5UmeCJLgGk","pdfSize":"204385"}
