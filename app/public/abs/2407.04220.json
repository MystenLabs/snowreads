In the radiation-dominated Universe, the coupling term introduces an\neffective mass to $\\phi$ and the background ultra-relativistic particles. The\noscillations of $\\phi$ result in the periodic change of the equation of state\nparameter and the sound speed, which provides a novel mechanism to amplify\nsubhorizon scalar perturbations through parametric resonance. The amplification\nof scalar perturbations leads to a stochastic gravitational-waves\nbackground~(SGWB) expected to be observed by multiband gravitational wave\nobservers. The observation of the SGWB helps to determine the initial value of\n$\\phi$ and the coupling strength of the interaction. This mechanism is\ngenerally applicable to the interactions that introduce an effective mass, and\nwe take the interaction between $\\phi$ and electrons as a concrete example to\nillustrate the result. We find that under the condition that the coupling\ncoefficient $\\lambda=10^{-16}$ and the initial value $\\phi_i=10^{18}$ GeV, the\nresulting SGWB spectrum is expected to be observed by the future observers\nincluding LISA, $Taiji$, DECIGO and BBO.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
