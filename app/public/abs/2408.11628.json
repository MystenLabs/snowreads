Typical QEC for ensembles requires\naddressing individually resolved qubits, but this is practically challenging in\nmost realistic architectures. Here, we propose QEC schemes for unresolvable\nspin ensembles. By using degenerate superpositions of excited states, which are\nfundamentally mixed, we find codes that can protect against both individual and\ncollective errors, including dephasing, decay, and pumping. We show how\ninformation recovery can be achieved with only collective measurement and\ncontrol, and illustrate its applications in extending memory lifetime and\nloss-tolerant sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
