We show that if we allow non-adaptive or adaptive\nX-basis measurements, or allow non-adaptive Z-basis measurements, then the\ncomputational power remains the same as that of the original IQP model; and\nwith adaptive Z-basis measurements the model becomes quantum universal.\nFurthermore we show that the computational model having circuits of only CZ\ngates and adaptive X-basis measurements, with input states that are tensor\nproducts of 1-qubit states from the set |+>, |->, |0>+i|1> and |0>+ e^{i\npi/4}|1> (each normalised), is quantum universal.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
