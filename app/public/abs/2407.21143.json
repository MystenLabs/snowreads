The buyers have independently drawn valuation from\na uniform distribution, and the seller would like to incentivize buyers to\ninvite more people to the auction. We prove that our mechanism is individual\nrational, and incentivize compatible with regard to the buyers' action.\nFurthermore, we show the approximation ratio of our mechanism to the optimal\nfixed-price auction in two ways, theoretically and via Monte-Carlo simulation,\nand show a high practical ratio. Finally, we discuss several factors affecting\nthe behavior of our mechanism and its feasibility in reality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"L9-h749Hv4uBdsseUInbNrcR2MmBcw3zSqBadE5Wg6o","pdfSize":"164123"}
