An exterior differential form\nof the integrable hierarchy is introduced, further confirming the existence of\nthe tau function. Subsequently, we present the twistor structure of the\nhierarchy. By constructing the nonlinear Riemann Hilbert problem for the\nequation, the structure of the solution to the equation is better understood.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
