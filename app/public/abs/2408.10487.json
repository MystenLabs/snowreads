Current\nevent-based tracking algorithms are gradually hitting their performance\nbottlenecks, due to the utilization of vision Transformer and the static\ntemplate for target object localization. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMamba-based visual tracking framework that adopts the state space model with\nlinear complexity as a backbone network. The search regions and target template\nare fed into the vision Mamba network for simultaneous feature extraction and\ninteraction. The output tokens of search regions will be fed into the tracking\nhead for target localization. More importantly, we consider introducing a\ndynamic template update strategy into the tracking framework using the Memory\nMamba network. By considering the diversity of samples in the target template\nlibrary and making appropriate adjustments to the template memory module, a\nmore effective dynamic template can be integrated. The effective combination of\ndynamic and static templates allows our Mamba-based tracking algorithm to\nachieve a good balance between accuracy and computational cost on multiple\nlarge-scale datasets, including EventVOT, VisEvent, and FE240hz.
