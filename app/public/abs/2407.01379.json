Let $L$ be an extension of $A_2$ by $A_1$, and\n$N$ an extension of $A_3$ by $A_2$. Let $M$ be a blended extension (extension\npanach\\'ee) of $N$ by $L$. Under very mild and natural hypotheses, we study the\nunipotent radical of the tannakian fundamental group of $M$. Examples where our\nresults apply include the unipotent radicals of motivic Galois groups of any\nmixed motive with three weights.\n  As an application, we give a proof of the unipotent part of the Hodge-Nori\nconjecture for 1-motives (which is now a theorem of Andr\\'e in the setting of\nNori motives) in the setting of any tannakian category of motives where the\ngroup $Ext^1(1,\\mathbb{Q}(1))$ is as expected.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
