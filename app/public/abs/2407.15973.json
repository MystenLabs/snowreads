We evaluate the performance improvement of the proposed mixed\nprecision BJAC preconditioners combined with the preconditioned conjugate\ngradient algorithm using problems including diffusion equations and radiation\nhydrodynamics equations. Numerical results show that, compared to the uniform\nhigh precision PCG algorithm, the mixed precision preconditioners can achieve\nspeedups from 1.3 to 1.8 without sacrificing accuracy. Furthermore, we observe\nthe phenomenon of convergence delay in some test cases for the mixed precision\npreconditioners, and further analyse the matrix features associate with the\nconvergence delay behavior.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
