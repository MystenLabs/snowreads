Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP,\nincluding the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from\nother UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a\nconvex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our\nstudy further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using\ndifferent toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by\n\"+/-1\"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by \"+/-i\") and a toy UBQP with\nmatrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the\nthree toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different\ntoy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by \"+/-1\")\nexhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3\n(construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using\nthe toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by \"+/-i\") emerges as the most effective,\nwhile ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings\ncontribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in\noptimizing UBQP.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
