In this research the parameters of rooting percentage, root\nnumber, root length, sprout bud number, shoot length and shoot diameter were\nmeasured. Effect of individual factors showed that the highest rooting\npercentage (15%) was achieved in cuttings soaked in water for 24 hours, as well\nas improving other traits. Also, the best (23.33%) rooting was found in\ncuttings dipped in 4000 ppm IBA. Interaction effects of the two factors showed\nthat cuttings treated with 4000 ppm IBA and soaked in water for 24 hours gave\nthe highest (40%) rooting, and the highest other root and shoot traits were\nachieved in the same interaction as well.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
