This work reports\nlow-temperature neutron diffraction measurements on single crystal\nCe$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ with $Q$-coverage both at low $Q$ where the magnetic form\nfactor for dipoles is near maximal and at high $Q$ covering the region where\nthe magnetic form factor for Ce$^{3+}$ octupoles is near maximal. This study\nwas motivated by recent powder neutron diffraction studies of other Ce-based\ndipole-octupole pyrochlores, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ and Ce$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$, which\neach showed temperature-dependent diffuse diffraction at high $Q$ that was\ninterpreted as arising from octupolar correlations. Our measurements use an\noptimized single crystal diffuse scattering instrument that allows us to screen\nagainst strong single crystal Bragg scattering in Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$. The\ntemperature-difference neutron diffraction reveals a low-$Q$ peak consistent\nwith dipolar spin ice correlations. For larger $Q$, the temperature-difference\nneutron diffraction shows an alternation between positive and negative net\nintensity. These features are qualitatively consistent with the corresponding\nnumerical-linked-cluster (NLC) calculations using pseudospin interaction\nparameters reported for Ce$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$, Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, or\nCe$_2$Hf$_2$O$_7$. Importantly, neither the measured data nor any of the NLC\ncalculations show increased scattering at high $Q$ resulting from octupolar\ncorrelations. We conclude that at the lowest attainable temperatures for our\nmeasurement ($T = 0.05$ K), octupolar correlations are not present in\nCe$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ on the level of our observation threshold of $\\sim$ 0.1$\\%$\nof the low-$Q$ dipole scattering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lWQAv5jqkTyWdQiZsP1gNMo5utT80CTnQndc_zFGJAI","pdfSize":"10397457","objectId":"0xd609aed3c7b33a9646b3511a365c022bacba4428aabc8da7c269b16914d017c5","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
