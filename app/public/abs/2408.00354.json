Our synthesis procedure takes the qubit\nconnectivity of a target quantum computer into account. As a result, the\ngenerated quantum circuit does not require routing, and no additional CNOT\ngates are needed to run the resulting circuit on a target device. We compare\nour algorithm against Paulihedral and TKET, and show a significant improvement\nfor randomized circuits and different molecular ansatzes. We also investigate\nthe Trotter error introduced by our ordering of the terms in the Hamiltonian\nversus default ordering and the ordering from the baseline methods and conclude\nthat our method on average does not increase the Trotter error.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
