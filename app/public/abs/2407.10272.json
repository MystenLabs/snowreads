However, while nonlinearity\nhas been recognized, the literature has so far neglected a deeper and more\nintricate level of nonlinearity, namely the {\\it row-level} nonlinear dynamics\nand the {\\it column-level} nonlinear dynamics, which are often observed in\neconomic and financial data. In this paper, we propose a novel two-way\nthreshold matrix autoregression (TWTMAR) model. This model is designed to\neffectively characterize the threshold structure in both rows and columns of\nmatrix-valued time series. Unlike existing models that consider a single\nthreshold variable or assume a uniform structure change across the matrix, the\nTWTMAR model allows for distinct threshold effects for rows and columns using\ntwo threshold variables. This approach achieves greater dimension reduction and\nyields better interpretation compared to existing methods. Moreover, we propose\na parameter estimation procedure leveraging the intrinsic matrix structure and\ninvestigate the asymptotic properties. The efficacy and flexibility of the\nmodel are demonstrated through both simulation studies and an empirical\nanalysis of the Fama-French Portfolio dataset.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
