The flare\nwhite-light fluxes reveal four successive and repetitive pulsations, which are\nsimultaneously measured by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager and the\nWhite-light Solar Telescope. A quasi-period of 8.6$^{+1.5}_{-1.9}$ minutes,\ndetermined by the Morlet wavelet transform, is detected in the visible\ncontinuum channel. The modulation depth, which is defined as the ratio between\nthe oscillatory amplitude and its long-term trend, is smaller than 0.1%,\nimplying that the QPP feature is a weak wave process. Imaging observations show\nthat the X6.4 flare occurs near a sunspot group. Moreover, the white-light\nbrightening is located in sunspot penumbra, and a similar quasi-period of about\n8.5$^{+1.6}_{-1.8}$ minutes is identified in one penumbral location of the\nnearest sunspot. The map of Fourier power distribution suggests that a similar\nperiodicity is universally existing in most parts of the penumbra that is close\nto the penumbral-photospheric boundary. Our observations support the scenario\nof that the white-light QPP is probably modulated by the slow-mode\nmagnetoacoustic gravity wave leaking from the sunspot penumbra.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
