It\nis thought to be the surviving WD donor predicted by the \"dynamically driven\ndouble-degenerate double-detonation\" (D$^6$) type Ia supernova formation model.\nWe analysed an ultraviolet spectrum of J0927-6335 obtained recently with the\nHubble Space Telescope and found very high abundances of iron and nickel. This\ncould originate in the pollution of the remnant by the SN Ia explosion but it\nis uncertain to what extent atomic diffusion altered the chemical composition\nof the accreted material.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
