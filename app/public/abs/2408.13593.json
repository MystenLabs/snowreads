This framework dynamically adapts to variations in affordable data\nrate within the communication pipeline. It conceptualizes communication\npipelines as symmetric, discrete, memoryless channels. We employ a progressive\nlearning strategy to train the system, comprising a nested codebook for\nencoding and task inference. This configuration allows for the adjustment of\nmultiple rate levels in response to evolving channel conditions. The results\nfrom our experiments show that this system not only supports edge inference\nacross various coding levels but also excels in adapting to variable\ncommunication environments.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
