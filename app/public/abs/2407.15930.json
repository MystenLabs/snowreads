Although the four-body final states suppress the\ndecay branching ratio, the large production of $W$ bosons makes detecting and\nprecisely measuring this decay probability entirely feasible. Our simulation\nstudy indicates that this tiny branching ratio can be measured with sub-percent\nprecision at the HL-LHC. This decay channel can also constrain Standard Model\nextensions. Using the $ L_\\mu-L_\\tau$ model as a benchmark, we find that the\ncurrent bound on the gauge coupling for $Z'$ mass in the range of $[4,75]$ GeV\ncan significantly improve.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
