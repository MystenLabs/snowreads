This paper presents a two-level classification method that\naddresses this transparency problem. At the first stage, an image segmenter\ndetects the objects present in the image and a feature vector is created from\nthose objects. In the second stage, this feature vector is used as input for\nstandard machine learning classifiers to discriminate between images. We apply\nthis method to a new dataset of more than 140,000 images to detect which ones\ndisplay political protest. This analysis demonstrates three advantages to this\npaper's approach. First, identifying objects in images improves transparency by\nproviding human-understandable labels for the objects shown on an image.\nSecond, knowing these objects enables analysis of which distinguish protest\nimages from non-protest ones. Third, comparing the importance of objects across\ncountries reveals how protest behavior varies. These insights are not available\nusing conventional computer vision classifiers and provide new opportunities\nfor comparative research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
