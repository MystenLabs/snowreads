To address this limitation, we introduce the\n\"Multi-Instance partially Homomorphic TLP\" (MH-TLP), a multi-instance TLP\nsupporting efficient verifiable homomorphic linear combinations of puzzles\nbelonging to a client. It ensures anyone can verify the correctness of\ncomputations and solutions. Building on MH-TLP, we further propose the\n\"Multi-instance Multi-client verifiable partially Homomorphic TLP\" (MMH-TLP).\nIt not only supports all the features of MH-TLP but also allows for verifiable\nhomomorphic linear combinations of puzzles from different clients. Our schemes\nrefrain from using asymmetric-key cryptography for verification and, unlike\nmost homomorphic TLPs, do not require a trusted third party. A comprehensive\ncost analysis demonstrates that our schemes scale linearly with the number of\nclients and puzzles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q5ooYsr7WkwDY-fA1Pt5CigHXB-MoQCTI6VZWInhXbI","pdfSize":"2630280"}
