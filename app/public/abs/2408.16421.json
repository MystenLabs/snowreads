While the use of active control systems is an\nestablished practice in engineering, passive systems are not well understood,\nand the limits of their efficacy are yet to be ascertained. To this end, the\npresent study aims to provide new insights into the effectiveness of passive\npitching in the mitigation of lift fluctuations in the most demanding case of\nfast, high-amplitude variations of the free stream speed and direction. We\nperform fluid-structure interaction simulations of a two-dimensional\nfree-to-pitch rigid foil. Our study reveals that the lift amplitude of the\nforce fluctuations can be decreased by at least two-thirds through passive\npitching. The efficacy of the unsteady load mitigation is only weakly dependent\non the exact pitching axis location, and the optimal position is upstream and\nclose to the axis of the foil. These results may inform the design of passive\ncontrol systems of wind/tidal turbines and aerial/underwater vehicles and\nprovide new insights into interpreting the control strategy of natural flyers\nsuch as insects and birds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
