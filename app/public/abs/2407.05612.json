For the first time, we have found the curve that\njoins the points of maximum height of all trajectories followed by a projectile\nin the ultra-relativistic limit. The parametric equations of this curve produce\nan onion-like curve; in fact, it is one of the loops of a lemniscate-type\ncurve. We also verify that the curve is an ellipse in the nonrelativistic\napproximation. These two limiting results are obtained by following two\nslightly distinct approaches. In addition, we calculate the nonrelativistic and\nultra-relativistic approximations of the trajectory equation and parametric\nequations of the trajectory as functions of time. All limiting cases in the\narticle are studied in detail. The content of the article is appropriate for\nadvanced undergraduate students.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
