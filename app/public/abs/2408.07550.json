More generally, we find the generic\nsubrank of tensors of all orders and dimensions. This answers two open\nquestions posed in arXiv:2205.15168v2. Finally, we compute dimensions of\nvarieties of tensors of subrank at least $r$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
