However, existing\ngeodesic regression methods limit their regression performance by a strong\nunderlying assumption of linear dynamics, while diffusion-based methods have\nhigh computational costs and lack constraints to preserve image topology. In\nthis paper, we propose an optimization-based new framework called NODER, which\nleverages neural ordinary differential equations to capture complex underlying\ndynamics and reduces its high computational cost of handling high-dimensional\nimage volumes by introducing the latent space. We compare our NODER with two\nrecent regression methods, and the experimental results on ADNI and ACDC\ndatasets demonstrate that our method achieves the state-of-the-art performance\nin 3D image regression. Our model needs only a couple of images in a sequence\nfor prediction, which is practical, especially for clinical situations where\nextremely limited image time series are available for analysis.
