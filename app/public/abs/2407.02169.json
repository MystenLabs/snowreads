About five years earlier, in\n1997, Sheu proved that the C*-algebra of a quantum sphere is a groupoid\nC*-algebra. Here we show that the path groupoid of the directed graph of Hong\nand Szyma\\'nski is isomorphic to the groupoid discovered by Sheu.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
