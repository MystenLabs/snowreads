The method is exact in the slow roll\napproximation but remains effective even when the slow roll conditions are\ntemporarily violated such as in ultra slow roll models. With this method we\nconstruct new ultra slow roll scenarios and also models that reproduce the DM\nabundance within the slow roll regime. As a second application we consider a\nscalar power spectrum that generates a secondary gravitational wave background\ncompatible with the one recently observed in Pulsar Timing Arrays experiments.\nThese scenarios could be tested by future observations of $\\mu-$distortions of\nthe CMB.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
