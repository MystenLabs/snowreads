We can think of these as limit cones of symmetric\nnonnegative polynomials and symmetric sums of squares of fixed degree as the\nnumber of variables goes to infinity. We compare these cones, including finding\nexplicit examples of nonnegative polynomials which are not sums of squares for\nany sufficiently large number of variables, and compute the tropicalizations of\ntheir dual cones in the even symmetric case. We find that the tropicalization\nof the dual cones is naturally understood in terms of the overlooked\nsuperdominance order on partitions. The power sum symmetric functions obey this\nsame partial order (analogously to how term-normalized power sums obey the\ndominance order).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
