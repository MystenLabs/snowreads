Despite\nnumerous introductory books, the subject remains challenging for beginners.\nMathematica has emerged as a popular tool for research and education, offering\nvarious packages and built-in tools for Group Theory. However, these resources\nare often too scattered for effective educational use. This work aims to\nprovide a comprehensive source to help beginning students grasp Group Theory\nconcepts and their applications from a physicist's perspective, while also\nbuilding familiarity with symbolic language. We present several example\nnotebooks that succinctly cover well-known theories and demonstrate specific\nconcepts, which can be easily adapted for educational purposes. We provide\nbasic examples on finite, compact and non-compact groups, and motivate the use\nof these concepts in solving physics problems such as addition of angular\nmomenta, modelling a system of qubits and the description of spacetime\ntransformations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
