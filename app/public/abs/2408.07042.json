We\ndeveloped a methodology to refine transit timing predictions for JWST's Cycle 3\nGuest Observer program, specifically for the NIRISS/SOSS and NIRSpec/BOTS\nobservation modes. Our process involved data collection from JWST proposal\ndocuments, cross-matching with TESS data, and applying the Transit Least\nSquares (TLS) algorithm for transit detection and characterization. We created\ncomprehensive timelines for instrument usage and individual proposals,\nproviding a visual representation of the observation schedule from July 2024 to\nSeptember 2025. This approach demonstrates the potential for improved\nefficiency in JWST time allocation and sets a foundation for future refinements\nin astronomical observation planning.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"auA5I2pvn_FcCU1gi1fL2gyzZBJb2VPKOE2RpwTnNfk","pdfSize":"4114320"}
