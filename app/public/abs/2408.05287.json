We take\nparticular care that all equations of state under investigation are compatible\nwith astrophysical constraints as well as are able to reproduce finite nuclear\nproperties. We find that while the inferred neutrino luminosity of cold\ntransiently-accreting star MXB $1659\\text{-}29$ is reproduced in all of the\nconstructed twin star models, the luminosity of colder source SAXJ\n$1808.4\\text{-}3658$ cannot be described by equations of state with\nquark-hadron transition densities below $1.7$ saturation density, suggesting\nthat twin stars with such low density transitions to the quark phase are not\nrealized in nature. We also discuss how constraints to the quark-hadron phase\ntransition density are strongly dependent on the cooling effectiveness of quark\nphase reactions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
