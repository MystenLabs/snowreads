Machine learning models trained with simulation data can provide\na faster alternative to traditional simulators. In this paper we present a\nsingle Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) surrogate that outperforms traditional\nreservoir simulators by the ability to predict pressures and saturations on\nvarying permeability fields, well locations, well controls, and number of\nwells. The maximum-mean relative error of 95\\% of pressure and saturation\npredictions is less than 5\\%. This is achieved by employing a simple yet very\neffective data augmentation technique that reduces the dataset size by 75\\% and\nreduces overfitting. Also, constructing the input tensor in a binary fashion\nenables predictions on unseen well locations, well controls, and number of\nwells. Such model can accelerate history matching and reservoir\ncharacterization procedures by several orders of magnitude. The ability to\npredict on new well locations, well controls, and number of wells enables\nhighly efficient reservoir management and optimization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
