We detect secondary\neclipse signals in $i$ and $z_{\\rm s}$ with eclipse depths of $373^{+74}_{-75}$\nppm and $638^{+199}_{-178}$, respectively. We perform an atmospheric retrieval\non the emission spectrum combined with the data from HST/WFC3, Spitzer, TESS,\nand CHEOPS to obtain the temperature profile and chemical abundances, including\nTiO and VO, which have been thought to produce temperature inversion structures\nin the dayside of ultra-hot Jupiters. While we confirm a strong temperature\ninversion structure, we find low abundances of TiO and VO with mixing ratios of\n$\\rm{log(TiO)}=-7.80^{+0.15}_{-0.30}$ and $\\rm{log(VO)}=-9.60^{+0.64}_{-0.57}$,\nrespectively. The low abundances of TiO and VO are consistent with theoretical\npredictions for such an ultra-hot atmosphere. In such low abundances, TiO and\nVO have little effect on the temperature structure of the atmosphere. The\nabundance of ${\\rm e}^{-}$, which serves as a proxy for ${\\rm H}^{-}$ ions in\nthis study, is found to be high, with $\\rm{log(e^-)}=-4.89\\pm{0.06}$. These\nresults indicate that the temperature inversion in KELT-9 b's dayside\natmosphere is likely not caused by TiO/VO, but rather by the significant\nabundance of ${\\rm H}^{-}$ ions. The best-fit model cannot fully explain the\nobserved spectrum, and chemical species not included in the retrieval may\nintroduce modeling biases. Future observations with broader wavelength coverage\nand higher spectral resolution are expected to provide more accurate\ndiagnostics on the presence and abundances of TiO/VO. These advanced\nobservations will overcome the limitations of current data from HST and\nphotometric facilities, which are constrained by narrow wavelength coverage and\ninstrumental systematics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LRELxyJZGM_9b3ZLqQNbRHwDbQ38aKboOnaHGa53ImE","pdfSize":"7337998"}
