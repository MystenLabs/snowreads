As a good observation, we use the\nintermittency of the temporal concentrated function in an almost optimal way,\nand establish its relationship with the viscosity exponent $\\alpha$ as well as\nthe regularity of the weak solutions. The research results extend the recent\nelegant works on 2D Navier-Stokes equations in [Cheskidov and Luo, Invent.\nMath., 229 (2022), pp. 987--1054; Cheskidov and Luo, Ann. PDE, 9:13 (2023)] to\nthe hyper-dissipative case $\\alpha \\in(1,\\frac{3}{2})$, and are also applicable\nin Lebesgue and Besov spaces. It is proved that even in the case of high\nviscosity, the behavior of the solution remains unpredictable and stochastic\ndue to the lack of integrability and regularity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
