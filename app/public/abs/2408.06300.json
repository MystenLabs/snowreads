We present GraphMetaMat, a graph-based\nframework capable of designing three-dimensional metamaterials with\nprogrammable responses and arbitrary manufacturing constraints. Integrating\ngraph networks, physics biases, reinforcement learning, and tree search,\nGraphMetaMat can target stress-strain curves spanning four orders of magnitude\nand complex behaviors, as well as viscoelastic transmission responses with\nvarying attenuation gaps. GraphMetaMat can create cushioning materials for\nprotective equipment and vibration-damping panels for electric vehicles,\noutperforming commercial materials, and enabling the automatic design of\nmaterials with on-demand functionalities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
