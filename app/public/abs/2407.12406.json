Different homogeneous boundary conditions\nare considered, including Dirichlet, Robin, and Neumann conditions for\nintegrable initial data in $L^1(\\Omega)$. After taking into account the loss of\nmass of the solution through the boundary, depending on the boundary\nconditions, we describe the asymptotic spatial distribution of the remaining\nmass in terms of the Gaussian and of a suitable asymptotic profile function. We\nshow that our results have optimal time rates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
