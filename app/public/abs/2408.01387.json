To address these limitations, we have\ndeveloped a novel method using neural networks called NeuralBeta, which is\ncapable of handling both univariate and multivariate scenarios and tracking the\ndynamic behavior of beta. To address the issue of interpretability, we\nintroduce a new output layer inspired by regularized weighted linear\nregression, which provides transparency into the model's decision-making\nprocess. We conducted extensive experiments on both synthetic and market data,\ndemonstrating NeuralBeta's superior performance compared to benchmark methods\nacross various scenarios, especially instances where beta is highly\ntime-varying, e.g., during regime shifts in the market. This model not only\nrepresents an advancement in the field of beta estimation, but also shows\npotential for applications in other financial contexts that assume linear\nrelationships.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
