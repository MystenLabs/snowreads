Key challenges are related to how on can optimally en- and\ndecode classical information, as well as what constitutes a good reservoir. Our\nmain contribution is a generalization of the standard way to robustly en- and\ndecode time series into subspaces defined by the cosets of a given stabilizer.\nA key observation is the necessity to perform the decoding step, which in turn\nensures a consistent way of encoding. This provides a systematic way to encode\nclassical information in a robust way. We provide a numerical analysis on a\ndiscrete time series given by two standard maps, namely the logistic and the\nH\\'enon map. Our numerical findings indicate that the system's performance is\nincreasing with the length of the training data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
