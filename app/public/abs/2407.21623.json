The THz signal is\neffectively emitted if the samples are magnetized perpendicular to the stripes\ndirection and decreases upon a 90-degree rotation of a sample. The maximal\n27-fold ratio of amplitude change is achieved for the sample with a $2 \\mu m$\nwidth of stripes. For the samples with easy magnetization axis directed\nperpendicular to stripes the THz signal is linearly polarized in the direction\nof the stripes and abruptly switches during the sample re-magnetization\nprocess. If the easy axis is along the stripes the THz source is almost\nswitched off in a zero magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
