This study proposes a\nhierarchical multistakeholder V2G coordination strategy based on safe\nmulti-agent constrained deep reinforcement learning (MCDRL) and the\nProof-of-Stake algorithm to optimize benefits for all stakeholders, including\nthe distribution system operator (DSO), electric vehicle aggregators (EVAs) and\nEV users. For DSO, the strategy addresses load fluctuations and the integration\nof renewable energy. For EVAs, energy constraints and charging costs are\nconsidered. The three critical parameters of battery conditioning, state of\ncharge (SOC), state of power (SOP), and state of health (SOH), are crucial to\nthe participation of EVs in V2G. Hierarchical multi-stakeholder V2G\ncoordination significantly enhances the integration of renewable energy,\nmitigates load fluctuations, meets the energy demands of the EVAs, and reduces\ncharging costs and battery degradation simultaneously.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
