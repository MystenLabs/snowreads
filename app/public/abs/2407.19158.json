The scattering zipper operator is the product of two\nunitary by blocks operators, multiplicatively perturbed on the left and right\nby random unitary phases. One of the operator is shifted so that this\nconfiguration produces a random 5-diagonal unitary operator per blocks. To\nprove the dynamical localization for this operator, we use the method of\nfractional moments. We first prove the continuity and strict positivity of the\nLyapunov exponents in an annulus around the unit circle, which leads to the\nexponential decay of a power of the norm of the products of transfer matrices.\nWe then establish an explicit formula of the coefficients of the finite\nresolvent in terms of the coefficients of the transfer matrices using Schur's\ncomplement. From this we deduce, through two reduction results, the exponential\ndecay of the resolvent, from which we get the dynamical localization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WTIoZcwefVFvVnb8tm5ZhywEbpjOkZQyH7LaoPl_fcM","pdfSize":"584581","objectId":"0x443120c41974d5ed5dd0988a36295be847de2d757400aacc873a9d63510f60d8","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
