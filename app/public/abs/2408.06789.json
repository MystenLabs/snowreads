Our objective is\nto maximize the users' sum rate by jointly optimizing the MAs' positions, the\ndecoding order and the power control. To solve this non-convex problem, we\nequivalently transform it into two tractable subproblems. First, we use the\nsuccessive convex approximation (SCA) to find a locally optimal solution for\nthe antenna position optimization subproblem. Next, we derive the closed-form\noptimal solution of the decoding order and power control subproblem. Numerical\nresults show that our proposed MA-enabled NOMA system can significantly enhance\nthe sum rate compared to fixed-position antenna (FPA) systems and orthogonal\nmultiple access (OMA) systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
