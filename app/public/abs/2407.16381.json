We introduce an algorithm of computing the\ncharacteristic cycle of an $\\ell$-adic GKZ hypergeometric sheaf of certain\ntype. Our strategy is to apply a formula of the characteristic cycle of the\ndirect image of an $\\ell$-adic sheaf. We verify the requirements for the\nformula to hold by calculating the dimension of the direct image of a certain\nclosed conical subset of cotangent bundle. We also define an $\\ell$-adic\nGKZ-type sheaf whose specialization tensored with a constant sheaf is\nisomorphic to an $\\ell$-adic non-confluent GKZ hypergeometric sheaf. On the\nother hand, the topological model of an $\\ell$-adic GKZ-type sheaf is\nisomorphic to the image by the de Rham functor of a non-confluent GKZ\nhypergeometric $\\mathcal{D}$-module whose characteristic cycle has been\ncalculated. This gives an easier way to determine the characteristic cycle of\nan $\\ell$-adic non-confluent GKZ hypergeometric sheaf of certain type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
