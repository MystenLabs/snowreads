For solid deforming\nmaterials, the phase lag between an oscillatory applied stress and the\nresulting strain response encapsulates information about the dynamical behavior\nof materials and attenuation. The phase lag is not directly measured and must\nbe extracted through multiple steps by carefully comparing two time-series\nsignals. The extracted value of the phase lag is highly sensitive to the\nanalysis method, and often there are no comparable values to increase\nconfidence in the calculated results. In this study, we propose a method for\nextracting the phase lag between two signals when either one or both include an\nunderlying nonlinear trend, which is very common when measuring attenuation in\ncreeping materials. We demonstrate the robustness of the method by analyzing\nartificial signals with known phases and quantifying their absolute and\nrelative errors. We apply the method to two experimental datasets and compare\nour results with those of previous studies\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
