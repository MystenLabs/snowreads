The mutual-visibility problem in a graph $G$ of\n$n$ vertices asks to find the largest set of vertices $X\\subseteq V(G)$, also\ncalled $\\mu$-set, such that for any two vertices $u,v\\in X$, there is a\nshortest $u,v$-path $P$ where all internal vertices of $P$ are not in $X$. This\nmeans that $u$ and $v$ are visible w.r.t. $X$. Variations of this problem are\nknown as total, outer, and dual mutual-visibility problems, depending on the\nvisibility property of vertices inside and/or outside $X$. The\nmutual-visibility problem and all its variations are known to be\n$\\mathsf{NP}$-complete on graphs of diameter $4$.\n  In this paper, we design a polynomial-time algorithm that finds a $\\mu$-set\nwith size $\\Omega\\left( \\sqrt{n/ \\overline{D}} \\right)$, where $\\overline D$ is\nthe average distance between any two vertices of $G$. Moreover, we show\ninapproximability results for all visibility problems on graphs of diameter $2$\nand strengthen the inapproximability ratios for graphs of diameter $3$ or\nlarger. More precisely, for graphs of diameter at least $3$ and for every\nconstant $\\varepsilon > 0$, we show that mutual-visibility and dual\nmutual-visibility problems are not approximable within a factor of\n$n^{1/3-\\varepsilon}$, while outer and total mutual-visibility problems are not\napproximable within a factor of $n^{1/2 - \\varepsilon}$, unless\n$\\mathsf{P}=\\mathsf{NP}$.\n  Furthermore we study the relationship between the mutual-visibility number\nand the general position number in which no three distinct vertices $u,v,w$ of\n$X$ belong to any shortest path of $G$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
