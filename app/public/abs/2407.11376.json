Therefore, it is important\nto understand the entanglement distribution performance of quantum repeater\nchains, especially their throughput and latency. By using Markov chains to\nmodel the stochastic dynamics in quantum repeater chains, we offer analytical\nestimations for long-run throughput and on-demand latency of continuous\nentanglement distribution. We first study single-link entanglement generation\nusing general multiheralded protocols. We then model entanglement distribution\nwith entanglement swapping over two links, using either a single- or a\ndouble-heralded entanglement generation protocol. We also demonstrate how the\ntwo-link results offer insights into the performance of general $2^k$-link\nnested repeater chains. Our results enrich the quantitative understanding of\nquantum repeater network performance, especially the dependence on system\nparameters. The analytical formulae themselves are valuable reference resources\nfor the quantum networking community. They can serve as benchmarks for quantum\nnetwork simulation validation or as examples of quantum network dynamics\nmodeling using the Markov chain formalism.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
