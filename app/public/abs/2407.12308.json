We present results on mixing and parameter\nestimation for a copula-based Markov chain model with Bernoulli($p$) marginal\ndistribution and highlight the differences between continuous and discrete\nstate-space Markov chains. We derive estimators for model parameters using the\nmaximum likelihood approach and discuss other estimators of $p$ that are\nasymptotically equivalent to its maximum likelihood estimator. The asymptotic\ndistributions of the parameter estimators are provided. A simulation study\nshowcases the performance of the different estimators of $p$. Additionally,\nstatistical tests for model parameters are included.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
