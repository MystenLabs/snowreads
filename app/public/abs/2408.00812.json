We prove these theorems are not provable in ZF (i.e. the Zermelo-Fraenkel\nset theory without the Axiom of Choice (AC)). Moreover, such theorems follow\nfrom Konig's Lemma (every infinite locally finite connected graph has a ray-a\nweak form of AC) in ZF. In ZF, we formulate new conditions for the existence of\nthe distinguishing chromatic number, the distinguishing chromatic index, the\ntotal chromatic number, the total distinguishing chromatic number, the odd\nchromatic number, and the neighbor-distinguishing index in infinite locally\nfinite connected graphs, which are equivalent to Konig's Lemma. In this\ndirection, we strengthen a recent result of Stawiski from 2023.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
