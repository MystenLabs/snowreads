Current optimization algorithms excel in solving problems with a fixed\nnumber of dimensions. However, their efficiency in searching dynamic\nmulti-dimensional spaces is unsatisfactory. In response to the challenge of\ncross-dimensional search in multi-dimensional spaces with varying numbers of\ndimensions, this study proposes a new optimization algorithm-Dynamic Dimension\nWrapping (DDW) algorithm. Firstly, by utilizing the Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)\nalgorithm and Euclidean distance, a mapping relationship between different time\nseries across dimensions is established, thus creating a fitness function\nsuitable for dimensionally dynamic multi-dimensional space. Additionally, DDW\nintroduces a novel, more efficient cross-dimensional search mechanism for\ndynamic multidimensional spaces. Finally, through comparative tests with 31\noptimization algorithms in dynamic multidimensional space search, the results\ndemonstrate that DDW exhibits outstanding search efficiency and provides search\nresults closest to the actual optimal solution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
