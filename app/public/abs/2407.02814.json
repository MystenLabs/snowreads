Current methods, which focus on modifying inputs and\nmonitoring changes in the model's output probability scores, often struggle to\ncomprehensively understand bias from the perspective of model components. We\npropose a framework that incorporates causal mediation analysis to measure and\nmap the pathways of bias generation and propagation within VLMs. This approach\nallows us to identify the direct effects of interventions on model bias and the\nindirect effects of interventions on bias mediated through different model\ncomponents. Our results show that image features are the primary contributors\nto bias, with significantly higher impacts than text features, specifically\naccounting for 32.57% and 12.63% of the bias in the MSCOCO and PASCAL-SENTENCE\ndatasets, respectively. Notably, the image encoder's contribution surpasses\nthat of the text encoder and the deep fusion encoder. Further experimentation\nconfirms that contributions from both language and vision modalities are\naligned and non-conflicting. Consequently, focusing on blurring gender\nrepresentations within the image encoder, which contributes most to the model\nbias, reduces bias efficiently by 22.03% and 9.04% in the MSCOCO and\nPASCAL-SENTENCE datasets, respectively, with minimal performance loss or\nincreased computational demands.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5v_ZKpmBNMFzQmGLRRn8ZC5IBqfI_asJlLMngYtFvnQ","pdfSize":"690304"}
