However, we may improve the generation rate from another\nperspective, which is studying an efficient entanglement swapping strategy.\nThis paper analyzes the challenges faced by existing entanglement swapping\nstrategies, including the node allocation principle, time synchronization, and\nprocessing of entanglement swapping failure. We present Parallel Segment\nEntanglement Swapping (PSES) to solve these problems. The core idea of PSES is\nto segment the path and perform parallel entanglement swapping between segments\nto improve the generation rate of long-distance entanglement. We construct a\ntree-like model as the carrier of PSES and propose heuristic algorithms called\nLayer Greedy and Segment Greedy to transform the path into a tree-like model.\nMoreover, we realize the time synchronization and design the on-demand\nretransmission mechanism to process entanglement swapping failure. The\nexperiments show that PSES performs superiorly to other entanglement swapping\nstrategies, and the on-demand retransmission mechanism can reduce the average\nentanglement swapping time by 80% and the average entanglement consumption by\n80%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
