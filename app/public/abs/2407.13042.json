Background and effective field theory techniques\nare used to include non-perturbative contributions from cubic and quartic\ninteractions. This approach is inspired by Savvidy who claims first-order\ncontributions from quartic interactions stabilize IR divergence found at\none-loop order, making possible IR finite Yang-Mills calculations. I assess the\nvalidity of this claim and discuss the implications of my findings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E0hC7dLH9XMUDA0KDHEh8sO0BTfpyVqFRXZYFUvUT08","pdfSize":"469525"}
