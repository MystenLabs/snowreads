However, astronomical observations\nrevealed the existence of exoplanets whose bulk density is far higher than what\nis expected from host-stars' composition. A commonly-invoked theory is that\nthese high-density exoplanets are the metallic cores of super-Earth-sized\nplanets whose rocky mantles were stripped by giant impacts. Here, by combining\norbital dynamics and impact physics, we show that mantle-stripping giant\nimpacts between super-Earths are unlikely to occur at rates sufficient to\nexplain the observed size and currently estimated abundance of the high-density\nexoplanets. We explain this as the interplay of two main factors: the parent\nsuper-Earths being in most cases smaller than 2 Earth radii; and the efficiency\nof mantle stripping decreasing with increasing planetary size. We conclude that\nmost of the observed high-density exoplanets are unlikely to be metal-rich\ngiant-impact remnants.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
