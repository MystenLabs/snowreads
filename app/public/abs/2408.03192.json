For a\nFeynman graph $\\Gamma$, we associate to each vertex a position $x_v \\in \\mathbb\nR$ and to each edge $e$ the combination $s_e = a_e^{-\\frac 12} \\left( x^+_e -\nx^-_e \\right)$, where $x^\\pm_e$ are the positions of the two end vertices of\n$e$ and $a_e$ a Schwinger parameter. The $``$topological propagator$\"$ $P_e =\ne^{-s_e^2}$d$s_e$ includes a part proportional to d$x_v$ and a part\nproportional to d$a_e$. Integrating the product of all $P_e$ over positions\nproduces a differential form $\\alpha_\\Gamma$ in the variables $a_e$. We prove\nthat $\\alpha_\\Gamma \\wedge \\alpha_\\Gamma=0$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
