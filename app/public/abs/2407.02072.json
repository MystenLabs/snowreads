The snapshots for the substructure\nprojection matrices are computed on the substructure level by the proper\northogonal decomposition (POD) method. The snapshots are computed using a\nrandom sampling procedure based on a parametrization of boundary conditions. To\nreduce the computational effort of the snapshot computation full-order\nsimulations of the substructures are only computed when the error of the\nreduced solution is above a threshold. In numerical examples, we show the\naccuracy and efficiency of the method for nonlinear problems involving material\nand geometric nonlinearity as well as non-matching meshes. We are able to\npredict solutions of systems that we did not compute in our snapshots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
