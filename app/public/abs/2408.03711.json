Suppose\n$\\mathcal{H}$ is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space consisting of holomorphic\nfunctions over the poly-disc $\\mathbb D^n$ and contains all the polynomials. If\n$\\pi : \\mbox{M\\\"ob} \\to \\mathcal{U}(\\mathcal{H})$ is a multiplier\nrepresentation, then we prove that there exist $\\lambda_1, \\lambda_2, \\ldots,\n\\lambda_n > 0$ such that $\\pi$ is unitarily equivalent to $(\\otimes_{i=1}^{n}\nD_{\\lambda_i}^+)|_{\\mbox{M\\\"ob}}$, where each $D_{\\lambda_i}^+$ is a\nholomorphic discrete series representation of M\\\"ob. As an application, we\nprove that if $(T_1, T_2)$ is a M\\\"ob - homogeneous pair in the Cowen - Douglas\nclass of rank $1$ over the bi-disc, then each $T_i$ posses an upper triangular\nform with respect to a decomposition of the Hilbert space. In this upper\ntriangular form of each $T_i$, the diagonal operators are identified. We also\nprove that if $\\mathcal{H}$ consists of symmetric (resp. anti-symmetric)\nholomorphic functions over $\\mathbb D^2$ and contains all the symmetric (resp.\nanti-symmetric) polynomials, then there exists $\\lambda > 0$ such that $\\pi\n\\cong \\oplus_{m = 0}^\\infty D^+_{\\lambda + 4m}$ (resp. $\\pi \\cong\n\\oplus_{m=0}^\\infty D^+_{\\lambda + 4m + 2}$).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
