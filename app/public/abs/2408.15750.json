Current methods primarily depend on\nselecting and matching feature points prone to incorrect matches, leading to\npoor performance. Consequently, relying solely on point-matching relationships\nfor pose estimation is a huge challenge. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose a Geometric Correspondence Graph neural network that integrates point\nfeatures with extra structured line segments. This integration of matched\npoints and line segments further exploits the geometry constraints and enhances\nmodel performance across different environments. We employ the Dual-Graph\nmodule and Feature Weighted Fusion Module to aggregate geometric and visual\nfeatures effectively, facilitating complex scene understanding. We demonstrate\nour approach through extensive experiments on the DeMoN and KITTI Odometry\ndatasets. The results show that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art\ntechniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
