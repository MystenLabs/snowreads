By utilizing bubble\nfunctions as a key analytical tool, our method extends to both convex and\nnon-convex elements in finite element partitions, marking a significant\nadvancement over existing stabilizer-free WG methods. It overcomes the\nrestrictive conditions of previous approaches and is applicable in any\ndimension $d$, offering substantial advantages. The proposed method maintains a\nsimple, symmetric, and positive definite structure. These benefits are\nevidenced by optimal order error estimates in both discrete $H^1$ and $L^2$\nnorms, highlighting the effectiveness and accuracy of our WG method for\npractical applications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
