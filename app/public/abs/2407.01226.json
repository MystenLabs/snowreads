The procedure is based on a Gaussian process latent force\nmodel, consisting of a white-box component (i.e., known physics) for the\nconduction and linear convection effects and a Gaussian process that acts as a\nblack-box component for the nonlinear convection effects. States are inferred\nthrough Bayesian smoothing and we obtain approximate posterior distributions\nfor the kernel covariance function's hyperparameters using Laplace's method.\nThe nonlinear convection function is recovered from the Gaussian process states\nusing a Bayesian regression model. We validate the procedure by simulation\nerror using the identified nonlinear convection function, on both data from a\nsimulated system and measurements from a physical assembly.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
