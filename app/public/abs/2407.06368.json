In this paper we solve the equations for an\neventual identity for a regular (so non-semi-simple) F-manifold and construct a\ndual coordinate system in which dual multiplication is preserved. As an\napplication, families of Nijenhuis operators are constructed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
