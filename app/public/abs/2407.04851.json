The impact\nof both lateral and longitudinal components of gravitational wind on the time\ngeodesics is discussed. The varying along-gravity effect depends on traction in\nthe presented model, whereas the cross-gravity additive is taken entirely in\nthe equations of motion, for any direction and gravity force. We obtain the\nconditions for strong convexity and the purely geometric solution to the\nproblem is given by a new Finsler metric, which belongs to the type of general\n$(\\alpha, \\beta)$-metrics. The proposed model enables us to create a direct\nlink between the Zermelo navigation problem and the slope-of-a-mountain problem\nunder the action of a cross gravitational wind. Moreover, the behavior of the\nFinslerian indicatrices and time-minimizing trajectories in relation to the\ntraction coefficient and gravitational wind force are explained and illustrated\nby a few examples in dimension two. This also compares the corresponding\nsolutions on the slippery slopes under various cross- and along-gravity\neffects, including the classical Matsumoto's slope-of-a-mountain problem and\nZermelo's navigation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
