Motivated by the observation that an\ninterface should exist between different classes where the function value is\nnon-smooth, we introduce a Laplace learning model that incorporates an\ninterface term. This model challenges the long-standing assumption that\nfunctions are smooth at all unlabeled points. In the proposed approach, we add\nan interface term to the Laplace learning model at the interface positions. We\nprovide a practical algorithm to approximate the interface positions using\nk-hop neighborhood indices, and to learn the interface term from labeled data\nwithout artificial design. Our method is efficient and effective, and we\npresent extensive experiments demonstrating that Interface Laplace learning\nachieves better performance than other recent semi-supervised learning\napproaches at extremely low label rates on the MNIST, FashionMNIST, and\nCIFAR-10 datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kAtCvJ7abnJAXbEyT0iF9j0f1smH3ShKy2PPTvV-SP8","pdfSize":"3348454"}
