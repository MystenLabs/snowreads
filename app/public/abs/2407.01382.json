At every round, each\nmember of this commission votes by pairwise comparison, and one-half of the\ncandidates is deleted from the tournament, the remaining ones proceeding to the\nnext round until the $n$-th round (the final one) in which the final winner is\ndeclared. The candidates are arranged on a board in a given order, which is\nmaintained among the remaining candidates at all rounds. A study of the size of\nthe commission is carried out in order to obtain the desired result of any\ncandidate being a possible winner. For $2^n$ candidates with $n \\geq 3$, we\nidentify a voting profile with $4n -3$ voters such that any candidate could win\njust by choosing a proper initial order of the candidates. Moreover, in the\nsetting of a random number of voters, we obtain the same results, with high\nprobability, when the expected number of voters is large.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
