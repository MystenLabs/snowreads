This article provides a taxonomy of the full breadth of the Synthetic\nData domain. We discuss its place in the research ecosystem by linking the\nadvances in computational social science with the idea of the Fourth Paradigm\nof scientific discovery that integrates the elements of the evolution from\nempirical to theoretic to computational models. Further, leveraging the\nframework of Truth, Beauty, and Justice, we discuss how evaluation criteria\nvary across use cases as the information is used to add value and draw\ninsights. Building a framework to organize different types of synthetic data,\nwe end by describing the opportunities and challenges with detailed examples of\nusing Generative AI to create synthetic quantitative and qualitative datasets\nand discuss the broader spectrum including synthetic populations, expert\nsystems, survey data replacement, and personabots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
