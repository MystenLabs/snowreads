Generalized Green functions of $G$ can be\ncomputed by using Lusztig's algorithm, if split elements exist for any\nunipotent class. The existence of split elements is reduced to the case where\n$G$ is a simply connected, almost simple group. We show, in the case of\nclassical groups, split elements exist, which is a refinement of previous\nresults. In the case of exceptional groups, we show the existence of split\nelements, possibly except one class for $G$ of type $E_7$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"94Ivjema8SG8Rbph33OzjLbBVOGo3LH2dj6xn44d6YE","pdfSize":"630116"}
