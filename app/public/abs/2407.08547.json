Due to the confinement of the quasiparticles by a\nvortex, it exhibits a circular shaped pattern of bound states with discrete\nenergy levels, as predicted by the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon theory in 1964.\nHere, however, we report a completely new type of vortex pattern which is\nnecklace-like in an iron-based superconductor KCa2Fe4As4F2. Our theoretical\nanalysis shows that this necklace-like vortex pattern arises from selective\noff-shell interference between vortex bound states of opposite angular momenta\nin the presence of rotational symmetry breaking due to disorders. This\nfascinating effect can be observed in a system with a small Fermi energy and\nwave vector, conditions fortuitously met in our samples. Our results not only\ndisclose a novel vortex structure but also provide insights into comprehending\nthe physics of the superconducting condensate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
