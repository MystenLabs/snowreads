While the effective medium theory predicts isotropic behaviour of\ntransverse magnetic (TM) waves in the structure, numerical simulations reveal\nnoticeable anisotropic properties. This anisotropy is dependent on the lattice\nrectangularity and reaches over 6% and over 75% along and across the wires\nrespectively for thick wires with the radii about 20 times smaller than the\nsmallest period. This conclusion is confirmed by line-of-current approximation\ntheory. The revealed anisotropy effect is observed when the wavelength at the\nplasma frequency is comparable to the period of the structure. The effect\nvanishes in the case of extremely thin wires. A dispersion relation for TM\nwaves in the vicinity of the $\\Gamma$-point was obtained in a closed form. This\nprovides an analytical description of the anisotropy effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
