We establish\nnecessary and sufficient conditions and find explicit solutions in some cases.\nAlso, very simple models with externalities are shown which Nash equilibrium\ncannot be replicated in a monopoly.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"szdEDux7_0ou16inBsz1PZKxad7fJ_bwUAtGwvkzz0k","pdfSize":"314132","objectId":"0xeced1ab6f47de7d90ff7654d6bc2cb8ffb369e2c23ca64c5971894941368c43c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
