We establish\nnecessary and sufficient conditions and find explicit solutions in some cases.\nAlso, very simple models with externalities are shown which Nash equilibrium\ncannot be replicated in a monopoly.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
