His main\nresult was that switching-lemma lower bounds for AC^0 lift to GC^0 with no loss\nin parameters, even though GC^0 requires exponential-size TC^0 circuits.\nInformally, GC^0 is AC^0 with unbounded-fan-in gates that behave arbitrarily\ninside a sufficiently small Hamming ball but must be constant outside it.\n  We show an analogous result for GC^0[p] (GC^0 with MODp gates) and the\npolynomial method. Specifically, we show that polynomial-method lower bounds\nfor AC^0[p] lift to GC^0[p] with no loss in parameters. As an application, we\nprove Majority requires depth-d GC^0[p] circuits of size\n$2^{\\Omega(n^{1/2(d-1)})}$, matching the state-of-the-art lower bounds for\nAC^0[p]. We also show that E^NP requires exponential-size GCC^0 circuits (the\nunion of GC^0[m] for all m), extending the result of Williams.\n  It is striking that the switching lemma, polynomial method, and algorithmic\nmethod all generalize to GC^0-related classes, with the first two methods doing\nso without any loss.\n  We also establish the strongest known unconditional separations between\nquantum and classical circuits:\n  1. There's an oracle relative to which BQP is not contained in the class of\nlanguages decidable by uniform families of size-$2^{n^{O(1)}}$ GC^0 circuits,\ngeneralizing Raz and Tal's relativized separation of BQP from the polynomial\nhierarchy.\n  2. There's a search problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but average-case\nhard for exponential-size GC^0 circuits.\n  3. There's a search problem that QNC^0/qpoly circuits can solve but\naverage-case hard for exponential-size GC^0[p] circuits.\n  4. There's an interactive problem that QNC^0 circuits can solve but\nexponential-size GC^0[p] circuits cannot.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XOdYI98dgSCQpOsmC0iNy8OSxJF6NBsAGDASJ2VnsNo","pdfSize":"638622"}
