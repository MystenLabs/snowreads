In particular we prove a number of closure results\nfor the class of groups with co-word problems in a subclass of `special' ET0L\nlanguages; that class of groups contains all groups that we know at the time of\nwriting to be co-ET0L, including all groups that were proved by Holt and\nR\\\"over to be stack groups, and hence co-indexed. It includes virtually free\ngroups, bounded automata groups, and the Higman-Thompson groups, together with\ngroups constructed from those using finitely generated subgroups, finite\nextension, free and direct products, and by taking the restricted standard\nwreath product of a co-\\E group by a finitely generated virtually free top\ngroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"tLXPRz6izYhW0KAMb53F1_kXrQQcuDrMLSI6gFEI610","pdfSize":"234421"}
