The KNRS\nconjecture asserts that for any graph $H$, locally dense graphs contain\nasymptotically at least the number of copies of $H$ found in a random graph\nwith the same edge density. We prove the following results about\n$k$-subdivisions of graphs (obtained by replacing edges with paths of length\n$k+1$): (1). If $H$ satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then its\n$(2k-1)$-subdivision satisfies Sidorenko's conjecture, extending a prior result\nof Conlon, Kim, Lee and Lee; (2). If $H$ satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then\nits $2k$-subdivision satisfies a constant-fraction version of the KNRS\nconjecture; (3). If $H$ is regular and satisfies the KNRS conjecture, then its\n$2k$-subdivision also satisfies the KNRS conjecture. These findings imply that\nall balanced subdivisions of cliques satisfy the KNRS conjecture, improving\nupon a recent result of Brada\\v{c}, Sudakov and Wigerson. Our work provides new\ninsights into this pivotal conjecture in extremal graph theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
