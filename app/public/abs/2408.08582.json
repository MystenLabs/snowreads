In this work, we demonstrate the tunneling\ncontrol between individual lattice sites patterned inside an optical\nmicrocavity. The tuning is achieved by applying a voltage to a liquid crystal\nmicrocavity possessing photonic Rashba-Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling. This\ntype of spin-orbit coupling emerges due to the high birefringence of the liquid\ncrystal material and constitutes an artificial gauge field for photons. The\nproposed technique can be combined with strong-light matter coupling and\nnon-Hermitian physics already established in liquid crystal microcavities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"DEAZGFvr8ml0mUZr6KLHHuBiWVkfvFDArEj3bTR9hFM","pdfSize":"12456838"}
