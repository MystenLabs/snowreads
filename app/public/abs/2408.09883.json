Existing approaches for NLOS sensing\nconsider the usage of either metallic mirrors, that only work under specular\nreflection, or dynamically-reconfigurable metasurfaces that steer the signal to\ncover a desired area in NLOS, with the drawback of cost and control signaling.\nThis paper proposes a novel sensing system, that allows a source to image a\ndesired region of interest (ROI) in NLOS, using the combination of a proper\nbeam sweeping (by the source) as well as a passive reflection plane configured\nas a periodic angular deflecting function (that allows illuminating the ROI).\n\\textit{Stroboscopic sensing} is obtained by sweeping over a sufficiently large\nportion of the reflection plane, the source covers the ROI \\textit{and} enhance\nthe spatial resolution of the image, thanks to multiple diverse observation\nangles of ROI. Remarkably, the proposed system achieves a near-field imaging\nwith a sequence of far-field acquisitions, thus limiting the implementation\ncomplexity. We detail the system design criteria and trade-offs, demonstrating\nthe remarkable benefits of such a stroboscopic sensing system, where a possibly\nmoving source can observe a ROI through multiple points of view as if it were\nstatic.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
