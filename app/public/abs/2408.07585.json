Here, we investigate the ME and localization properties\nof a one-dimensional (1D) NH quasiperiodic continuous system, which is\ndescribed by a Schr{\\\"o}dinger equation with an imaginary vector potential and\nan incommensurable one-site potential. We find that the ME is located in the\nreal spectrum and falls between the localized and extended states.\nAdditionally, we show that under the periodic boundary condition, the energy\nspectrum always exhibits an open curve representing high-energy extended\nelectronic states characterized by a non-zero integer winding number. This\ncomplex spectrum topology is closely connected with the non-Hermitian skin\neffect (NHSE) observed under open boundary conditions, where the eigenstates of\nthe bulk bands accumulate at the boundaries. Furthermore, we analyze the\ncritical behavior of the localization transition and obtain critical potential\namplitude accompanied by the universal critical exponent $\\nu \\simeq 1/3$. Our\nstudy provides valuable inspiration for exploring MEs and localization\nbehaviors in NH quasiperiodic continuous systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
