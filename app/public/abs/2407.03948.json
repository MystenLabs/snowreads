More precisely, in all these tests, we focus on the analysis of\nthe asymmetry of the pressure distribution at the base. Proper Orthogonal\nDecomposition (POD) is used. For all cases considered, POD analysis reveals two\ndominant modes, respectively associated with vertical and horizontal wake large\nscale reorganisation. More than 50\\% of the total energy is carried by these\ntwo modes and this value increases significantly for on-road tests. Noteworthy,\nthe low-frequency energy content of the temporal coefficients of these modes is\nsignificantly higher on-road. Low frequencies (even very low ones) then play a\nmajor role, corresponding to a quasi-static perturbation domain of the velocity\nseen by the vehicle. We show that a quasi-steady exploration of the on-road yaw\nangle statistical distribution during a wind tunnel test captures phenomena\nsimilar to those observed on the road and is therefore interesting to evaluate\non-road aerodynamic performances. This also opens perspectives for developing\nclosed loop control strategies aiming to maintain a prescribed wake balance in\norder to reduce drag experienced on the road.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
