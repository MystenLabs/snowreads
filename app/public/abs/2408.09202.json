This framework could embed delay differential equations\ninto neural networks to accommodate the diverse requirements of DDEs in terms\nof initial conditions, control equations, and known data. NDDEs adjust the\nnetwork parameters through automatic differentiation and optimization\nalgorithms to minimize the loss function, thereby obtaining numerical solutions\nto the delay differential equations without the grid dependence and polynomial\ninterpolation typical of traditional numerical methods. In addressing inverse\nproblems, the NDDE framework can utilize observational data to perform precise\nestimation of single or multiple delay parameters, which is very important in\npractical mathematical modeling. The results of multiple numerical experiments\nhave shown that NDDEs demonstrate high precision in both forward and inverse\nproblems, proving their effectiveness and promising potential in dealing with\ndelayed differential equation issues.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
