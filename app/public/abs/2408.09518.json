Among these parameters, wavelength, polarization, and\nangle are the primary ones for multiplexing in plane waves with uniform\ncross-sectional distribution. While metasurfaces have recently emerged as a\npowerful platform for optical multiplexing, they are typically restricted to\npartial parameter multiplexing and exhibit a low number of multiplexing\nchannels. In this work, we propose and experimentally demonstrate the\nfull-parameter multiplexing of polarization, wavelength, and angle, achieving\nhundreds of distinct multiplexing channels,the largest reported to date. Our\ndesign utilizes a gradient-based optimization algorithm to enable\nhigh-efficiency performance and independent functionalities with minimal\ncross-talk among channels. This approach represents a significant advancement\nin metasurface design and optical multiplexing, with potential applications in\ncomplex and dynamic optical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lynRUeseVoqedMvfkrVSbHhSFw_T8XKBu66ziEml1xg","pdfSize":"1149899"}
