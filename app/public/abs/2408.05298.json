From these equations, we can\nsummarize the temporal dynamics through a method of moments. These\ndistributions and their moments capture the stochastic nature of a system,\nwhich is essential to study infectious diseases. In this paper, we define the\nstates of the system to be the number of infected cells of a given type in the\nepithelium, the hollow organ tissue in the human body. Epithelium found in the\ncervix provides a location for viral infections to live and persist, such as\nhuman papillomavirus (HPV). HPV is a highly transmissible disease which most\ncommonly affects biological females and has the potential to progress into\ncervical cancer. By defining a master equation model which tracks the infected\ncell layer dynamics, information on disease extinction, progression, and viral\noutput can be derived from the method of moments. From this methodology and the\noutcomes we glean from it, we aim to inform differing states of HPV infected\ncells, and assess the effects of structural information for each outcome.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
