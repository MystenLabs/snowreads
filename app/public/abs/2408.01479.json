Given a finite graph $F$ with no\nisolated vertices, the generalized Ramsey achievement game of $F$ on the\ncomplete graph $K_n$, denoted by $(p,q;K_n,F,+)$, is played by two players\ncalled Alice and Bob. In each round, Alice firstly chooses $p$ uncolored edges\n$e_1,e_2,...,e_p$ and colors it blue, then Bob chooses $q$ uncolored edge\n$f_1,f_2,...,f_q$ and colors it red; the player who can first complete the\nformation of $F$ in his (or her) color is the winner. The generalized\nachievement number of $F$, denoted by ${a}(p,q;F)$ is defined to be the\nsmallest $n$ for which Alice has a winning strategy. If $p=q=1$, then it is\ndenoted by ${a}(F)$, which is the classical achievement number of $F$\nintroduced by Harary in 1982. If Alice aims to form a blue $F$, and the goal of\nBob is to try to stop him, this kind of game is called the first player game by\nBollob\\'{a}s. Let ${a}^*(F)$ be the smallest positive integer $n$ for which\nAlice has a winning strategy in the first player game.\n  A conjecture due to Harary states that the minimum value of ${a}(T)$ is\nrealized when $T$ is a path and the maximum value of ${a}(T)$ is realized when\n$T$ is a star among all trees $T$ of order $n$. He also asked which graphs $F$\nsatisfy $a^*(F)=a(F)$? In this paper, we proved that $n\\leq {a}(p,q;T)\\leq\nn+q\\left\\lfloor (n-2)/p \\right\\rfloor$ for all trees $T$ of order $n$, and\nobtained a lower bound of ${a}(p,q;K_{1,n-1})$, where $K_{1,n-1}$ is a star. We\nproved that the minimum value of ${a}(T)$ is realized when $T$ is a path which\ngives a positive solution to the first part of Harary's conjecture, and\n${a}(T)\\leq 2n-2$ for all trees of order $n$. We also proved that for $n\\geq\n3$, we have $2n-2-\\sqrt{(4n-8)\\ln (4n-4)}\\leq a(K_{1,n-1})\\leq 2n-2$ with the\nhelp of a theorem of Alon, Krivelevich, Spencer and Szab\\'o. We proved that\n$a^*(P_n)=a(P_n)$ for a path $P_n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gI_d3zjkHX94vfsY5LKgSaydzDxTAxyg1eQPRqNJS9E","pdfSize":"173101"}
