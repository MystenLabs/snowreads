In practice, however, existing scientific machine learning\napproaches have difficulty fitting complex, multi-scale dynamical systems to\nvery high precision, as required in scientific contexts. We propose using the\nnovel multistage neural network approach with a spectrum-informed\ninitialization to learn the residue from the previous stage, utilizing the\nspectral biases associated with neural networks to capture high frequency\nfeatures in the residue, and successfully tackle the spectral bias of neural\nnetworks. This approach allows the neural network to fit target functions to\ndouble floating-point machine precision $O(10^{-16})$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NMo6UZkCkB9YwxLgEi-xtZpQqVC80blBqRum9EuFDCQ","pdfSize":"7722738"}
