AI\nis expected to play a critical role in autonomous and intelligent space\nmissions, yet human experts question the reliability of AI solutions. Thus, the\n\\gls{xai} for vision-based lunar landing is studied in this paper, aiming at\nproviding transparent and understandable predictions for intelligent lunar\nlanding. Attention-based Darknet53 is proposed as the feature extraction\nstructure. For crater detection and navigation tasks, attention-based YOLOv3\nand attention-Darknet53-LSTM are presented respectively. The experimental\nresults show that the offered networks provide competitive performance on\nrelative crater detection and pose estimation during the lunar landing. The\nexplainability of the provided networks is achieved by introducing an attention\nmechanism into the network during model building. Moreover, the PCC is utilised\nto quantitively evaluate the explainability of the proposed networks, with the\nfindings showing the functions of various convolutional layers in the network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
