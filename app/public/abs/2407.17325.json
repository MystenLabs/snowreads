Leveraging a distributed framework, we address the limitations of\ncurrent Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices, which are hindered by\nlimited qubit counts and high error rates. Our approach decomposes large QAOA\nproblems into smaller subproblems, distributing them across multiple Quantum\nProcessing Units (QPUs) to enhance scalability and performance. The noise-aware\nstrategy incorporates error mitigation techniques to optimize qubit fidelity\nand gate operations, ensuring reliable quantum computations. We evaluate the\nefficacy of our framework using the HamilToniQ Benchmarking Toolkit, which\nquantifies the performance across various quantum hardware configurations. The\nresults demonstrate that our distributed QAOA framework achieves significant\nimprovements in computational speed and accuracy, showcasing its potential to\nsolve complex optimization problems efficiently in the NISQ era. This work sets\nthe stage for advanced algorithmic strategies and practical quantum system\nenhancements, contributing to the broader goal of achieving quantum advantage.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
