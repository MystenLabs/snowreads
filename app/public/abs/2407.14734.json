We employ a non-radial and non-oriented slack based\nsuper-efficiency Data Envelopment Analysis (Super-SBM-UND-VRS based DEA) model,\nwhich treats Non-Performing Loans (NPLs) as an undesired output. Our results\nshow that the relationship between super-efficiency and stock market valuation\nis stronger than that between Return on Asset (ROA) and stock market\nperformance, as measured by Tobin's Q. Notably, the Super-SBM-UND-VRS model\nyields novel results compared to other efficiency methods, such as the\nStochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) approach and traditional DEA models.\nFurthermore, our results suggest that bank evaluations benefit from decreased\nownership concentration, whereas interest rate liberalization has the opposite\neffect.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Pricing of Securities","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hTBvfpzq-8pJNHgWvT4Yl_1kkp9Tq6GQqVKiDX7xJgk","pdfSize":"1716500"}
