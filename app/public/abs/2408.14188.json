However, most discussed are the questions of using\nmaterials with known parameters and building corresponding quantum gates and\nalgorithms. In this paper we discuss opposite problem of finding Chern-Simons\nlevel $k$ in the unknown material. For this purpose, we use the previously\nderived braiding rules for Chern-Simons $SU(2)_k$ anyons. Using certain\noperations (turnarounds) on three anyons, one can measure probabilities of\nannihilation of pairs of anyons, which depend on the parameter of the theory.\nTherefore, Chern-Simons level $k$ can be found from such an experiment. It is\nimplied that anyons additionally possess certain properties which are required\nfor topological quantum computations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dVkthszsV55dRWxJfGTdYUFDBjToB3_NOw_PfVcgnJ0","pdfSize":"574726"}
