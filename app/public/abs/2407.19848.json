We present an approach for training generative models for financial\ntime series using the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) with a signature kernel.\nOur method leverages the expressive power of the signature transform to capture\nthe complex dependencies and temporal structures inherent in financial data. We\nemploy a moving average model to model the variance of the noise input,\nenhancing the model's ability to reproduce stylized facts such as volatility\nclustering. Through empirical experiments on S&P 500 index data, we demonstrate\nthat our model effectively captures key characteristics of financial time\nseries and outperforms a comparable GAN-based approach. In addition, we explore\nthe application of the synthetic data generated to train a reinforcement\nlearning agent for portfolio management, achieving promising results. Finally,\nwe propose a method to add robustness to the generative model by tweaking the\nnoise input so that the generated sequences can be adjusted to different market\nenvironments with minimal data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
