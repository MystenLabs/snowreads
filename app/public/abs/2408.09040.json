However,\ntime-consuming simulations must be run for every new set of network\nconfigurations. Learnable digital twins (LDTs), in contrast, can be trained\noffline to emulate simulation outcomes and serve as a more efficient\nalternative to simulation-based DTs at runtime. In this work, we propose\nGLANCE, a communication LDT that learns from the simulator ns-3. It can\nevaluate network key performance indicators (KPIs) and assist in network\nmanagement with exceptional efficiency. Leveraging graph learning, we exploit\nnetwork data characteristics and devise a specialized architecture to embed\nsequential and topological features of traffic flows within the network. In\naddition, multi-task learning (MTL) and transfer learning (TL) are leveraged to\nenhance GLANCE's generalizability to unseen inputs and efficacy across\ndifferent tasks. Beyond end-to-end KPI prediction, GLANCE can be deployed\nwithin an optimization framework for network management. It serves as an\nefficient or differentiable evaluator in optimizing network configurations such\nas traffic loads and flow destinations. Through numerical experiments and\nbenchmarking, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed LDT architecture,\ndemonstrate its robust generalization to various inputs, and showcase its\nefficacy in network management applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
