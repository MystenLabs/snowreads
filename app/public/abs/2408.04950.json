However, the\ndemarcation line between life and non-life appears to be less distinct than\npreviously thought. In a study of amplifying spin waves, we observe a\nphenomenon reminiscent of life: The atomic spin wave stored in atomic vapor has\na capability of absorbing energy from an external light source, and exhibits\nbehaviors akin to active regeneration. We demonstrate that this regeneration\nsignificantly enhances the lifetime and retrieval efficiency of the spin wave,\nwhile concurrently the noise is effectively suppressed. Our results suggest\nthat the regeneration mechanism holds promise for mitigating the pronounced\ndecoherence typically encountered in spin waves carried by room-temperature\nmedia, therefore offering potential applications in the realms of quantum\ninformation and precision measurements at ambient conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6Z9h78t2l7jW3LDJ3KKIBuuGhZ6Qcx71cAA9fF-gP9Y","pdfSize":"1980813"}
