Within the framework of Besov spaces, by\nintroducing several new unknown quantities and exploiting the intrinsic\nstructure of the system, we prove the global well-posedness of strong solutions\nfor initial data close to a constant equilibrium state. Furthermore, under some\nsuitable additional conditions involving only the low-frequency part of the\ninitial perturbation, we develop a Lyapunov-type energy argument, which yields\nthe optimal time-decay rates of the global solution. To the best of our\nknowledge, our result is the first one on global solvability to the full\ncompressible, viscous, non-resistive MHD system in multi-dimensional whole\nspace.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
