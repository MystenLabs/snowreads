In this\narticle, we give an in-depth observation of our system of self-paced reading\nfor annotation of humor, that collects readers' annotations while they open a\ntext word by word. The system registers keys that readers press to open the\nnext word, choose a class (humorous versus non-humorous texts), change their\nchoice. We also touch upon our psycho-linguistic experiment conducted with the\nsystem and the data collected during it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
