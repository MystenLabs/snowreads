We\ndeduce that $\\text{T}(A)$ is a Poulsen simplex whenever $A_1$ and $A_2$ have no\n$1$-dimensional representations, e.g., if $A_1$ and $A_2$ are finite\ndimensional with no $1$-dimensional direct summands. Additionally, we\ncharacterize when the space of traces of a free product of two countable groups\nis a Poulsen simplex. Our main technical contribution is a new perturbation\nresult for pairs of von Neumann subalgebras $(M_1,M_2)$ of a tracial von\nNeumann algebra $M$ which gives necessary conditions ensuring that $M_1$ and a\nsmall unitary perturbation of $M_2$ generate a II$_1$ factor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
