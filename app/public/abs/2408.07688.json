Gangbo, S. Mayorga and A. {\\'{S}}wi{\\k{e}}ch,\n\\textit{SIAM J. Math. Anal.} 53 (2021), no. 2, 1320--1356] and [S. Mayorga and\nA. {\\'{S}}wi{\\k{e}}ch, \\textit{SIAM J. Control Optim.} 61 (2023), no. 2,\n820--851]. First, we extend the following results of the previously mentioned\nworks to the case of multiplicative noise: (i) We generalize the convergence of\nthe value functions $u_n$ corresponding to control problems of $n$ particles to\nthe value function $V$ corresponding to an appropriately defined infinite\ndimensional control problem; (ii) we prove, under certain additional\nassumptions, $C^{1,1}$ regularity of $V$ in the spatial variable. The second\nmain contribution of the present work is the proof that if $DV$ is continuous\n(which, in particular, includes the previously proven case of $C^{1,1}$\nregularity in the spatial variable), the value function $V$ projects precisely\nonto the value functions $u_n$. Using this projection property, we show that\noptimal controls of the finite dimensional problem correspond to optimal\ncontrols of the infinite dimensional problem and vice versa. In the case of a\nlinear state equation, we are able to prove that $V$ projects precisely onto\nthe value functions $u_n$ under relaxed assumptions on the coefficients of the\ncost functional by using approximation techniques in the Wasserstein space,\nthus covering cases where $V$ may not be differentiable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
