Conditions making truncated stop loss\ncontracts optimal are derived, and it is argued that those are usually\nsatisfied in practice. One of the prerequisites is that reinsurance is not too\ncheap, and an argument resembling arbitrage suggests that it is not.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
