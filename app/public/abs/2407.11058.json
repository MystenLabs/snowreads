By considering the changes in the cosmological constant and\nNewton's constant, the gravitational thermodynamics of AdS black holes can be\nextended. This corresponds to including the central charge $C$ and its chemical\npotential $\\mu$ to the conventional pairs of temperature vs. entropy $(T, S)$,\nelectric potential vs. charge $(\\tilde{\\Phi},\\tilde{Q})$, and field theory\npressure vs. volume $(p,\\mathcal{V})$ as a new pair of conjugate thermodynamic\nvariables in the dual CFT. Here we have dived further and taken a dyonic\nsystem. So the conventional pairs for potential and charges become electric\npotential and charge $(\\tilde{\\Phi}_e,\\tilde{Q}_e)$ and magnetic potential and\ncharge $(\\tilde{\\Phi}_m, \\tilde{Q}_m)$. In all the 16 ensembles that we\nexamined, we found that only some have interesting phase behavior. For\nensembles $(\\tilde{\\Phi}_e, \\tilde{Q}_m \\mathcal{V}, C )$, $(\\tilde{\\Phi}_m,\n\\tilde{Q}_e \\mathcal{V}, C )$ and $(\\tilde{Q}_e, \\tilde{Q}_m \\mathcal{V}, C )$\nwe notice a first and second order phase transition. For the ensemble\n$(\\tilde{\\Phi}_e, \\tilde{\\Phi}_m \\mathcal{V}, C )$ we see a confined/deconfined\nphase transition. At a temperature that depends on $\\mu$, we discover a\nzeroth-order phase transition between a high- and low-entropy phase in the\nfixed $(\\tilde{\\Phi}_e, \\tilde{Q}_m \\mathcal{V}, \\mu )$, $(\\tilde{\\Phi}_m,\n\\tilde{Q}_e \\mathcal{V}, \\mu )$, $(\\tilde{Q}_e, \\tilde{Q}_m \\mathcal{V}, \\mu\n)$. Since in our study of the parametric plots, the fixed eight $p$ ensembles\nexhibit no critical behavior, or $p-\\mathcal{V}$ criticality, the CFT state\ndual to a classical charged black hole cannot be a Van der Waals fluid.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UkL1z5bGBL0lGy81fUW2hKhIiH_6juJno9aED4fRKss","pdfSize":"1674763"}
