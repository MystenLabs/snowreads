When the extremal limit does not\npreserve any supersymmetry, the density of states goes to zero at extremality\nand no extremal black holes remain. However, when the extremal limit is\nsupersymmetric, a large microscopic degeneracy survives and there is a gap to\nthe first excited black hole visible from gravity. In this article we study\nlarge $N$ quantum mechanical models where supersymmetry is explicitly broken,\nallowing us to interpolate between these two qualitatively different pictures.\nWe propose and analyze deformations of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYK models with such a\npattern of (super)symmetry breaking which violates the $U(1)$ $R$-symmetry.\nThese models feature a lifting of the BPS degeneracy and a closing of the\nspectral gap, and we further show that the large $N$ soft effective action is\ngiven by a modification of the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ Schwarzian theory in which the\n$U(1)_R$ mode becomes massive.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BDDiPZxUrtZpOB8JHbi9DXBF_Q5K4Z95JfSXOd2NnoY","pdfSize":"1534396"}
