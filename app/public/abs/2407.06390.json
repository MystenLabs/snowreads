Furthermore,\nexisting approaches struggle to handle multi-step ahead prediction tasks, where\nuncertainty estimates across multiple future time points are crucial. We\npropose JANET (Joint Adaptive predictioN-region Estimation for Time-series), a\nnovel framework for constructing conformal prediction regions that are valid\nfor both univariate and multivariate time series. JANET generalises the\ninductive conformal framework and efficiently produces joint prediction regions\nwith controlled K-familywise error rates, enabling flexible adaptation to\nspecific application needs. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates JANET's\nsuperior performance in multi-step prediction tasks across diverse time series\ndatasets, highlighting its potential for reliable and interpretable uncertainty\nquantification in sequential data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
