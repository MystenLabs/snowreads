We obtain a Llarull type scalar curvature rigidity\nfor a general class of domains in a warped product. Also, we are able to\naddress Gromov dihedral rigidity in hyperbolic space assuming matching angles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
