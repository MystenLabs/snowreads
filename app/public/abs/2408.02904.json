The first stage employs image\nprocessing techniques to reliably localize license plates, while the second\nstage utilizes a custom-designed deep learning model for robust Arabic\ncharacter recognition. The proposed system achieves a remarkable 99.3% accuracy\non a diverse dataset, surpassing existing approaches. Its potential\napplications extend to intelligent traffic management, including traffic\nviolation detection and parking optimization. Future research will focus on\nenhancing the system's capabilities through architectural refinements, expanded\ndatasets, and addressing system dependencies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
