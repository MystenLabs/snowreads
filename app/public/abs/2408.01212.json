We focus on a\nsingle $\\omega$-regular objective expressed as parity that must be surely met\nwhile satisfying $n$ reachability objectives towards sink states with some\nprobability thresholds too. We consider three variants of the problem: (a)\nstrict and (b) non-strict thresholds on all reachability objectives, and (c)\nmaximizing the thresholds with respect to a lexicographic order. We show that\n(a) and (c) can be reduced to solving parity games, and (b) can be solved in\n$\\sf{EXPTIME}$. Strategy complexities as well as algorithms are provided for\nall cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LkpfkFQ_-L1N-QJ9IhANjtEr1aYP4W2Mdpt9FbINxa4","pdfSize":"436189"}
