We define\n$p$-adic tame Tate twists in the tame topology and prove some first properties.\nWe establish a framework analogous to the Beilinson-Lichtenbaum conjectures in\nthe tame topology for $p$-adic tame Tate twists and tame logarithmic\ndeRham-Witt sheaves. Both only differ from their \\'etale counterpart in\ncohomological degrees above the weight. These cohomology groups can be analysed\nusing the Gersten conjecture which, at least conjecturally, has a nice shape in\nthe tame topology. We prove the Gersten conjecture for tame logarithmic\ndeRham-Witt sheaves for curves in positive characteristic and note that the\nconjecture in arbitrary dimension would follow from strict\n$\\mathbb{A}^1$-invariance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
