However, these methods encounter challenges with non-rigid\nedits, which involve altering the image's layout or structure. Our\ncomprehensive analysis reveals that the high-frequency components of DDIM\nlatent, crucial for retaining the original image's key features and layout,\nsignificantly contribute to these limitations. Addressing this, we introduce\nFlexiEdit, which enhances fidelity to input text prompts by refining DDIM\nlatent, by reducing high-frequency components in targeted editing areas.\nFlexiEdit comprises two key components: (1) Latent Refinement, which modifies\nDDIM latent to better accommodate layout adjustments, and (2) Edit Fidelity\nEnhancement via Re-inversion, aimed at ensuring the edits more accurately\nreflect the input text prompts. Our approach represents notable progress in\nimage editing, particularly in performing complex non-rigid edits, showcasing\nits enhanced capability through comparative experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
