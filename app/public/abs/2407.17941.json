The Shapes\nConstraint Language (SHACL) is a W3C standard which specifies ways to validate\ndata in RDF graphs, by defining constraining shapes. However, even though the\nmain purpose of SHACL is validation of existing RDF data, in order to solve the\nproblem with the lack of available RDF datasets in multiple RDF-based\napplication development processes, we envisioned and implemented a reverse role\nfor SHACL: we use SHACL shape definitions as a starting point to generate\nsynthetic data for an RDF graph. The generation process involves extracting the\nconstraints from the SHACL shapes, converting the specified constraints into\nrules, and then generating artificial data for a predefined number of RDF\nentities, based on these rules. The purpose of RDFGraphGen is the generation of\nsmall, medium or large RDF knowledge graphs for the purpose of benchmarking,\ntesting, quality control, training and other similar purposes for applications\nfrom the RDF, Linked Data and Semantic Web domain. RDFGraphGen is open-source\nand is available as a ready-to-use Python package.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
