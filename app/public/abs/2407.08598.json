Our rules encompass\nboth flavour- and particle-antiparticle coherence and allow writing down the\nscattering matrix elements and collision integrals with the same intuitive ease\nas with the usual non-coherent Feynman rules. Our results are useful for\ncomputing collision rates that arise routinely in the context of coherently\nmixing neutrinos with arbitrary masses. We give several explicit examples,\nincluding some collision integrals for coherently mixing neutrinos in\nsupernovae.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
