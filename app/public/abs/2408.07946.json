Over the last 55 years, Singapore has become an established\npurchaser of U.S. defense technology, but the past 20 years have also seen the\nU.S.-Singapore relationship mature into an increasingly collaborative one,\ntackling newer fields like cybersecurity and biosecurity. However, current\ngeopolitical tensions present a challenge for Singapore, which strives to\nretain its strategic autonomy by maintaining positive relations with all\nparties. Paradoxically, the rise of non-traditional security threats may pave\nthe way for greater bilateral cooperation by allowing Singapore to position\nitself as a hub for cooperation on regional security issues in Southeast Asia\nat large. In such spirit, this paper recommends that the United States and\nSingapore do the following: 1) in defense technology, co-develop niche\ncapabilities in C4ISR and unmanned systems with peacetime applications; 2) in\ncybersecurity, improve their domestic resilience against sophisticated\nnation-state actors while also building regional capacity to counter cybercrime\nin Southeast Asia; and 3) in biosecurity, strengthen regional epidemiological\nsurveillance to brace against possible future pandemics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
