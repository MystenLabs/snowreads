However, previous qualitative analyses of the composite spectrum\nhave led to a wide discussion about whether the secondary is an Of or a\nWolf-Rayet star. We use new observations and our novel QER20 package to\ndisentangle for the first time the spectra of the two stellar components and\nobtain artefact free reconstructed spectra, yielding the more accurate and\nreliable spectral classifications of O7.5 V((f))z for the primary and O6 Iaf\nfor the secondary. The emission features of the P-Cygni profiles of the\nH\\b{eta} and He I 5876 {\\AA} lines, present in the reconstructed spectrum of\nthe secondary, show that this star is at an initial phase of its transition to\nthe WN evolutionary stage. A previously unobserved variable emission, composed\nof at least four independent features, is seen since 2014 superposed to the\nH{\\gamma} absorption line. Our analysis reveals that these emission features\noriginate from a physically extended region. This could be explained by an\nepisode of enhanced mass-loss in the scenario of a non conservative evolution\nof the binary.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
