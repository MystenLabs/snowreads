The HODSM phase exhibits hinge Fermi arcs\n(FAs) with a quantized higher-order topological invariant. Conversely, the\nHOWSM phase is a hybrid-order topological phase manifesting both surface and\nhinge FAs as a signature of first- and second-order topology and also possesses\nboth first- and second-order topological invariants. In this work, we\ninvestigate a tight binding model for multi-HODSM (mHODSM) hosting multiple\nhinge FAs having a quantized quadrupolar winding number (QWN) greater than one.\nFurthermore, we obtain a multi-HOWSM (mHOWSM) phase from the mHODSM by applying\nan external magnetic field. The mHOWSM phase possesses both the Chern number\nand the QWN, featuring both surface and multiple hinge FAs. We study the\nspectral properties of the mHODSM and mHOWSM in different geometries. We also\ninvestigate the hinge FA-mediated transport in mHOWSM employing a two-terminal\nsetup.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
