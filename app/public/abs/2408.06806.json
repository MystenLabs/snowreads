Thus, AIFR research\nefforts have often under-represented/misrepresented the African ethnicity with\nnon-indigenous Africans. This work developed an AIFR system for indigenous\nAfrican faces to reduce the misrepresentation of African ethnicity in facial\nimage analysis research. We adopted a pre-trained deep learning model (VGGFace)\nfor AIFR on a dataset of 5,000 indigenous African faces (FAGE\\_v2) collected\nfor this study. FAGE\\_v2 was curated via Internet image searches of 500\nindividuals evenly distributed across 10 African countries. VGGFace was trained\non FAGE\\_v2 to obtain the best accuracy of 81.80\\%. We also performed\nexperiments on an African-American subset of the CACD dataset and obtained the\nbest accuracy of 91.5\\%. The results show a significant difference in the\nrecognition accuracies of indigenous versus non-indigenous Africans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
