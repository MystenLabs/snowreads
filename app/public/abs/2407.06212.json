This\nis a classification problem that combines elements of natural language\nprocessing and rare event detection. Because online platforms are rare,\naccurately identifying them with Machine Learning algorithms is challenging.\nHere, we describe the development of a Machine Learning-based text\nclassification approach that reduces the number of false positives as much as\npossible. It greatly reduces the bias in the estimates obtained by using\ncalibrated probabilities and ensembles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lnd3E1hf5CKVyUcv0n92DoVVMjqdB-2S4-o9FUK6gzE","pdfSize":"129463"}
