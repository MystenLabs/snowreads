Under the additional hypothesis that\nall members are irreducible, we prove that there exists a unique non-isotrivial\npencil with these properties up to projective transformation. We compare our\nconstruction with the classical approaches given by Gattazzo, Beauville and\nMiranda-Persson.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
