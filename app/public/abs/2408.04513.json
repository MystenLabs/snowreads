Here, the key point is to\npreserve the solenoidality constraint while simultaneously keeping the\nunderlying $\\mathrm{L}^{1}$-boundedness. While previous results as in Kato et\nal. [Extension and representation of divergence-free vector fields on bounded\ndomains, Math. Res. Lett., 2000] for $\\mathrm{L}^{p}$-based function spaces,\n$1<p<\\infty$, rely on PDE approaches, basic principles from harmonic analysis\nrule out such strategies in the $\\mathrm{L}^{1}$-context. By means of a novel\nmethod adapted to the divergence-free constraint via differential forms, we\nestablish the existence of such extension operators in the\n$\\mathrm{L}^{1}$-based situation. This applies both to the case of convex\ndomains, where a global extensions can be achieved, as well as to the Lipschitz\ncase, where a local extension can be achieved. Being applicable to $1<p<\\infty$\ntoo, our method provides a unifying approach to the cases $p\\in\\{1,\\infty\\}$\nand $1<p<\\infty$. Specifically, covering the exponents $p\\in\\{1,\\infty\\}$, this\nanswers a borderline case left open by Kato et al. [Extension and\nrepresentation of divergence-free vector fields on bounded domains, Math. Res.\nLett., 2000] in the affirmative. By use of explicit examples, the assumptions\non the underlying domains are shown to be almost optimal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
