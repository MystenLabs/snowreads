Hence, it is crucial to evaluate the impact of treatments in\nterms of both curing the disease and prolonging survival. We may use a Cox\nproportional hazards (PH) cure model to achieve this. However, a significant\nchallenge in applying such a model is the potential presence of partially\nobserved covariates in the data. We aim to refine the methods for imputing\npartially observed covariates based on multiple imputation and fully\nconditional specification (FCS) approaches. To be more specific, we consider a\nmore general case, where different covariate vectors are used to model the cure\nprobability and the survival of patients who are not cured. We also propose an\napproximation of the exact conditional distribution using a regression\napproach, which helps draw imputed values at a lower computational cost. To\nassess its effectiveness, we compare the proposed approach with a complete case\nanalysis and an analysis without any missing covariates. We discuss the\napplication of these techniques to a real-world dataset from the BO06 clinical\ntrial on osteosarcoma.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q9ZaFc6AETHHRJQNa_BTIhmEeb1fVdyWHC5KbgAhlyQ","pdfSize":"914526"}
