We present a\nfundamental analysis of adjacency access locality in vertex ordering from the\nperspective of graph composition of, or decomposition into, elementary compact\ngraphs. We introduce an algebraic indexing approach that maintains the\nadvantageous features of existing methods, mitigates their shortcomings, and\nadapts to the degree distribution. The new method demonstrates superior and\nversatile performance in graph compression across diverse types of graphs. It\nalso renders proportional improvement in the efficiency of matrix-vector\nmultiplications for subspace iterations in response to random walk queries on a\nlarge network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
