We aim to pioneer the establishment of the stochastic maximum\nprinciple (SMP) and the derivation of the backward SDE (BSDE) from the\nperspective of the constrained optimization using the method of Lagrangian\nmultipliers. To this end, we first propose to embed the constrained extended\nmean-field control (C-MFC) problems into some abstract optimization problems\nwith constraints on Banach spaces, for which we develop the generalized\nFritz-John (FJ) optimality conditions. We then prove the stochastic maximum\nprinciple (SMP) for C-MFC problems by transforming the FJ type conditions into\nan equivalent stochastic first-order condition associated with a general type\nof constrained forward-backward SDEs (FBSDEs). Contrary to the existing\nliterature, we treat the controlled Mckean-Vlasov SDE as an\ninfinite-dimensional equality constraint such that the BSDE induced by the FJ\nfirst-order optimality condition can be interpreted as the generalized Lagrange\nmultiplier to cope with the SDE constraint. Finally, we also present the SMP\nfor stochastic control problems and mean field game problems under similar\ntypes of constraints as consequences of our main result for C-MFC problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
