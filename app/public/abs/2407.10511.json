Okutsu sequences of $\\theta$ have been defined\nonly when the extension $K(\\theta)/K$ is defectless. In this paper, we extend\nthis concept to arbitrary $\\theta\\in\\overline{K}$ and we show that these\nobjects are essentially equivalent to Okutsu frames of $F$ and to Mac\nLane-Vaqui\\'e chains of the natural valuation on $K[x]$ induced by $\\theta$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"n5hK5SmEz2_Z0rP3sgIMYE9sKN3a9MXlA75VKbVJ1vE","pdfSize":"280404"}
