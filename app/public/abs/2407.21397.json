Aiming to interpret present $|G_E/G_M|$ data on\nhyperons of the baryon octet, as well as to predict future data, we present\nmodel calculations of that ratio for large invariant 4-momentum square $q^2$ in\nthe timelike region ($q^2>0$). Without any further parameter fitting, we extend\nto the timelike region a covariant quark model previously developed to describe\nthe kinematic spacelike region ($q^2 \\le 0$) of the baryon octet form factors.\nThe model takes into account both the effects of valence quarks and the\nexcitations of the meson cloud which dresses the baryons. We report here that\nour results are in good agreement with very recent data from BESIII, within the\nuncertainty limits of our model. We also make new predictions which may be\ntested in the near future, when the range of the present measurements is\nexpanded to the 20--50 GeV$^2$ region.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
