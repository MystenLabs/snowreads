We\nintroduce the notion of rigid graphs and define a class of II$_1$-factors named\n$\\mathcal{C}_{\\rm Rigid}$. For von Neumann algebras in this class we show a\nunique rigid graph product decomposition. In particular, we obtain unique prime\nfactorization results and unique free product decomposition results for new\nclasses of von Neumann algebras. We also prove several technical results\nconcerning relative amenability and embeddings of (quasi)-normalizers in graph\nproducts. Furthermore, we give sufficient conditions for a graph product to be\nnuclear and characterize strong solidity, primeness and free-indecomposability\nfor graph products.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
