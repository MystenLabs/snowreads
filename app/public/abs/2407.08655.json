However, the\nsparsity of good-quality annotations of such images makes the task of vessel\nsegmentation challenging. Deep learning offers an efficient way to segment\nvessels of different sizes by learning their high-level feature representations\nand the spatial continuity of such features across dimensions. Semi-supervised\npatch-based approaches have been effective in identifying small vessels of one\nto two voxels in diameter. This study focuses on improving the segmentation\nquality by considering the spatial correlation of the features using the\nMaximum Intensity Projection~(MIP) as an additional loss criterion. Two methods\nare proposed with the incorporation of MIPs of label segmentation on the\nsingle~(z-axis) and multiple perceivable axes of the 3D volume. The proposed\nMIP-based methods produce segmentations with improved vessel continuity, which\nis evident in visual examinations of ROIs. Patch-based training is improved by\nintroducing an additional loss term, MIP loss, to penalise the predicted\ndiscontinuity of vessels. A training set of 14 volumes is selected from the\nStudyForrest dataset comprising of 18 7-Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight~(ToF) Magnetic\nResonance Angiography (MRA) images. The generalisation performance of the\nmethod is evaluated using the other unseen volumes in the dataset. It is\nobserved that the proposed method with multi-axes MIP loss produces better\nquality segmentations with a median Dice of $80.245 \\pm 0.129$. Also, the\nmethod with single-axis MIP loss produces segmentations with a median Dice of\n$79.749 \\pm 0.109$. Furthermore, a visual comparison of the ROIs in the\npredicted segmentation reveals a significant improvement in the continuity of\nthe vessels when MIP loss is incorporated into training.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
