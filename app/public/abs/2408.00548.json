In this work, we\npropose a distinctive mechanism to realize FFLO states by creating an imbalance\nin the quantum geometry of paired electrons on an isolated flat band, which we\nterm \"Quantum Geometry Discrepancy (QGD)\". Based on a flat-band electronic\nHamiltonian with continuously tunable quantum metrics for each spin species, we\nanalytically investigate the QGD-induced FFLO instability near the\nsuperconducting critical temperature through the band-projection method. To\nobtain the phase diagram of the BCS-FFLO transition driven by QGD, we perform\nnumerical calculations using self-consistent mean-field theory, which aligns\nwell with the analytical results. Additionally, we discuss the stability of the\nflat-band FFLO state when a finite band dispersion is turned on. We point out\nthat QGD serves as a new protocol for stabilizing the FFLO states in flat-band\nsuperconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
