Our approach has a\ngeometrical flavor and equivalently reformulates the sharp constant in the\nlimit case $p=1$ as the Cheeger constant for the fractional perimeter and the\nLebesgue measure with a suitable weight. As a by-product, we obtain new lower\nbounds on the sharp constant in the $1$-dimensional case, even for non-convex\nsets, some of which optimal in the case $p=1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
