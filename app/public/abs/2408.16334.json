Our study investigates the\nproduction of gauge bosons and GW emission from cosmic string decay,\nconsidering the constraints imposed by cosmological observations. We\nspecifically examine how gauge bosons radiated from strings contribute to DM\nand dark radiation, with limits set by the observed DM abundance and cosmic\nmicrowave background data, respectively. Additionally, we analyze the\ngravitational wave spectrum of this model across both low and high frequencies.\nNotably, the spectrum typically follows a $f^{-1/3}$ pattern at high\nfrequencies, beyond the pivot frequency $f_*$. We derive an analytical\nexpression for the frequency $f_*$ and confirm its accuracy through numerical\nverification. Furthermore, we compare the GW spectrum of this model with the\nforecasted capabilities of future GW observatories, such as the Einstein\nTelescope, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna, the Big Bang Observer, and\n$\\mu$Ares. Finally, we discuss how these considerations impact the model\nparameters, specifically the gauge boson mass and the energy scale of U(1)\nsymmetry breaking, providing insights into how cosmic strings could enhance our\nunderstanding of DM and GW astronomy.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
