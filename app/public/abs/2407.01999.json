Each\nindividual dies at rate 1 and is replaced by a random individual chosen with\nprobability proportional to its fitness. We show that when $\\mu_N \\ll 1/(N \\log\nN)$ and $N^{-\\eta} \\ll s_N \\ll 1$ for some $\\eta < 1$, large numbers of\nbeneficial mutations are present in the population at the same time, competing\nagainst each other, yet the fixation times of beneficial mutations, after a\ntime scaling, converge to the times of a Poisson process.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
