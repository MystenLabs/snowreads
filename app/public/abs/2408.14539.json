To be ready for this, it is\nimportant to share knowledge of quantum computing in application domains where\nit is not yet represented. One such application is the verification of\nclassical circuits, specifically, equivalence checking. Although this problem\nhas been investigated over decades in an effort to overcome the verification\ngap, how it can potentially be solved using quantum computing has hardly been\ninvestigated yet. In this work, we address this question by considering a\npresumably straightforward approach: Using Grover's algorithm. However, we also\nshow that, although this might be an obvious choice, there are several pitfalls\nto avoid in order to get meaningful results. This leads to the proposal of a\nworking concept of a quantum computing methodology for equivalent checking\nproviding the foundation for corresponding solutions in the (near) future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
