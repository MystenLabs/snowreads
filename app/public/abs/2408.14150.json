Subsequently, we provide an easy proof of theorem 1 in\nMangasarian (1979), based on a lemma that may be of some significance by\nitself. As a result of our lemma, we are able to show that a necessary and\nsufficient condition for a solution for a linear programming problem to be its\nunique solution, is that a system of linear inequalities has a solution whose\nlast coordinate is non-negative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
