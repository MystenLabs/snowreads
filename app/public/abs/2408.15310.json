However, the existing silico\nDDI prediction methods either ignore the potential interactions among drug-drug\npairs (DDPs), or fail to explicitly model and fuse the multi-scale drug feature\nrepresentations for better prediction. In this study, we propose RGDA-DDI, a\nresidual graph attention network (residual-GAT) and dual-attention based\nframework for drug-drug interaction prediction. A residual-GAT module is\nintroduced to simultaneously learn multi-scale feature representations from\ndrugs and DDPs. In addition, a dual-attention based feature fusion block is\nconstructed to learn local joint interaction representations. A series of\nevaluation metrics demonstrate that the RGDA-DDI significantly improved DDI\nprediction performance on two public benchmark datasets, which provides a new\ninsight into drug development.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
