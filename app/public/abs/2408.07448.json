This has also aggravated the spread of misinformation and\ndisinformation. This has potentially serious consequences, such as civil\nunrest. While fact-checking aims to combat this, manual fact-checking is\ncumbersome and not scalable. While automated fact-checking approaches exist,\nthey do not operate in real-time and do not always account for spread of\nmisinformation through different modalities. This is particularly important as\nproactive fact-checking on live streams in real-time can help people be\ninformed of false narratives and prevent catastrophic consequences that may\ncause civil unrest. This is particularly relevant with the rapid dissemination\nof information through video on social media platforms or other streams like\npolitical rallies and debates. Hence, in this work we develop a platform named\nLiveFC, that can aid in fact-checking live audio streams in real-time. LiveFC\nhas a user-friendly interface that displays the claims detected along with\ntheir veracity and evidence for live streams with associated speakers for\nclaims from respective segments. The app can be accessed at\nhttp://livefc.factiverse.ai and a screen recording of the demo can be found at\nhttps://bit.ly/3WVAoIw.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
