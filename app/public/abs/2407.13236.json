If $g$ is H\\\"older-continuous, we show that $\\nabla v$ is\nlocally H\\\"older-continuous. As an application, we specialize to the case $p=n$\nand we prove that any continuous solution to $|\\Delta_{g,n}u|\\lesssim |\\nabla\nu|^n_g$ satisfies additional regularity properties depending on the regularity\nof $g$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
