Previous works exploring\nFunctions-as-a-Service providers have focused primarily on the most well known\nproviders AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions and Microsoft Azure Functions\nwithout exploring other providers in similar detail. In this work, we conduct\nthe first detailed review of ten currently publicly available FaaS platforms\nexploring everything from their history, to their features and pricing to where\nthey sit within the overall public FaaS landscape, before making a number of\nobservations as to the state of the FaaS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
