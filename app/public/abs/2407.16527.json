{"id":"2407.16527","title":"The Negative Drift of a Limit Order Fill","authors":"Timothy DeLise","authorsParsed":[["DeLise","Timothy",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 14:39:42 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-24","timestamp":1721745582000,"abstract":"  Market making refers to a form of trading in financial markets characterized\nby passive orders which add liquidity to limit order books. Market makers are\nimportant for the proper functioning of financial markets worldwide. Given the\nimportance, financial mathematics has endeavored to derive optimal strategies\nfor placing limit orders in this context. This paper identifies a key\ndiscrepancy between popular model assumptions and the realities of real\nmarkets, specifically regarding the dynamics around limit order fills.\nTraditionally, market making models rely on an assumption of low-cost random\nfills, when in reality we observe a high-cost non-random fill behavior. Namely,\nlimit order fills are caused by and coincide with adverse price movements,\nwhich create a drag on the market maker's profit and loss. We refer to this\nphenomenon as \"the negative drift\" associated with limit order fills. We\ndescribe a discrete market model and prove theoretically that the negative\ndrift exists. We also provide a detailed empirical simulation using one of the\nmost traded financial instruments in the world, the 10 Year US Treasury Bond\nfutures, which also confirms its existence. To our knowledge, this is the first\npaper to describe and prove this phenomenon in such detail.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
