Utilizing Hartree-Fock (HF) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we\nuncover that the magnetic solutions of this model feature Dirac points in their\nspectrum. HF predicts a gap opening at a critical interaction strength, a\nresult corroborated by DMFT calculations at zero temperature. However, at\nfinite temperature and high interaction strengths, Dirac points re-emerge at\nhigh energies in the spectral function, even if they are absent in the\nnon-interacting and HF-predicted band structures. Analytical arguments reveal\nthat this phenomenon arises near Mott insulating solutions from the frequency\ndependence of the self-energy, a behavior not captured by static mean-field\ntheory. We also propose perturbations to the model that can induce a\ntopological gap in the spectrum, leading to a transition from topologically\ntrivial to non-trivial states by varying doping, interaction strength, and\ntemperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
