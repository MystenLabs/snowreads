As essential components of AI accelerators, they\nsignificantly influence the area and performance of compute-intensive circuits.\nThis paper presents UFO-MAC, a unified framework for the optimization of\nmultipliers and MACs. Specifically, UFO-MAC employs an optimal compressor tree\nstructure and utilizes integer linear programming (ILP) to refine the stage\nassignment and interconnection of the compressors. Additionally, it explicitly\nexploits the non-uniform arrival time profile of the carry propagate adder\n(CPA) within multipliers to achieve targeted optimization. Moreover, the\nframework also supports the optimization of fused MAC architectures.\nExperimental results demonstrate that multipliers and MACs optimized by UFO-MAC\nPareto-dominate state-of-the-art baselines and commercial IP libraries. The\nperformance gain of UFO-MAC is further validated through the implementation of\nmultipliers and MACs within functional modules, underlining its efficacy in\nreal scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
