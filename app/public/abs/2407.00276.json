A Kronecker-type\nset K is a subset of this group on which every continuous function into the\ncomplex unit circle equals the restriction, to K, of a character in the group's\nPontryagin dual. Ackelsberg proves that if, for all q > 1, there exists a\nperfect Kronecker-type set generating a dense subgroup, then there exist large\nrigidity sequences for weak mixing systems of actions by countable discrete\nabelian groups. Ackelsberg shows the existence of such sets for prime values of\nq, while we construct them for all q > 1.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
