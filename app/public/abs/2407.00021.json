First, texture compression requires on-demand and\nreal-time decoding with random access during parallel rendering (e.g. block\ntexture decompression on GPUs). Additionally, NIC does not support\nmulti-resolution reconstruction (mip-levels), nor does it have the ability to\nefficiently jointly compress different sets of texture channels. In this work,\nwe introduce a novel approach to texture set compression that integrates\ntraditional GPU texture representation and NIC techniques, designed to enable\nrandom access and support many-channel texture sets. To achieve this goal, we\npropose an asymmetric auto-encoder framework that employs a convolutional\nencoder to capture detailed information in a bottleneck-latent space, and at\ndecoder side we utilize a fully connected network, whose inputs are sampled\nlatent features plus positional information, for a given texture coordinate and\nmip level. This latent data is defined to enable simplified access to\nmulti-resolution data by simply changing the scanning strides. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that this approach provides much better results than\nconventional texture compression, and significant improvement over the latest\nmethod using neural networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SVJlRZjac_efO3Hve5QwGwWxaA7h9OkdLpoM8q1EDkU","pdfSize":"45821503"}
