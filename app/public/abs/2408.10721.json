While a few\nstudies on type Ia supernovae, which are known to involve detonation, have\naddressed the importance of the cellular structure, further detailed treatment\nwill benefit enhanced understanding of the explosion outcomes. In the present\nstudy, we bridge this gap in the astrophysics and engineering fields, focusing\non the detonation in a heliumrich white dwarf envelope as the triggering\nprocess for the so-called double-detonation model. The cellular structures are\nquantified via high-resolution two-dimensional simulations. We demonstrate that\nwidely-accepted terrestrial-experimental criteria for quenching and initiation\nof detonation can indeed explain the results of previous hydrodynamic\nsimulations very well. The present study highlights the potential of continuing\nto apply the insight from terrestrial detonation experiments to astrophysical\nproblems, specifically the long unresolved problem of the explosion mechanism\nof type Ia supernovae.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nrtYzTWA1A4vpYQG824ZevciaSWh6jDxVs4rEFIO5q0","pdfSize":"1661282"}
