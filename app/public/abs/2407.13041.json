Specifically, we examine\nboth explicit and spontaneous background fields which display distinct\ntransformation properties and are characterized with different dynamics. For\nexplicit breaking, we focus on the $t$-sector of the minimal gravitational\nStandard-Model Extension (SME) and for spontaneous breaking on a vector field\ncalled the bumblebee model. In both cases, we derive the modified Friedmann\nequations and find a configuration of the background fields that preserve\nisotropy and homogeneity. We show that the explicit $t$-sector admits phases of\naccelerated expansion of the universe with standard matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
