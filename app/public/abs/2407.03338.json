Block Finite Difference methods\n(BFD) are FD methods in which the domain is divided into blocks, or cells,\ncontaining two or more grid points, with a different scheme used for each grid\npoint, unlike the standard FD method.\n  It was shown in recent works that BFD schemes might be one to three orders\nmore accurate than their truncation errors. Due to these schemes' ability to\ninhibit the accumulation of truncation errors, these methods were called Error\nInhibiting Schemes (EIS).\n  This manuscript shows that our BFD schemes can be viewed as a particular type\nof Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method. Then, we prove the BFD scheme's\nstability using the standard DG procedure while using a Fourier-like analysis\nto establish its optimal convergence rate.\n  We present numerical examples in one and two dimensions to demonstrate the\nefficacy of these schemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
