The presence of a radial field is linked to the disk's vertical\nshear and vertical magnetic field. We perform radially global linear analyses\nand utilize the spectral code \\textsc{Dedalus} to solve the matrix eigenvalue\nproblems. Our findings reveal that radial fields exhibit behavior similar to\nvertical fields. In the ideal MHD limit, radial fields enhance the effect of\nvertical fields in reducing growth rates, with significant reductions starting\nat relatively weak field strengths, around $\\beta \\sim 10^3 - 10^4$, which are\nrelevant to protoplanetary disks. In the non-ideal MHD limit, all three\nnon-ideal effects, when sufficiently strong, cause the growth rates to closely\nresemble those observed in hydrodynamic models.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
