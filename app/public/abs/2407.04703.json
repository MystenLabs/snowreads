The performance of\nclassical localization protocols is limited by the specific form of distance\ninformation and suffer from considerable ranging errors. This paper foresees a\nnew opportunity by utilizing the exceptional property of entangled quantum\nstates to measure a linear combination of target-anchor distances.\nSpecifically, we consider localization with quantum-based TDoA measurements.\nClassical TDoA ranging takes the difference of two separate measurements.\nInstead, quantum ranging allows TDoA estimation within a single measurement,\nthereby reducing the ranging errors. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the\nnew quantum-based localization significantly outperforms conventional\nalgorithms based on classical ranging, with over 50% gains on average.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
