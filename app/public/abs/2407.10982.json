This paper describes ARA-O-RAN, a novel O-RAN testbed\nestablished through the NSF Platforms for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) ARA\nplatform. ARA provides an at-scale rural wireless living lab focused on\ntechnologies for digital agriculture and rural communities. As an O-RAN\nAlliance certified Open Testing and Integration Centre (OTIC), ARA launched\nARA-O-RAN -- the first public O-RAN testbed tailored to rural and agriculture\nuse cases, together with the end-to-end, whole-stack programmability. ARA-O-RAN\nuniquely combines support for outdoor testing across a university campus,\nsurrounding farmlands, and rural communities with a 50-node indoor sandbox. The\ntestbed facilitates vital R\\&D to implement open architectures that can meet\nrural connectivity needs. The paper outlines ARA-O-RAN's hardware system\ndesign, software architecture, and enabled research experiments. It also\ndiscusses plans aligned with national spectrum policy and rural spectrum\ninnovation. ARA-O-RAN exemplifies the value of purpose-built wireless testbeds\nin accelerating impactful wireless research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
