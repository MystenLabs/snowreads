With the state-of-the-art calculation from the\nfunctional QCD method, we found that the large chemical potential of QCD phase\ntransition results in very weak and fast first-order phase transitions at the\ntemperature lower than $\\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ MeV. These results further suggest\nthat the GW signals of NANOGrav are very unlikely sourced from the chiral phase\ntransition of QCD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
