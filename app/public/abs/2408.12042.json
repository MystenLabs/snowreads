This phase transition is consistent with the 3D O(3)\nHeisenberg universality class. Additionally, we analyze dynamical properties\nsuch as the single-particle spectral function and dynamic spin structure\nfactor. The pronounced inter-layer correlation of $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ orbitals\nresults in a downward trend and an extended flatness in the $\\gamma$ band,\nmirroring the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy findings under ambient\npressure. Our numerical results provide important clues for understanding the\nstrong correlation effects in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
