The polynomials $\\mathbb{C}[x_{1},x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}]$ in $n$\nindeterminates is a choice representative. In the case $n > 1$, tensoring\n$\\mathbb{C}[x_{1},x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}]$ with the natural\n$\\mathfrak{osp}(1|2n)$-module $\\mathbb{C}^{1|2n}$ gives rise to a tensor\nproduct representation $V = \\mathbb{C}[x_{1},x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}] \\otimes\n\\mathbb{C}^{1|2n}$ of $\\mathfrak{osp}(1|2n)$ that decomposes into two\nirreducible summands. These summands are understood through automorphisms of\n$V$ that turn out to be intertwining operators describing the first summand as\nan isomorphic copy of $\\mathbb{C}[x_{1},x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}]$ and the second\nsummand as $\\mathbb{C}[x_{1},x_{2}, \\ldots, x_{n}] \\otimes \\mathbb{C}^{2n}$,\nwhich does not have a natural $\\mathfrak{osp}(1|2n)$-module structure. We\ndescribe the intertwining operators as infinite diagonal block matrices of\narrowhead matrices and give formulas for the action of the odd root vectors\n(which generate $\\mathfrak{osp}(1|2n)$) on bases of of each of these conjugated\noscillator realizations. The decomposition in the $n=1$ case yields three\nsummands, and we recall why the difference in cases is to be expected.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
