Tunneling between fractional quantum Hall edge\nmodes facilitates the study of anyonic statistics: it induces time-domain\nbraiding that dominates signals from diluted anyon beams. We develop a\nframework for characterizing out-of-equilibrium anyonic states and define their\neffective potential and temperature, as well as the landscape of their\nexcitations. Unlike fermions, the effective anyon potential depends on the type\nof the tunneling quasiparticles; non-equilibrium anyonic states are underlain\nby power-law energy distributions. This allows \"hot\" anyons to tunnel above the\nchemical potential of the source, which we capture by a measurable universal\nwitness function.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k1avfjn3wb4fZ4Wxb16YGQ6UaQX2Tkfj8CN1_dLPkdE","pdfSize":"2966990"}
