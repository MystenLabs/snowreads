Two key features are 1) the proposed method is\nsingle-looped, and 2) an first-order iteration complexity of\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{-2})$ is established under mild regularity assumptions.\nThe first feature suggests the practical efficiency of the proposed method,\nwhile the second feature highlights its theoretical superiority. Numerical\nexperiments on various problem scales demonstrate the advantages of the\nproposed method in terms of speed and solution quality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
