Alternatively,\noptimal evolutions can happen along predefined paths with no waste of energy\nresources and 100% speed efficiency. Unfortunately, realistic physical\nscenarios typically result in less-than-ideal evolutions. In this paper, we\nstudy different families of sub-optimal qubit Hamiltonians, both stationary and\ntime-varying, for which the so-called geodesic efficiency and the speed\nefficiency of the corresponding quantum evolutions are less than one.\nFurthermore, after proposing an alternative hybrid efficiency measure\nconstructed out of the two previously mentioned efficiency quantifiers, we\nprovide illustrative examples where the average departures from time-optimality\nand 100% speed efficiency are globally captured over a limited time period. In\nparticular, thanks to this hybrid measure, quantum evolutions are partitioned\nin four categories: Geodesic unwasteful, nongeodesic unwasteful, geodesic\nwasteful and, lastly, nongeodesic wasteful. Finally, we discuss Hamiltonians\nspecified by magnetic field configurations, both stationary and nonstationary,\nyielding optimal hybrid efficiency (that it, both time-optimality and 100%\nspeed efficiency) over a finite time interval.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u_JoxwxuWsgI9VcLJTNtNcJa8J6yUG_FOahQG3T6nyU","pdfSize":"1266155"}
