Most work on\nthis problem has focused on determining whether (up to isomorphism) there is a\nunique unital, simple, Leavitt path algebra with trivial $K$-theory (often\nreformulated as the question of whether the Leavitt path algebras $L_2$ and\n$L_{2_-}$ are isomorphic). However, it is unknown whether a positive answer to\nthis special case implies a positive answer to the Algebraic Kirchberg-Phillips\nQuestion. In this note, we pose a different question that asks whether two\nparticular non-simple Leavitt path algebras $L_k(\\mathbf{F}_*)$ and\n$L_k(\\mathbf{F}_{**})$ are isomorphic, and we prove that a positive answer to\nthis question implies a positive answer to the Algebraic Kirchberg-Phillips\nQuestion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
