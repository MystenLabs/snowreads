Neutron diffraction experiments were performed on both\npolycrystalline and single-crystalline VBr3 samples, revealing clear magnetic\nBragg peaks emerging below the N\\'eel temperature of TN = 26.5 K. These\nmagnetic Bragg peaks can be indexed by k = (0, 0.5, 1) in hexagonal notation.\nOur refinement analysis suggests that the antiferromagnetic order in VBr3\nmanifests as a zigzag structure. Moreover, we observed peak splitting for\nnuclear Bragg peaks in the HK-plane below the structure transition temperature\nof Ts = 94 K, indicating the breaking of 3-fold symmetry within the ab-plane.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hjewGhElyaiLUrpesue9jOt5RphvESYuSZIq3DpWQ3k","pdfSize":"1865473","txDigest":"pNEa6c5Sfsx8ngHhLrYv6RZaBRKqw9Doc2nADVjQBQM","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
