In coupled systems of\nlight and matter, entanglement manifests itself in the linear superposition of\nmultipartite quantum states (e.g., parametrized by the multiple spatial,\nspectral, or temporal degrees of freedom of a light field). In bipartite\nsystems, the Schmidt decomposition provides a modal decomposition of the\nentanglement structure over independent, separable states. Although ubiquitous\nas a tool to describe and measure entanglement, there exists no general method\nto decompose a bipartite quantum state onto its Schmidt modes. Here, we propose\na method that relies on bipartite self-configuring optics that automatically\n\"learns\" the Schmidt decomposition of an arbitrary pure quantum state. Our\nmethod is agnostic to the degrees of freedom over which quantum entanglement is\ndistributed and can reconstruct the Schmidt modes and values by variational\noptimization of the network's output powers or coincidences. We illustrate our\nmethod with numerical examples of spectral entanglement analysis for biphotons\ngenerated via spontaneous parametric down conversion and provide experimental\nguidelines for its realization, including the influence of losses and\nimpurities. Our method provides a versatile and scalable way of analyzing\nentanglement in bipartite integrated quantum photonic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
