Passing subhalos induce\nperturbations in streams that indicate the presence of the subhalos.\nUnderstanding how known DM-dominated satellites impact streams is a crucial\nstep towards using stream perturbations to constrain the properties of dark\nperturbers. Here, we cross-match a $\\textit{Gaia}$ EDR3 and SEGUE member\ncatalog of the Cetus-Palca stream (CPS) with H3 for additional radial velocity\nmeasurements and fit the orbit of the CPS using this 6-D data. We demonstrate\nfor the first time that the ultra-faint dwarf Segue 2 had a recent (77$\\pm$5\nMyr ago) close flyby (within the stream's 2$\\sigma$ width) with the CPS. This\ninteraction enables constraints on Segue 2's mass and density profile at larger\nradii ($\\mathcal{O}(1)$ kpc) than are probed by its stars ($\\mathcal{O}(10)$\npc). While Segue 2 is not expected to strongly affect the portion of the stream\ncovered by our 6-D data, we predict that if Segue 2's mass within $\\sim 6$ kpc\nis $5\\times 10^9\\,M_\\odot$, the CPS's velocity dispersion will be $\\sim 40$\nkm/s larger ahead of the impact site than behind it. If no such heating is\ndetected, Segue 2's mass cannot exceed $10^9\\,M_\\odot$ within $\\sim 6$ kpc. The\nproper motion distribution of the CPS near the impact site is mildly sensitive\nto the shape of Segue 2's density profile. This study presents a critical test\nfor frameworks designed to constrain properties of dark subhalos from stream\nperturbations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HP_1ANGcCX1fDSczX9XSCsjlQ1c5hj3kmETnC17f0gY","pdfSize":"4060296"}
