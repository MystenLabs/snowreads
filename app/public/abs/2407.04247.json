In\nthis edition, ArAIEval offers two tasks: (i) detection of propagandistic\ntextual spans with persuasion techniques identification in tweets and news\narticles, and (ii) distinguishing between propagandistic and non-propagandistic\nmemes. A total of 14 teams participated in the final evaluation phase, with 6\nand 9 teams participating in Tasks 1 and 2, respectively. Finally, 11 teams\nsubmitted system description papers. Across both tasks, we observed that\nfine-tuning transformer models such as AraBERT was at the core of the majority\nof the participating systems. We provide a description of the task setup,\nincluding a description of the dataset construction and the evaluation setup.\nWe further provide a brief overview of the participating systems. All datasets\nand evaluation scripts are released to the research community\n(https://araieval.gitlab.io/). We hope this will enable further research on\nthese important tasks in Arabic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
