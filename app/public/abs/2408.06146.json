Building on recent connections between these\ntwo areas, we generalize the \"deterministic discrepancy walk\" framework by\nPesenti and Vladu [SODA~23] for vector discrepancy to matrix discrepancy, and\nuse it to give a simpler proof of the matrix partial coloring theorem of Reis\nand Rothvoss [SODA~20]. Moreover, we show that this matrix discrepancy\nframework provides a unified approach for various spectral sparsification\nproblems, from stronger notions including unit-circle approximation and\nsingular-value approximation to weaker notions including graphical spectral\nsketching and effective resistance sparsification. In all of these\napplications, our framework produces improved results with a simpler and\ndeterministic analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
