A theorem of Milnor\nthat determines the Witt ring of a function field is applied to prove an\nanalogue of Gauss's principal genus theorem for binary quadratic forms with\npolynomial coefficients. This is used to help understand when and why quadratic\nreciprocity fails in these polynomial rings. Another application is a count of\nthe number of cyclic subgroups whose order is divisible by four in the primary\ndecomposition of the torsion subgroup of the Jacobian of certain hyperelliptic\ncurves. Invariant theory is applied to prove an analogue of a classical theorem\nof Fueter to give criteria for an elliptic curve with a polynomial discriminant\nand zero $j$-invariant to have no affine points over the associated function\nfield.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
