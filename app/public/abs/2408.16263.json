In 2021, Lin and Shao constructed a series analogous to the\nMcKay-Thompson series (a twined partition function of the Monster CFT), but\nusing a non-invertible topological defect rather than an element of the Monster\ngroup $\\mathcal{M}$. This \"defect McKay-Thompson series\" was found to be\ninvariant under a genus zero subgroup of $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$, but was shown not\nto be the Hauptmodul of the subgroup. Nevertheless, one might wonder if a\nweaker version of Borcherds' theorem holds for non-invertible defects: perhaps\ndefect McKay-Thompson series enjoy genus zero invariance groups in $SL(2,\n\\mathbb{R})$, whether or not they are Hauptmoduln for those groups. Using the\ndecompositions of the monster stress tensor found in Bae et al. (2021), we\nconstruct several new defect McKay-Thompson series, study their modular\nproperties, and determine their invariance groups in $SL(2, \\mathbb{R})$. We\ndiscover that many of the invariance groups are not genus zero.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
