The necessity for\nsuch innovation stems from the increasing demand for efficient biosensing\ntechnologies that can operate with minimal poxer consumption. Within this\nstudy, a numerical dynamic memristive model serves as a basis platform for\nimplementing enhanced nanosensing method characterized by low cost and high\nsensitivity. Numerous simulations were conducted to validate the suitability of\nthe dynamic memristive model's behaviour for emulating a chemical sensing\napproach. The simulated data is collected for deploying an AI application to\nensure an advanced predictable biosensing intake function. All in all, this\nwork paves the way for developing compact numerical models of memristive\nbiosensors, addressing the pressing need for portable lox poxer consumption\nbiosensing solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rl75Xy0DVIIxt0H_t-9VSpQ0j0dEgKAL8S2iSNpaaYY","pdfSize":"1096996"}
