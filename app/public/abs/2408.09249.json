This fact can be used to set up polarization experiments of a\nnew type to measure the ratio $R$.\n  For double spin asymmetry in the $\\vec e \\vec p \\to e p$ process, the\ncorresponding difference of the $R$ ratio does not exceed 2.32 $\\%$. This fact\nmeans that it is not sensitive to the effects of the Sachs form factor scaling\nviolation and could be used as a test for the $R\\approx 1$ equality.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
