While advancements have been made in\ncomputational efficiency as well as diversity and convergence of solutions, a\ncritical challenge persists: the internal evolutionary mechanisms are opaque to\nhuman users. Drawing upon the successes of explainable AI in explaining complex\nalgorithms and models, we argue that the need to understand the underlying\nevolutionary operators and population dynamics within MOEAs aligns well with a\nvisual analytics paradigm. This paper introduces ParetoTracker, a visual\nanalytics framework designed to support the comprehension and inspection of\npopulation dynamics in the evolutionary processes of MOEAs. Informed by\npreliminary literature review and expert interviews, the framework establishes\na multi-level analysis scheme, which caters to user engagement and exploration\nranging from examining overall trends in performance metrics to conducting\nfine-grained inspections of evolutionary operations. In contrast to\nconventional practices that require manual plotting of solutions for each\ngeneration, ParetoTracker facilitates the examination of temporal trends and\ndynamics across consecutive generations in an integrated visual interface. The\neffectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through case studies and expert\ninterviews focused on widely adopted benchmark optimization problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eNxR3eZO_WoAN_hL45ooh_-nuOWsEutiEsXtlnxc1aM","pdfSize":"8093515"}
