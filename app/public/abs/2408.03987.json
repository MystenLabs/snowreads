Double-bracket quantum algorithms (DBQAs) have been\nrecently proposed to diagonalize Hamiltonians and in this work we show how to\nuse them to prepare ground states. We propose to improve an initial state\npreparation by adding a few steps of DBQAs. The interfaced method\nsystematically achieves a better fidelity while significantly reducing the\ncomputational cost of the procedure. For a Heisenberg model, we compile our\nalgorithm using CZ and single-qubit gates into circuits that match capabilities\nof near-term quantum devices. Moreover, we show that DBQAs can benefit from the\nexperimental availability of increasing circuit depths. Whenever an approximate\nground state can be prepared without exhausting the available circuit depth,\nthen DBQAs can be enlisted to algorithmically seek a higher fidelity\npreparation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wZl2FtTEDbNYM8le_Jf4LBa-sjhKIMqocxVFhRZ_kng","pdfSize":"1449402"}
