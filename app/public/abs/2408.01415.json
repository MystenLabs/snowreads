Inspired by this, researchers have explored utilizing generative\nmodels to generate neural network parameters. However, these efforts have been\nlimited by the parameter size and the practicality of generating\nhigh-performance parameters. In this paper, we propose COND P-DIFF, a novel\napproach that demonstrates the feasibility of controllable high-performance\nparameter generation, particularly for LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) weights,\nduring the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to\nextract efficient latent representations for parameters. We then train a\nconditional latent diffusion model to synthesize high-performing model\nparameters from random noise based on specific task conditions. Experimental\nresults in both computer vision and natural language processing domains\nconsistently demonstrate that COND P-DIFF can generate high-performance\nparameters conditioned on the given task. Moreover, we observe that the\nparameter distribution generated by COND P-DIFF exhibits differences compared\nto the distribution obtained through normal optimization methods, indicating a\ncertain level of generalization capability. Our work paves the way for further\nexploration of condition-driven parameter generation, offering a promising\ndirection for task-specific adaptation of neural networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
