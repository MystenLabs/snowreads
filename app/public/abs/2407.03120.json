The very recent\nobservation of large transient spin-charge conversion (SCC) and subsequent\npowerful THz emission from Co|Bi_{1-x}Sb_x bilayers clearly demonstrates such\npotentiality and feasibility for the near future. Amongst the exotic properties\nappearing in and at the surface of such quantum materials, spin-momentum\nlocking (SML) and Rashba-Edelstein effects remain as key ingredients to\neffectively convert the spin degree of freedom into a charge or a voltage\nsignal. In this work, we extend our analyses to the quantification of orbital\nmomentum-locking and related orbital charge conversion effects in\nBi_{0.85}Sb_{0.15} via orbital Rashba-Edelstein effects. In that sense, we will\nprovide some clear theoretical and numerical insights implemented by\nmulti-orbital and multi-layered tight-binding methods (TB) to clarify our\nrecent experimental results obtained by THz-TDS spectroscopy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
