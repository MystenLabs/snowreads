In each of the two cases considered, we\nprovide a census of the birational models, relating each model to familiar\ngeometric constructions. We also provide structural results about the\nbirational automorphism groups, giving generators in both cases and a full set\nof relations in one case. Finally, as a byproduct of our analysis, we obtain\nnon-isomorphic cubic fourfolds whose Fano varieties of lines are birationally\nequivalent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
