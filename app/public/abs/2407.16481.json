We computationally find\nexamples of interesting families with the following three properties. Firstly,\ntheir geometric monodromy group is Zariski dense in $\\operatorname{SL}_n$.\nSecondly, they realise many different unipotent operators as the monodromy\noperator at $t = \\infty$. Thirdly, all their Hodge numbers are $\\leq 1$.\n  This has consequences for Galois representations. Namely, if a nilpotent\noperator $N$ appears as the monodromy at $t = \\infty$ in one of our families,\nwe can construct potentially automorphic representations with $\\ell$-adic\nmonodromy given by $N$ at a fixed prime $p$. As another application, we obtain\na new proof of some cases of the recent local-global compatibility theorem of\nMatsumoto.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jvjkYslWQ0OPLZCTe7UPUikdZlyXBVJBlaOECFYgbKY","pdfSize":"453863"}
