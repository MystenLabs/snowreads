If it exists, the block is compatible\nwith the pipeline. For unaltered images, all blocks are always compatible with\nthe original pipeline; however, for manipulated images, this is not always the\ncase. This article demonstrates the potential of compatibility concepts for\nJPEG image forensics. It presents a solution to the main challenge of finding a\nblock antecedent in a high-dimensional space. This solution relies on a local\nsearch algorithm with restrictions on the search space. We show that\ninpainting, copy-move, or splicing applied after a JPEG compression can be\nturned into three different mismatch problems and be detected. In particular,\nwhen the image is re-compressed after the modification, we can detect the\nmanipulation if the quality factor of the second compression is higher than the\nfirst one. Our method can pinpoint forgeries down to the JPEG block with great\ndetection power and without False Positive. We compare our method with two\nstate-of-the-art models on localizing inpainted forgeries after a simple or a\ndouble compression. We show that under our working assumptions, it outperforms\nthose models for most experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
