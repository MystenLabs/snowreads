We confirm\nstandard Ohmic behavior with strictly linear current-voltage curves above the\nindium critical field or temperature, although with high, about 100~kOhm,\njunction resistance. At low temperatures and in zero magnetic field, we observe\na well-developed Andreev curve with the pronounced coherence peaks, which\ncannot be normally expected for these high values of normal junction\nresistance. The conclusion on the Andreev reflection is also supported by\nsuppression in magnetic field, as well as by universality of the observed\nbehavior for all of the investigated samples. The experimental results can be\nexplained by specifics of Andreev transport through the disordered region at\nthe superconductor-altermagnet interface. Due to a different set of\nrestrictions on the possibility of Andreev reflection, an altermagnet suffers\nfrom the presence of disorder less than a normal spin-degenerate metal, so the\nconductance enhancement is retained throughout the superconducting gap.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
