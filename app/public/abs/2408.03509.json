In response\nto the industry needs, an engineering design course has been developed for\nsenior level students enrolled in the software engineering program in Canada.\nThe goals of the course are to provide a realistic design experience, introduce\nstudents to industry culture, improve their time management skills, challenge\nthem technically and intellectually, improve their communication skills, raise\nstudent level of professionalism, hone their soft skills, and raise awareness\nof human factors in software engineering. This work discusses the details of\nhow this design course has been developed and delivered, and the learning\noutcomes that has been obtained.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
