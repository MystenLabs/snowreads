The synthesis of SmCrGe$_3$ single crystals through a\nhigh-temperature solution method has led to the determination of uniaxial\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy. Phase verification was achieved using scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy (STEM), powder, and single-crystal X-ray\ndiffraction techniques. Electrical transport and specific heat measurements\nindicate a Curie temperature ($T_C$) of approximately 160 K, while\nmagnetization measurements were utilized to determine the anisotropy fields and\nconstants. Curie-Weiss fitting applied to magnetization data suggests the\ncontribution of both Sm and Cr in the paramagnetic phase. Additionally, density\nfunctional theory (DFT) calculations explored the electronic structures and\nmagnetic properties of SmCrGe$_3$, revealing a significant easy-axis single-ion\nSm magnetocrystalline anisotropy of 16 meV/f.u.. Based on the magnetization\nmeasurements, easy-axis magnetocrystalline anisotropy at 20 K is 13 meV/f.u..\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
