In this article, first we obtain a necessary\nand sufficient condition for an arbitrary graph to be minimally edge connected.\nConsequently, we characterize finite groups whose enhanced power graphs and\norder superpower graphs, respectively, are minimally edge connected. Moreover,\nfor a finite non-cyclic group $G$, we prove that $G$ is an elementary abelian\n$2$-group if and only if its enhanced power graph is minimally connected. Also,\nwe show that $G$ is a finite $p$-group if and only if its order superpower\ngraph is minimally connected. Finally, we characterize all the finite nilpotent\ngroups such that the minimum degree and the vertex connectivity of their order\nsuperpower graphs are equal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
