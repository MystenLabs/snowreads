{"id":"2408.06763","title":"A Dynorphin Theory of Depression and Bipolar Disorder","authors":"Ari Rappoport","authorsParsed":[["Rappoport","Ari",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 09:39:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-14","timestamp":1723541951000,"abstract":"  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a debilitating health condition affecting\na substantial part of the world's population. At present, there is no\nbiological theory of MDD, and treatment is partial at best. Here I present a\ntheory of MDD that explains its etiology, symptoms, pathophysiology, and\ntreatment. MDD involves stressful life events that the person does not manage\nto resolve. In this situation animals normally execute a 'disengage' survival\nresponse. In MDD, this response is chronically executed, leading to depressed\nmood and the somatic MDD symptoms. To explain the biological mechanisms\ninvolved, I present a novel theory of opioids, where each opioid mediates one\nof the basic survival responses. The opioid mediating 'disengage' is dynorphin.\nThe paper presents strong evidence for chronic dynorphin signaling in MDD and\nfor its causal role in the disorder. The theory also explains bipolar disorder,\nand the mechanisms behind the treatment of both disorders.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4d85c80RvYrJ-fc79Jb2M42xjuwV9WL-4E9Bv5vvRJc","pdfSize":"267183"}
