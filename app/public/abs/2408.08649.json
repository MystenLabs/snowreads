These transitions are typically\ncharacterized by quantities such as heat absorption and the work needed to\nalter the system's volume. This study is inspired by the potential to develop\nan analogous, straightforward thermodynamic description for systems that are\nout of equilibrium. Here, we explore the global energy exchanges that occur\nduring transitions between these nonequilibrium states. We study a system with\nheat flow and an external (gravity) field that exhibits macroscopic motion,\nsuch as Rayleigh-B\\'enard convection. We show that the formula for system's\nenergy exchange has the same form as in equilibrium. It opens the possibility\nof describing out-of-equilibrium systems using a few simple laws similar to\nequilibrium thermodynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-0YrDYkmJD276N5_5berAoO5zcEgLkL0MLLPKCHA3Q8","pdfSize":"590027"}
