Then we review recent\nexperimental results from the first beam energy scan program (BES-I) at the\nRelativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC). Topics cover measurements of\ncollectivity, chirality, criticality, global polarization, strangeness,\nheavy-flavor, di-lepton and light nuclei productions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
