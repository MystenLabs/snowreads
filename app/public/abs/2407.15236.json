Traditional linear models often fall short in\naccurately capturing the unique and complex dynamics of this market. In\ncontrast, Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have demonstrated considerable\nproficiency in time series forecasting. This papers introduces novel neural\nnetwork framework that blend the principles of econometric state space models\nwith the dynamic capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). We propose\nstate space models using Long Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Residual Units\n(GRU) and Temporal Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (TKANs). According to the\nresults, TKANs, inspired by Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and LSTM,\ndemonstrate promising outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
