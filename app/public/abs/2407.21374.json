By\nleveraging human gestures in video data, we propose the Temporal-Spatiotemporal\nFusion Network (TSFN) model that surpasses the limitations of current methods,\nenabling robots to understand gestures from long distances. With applications\nin service robots, search and rescue operations, and drone-based interactions,\nour approach enhances HRI in expansive environments. Experimental validation\ndemonstrates significant advancements in gesture recognition accuracy,\nparticularly in prolonged gesture sequences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XXlZ_UfSRdv5LDiQ4XFcX7oqoo9DVz7FVMOvieT5TIU","pdfSize":"1914981"}
