Carrillo, K. Craig, F. Patacchini, Calc. Var., 58 (2019), pp. 53] and the\nLandau equation in [J. Carrillo, J. Hu., L. Wang, J. Wu, J. Comput. Phys. X, 7\n(2020), pp. 100066]. One common feature to these equations is that they both\nadmit some variational formulation, which upon proper regularization, leads to\nparticle approximations dissipating the energy and conserving some quantities\nsimultaneously at the semi-discrete level. In this paper, we formulate\ncontinuity equations with a density dependent bilinear form associated with the\nvariational derivative of the energy functional and prove that appropriate\nparticle methods satisfy a compatibility condition with its regularized energy.\nThis enables us to utilize discrete gradient time integrators and show that the\nenergy can be dissipated and the mass conserved simultaneously at the fully\ndiscrete level. In the case of the Landau equation, we prove that our approach\nalso conserves the momentum and kinetic energy at the fully discrete level.\nSeveral numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the dissipative and\nconservative properties of our proposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
