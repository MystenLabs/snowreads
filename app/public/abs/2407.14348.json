Where possible, we provide closed expressions for damping\nrates, including the contributions from viscosity, as well as thermal\nconductivity and solutions of the heat equation. We assume an isolated system,\nsuch that no energy/heat transfer to the environment is allowed. We find\nmonotonic behavior of the damping as a function of frequency for breathing and\ntorsional modes, however, for spheroidal modes we find non-monotonicity.\nFurthermore, we analytically analyze the thermodynamic limit for all mode\ntypes. We also investigate the frequency shift and find expected behavior, i.e.\na reduced eigenfrequency with damping than without damping for breathing and\ntorsional modes. For spheroidal modes, however, we find non-monotonic shifts,\ncorresponding to the damping. For some eigenfrequencies we find anomalous\nfrequency shifts.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
