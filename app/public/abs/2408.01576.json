We develop a prototype system for\ntending to a bench-top centrifuge using computer vision methods for color\ndetection and circular Hough Transforms to detect and localize centrifuge\nbuckets. Initial results show that the prototype is capable of automating the\nusage of regular bench-top lab equipment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
