These\ncollective excitations have strong fluorescence, narrow bandwidth, and shifted\nemission/absorption energies. We study the optical properties of\n{\\alpha}-sexithiophene chains in boron nitride nanotubes by combining\nfluorescence with far- and near-field absorption spectroscopy. The inner\nnanotube diameter determines the number of encapsulated molecular chains. A\nsingle chain of {\\alpha}-sexithiophene molecules has an optical absorption and\nemission spectrum that is red-shifted by almost 300 meV compared to the monomer\nemission, which is much larger than expected from dipole-dipole coupling. The\ncollective state splits into excitation and emission channels with a Stokes\nshift of 200 meV for chains with two or more files. Our study emphasises the\nformation of a delocalized collective state through Coulomb coupling of the\ntransition moments that shows a remarkable tuneability in transition energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
