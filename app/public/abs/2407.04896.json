Sensor planning can enhance the\nefficiency and success of these types of missions when coupled with a\nhigher-level informative path-planning algorithm. This paper aims to address\nthese data acquisition challenges by developing an informative non-myopic\nsensor planning framework for a single-axis gimbal coupled with an informative\npath planner to maximize information gain over a prior information map. This is\ndone by finding reduced sensor sweep bounds over a planning horizon such that\nregions of higher confidence are prioritized. This novel sensor planning\nframework is evaluated against a predefined sensor sweep and no sensor planning\nbaselines as well as validated in two simulation environments. In our results,\nwe observe an improvement in the performance by 21.88% and 13.34% for the no\nsensor planning and predefined sensor sweep baselines respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
