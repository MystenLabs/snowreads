When the simulation cell is\ndiscretized into $N_\\mathrm{g}$ grid points, combined with quantum phase\nestimation (QPE), it is shown that obtaining the ground state energy of\nHamiltonian requires a circuit depth of $O(\\log N_\\mathrm{g})$. The ground\nstate calculation part in OFDFT is expected to be accelerated, for example, by\ncreating an appropriate preconditioner from the estimated ground state energy\nfor the locally optimal block preconditioned conjugate gradient (LOBPCG)\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
