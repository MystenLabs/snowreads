In process\nindustrial systems, fault samples are limited, and only single-mode fault data\ncan be obtained. Extracting domain-invariant fault features from single-mode\ndata for unseen mode fault diagnosis poses challenges. Existing methods utilize\na generator module to simulate samples of unseen modes. However, multi-mode\nsamples contain complex spatiotemporal information, which brings significant\ndifficulties to accurate sample generation. Therefore, double gradient reversal\nnetwork (DGRN) is proposed. First, the model is pre-trained to acquire fault\nknowledge from the single seen mode. Then, pseudo-fault feature generation\nstrategy is designed by Adaptive instance normalization, to simulate fault\nfeatures of unseen mode. The dual adversarial training strategy is created to\nenhance the diversity of pseudo-fault features, which models unseen modes with\nsignificant distribution differences. Subsequently, domain-invariant feature\nextraction strategy is constructed by contrastive learning and adversarial\nlearning. This strategy extracts common features of faults and helps multi-mode\nfault diagnosis. Finally, the experiments were conducted on Tennessee Eastman\nprocess and continuous stirred-tank reactor. The experiments demonstrate that\nDGRN achieves high classification accuracy on unseen modes while maintaining a\nsmall model size.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
