As applications, we construct a class of general type\nMarkov processes on $E$ via quasi-regular Dirichlet forms containing the\ndiffusion, jump and killing terms. Moreover, stochastic extrinsic derivative\nflows on $E$ are studied by using quasi-regular Dirichlet forms, which in\nparticular provide martingale solutions to SDEs on these two spaces, with\ndrifts given by the extrinsic derivative of entropy functionals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
