A liquid\nxenon calorimeter with VUV-sensitive photosensors measures photon position,\ntiming, and energy. This paper concentrates on the precise photon energy\nreconstruction with the MEG II liquid xenon calorimeter. Since a muon beam rate\nis $3\\text{-}5 \\times 10^{7}~\\text{s}^{-1}$, multi-photon elimination analysis\nis performed using waveform analysis techniques such as a template waveform\nfit. As a result, background events in the energy range of 48-58 MeV were\nreduced by 34 %. The calibration of an energy scale of the calorimeter with\nseveral calibration sources is also discussed to achieve a high resolution of\n1.8 %.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nvLC7sNRuwtbkvGWBJy4L2UKLcIcZ4Wcmc0UOc3yelI","pdfSize":"980446"}
