By systematically adjusting\nthe spatial difference in crosslinking density, we observed that\nmillimeter-sized liquid droplets moved along the gradient of elastic modulus\nand even climbed tilted slopes against gravity. Unlike the wetting dynamics of\nmicro-droplets, which are governed by elastocapillary effects, we demonstrated\nthat the observed spontaneous movements of millimeter-sized droplets were\nattributed to the surface energy difference resulting from the variation in\ncrosslinking density. Using {\\em in-situ} confocal microscopy imaging, we\nanalyzed the viscoelastic dissipation induced by the moving wetting ridges near\ndynamic contact lines. Based on the relationship between the crosslinking\ndensity and surface energy of soft gels, our findings reveal a new method for\ncontrolling droplet dynamics at soft and dissipative interfaces.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
