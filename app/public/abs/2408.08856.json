Pieces move by jumping over an adjacent\nchecker, removing the checker jumped over. Conway showed that it is not\npossible to reach row 5 in finitely many moves by weighting each cell in the\nboard by powers of the golden ratio such that no move increases the total\nweight. Other authors have considered the game played on many different boards,\nincluding generalising the standard game to higher dimensions. We work on a\nboard of arbitrary dimension, where we allow a cell to hold multiple checkers\nand begin with m checkers on each cell. We derive an upper bound and a\nconstructive lower bound on the height that can be reached, such that the upper\nbound almost never fails to be equal to the lower bound. We also consider the\nmore general case where instead of jumping over 1 checker, each checker moves\nby jumping over k checkers, and again show the maximum height reachable lies\nwithin bounds that are almost always equal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ew_lJ0vkAFgqoPjS_hnCgWaoy5HSYIXPSWk9cjZxzN0","pdfSize":"199425"}
