We present details for the second order\naccurate parametric scheme based on the finite volume method including simple\nvariants of ENO (Essentially Non-Oscillatory) and WENO (Weighted Essentially\nNon-Oscillatory) approximations. We present numerical experiments for\nrepresentative linear and nonlinear problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
