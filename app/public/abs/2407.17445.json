This mechanism can be visualized as a hole that toggles back\nand forth between two electrons. The coined term component exchange is meant to\ninform that the repeated change of the electron component of the exciton\noriginates from the exchange interaction. We develop a Bethe-Salpeter Equation\nfor trions, showing that a bound trion state emerges if the electron and\nelectron of the exciton are distinguishable particles (e.g., having opposite\nspins or residing in different valleys of the Brillouin zone). Similar to\nnumerical techniques that treat the trion as a three-body problem, the trion\nBethe-Salpeter Equation yields similar binding energy without using parameters\nbeyond effective masses and dielectric constants.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
