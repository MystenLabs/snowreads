The subtoposes of\n$[\\mathbf{C}^{\\mathrm{op}}, \\mathbf{Set}]$ are sometimes all of the form\n$[\\mathbf{D}^{\\mathrm{op}}, \\mathbf{Set}]$ where $\\mathbf{D}$ is a full\nCauchy-complete subcategory of $\\mathbf{C}$. This is the case for instance when\n$\\mathbf{C}$ is finite, an Artinian poset, or the simplex category. In order to\nunify these situations, we give two formulations of a sufficient condition. The\nfirst formulation involves a two-player game, and the second formulation\ncombines two \"local\" properties of $\\mathbf{C}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sTzGu2lnqL0FdB5LKbuTlf8RRK4FI0j9eezbzvkLOCw","pdfSize":"124881"}
