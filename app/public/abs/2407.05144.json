The $\\sigma$-fields of this largest extension constitute the\ncompletion, in the sense of noise-type Boolean algebras, of the range of the\nunextended (basic) splitting noise. A Lebesgue measurable domain to which the\nextension is possible is characterized by a certain stability property: under\nindependent perturbation of Brownian increments off the domain, of the times of\nBrownian local maxima belonging to the domain; together with the same property\nfor the complement of the domain. A set that is equal to an open set modulo a\nLebesgue negligible one, with the same being true of its complement, has this\nstability property, but others have it too: the extension is non-trivial. Some\ndomains are totally unstable with respect to the indicated perturbation, and to\nthem the extension cannot be made.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
