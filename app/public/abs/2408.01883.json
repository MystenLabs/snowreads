Using Ordinary Least Squares\n(OLS) regression, we evaluate the effects of thirteen major health events since\n2000, including the Anthrax attacks, SARS outbreak, H1N1 pandemic, and COVID-19\npandemic, on the pharmaceutical sector. The analysis covers different phases of\neach event beginning, peak, and ending to capture their temporal influence on\nstock prices. Our findings reveal distinct patterns in stock performance,\ndriven by market reactions to the initial news, peak impact, and eventual\nresolution of these crises. We also examine scenarios with and without key\nmacroeconomic (MA) and market (MI) indicators to isolate their contributions.\nThis detailed examination provides valuable insights for investors,\npolicymakers, and stakeholders in understanding the interplay between major\nhealth events and health market dynamics, guiding better decision-making during\nfuture health related disruptions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
