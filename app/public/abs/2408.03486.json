In this paper, we construct a complete list of irreducible projective\n(or spin) representations of $G$ and compute their characters (called spin\ncharacters). It is a continuation of our study of spin representations in the\ncases where $M(G)$ contains prime number 2 to the cases where other prime $p$\nappears, firstly $p=3$. We classify irreducible spin representations and\ncalculate spin characters according to their spin types.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
