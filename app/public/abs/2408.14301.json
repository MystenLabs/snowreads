The Resolve\nmicrocalorimeter has obtained the first high-resolution spectrum in the 1.6-10\nkeV band, which contains K-shell emission lines of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. We\nfind that the Si and S lines are relatively narrow, with a broadening\nrepresented by a Gaussian-like velocity dispersion of $\\sigma_v \\sim 450$ km\ns$^{-1}$. The Fe He$\\alpha$ lines are, on the other hand, substantially\nbroadened with $\\sigma_v \\sim 1670$ km s$^{-1}$. This broadening can be\nexplained by a combination of the thermal Doppler effect due to the high ion\ntemperature and the kinematic Doppler effect due to the SNR expansion. Assuming\nthat the Fe He$\\alpha$ emission originates predominantly from the supernova\nejecta, we estimate the reverse shock velocity at the time when the bulk of the\nFe ejecta were shock heated to be $-1000 \\lesssim V_{\\rm rs}~[{\\rm km s}^{-1}]\n\\lesssim 3300$ (in the observer frame). We also find that Fe Ly$\\alpha$\nemission is redshifted with a bulk velocity of $\\sim 890$ km s$^{-1}$,\nsubstantially larger than the radial velocity of the local interstellar medium\nsurrounding N132D. These results demonstrate that high-resolution X-ray\nspectroscopy is capable of providing constraints on the evolutionary stage,\ngeometry, and velocity distribution of SNRs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
