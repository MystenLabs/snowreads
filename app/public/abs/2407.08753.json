The Mordell-Gruber spectrum has\nbeen studied since 1936, concerning the supremum of the area of a rectangle\ncentered at the origin that contains no other points of a unimodular lattice.\nWe develop techniques that incorporate unimodular lattices and integer\nsequences, providing the log-systole function which unifies four famous\nspectra. We compute the Mordell-Gruber spectrum in the two-dimensional case and\ngeneralize Perron's formulas behind some famous spectra. Furthermore, we\ngeneralize the sum of Cantor sets to prove that certain functions on cartesian\nproduct of two Cantor sets contain an interval. Combining the techniques, we\nprove closedness and existence of Hall's interval in several different\napplications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8sS27w5jThqGTZ6HVr5IgaPlL6cGDEGgMk7IydqDYTE","pdfSize":"901592"}
