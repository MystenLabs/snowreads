This\ninterpretation uses the category $\\mathbf{Mag}_{\\mathbf{Set}}$, whose objects\nare magmas and whose arrows are functions from the category $\\mathbf{Set}$,\nspecifically for the case of the parallel lambda calculus. Similarly, we use\nthe category $\\mathbf{AMag}^{\\mathcal S}_{\\mathbf{Set}}$, whose objects are\naction magmas and whose arrows are also functions from the category\n$\\mathbf{Set}$, for the case of the algebraic lambda calculus. Our approach\ndiverges from conventional interpretations where disjunctions are handled by\ncoproducts, instead proposing to handle them with the union of disjoint union\nand the Cartesian product.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
