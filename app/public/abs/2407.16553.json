Following this perspective, we introduce a novel technique of\ncharging in which coherent charger-battery interaction is replaced by a\ndissipative interaction via an engineered shared reservoir. We demonstrate that\nexploiting collective effects of the engineered shared reservoir allows for\nextra optimization giving rise to optimal redistribution of energy, which leads\nto a significant enhancement in the efficiency of the charging process. The\narticle unveils the intricacies of built-in detuning within the context of a\nshared environment, offering a deeper understanding of the charging mechanisms\ninvolved. These findings apply naturally to quantum circuit battery\narchitectures, suggesting the feasibility of efficient energy storage in these\nsystems. Moreover, the super-optimal charging offers a practical justification\nfor charger-battery configurations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GRAo0N_Zp1qn-rZyqZlU5TJq1mRYVJIDMCNT93HE6Jo","pdfSize":"638398"}
