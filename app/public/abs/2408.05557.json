The complexity is\ndefined as the difference between the Shannon-entropy and the second order\nR\\'enyi-entropy, where the latter is connected to the traditional participation\nmeasure or purity. It is shown that the system attains maximal complexity for\nspecial choice of control parameters, i.e. strength of disorder either in the\npresence of noise of the energy states or the presence of disorder in the off\ndiagonal coupling. It is shown that such a noise or disorder dependence\nprovides a basis free analysis and gives meaningful insights. We also look at\nsimilar entropic complexity of spins in thermal equilibrium for a paramagnet at\nfinite temperature, $T$ and magnetic field $B$, as well as the case of an Ising\nmodel in the mean-field approximation. As a result all examples provide\nimportant evidence that the investigation of the entropic complexity parameters\nhelp to get deeper understanding in the behavior of these systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KCtorohwCotX526bVlVyw3QI0vNUDqKXcvb0TatOABA","pdfSize":"228831"}
