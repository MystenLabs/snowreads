This paper designs and optimizes a risk monitoring\nsystem based on big data and machine learning. By constructing a four-layer\narchitecture, it effectively integrates large-scale financial data and advanced\nmachine learning algorithms. Key technologies employed in the system include\nLong Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Trees,\nand real-time data processing platform Apache Flink, ensuring the real-time and\naccurate nature of risk monitoring. Research findings demonstrate that the\nsystem significantly enhances efficiency and accuracy in risk management,\nparticularly excelling in identifying and warning against market crash risks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
