Consequently, a similar method\nworks for arbitrary Pauli exponentials. We prove the correctness of our\napproach, after introducing novel rewrite rules for circuits which benefit from\nqubit recycling. The decomposition has a wide variety of applications ranging\nfrom the efficient implementation of fault-tolerant lattice surgery\ncomputations, to expressing arbitrary stabilizer circuits via two-body\ninteractions only, and to reducing the depth of NISQ computations, such as VQE.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
