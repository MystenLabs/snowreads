The resulting re-routing of resource flows\nwithin the organism's network can significantly impact local ecosystems. In\ncurrent analysis limitations stem from a focus on single-time-point morphology,\nhindering understanding of continuous dynamics and underlying constraints.\nHere, we study ongoing network reorganization in the foraging slime mold\n\\textit{Physarum~polycephalum}, identifying three distinct states with varying\nmorphology and migration velocity. We estimate the energetic cost of each state\nand find a trade-off between building and transport costs within the\nmorphological variability, facilitating different search strategies. Adaptation\nof state population to the environment suggests that diverse network\nmorphologies support varied foraging strategies, though constrained by\nassociated costs. Our findings provide insights for evaluating the impact of\nresource flow re-routing in changing ecosystems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SN2k7mTqYOhhmQDjcJCpOjTqN3Td1WgKj8iE46kUXNA","pdfSize":"4514355"}
