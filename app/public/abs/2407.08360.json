For certain choices of $(a,b,c)$,\nour result is conditional on an Elliott-type conjecture. Our proofs build on\nand extend previous arguments of the authors dealing with the Pythagorean\nequation. We make use of new uniformity properties of aperiodic multiplicative\nfunctions and concentration estimates for multiplicative functions along\narbitrary binary quadratic forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YdtrRa4TpSctTUooJLY2088x6YOiWsAZcxfo7DbAEXY","pdfSize":"698693","objectId":"0xd7b097adb2a5220a2f128e8469b550e189fdd6116f0ecdf7bbdb38989b7c7abe","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
