These virtual lipids serve as a corpus for\npre-training, lipid representation learning, and downstream task knowledge\ntransfer, culminating in state-of-the-art LNP property prediction performance.\nWe propose LipidBERT, a BERT-like model pre-trained with the Masked Language\nModel (MLM) and various secondary tasks. Additionally, we compare the\nperformance of embeddings generated by LipidBERT and PhatGPT, our GPT-like\nlipid generation model, on downstream tasks. The proposed bilingual LipidBERT\nmodel operates in two languages: the language of ionizable lipid pre-training,\nusing in-house dry-lab lipid structures, and the language of LNP fine-tuning,\nutilizing in-house LNP wet-lab data. This dual capability positions LipidBERT\nas a key AI-based filter for future screening tasks, including new versions of\nMETiS de novo lipid libraries and, more importantly, candidates for in vivo\ntesting for orgran-targeting LNPs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst successful demonstration of the capability of a pre-trained language\nmodel on virtual lipids and its effectiveness in downstream tasks using web-lab\ndata. This work showcases the clever utilization of METiS's in-house de novo\nlipid library as well as the power of dry-wet lab integration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Physics/Chemical Physics","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
