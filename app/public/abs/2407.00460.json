This paper describes how such functionality can be achieved with\na practical rule engine learned from expert driving decisions. We propose an\nalgorithm to create and maintain a rule-based behaviour planner, using a\ntwo-layer rule-based theory. The first layer determines a set of feasible\nparametrized behaviours, given the perceived state of the environment. From\nthese, a resolution function chooses the most conservative high-level maneuver.\nThe second layer then reconciles the parameters into a single behaviour. To\ndemonstrate the practicality of our approach, we report results of its\nimplementation in a level-3 autonomous vehicle and its field test in an urban\nenvironment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JxfZr-0DujkM3uU5BIohviQS8Bu-vIccuF4S-4XaAKI","pdfSize":"1483188"}
