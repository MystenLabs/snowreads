One factor may be nationality, a\ncomplex social characteristic that is linked to ethnicity, culture, and other\nfactors of identity that can be embedded in the visual design of robots. Guided\nby social identity theory (SIT), we explored the notion of \"mukokuseki,\" a\nvisual design characteristic defined by the absence of visual cues to national\nand ethnic identity in Japanese cultural exports. In a two-phase categorization\nstudy (n=212), American (n=110) and Japanese (n=92) participants rated a random\nselection of nine robot stimuli from America and Japan, plus multinational\nPepper. We found evidence of made-in and two kinds of mukokuseki effects. We\noffer suggestions for the visual design of mukokuseki robots that may interact\nwith people from diverse backgrounds. Our findings have implications for robots\nand social identity, the viability of robotic exports, and the use of robots\ninternationally.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ZtQO-Uq0SJ-c43cmJOxBd1-jkuiMHze0D9SlpukZ4g8","pdfSize":"618985"}
