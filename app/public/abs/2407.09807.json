While\nstreaming single-channel end-to-end ASR has been extensively studied, streaming\nME2E ASR is limited in exploration. Additionally, recent studies call attention\nto the gap between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) tests and\ndoing realistic evaluations. This paper focuses on two research problems:\nrealizing streaming ME2E ASR and improving OOD generalization. We propose the\nCUSIDE-array method, which integrates the recent CUSIDE methodology (Chunking,\nSimulating Future Context and Decoding) into the neural beamformer approach of\nME2E ASR. It enables streaming processing of both front-end and back-end with a\ntotal latency of 402ms. The CUSIDE-array ME2E models are shown to achieve\nsuperior streaming results in both ID and OOD tests. Realistic evaluations\nconfirm the advantage of CUSIDE-array in its capability to consume\nsingle-channel data to improve OOD generalization via back-end pre-training and\nME2E fine-tuning.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
