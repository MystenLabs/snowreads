These solutions\ncorrespond to specific values of the constant $\\lambda$, and represent\ndifferent compactness states of the corresponding stars, though only those made\nof quark matter can be regarded as physical. The latter modify the compactness\n(Buchdahl) limit of neutron stars upwards for $\\lambda>0$ until saturating the\none of black holes. Our results show that it is possible to find useful\ninsights on stellar structure in this class of theories, a fact that could be\nused for obtaining constraints on limiting masses such as the minimum hydrogen\nburning mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
