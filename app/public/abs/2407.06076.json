Yet,\nthere has been limited focus on understanding the complexity of the myriad\nfeatures that models learn. In this work, we introduce a new metric for\nquantifying feature complexity, based on $\\mathscr{V}$-information and\ncapturing whether a feature requires complex computational transformations to\nbe extracted. Using this $\\mathscr{V}$-information metric, we analyze the\ncomplexities of 10,000 features, represented as directions in the penultimate\nlayer, that were extracted from a standard ImageNet-trained vision model. Our\nstudy addresses four key questions: First, we ask what features look like as a\nfunction of complexity and find a spectrum of simple to complex features\npresent within the model. Second, we ask when features are learned during\ntraining. We find that simpler features dominate early in training, and more\ncomplex features emerge gradually. Third, we investigate where within the\nnetwork simple and complex features flow, and find that simpler features tend\nto bypass the visual hierarchy via residual connections. Fourth, we explore the\nconnection between features complexity and their importance in driving the\nnetworks decision. We find that complex features tend to be less important.\nSurprisingly, important features become accessible at earlier layers during\ntraining, like a sedimentation process, allowing the model to build upon these\nfoundational elements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
