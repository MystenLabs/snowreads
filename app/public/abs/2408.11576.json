Pivoting\nFrequency-Modulated Continuous Wave radars are an emerging sensing modality for\nSLAM in this kind of environment. However, the complex noise characteristics of\nradar SLAM makes, particularly indoor, applications computationally demanding\nand slow. In this work, we introduce a novel radar SLAM framework, RaNDT SLAM,\nthat operates fast and generates accurate robot trajectories. The method is\nbased on the Normal Distributions Transform augmented by radar intensity\nmeasures. Motion estimation is based on fusion of motion model, IMU data, and\nregistration of the intensity-augmented Normal Distributions Transform. We\nevaluate RaNDT SLAM in a new benchmark dataset and the Oxford Radar RobotCar\ndataset. The new dataset contains indoor and outdoor environments besides\nmultiple sensing modalities (LiDAR, radar, and IMU).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
