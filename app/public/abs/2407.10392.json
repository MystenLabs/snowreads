Variation of coefficients leads to a family of smooth complete\ngenus $g$ curves carrying a canonical algebraic $K_2$-class over a\n$g$-dimensional base $S$, hence to an extension of admissible variations of MHS\n(or normal function) on $S$. We prove that the $\\mathbb{R}$-split locus of this\nextension is finite. Consequently, the torsion locus of the normal function and\nthe $A$-polynomial locus for the family of curves are also finite.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
