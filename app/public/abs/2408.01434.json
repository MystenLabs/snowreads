In\nthis study, we analyzed maternal emotional state by modeling maternal emotion\nregulation reflected in smiles. The dataset comprises N=94 videos of\napproximately 3 plus or minus 1-minutes, capturing free play interactions\nbetween 6 and 12-month-old infants and their mothers. Corresponding demographic\ndetails of self-reported maternal mental health provide variables for\ndetermining mothers' relations to emotions measured during free play. In this\nwork, we employ diverse methodological approaches to explore the temporal\nevolution of maternal smiles. Our findings reveal a correlation between the\ntemporal dynamics of mothers' smiles and their emotional state. Furthermore, we\nidentify specific smile features that correlate with maternal emotional state,\nthereby enabling informed inferences with existing literature on general smile\nanalysis. This study offers insights into emotional labor, defined as the\nmanagement of one's own emotions for the benefit of others, and emotion\nregulation entailed in mother-infant interactions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"05DbRHrwlYu6VXkL2leNl0II4TAaQqE6IS3JBByDtgg","pdfSize":"798660"}
