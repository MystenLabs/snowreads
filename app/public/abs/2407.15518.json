In particular, for any $0<\\epsilon\\leq 1$ we show that\none can construct in $O\\left(n\\log (1/\\epsilon)\\right)$ time, an equitable\npartition $P=U_1\\uplus \\ldots\\uplus U_K$ into $K=O(1/\\epsilon^{d+1+\\delta})$\nsubsets, for any $0<\\delta$, so that all but $\\epsilon$-fraction of the\n$k$-tuples $U_{i_1},\\ldots,U_{i_k}$ are {\\it homogeneous}: we have that either\n$U_{i_1}\\times\\ldots\\times U_{i_k}\\subseteq E$ or $(U_{i_1}\\times\\ldots\\times\nU_{i_k})\\cap E=\\emptyset$. If the points of $P$ can be perturbed in a general\nposition, the bound improves to $O(1/\\epsilon^{d+1})$, and the partition is\nattained via a {\\it single partitioning polynomial} (albeit, at expense of a\npossible increase in worst-case running time). In contrast to the previous such\nregularity lemmas which were established by Fox, Gromov, Lafforgue, Naor, and\nPach and, subsequently, Fox, Pach and Suk, our partition of $P$ does not depend\non the edge set $E$ provided its semi-algebraic description complexity does not\nexceed a certain constant. As a by-product, we show that in any $k$-partite\n$k$-uniform hypergraph $(P_1\\uplus\\ldots\\uplus P_k,E)$ of bounded\nsemi-algebraic description complexity in ${\\mathbb R}^d$ and with $|E|\\geq\n\\epsilon \\prod_{i=1}^k|P_i|$ edges, one can find, in expected time\n$O\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^k\\left(|P_i|+1/\\epsilon)\\right)\\log (1/\\epsilon)\\right)$,\nsubsets $Q_i\\subseteq P_i$ of cardinality $|Q_i|\\geq\n|P_i|/\\epsilon^{d+1+\\delta}$, so that $Q_1\\times\\ldots\\times Q_k\\subseteq E$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
