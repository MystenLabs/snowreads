Secondly it controls the runtime of a\nclass of classical simulation algorithms, which are state-of-the-art for\nsimulating quantum circuits formed mostly of FLO unitaries and promoted to\nuniversality by the addition of ``magic states''. It is therefore interesting\nto understand the scaling behaviour of the extent as magic states are added to\na circuit. In this work we solve this problem for the case of $4$-qubit parity\neigenstates. We show that the FLO extent of a tensor product of any pure state\nand a $4$ qubit parity eigenstate is the product of the extents of the two\ntensor factors. Applying this result recursively one proves a conjecture that\nthe extent is multiplicative for arbitrary tensor products of $4$ qubit magic\nstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
