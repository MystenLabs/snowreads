Specifically, we\npresent two approaches based on random forests: the Generalized Mixed Effects\nRandom Forest (GMERF) and a Mixed Effects Random Forest (MERF), both tailored\nto address challenges associated with count outcomes, particularly\noverdispersion. Our analysis reveals that the MERF, which does not assume a\nPoisson distribution to model the mean behavior of count data, excels in\nscenarios of severe overdispersion. Conversely, the GMERF performs best under\nconditions where Poisson distribution assumptions are moderately met.\nAdditionally, we introduce and evaluate three bootstrap methodologies - one\nparametric and two non-parametric - designed to assess the reliability of point\nestimators for area-level means. The effectiveness of these methodologies is\ntested through model-based (and design-based) simulations and applied to a\nreal-world dataset from the state of Guerrero in Mexico, demonstrating their\nrobustness and potential for practical applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
