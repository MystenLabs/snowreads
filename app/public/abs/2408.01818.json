Our study highlights the\nrole of this interaction in inducing dynamical friction between dark matter and\nstars, which can significantly influence the evolution of compact stellar\nsystems. Using the star cluster in Eridanus II as a case study, we derive a new\nstringent upper bound on the interaction strength $\\tilde{\\alpha}\\leq 333.7$\nfor the interaction range $\\lambda = 1$ pc. This constraint is independent of\nthe dark matter mass and can improve the existing model-independent limits on\n$\\tilde{\\alpha}$ by a few orders of magnitude. Furthermore, we observe that the\nconstraint is insensitive to the mass of the stellar system and the dark matter\ndensity in the stellar system as long as the system is dark matter dominated.\nThis new approach can be applied to many other stellar systems, and we obtain\ncomparable constraints from compact stellar halos observed in ultrafaint dwarf\ngalaxies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
