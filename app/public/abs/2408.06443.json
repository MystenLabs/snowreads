By using some\ngeometry and/or systems of linear equations, we constructively prove that it is\nimpossible to interpolate arbitrary data on any three or more straight lines by\nsums of ridge functions with two fixed directions. The general case with more\nstraight lines and more directions is reduced to the problem of existence of\ncertain sets in the union of these lines.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
