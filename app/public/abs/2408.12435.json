Here, we report the experimental observation of\nRA-ICD in aqueous solution. We show that for solvated Ca$^{2+}$ ions, the\nemission can be very efficiently controlled by tuning the photon energy of\nexciting X-rays to inner-shell resonances of the ions. Our results provide the\nnext step from proving RA-ICD in relatively simple prototype systems to\nunderstanding the relevance and potential applications of ICD in real-life\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
