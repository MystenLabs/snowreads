To\nformulate the proposed guidance, we developed and explained a supervised\nMachine Learning (ML) model, that is used to formulate the guidance and control\nthe diversity of the solution during the optimization process. We propose a\nmetaheuristic algorithm combining neighborhood search and a novel mechanism of\nhybrid split and path relinking to implement the proposed guidance. The\nproposed guidance has proven to give a statistically significant improvement to\nthe proposed metaheuristic algorithm when solving CVRP. Moreover, the proposed\nguided metaheuristic is also capable of producing competitive solutions among\nstate-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BOSg6eX-aHzcUQNjxcgpY-LgF1-ChsJIYA5Q_shg6Dw","pdfSize":"2495845"}
