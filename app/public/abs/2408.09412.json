The weighted pseudoinverse $A_{ML}^{\\dag}$\nis the matrix that maps $b$ to the minimum 2-norm solution of this GLS problem.\nBy introducing a linear operator induced by $\\{A, M, L\\}$ between two\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, we show that the minimum 2-norm solution of\nthe GLS problem is equivalent to the minimum norm solution of a linear least\nsquares problem involving this linear operator, and $A_{ML}^{\\dag}$ can be\nexpressed as the composition of the Moore-Penrose pseudoinverse of this linear\noperator and an orthogonal projector. With this new interpretation, we\nestablish the generalized Moore-Penrose equations that completely characterize\nthe weighted pseudoinverse, give a closed-form expression of the weighted\npseudoinverse using the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD), and\npropose a generalized LSQR (gLSQR) algorithm for iteratively solving the GLS\nproblem. We construct several numerical examples to test the proposed iterative\nalgorithm for solving GLS problems. Our results highlight the close connections\nbetween GLS, weighted pseudoinverse, GSVD and gLSQR, providing new tools for\nboth analysis and computations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"srmITwfT2cLTAcDDEN2RKdCf1DTaH4mqNcpqwpkEYNU","pdfSize":"1012195"}
