We first make use of a\nWentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation of the Dirac equation in curved\nspacetime to extract the corresponding Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon equations\nthat describe the deviation from geodesic motion as well as the spin precession\nof such particles. We then discuss, in light of our results, the case of\nflavour neutrinos which are, by nature, a superposition of mass eigenstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
