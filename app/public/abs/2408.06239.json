This compound is formed X-ray\ndiffraction pure, with a complete conversion within just over 2 h from\nflux-grown LiCrTe2 crystals using diluted acids. Due to the availability of\nhigh-quality single crystals, we have confirmed the crystal structure for the\nfirst time by single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiments. For the acid\ndeintercalated 1T-CrTe2 crystals, we find long-range ferromagnetic order with a\nCurie temperature of $T_{\\rm C}$ = 318 K. We further revealed the magnetic\nstructure of 1T-CrTe2 using low-temperature neutron powder diffraction\nexperiments and determine the magnetic Hamiltonian using density functional\ntheory. X-ray diffraction experiments of post-annealed crystals suggest a\nthermal stability of 1T-CrTe2 up to at least 100 {\\deg}C. Our findings expand\nthe synthesis methods for 1T-CrTe2 crystals, which hold promise for integrated\nroom-temperature spintronics applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
