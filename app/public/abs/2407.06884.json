The\nvelocity field is $u = \\nabla^\\perp H$, where H is an autonomous Hamiltonian\nwhose level sets are Jordan curves foliating the domain. We focus on the high\nP\\'eclet number regime ($Pe := \\nu^{-1} \\gg 1$), where two distinct processes\nunfold on well separated time-scales: streamline averaging and standard\ndiffusion. For a specific class of Hamiltonians with one non-degenerate\nelliptic point (including perturbed radial flows), we prove exponential\nconvergence of the solution to its streamline average on a subdiffusive\ntime-scale $T_\\nu \\ll \\nu^{-1}$ ,up to a small correction related to the shape\nof the streamlines. The time-scale $T_\\nu$ is determined by the behavior of the\nperiod function around the elliptic point. To establish this result, we\nintroduce a model problem arising naturally from the difference between the\nsolution and its streamline average. We use pseudospectral estimates to infer\ndecay in the model problem, and, in fact, this analysis extends to a broader\nclass of Hamiltonian flows. Finally, we perform an asymptotic expansion of the\nfull solution, revealing that the leading terms consist of the streamline\naverage and the solution of the model problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
