Yet, most existing methods apply PCA to a\nsingle dataset whereas multi-source data-i.e. multiple related datasets\nrequiring joint analysis-arise across many scientific areas. We introduce a\nnovel PCA methodology that simultaneously (i) selects important features, (ii)\nallows for the detection of global sparse patterns across multiple data sources\nas well as local source-specific patterns, and (iii) is resistant to outliers.\nTo this end, we develop a regularization problem with a penalty that\naccommodates global-local structured sparsity patterns, and where the ssMRCD\nestimator is used as plug-in to permit joint outlier-robust analysis across\nmultiple data sources. We provide an efficient implementation of our proposal\nvia the Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier and illustrate its practical\nadvantages in simulation and in applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
