Users opinions are\ninfluenced by both social interactions and recommended content. We leverage\nonline feedback optimization to design a recommender system that trades-off\nbetween maximizing engagement and minimizing polarization. The recommender\nsystem is agnostic about users' opinion, clicking behavior, and social\ninteractions, and solely relies on clicks. We establish optimality and\nclosed-loop stability of the resulting feedback interconnection between the\nsocial platform and the recommender system. We numerically validate our\nalgorithm when the user population follows an extended Friedkin--Johnsen model.\nWe observe that network-aware recommendations significantly reduce polarization\nwithout compromising user engagement.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
