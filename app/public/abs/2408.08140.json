For this fractional\nmodel we investigate the existence and uniqueness of solution of initial value\nproblem, asymptotic stability of its equilibrium states, stabilization problem\nusing appropriate control and numerical integration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
