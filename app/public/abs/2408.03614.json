As they cool, the\neffective temperatures of the white dwarfs becomes so low that no spectral\nlines can be seen in the visible wavelength range. If their atmospheres are not\npolluted by the debris of a planetary system, these cool white dwarfs have\nfeatureless optical spectra. Until quite recently, very little was known about\nthe incidence of magnetic fields in these objects. However, when observed with\npolarimetric techniques, a significant number of featureless white dwarfs\nreveal strong magnetic fields in their optical continuum spectra. Measuring the\noccurrence rate and strength of magnetic fields in old white dwarfs may help us\nto understand how these fields are generated and evolve. We report the results\nof an ongoing survey of cool white dwarfs with the high-precision broad-band\npolarimeter DIPOL-UF, which is deployed at the Nordic Optical Telescope on La\nPalma, Spain. This survey has led to the firm discovery of 13 cool magnetic\nwhite dwarfs in the solar neighborhood so far, including six new detections\nthat we report in this paper.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"o5DSzAQLJGNgmJiwZckkn9wp1rX4HdKCgEzmuNpeqlY","pdfSize":"269159"}
