However, compliance varies due to\nits impact on daily life. This paper explores the effects of compliance on\nsocial distancing effectiveness through a \"social distancing game,\" where\ncommunity members make decisions based on personal utility. We conducted\nnumerical experiments to evaluate how different policy settings for social\ndistancing affect disease transmission.\n  Our findings suggest several key points for developing effective social\ndistancing policies. Firstly, while generally effective, overly strict policies\nmay lead to noncompliance and reduced effectiveness. Secondly, the public\nhealth benefits of social distancing need to be balanced against social costs,\nemphasizing policy efficiency. Lastly, for diseases with low reinfection risk,\na segmented policy exempting immune individuals could lessen both infections\nand socioeconomic costs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0qPGkVaNw7KyisfGaeY09uzCHm0M1vhPL4BmwIOOuzk","pdfSize":"2597045"}
