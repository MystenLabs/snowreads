This is possible since the nodes, where the beam equations are coupled,\nare zero-dimensional objects. To discretize the beam network model, we propose\na hybridizable discontinuous Galerkin method that can achieve arbitrary orders\nof convergence under mesh refinement without increasing the size of the global\nsystem matrix. As a preconditioner for the typically very poorly conditioned\nglobal system matrix, we employ a two-level overlapping additive Schwarz\nmethod. We prove uniform convergence of the corresponding preconditioned\nconjugate gradient method under appropriate connectivity assumptions on the\nnetwork. Numerical experiments support the theoretical findings of this work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XSxur6NV3Dil4KLoTZ_R5XgXFySuWyEvQMgcmsgEgZg","pdfSize":"3969973"}
