This category can be defined to\nencompass non-Kerr black holes both within and beyond general relativity, as\nwell as horizonless compact objects such as boson stars. In order to model\nobservational signatures and identify possible detections, it is crucial to\nunderstand the interaction between these objects and their surrounding medium,\nusually plasmas described by the equations of general relativistic\nmagnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD). To this end, we review the existent literature on\nGRMHD simulations of accretion onto these objects. These cover a variety of\nobjects and accretion patterns. We conclude by listing possible directions to\ncontinue exploring this relatively young field.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Cykl-hTIlK86vdcl6nfYdLGk5d6JMhV42GTFUsMvqjA","pdfSize":"1890266"}
