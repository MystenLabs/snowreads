However, the inherent biases in AI algorithms hinder\nthis improvement by unintentionally perpetuating prejudice against specific\ndemographics, especially in human-centered applications like education. This\nsurvey delves deeply into the developing topic of algorithmic fairness in\neducational contexts, providing a comprehensive evaluation of the diverse\nliterature on fairness, bias, and ethics in AI-driven educational applications.\nIt identifies the common forms of biases, such as data-related, algorithmic,\nand user-interaction, that fundamentally undermine the accomplishment of\nfairness in AI teaching aids. By outlining existing techniques for mitigating\nthese biases, ranging from varied data gathering to algorithmic fairness\ninterventions, the survey emphasizes the critical role of ethical\nconsiderations and legal frameworks in shaping a more equitable educational\nenvironment. Furthermore, it guides readers through the complexities of\nfairness measurements, methods, and datasets, shedding light on the way to bias\nreduction. Despite these gains, this survey highlights long-standing issues,\nsuch as achieving a balance between fairness and accuracy, as well as the need\nfor diverse datasets. Overcoming these challenges and ensuring the ethical and\nfair use of AI's promise in education call for a collaborative,\ninterdisciplinary approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LRSrhBpik5XJndK5Y0oTuyduYHj0O-wfNClaptkeJUo","pdfSize":"877857"}
