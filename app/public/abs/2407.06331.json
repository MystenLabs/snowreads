We propose a new approach of utilizing a Character-level\nTransformer model for Sanskrit Word Segmentation (CharSS). We perform\nexperiments on three benchmark datasets to compare the performance of our\nmethod against existing methods. On the UoH+SandhiKosh dataset, our method\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art system by an absolute gain of 6.72\npoints in split prediction accuracy. On the hackathon dataset, our method\nachieves a gain of 2.27 points over the current SOTA system in terms of perfect\nmatch metric. We also propose a use-case of Sanskrit-based segments for a\nlinguistically informed translation of technical terms to lexically similar\nlow-resource Indian languages. In two separate experimental settings for this\ntask, we achieve an average improvement of 8.46 and 6.79 chrF++ scores,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
