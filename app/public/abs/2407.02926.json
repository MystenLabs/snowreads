We\nincorporate Genant's semi-quantitative criteria as a differentiable rule-based\nmeans of classifying both vertebra fracture grade and morphology. Unlike\nprevious work, XVFA provides explainable classifications relatable to current\nclinical methodology, as well as uncertainty estimations, while at the same\ntime surpassing state-of-the art methods with a vertebra-level sensitivity of\n93% and end-to-end AUC of 97% in a challenging setting. Moreover, we compare\nintra-reader agreement with model uncertainty estimates, with model reliability\non par with human annotators.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
