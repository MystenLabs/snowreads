Consequently, we see that $M_d(G)$ is\nisometrically isomorphic to the dual space of $X_d(G)$, the completion of\n$L^1(G)$ in the dual of $M_d(G)$. We also show that\n$M_d$-type-approximation-properties are inherited to lattices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"um9GtSjagAbGM3k0sF0JD7kLdh1uokgroZ84Wf7bUAs","pdfSize":"196280"}
