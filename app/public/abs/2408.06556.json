Here, an improved\npoint-to-surface contact model is proposed for PD with high accuracy. First,\nthe outer surface is identified using the eigenvalue method and then we\nconstruct a Verlet list to identify potential contact particle pairs\nefficiently. Subsequently, a point-to-surface contact search algorithm is\nutilized to determine precise contact locations with the penalty function\nmethod calculating the contact force. Finally, the accuracy of this\npoint-to-surface contact model is validated through several representative\ncontact examples. The results demonstrate that the point-to-surface contact\nmodel model can predict contact forces and deformations with high accuracy,\naligning well with the classical Hertz contact theory solutions. This work\npresents a contact model for PD that automatically recognizes external surface\nparticles and accurately calculates the contact force, which provides guidance\nfor the study of multi-body contact as well as complex contact situations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
