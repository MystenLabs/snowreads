Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical\nscenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail\nin the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing\nmystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the\nself-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We\nperform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to\nshow that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a\nquasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends\non $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically\nforced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like\nelectric field, then $D(v)\\sim v^4$ for $\\sigma<v<\\omega_{\\mathrm{P}}/k$, with\n$\\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\\omega_{\\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and\n$k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the\nquasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\\left(d+2\\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions\n($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$\ntail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only\nalters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower\nthan the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\\omega_{\\mathrm{P}}/k$)\nexperience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law\nsuppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian\nDF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v<\\sigma$) eventually also\nheats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms.\nWe definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle\ntreatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
