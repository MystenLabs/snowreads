The design incorporates\nmultiple Atmospheric Dispersion Correctors (ADCs) and tip-tilt mirrors that\nreceive non-telecentric input from individual targets and direct it to the\nADCs. Here, we introduce a mechanical design for the fiber positioner that\naccommodates the optics and operates in a curved focal plane with a Radius of\nCurvature (R) of 3m. This mechanical design provides four degrees of freedom to\naccess the focal volume, enhancing targeting efficiency. The proposed design\nand an efficient target allocation algorithm ensure a targeting efficiency of\napproximately 80-100% for a primary observation session. We also present a\nmethodology for target assignment, positioning, and quantification based on\nsequential and Monte Carlo (MC) algorithms. This method has been tested on\nrealistic fields with varying target densities to validate its performance.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
