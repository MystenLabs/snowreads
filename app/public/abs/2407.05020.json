Each player represents a region which is assumed to choose\nits control to implement a tradeoff between socio-economic aspects and health\naspects; the control comprises both epidemic control physical measures and\ninfluence actions on the region opinion. The Generalized Nash equilibrium\n$(\\mathrm{GNE})$ analysis of the proposed game model is conducted. The direct\nanalysis of this game of practical interest is non-trivial but it turns out\nthat one can construct an auxiliary game which allows one: to prove existence\nand uniqueness; to compute the GNE and the optimal centralized solution\n(sum-cost) of the game. These results allow us to assess numerically the loss\n(measured in terms of Price of Anarchy ($\\mathrm{PoA}$)) induced by\ndecentralization with or without taking into account the opinion dynamics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
