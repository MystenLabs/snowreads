Here we develop a\nlarge-$N$ mean-field theory of a strongly coupled spin-$\\tfrac{1}{2}$ quantum\nimpurity in a conventional $s$-wave superconductor. The approach is benchmarked\nagainst Wilson's numerical renormalization group (NRG). While the large-$N$\nmethod is not applicable in the weak-coupling regime where the Kondo\ntemperature $T_K$ is smaller than the superconducting gap $\\Delta$, it performs\nvery well in the strong coupling regime where $T_K \\gtrsim \\Delta$, thus\nallowing to obtain a reasonably accurate description of experimentally relevant\nquantities. The latter includes the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov subgap\nstates, their spectral weight, as well as the local density of continuum\nstates. The method provides a reliable analytical tool that complements other\nperturbative and non-perturbative methods, and can be extended to more complex\nimpurity models for which NRG may be not easily applicable.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
