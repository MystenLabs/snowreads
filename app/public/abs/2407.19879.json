When the ferroelectric is in\na heterostructure, this behavior yields a voltage amplification in the other\nelements, an effect that could be leveraged in low-power electronic devices.\nInterestingly, the mentioned voltage amplification should have an accompanying\nelastic effect. Specifically, in the typical case that the materials in contact\nwith the ferroelectric are non-polar dielectrics, those should present an\nenhanced electrostrictive response. Here we use atomistic simulations - of\nmodel PbTiO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ ferroelectric/dielectric superlattices displaying\nnegative capacitance - to show that this is indeed the case: we reveal the\nenhanced elastic response of the dielectric layer and show that it is clearly\nlinked to the voltage amplification. We argue that this \"elastic amplification\"\ncould serve as a convenient experimental fingerprint for negative capacitance.\nFurther, we propose that it may have interest on its own, e.g. for the\ndevelopment of low-power electromechanical actuators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
