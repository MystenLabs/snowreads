The\nphilosophy of this library is to achieve a balance of readability and usability\nfor new-comers, while at the same time providing powerful algorithms for\nexperts. The focus is on MPS algorithms for 1D and 2D lattices, such as DMRG\nground state search, as well as dynamics using TEBD, TDVP, or MPO evolution.\nThis article is a companion to the recent version 1.0 release of TeNPy and\ngives a brief overview of the package.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DBfliJ-guv2KJgO8Bet2i-nP43Ik3mamCKeQRJuP0jg","pdfSize":"1059075","txDigest":"9qJqXFGpYzEmFRbGT7AdcVh62XqQmMajRm2sZnM1yK3W","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
