This work is devoted to exploring the interplay between\nthe effects of a constant external electric field and confining potential on\nheavy-flavor mesons. As the corresponding vector potential linearly depends on\none spatial coordinate for a constant electric field, it might be able to\novercome the linear confining potential of QCD and induce deconfinement. To\nperform analytic calculations and for comparison, one and two dimensional\nsystems are studied together with the realistic three dimensional systems. The\none dimensional Schr$\\ddot{\\text o}$dinger equation can be solved analytically\nwith the help of Airy functions, and deconfinement is indeed realized when the\nelectric field is larger than the string tension. Focus on the confining case,\nthe two and three dimensional Schr$\\ddot{\\text o}$dinger equations can be\nsolved analytically in large $r$ limit with the help of elliptic cosine/sine\nfunctions, and the wave functions are dominated by the region antiparallel to\nthe electric field. When a more realistic potential is applied, a non-monotonic\nfeature is found for $\\Upsilon(2S)$ and $\\Upsilon(3S)$-like mesons with\nincreasing electric field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0zzE1IsGj6Q77ghRLXG9PRpNB0bs4ADY9Z6LbdRu7bg","pdfSize":"860193"}
