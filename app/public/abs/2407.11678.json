Unlike classical GANs, CycleGAN not only\ntransforms data between two unpaired distributions but also ensures the\nmappings are consistent, which is encouraged by the cycle-consistency term\nunique to CycleGAN. The increasing complexity of model structure and the\naddition of the cycle-consistency term in CycleGAN present new challenges for\nerror analysis. By considering the impact of both the model architecture and\ntraining procedure, the risk is decomposed into two terms: approximation error\nand estimation error. These two error terms are analyzed separately and\nultimately combined by considering the trade-off between them. Each component\nis rigorously analyzed; the approximation error through constructing\napproximations of the optimal transport maps, and the estimation error through\nestablishing an upper bound using Rademacher complexity. Our analysis not only\nisolates these errors but also explores the trade-offs between them, which\nprovides a theoretical insights of how CycleGAN's architecture and training\nprocedures influence its performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
