They provide\nan attractive way of analyzing dynamic systems in real-time, taking into\naccount the limitations of traditional approaches such as Markov Chain Monte\nCarlo methods, which are not well suited to data that arrives incrementally.\nThis paper reviews and explores the application of Sequential Monte Carlo in\ndynamic disease modeling, highlighting its capacity for online inference and\nreal-time adaptation to evolving disease dynamics. The integration of kernel\ndensity approximation techniques within the stochastic\nSusceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) compartment model is examined,\ndemonstrating the algorithm's effectiveness in monitoring time-varying\nparameters such as the effective reproduction number. Case studies, including\nsimulations with synthetic data and analysis of real-world COVID-19 data from\nIreland, demonstrate the practical applicability of this approach for informing\ntimely public health interventions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hfciUrlR3OQSAvieb66niTrVkn2QsbL77xRrRli1Flg","pdfSize":"2258256"}
