Next, it is shown that the closely related canonical\nform of the Clifford group can be computed in time $O(n^3)$ for $n$ qubits,\nwhich improves upon the previously known time $O(n^6)$. Finally, the related\nproblem of finite blocklength bounds for stabilizer codes and Pauli noise is\nstudied. A finite blocklength refinement of the hashing bound is derived, and\nit is shown that no argument that uses guessing the error as a substitute for\nguessing the coset can lead to a significantly better achievability bound.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
