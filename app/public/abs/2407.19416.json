Given a global\nsolution $u$ to the scalar wave equation with sufficiently small $C_c^\\infty$\ninitial data, we derive an asymptotic formula for this global solution inside\nthe light cone (i.e. for $|x|<t$). It involves the scattering data obtained in\nthe author's asymptotic completeness result in arXiv:2105.11573. Using this\nasymptotic formula, we prove that $u$ must vanish under some decaying\nassumptions on $u$ or its scattering data, provided that the wave equation\nviolates the null condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
