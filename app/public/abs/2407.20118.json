The primary uncertainty of\nthis phenomenon may originate from the magnetic field within the jet of the\nblazar. While many studies have explored the effects of ALP-photon oscillations\nusing typical values for jet magnetic field parameters, it is important to\nrecognize that these parameters can be constrained by multi-wavelength\nobservations. In this study, we utilize the high energy $\\gamma$-ray spectrum\nof Mrk 421 obtained from MAGIC and Fermi-LAT observations. By employing\nmulti-wavelength fitting with a one-zone synchrotron self-Compton model, we\nderive the parameters characterizing the magnetic field model within the jet,\nand investigate their impacts on the ALP constraints.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
