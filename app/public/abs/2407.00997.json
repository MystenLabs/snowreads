The increasing prevalence of conversational interfaces\nadopting this search paradigm challenges traditional information retrieval\napproaches, stressing the importance of better understanding the engineering\nprocess of developing these systems. We undertook a systematic literature\nreview to investigate the links between theoretical studies and technical\nimplementations of conversational search systems. Our review identifies\nreal-world application scenarios, system architectures, and functional\ncomponents. We consolidate our results by presenting a layered architecture\nframework and explaining the core functions of conversational search systems.\nFurthermore, we reflect on our findings in light of the rapid progress in large\nlanguage models, discussing their capabilities, limitations, and directions for\nfuture research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
