Most of the literature uses\nthe language models as world models to define the search space, forgoing\nsoundness for the sake of flexibility. A recent work, Thought of Search (ToS),\nproposed defining the search space with code, having the language models\nproduce that code. ToS requires a human in the loop, collaboratively producing\na sound successor function and goal test. The result, however, is worth the\neffort: all the tested datasets were solved with 100% accuracy. At the same\ntime LLMs have demonstrated significant progress in code generation and\nrefinement for complex reasoning tasks. In this work, we automate ToS\n(AutoToS), completely taking the human out of the loop of solving planning\nproblems. AutoToS guides the language model step by step towards the generation\nof sound and complete search components, through feedback from both generic and\ndomain specific unit tests. We achieve 100% accuracy, with minimal feedback\niterations, using LLMs of various sizes on all evaluated domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
