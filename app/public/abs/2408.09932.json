Many\nmechanisms can trigger warp formation, including tidal interactions. The\ninteractions with satellites distort the edges of the disc and can also change\nthe central morphology, impacting, for example, the development of a galactic\nbar. In mergers events, the bar can be weakened or even destroyed. In this\nstudy, we aim to compare barred and non-barred galaxy models and their\nsusceptibility to warping. To analyze the effects of induced warps, we used\n$N$-body simulations of a barred and a non-barred central galaxy interacting\nwith satellites of varying masses ($0.1 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$,\n$0.5 \\times 10^{10} \\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$ and $1 \\times 10^{10}\n\\mathrm{M_{\\odot}}$) and initial orbital radii (10, 20 and 30 kpc). We also ran\nisolated simulations of the central galaxies for comparison. We found that the\ninduced warps are stronger in the barred galaxy compared with the non-barred\ngalaxy, in perturbed and isolated models. In addition, the masses of the\nsatellites determine the level of destruction of the bar and the intensity of\nthe induced warp. The time in which the bar will be weakened or destroyed\ndepends on the orbital radius of the satellite.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
