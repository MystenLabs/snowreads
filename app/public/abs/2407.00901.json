Calculations of some low-lying\nKac determinants are made, providing us with a conjecture for the factorization\nproperty of the Kac determinants. The analysis of the screening operators gives\na supporting evidence for our conjecture. It is shown that by taking the limit\n$q\\rightarrow 1$ of ${\\mathcal{SV}ir\\!}_{q,k}$ we recover the ordinary\n${\\mathcal N}=2$ superconformal algebra.
