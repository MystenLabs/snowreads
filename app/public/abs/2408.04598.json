Nonetheless, it bears crucial significance as it profoundly impacts\nthe efficiency of QKD network services, thereby shaping its suitability for\ndiverse applications. In this article, we analyze the effectiveness of key\nstorage designs developed through practical testbeds and propose a novel key\nstorage design to increase the effectiveness of key creation and supply. All\nkey storage designs underwent analysis using network simulation tools, and the\nfindings demonstrate that the novel key storage design surpasses existing\napproaches in terms of performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
