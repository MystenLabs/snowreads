Examples are known of multiple stable line defect\nConformal Field Theories (dCFTs) existing simultaneously, unlike the case of\nnormal multiscalar field theories where a theorem by Michel guarantees that the\nstable fixed point is the unique global minimum of a so-called $A$-function. We\nprove that a suitable modification of Michel's theorem survives for line defect\ntheories, with fixed points locally rather than globally minimizing an\n$A$-function along a specified surface in coupling space and provide a novel\nclassification of the fixed points in the hypertetrahedral line defect model.\nFor surface defects Michel's theorem survives almost untouched, and we explore\nbulk models for which the symmetry preserving defect is the unique stable\npoint. In the case of interface theories, we prove that for any critical bulk\nmodel there can exist no fixed points stable under generic deformations for\n$N\\geq 6$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
