Mele, A.A. Mele, L. Bittel, J. Eisert, V. Giovannetti,\nL. Lami, L. Leone, S.F.E. Oliviero, ArXiv:2405.01431, estimates for the\ntrace-norm distance between two quantum Gaussian states in terms of the mean\nvectors and covariance matrices were derived and used to evaluate the number of\nelements in the $\\varepsilon -$net in the set of energy-constrained Gaussian\nstates. In the present paper we obtain different estimates; our proof is based\non a fidelity-like quantity which we call states overlap, and is more\nstraightforward leading to estimates which are sometimes even more stringent,\nespecially in the cases of pure or gauge-invariant states. They do not depend\non number of modes and hence can be extended to the case of bosonic field with\ninfinite number of modes. These derivations are not aimed to replace the useful\ninequalities from ArXiv:2405.01431; they just show an alternative approach to\nthe problem leading to different results. The problem studied in this paper can\nbe considered as a noncommutative analog of estimation of the total variance\ndistance between Gaussian probability distributions in the classical\nprobability theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
