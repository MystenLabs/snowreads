The local\nwell-posedness of classical solution is established by introducing a\n\"quasi-symmetric hyperbolic\"-\"degenerate elliptic\" coupled structure to control\nthe behavior of the velocity of the fluid near the vacuum and give some uniform\nestimates. In particular, the initial data allows vacuum in an open set and we\ndo not need any initial compatibility conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
