Global symmetries are characterised by the presence of a\nconserved current which has been shown to be of particular importance for the\nintegrability features of the theory at hand yielding numerous compact object\nsolutions. We find the general conserved current associated to global conformal\nsymmetry of Horndeski theories. We discuss some of its properties, how it can\nbe conveniently broken by physically relevant terms and, show how it is related\nto that of shift symmetry when shift symmetry is present. Given our results, we\nconsider a particular theory and demonstrate how the presence of symmetries\nprovides integrability for the given black hole solution. We then find the\ncharged extension of the solution thanks to the conformal invariance of the\nMaxwell action.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
