Conventional identification techniques are designed primarily\nfor unconstrained systems, such as robotic manipulators. In contrast, the\ngrowing importance of legged robots that feature closed kinematic chains or\nother constraints, poses challenges to these traditional methods. This paper\nintroduces a system identification approach for constrained systems that relies\non iterative least squares to identify motor inertia and joint friction\nparameters from data. The proposed approach is validated in simulation and in\nthe real-world on Digit, which is a 20 degree-of-freedom humanoid robot built\nby Agility Robotics. In these experiments, the parameters identified by the\nproposed method enable a model-based controller to achieve better tracking\nperformance than when it uses the default parameters provided by the\nmanufacturer.
