It is\ndeveloped for applied mathematicians and engineers, and requires no previous\nbackground in quantum mechanics. The main topics of this course, in addition to\na rigorous introduction to the computational model, are: input/output models,\nquantum search, the quantum gradient algorithm, matrix manipulation algorithms,\nthe matrix multiplicative weights update framework for semidefinite\noptimization, adiabatic optimization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
