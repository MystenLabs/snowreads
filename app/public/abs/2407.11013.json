Responding to the\ncontemporary challenges, I introduce a novel deep neural network (DNN)\narchitecture that processes information using the effect of quantum tunnelling.\nI demonstrate the ability of the quantum tunnelling DNN (QT-DNN) to recognise\noptical illusions like a human. Hardware implementation of QT-DNN is expected\nto result in an inexpensive and energy-efficient neuromorphic chip suitable for\napplications in autonomous vehicles. The optical illusions recognition tests\ndeveloped in this paper should lay foundations for cognitive benchmarking tasks\nfor AI systems of the future, benefiting the fields of sociophysics and\nbehavioural science.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vdc02ItcndjEz7Dj1qL6pQYiRCGUhowtK8J0ZcixVCY","pdfSize":"1537412","objectId":"0xaef6ae5153fca2d03d4d10adfada1af3db29fc489943bdfe80d986acb1993a56","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
