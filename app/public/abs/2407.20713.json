This calibration has been performed for EURO STOXX 50 index and\nEUR/USD exchange rate with an asymptotic formula for volatility or Monte Carlo\nsimulation. Moreover, in the dynamic model we propose an original more general\nexpression for the functional parameters, specially well suited for the EUR/USD\nexchange rate case. Numerical results illustrate the expected behavior of both\nSABR models and the accuracy of the calibration. In terms of computational\ntime, when the asymptotic formula for volatility is used the speedup with\nrespect to CPU computation is around $200$ with one GPU. Furthermore, GPU\ntechnology allows the use of Monte Carlo simulation for calibration purposes,\nthe computational time with CPU being prohibitive.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
