It can be pruned\nto couple separated pairs of nodes so that when a strain is applied to one of\nthem, the other responds either in-phase or out-of-phase. This produces two\npruned networks with incompatible functions that are nearly identical but\ndiffer from each other by a set of \"mutations,\" each of which removes or adds a\nsingle bond in the network. The effect of multiple mutations is epistatic; that\nis, the effect of a mutation depends on what other mutations have already\noccurred. We generate ensembles of network pairs that differ by a fixed number,\n$M$, of discrete mutations and evaluate all $M!$ mutational paths between the\nin- and out-of phase behaviors up to $M = 14$. With a threshold response for\nthe network to be considered functional, so that non-functional networks are\ndisallowed, only some mutational pathways are viable. We find that there is a\nsurprisingly high critical response threshold above which no evolutionarily\nviable path exists between the two networks. The few remaining pathways at this\ncritical value dictate much of the behavior along the evolutionary trajectory.\nIn most cases, the mutations break up into two distinct classes. The analysis\nclarifies how the number of mutations and the position of a mutation along the\npathway affect the evolutionary outcome.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
