In the process of DM capture, deep inelastic scattering may dominate\nover elastic scattering, especially for the DM with a large momentum transfer.\nIn this work, we calculate DM-nucleon deep inelastic scattering via a vector\nmediator and estimate its contribution to the capture rate. Using the surface\ntemperature of the NSs, we derive the exclusion limits for the DM-nucleon\nscattering cross section in the mass range, $1~{\\rm GeV}<m_{\\chi}< 10^{5}~{\\rm\nGeV}$. We find the bounds for DM with the mass $\\gtrsim$ 1 GeV can be changed\nseveral times after including the deep inelastic scattering contribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
