They emerge as\neigenstates of the Tavis-Cummings Hamiltonian, a simplification of the Dicke\nmodel, which describes an assembly of two-level atoms trapped in an\nelectromagnetic cavity. In this letter, we show that in the regime where the\nfield energy is large with respect to the atomic energy splitting, precise\ncontrol of the ground state can be implemented. Specifically, pure Dicke states\ncan be selected and produced by appropriate tuning of the parameters. This\nresult may have important applications in quantum engineering and quantum\ninformation theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
