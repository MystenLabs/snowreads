We identify\nin low-symmetric wide-bandgap compounds an anion-anion antibonding coupling\n(AAAC) effect as the intrinsic factor behind hole localization, which explains\nthe extremely heavy $m_h^*$ and self-trapped hole (STH) formation observed in\ngallium oxide ($\\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$). We propose a design principle for\nachieving light holes by manipulating AAAC, demonstrating that specific strain\nconditions can reduce $m_h^*$ in $\\beta$-$Ga_{2}O_{3}$ from 4.77 $m_0$ to 0.38\n$m_0$, making it comparable to the electron mass (0.28 $m_0$), while also\nsuppressing STH. The light holes show significant anisotropy, potentially\nenabling two-dimensional transport in bulk material. This study provides a\nfundamental understanding of hole mass enhancement and STH formation in novel\nwide-bandgap materials and suggest new pathways for engineering hole\nmobilities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
