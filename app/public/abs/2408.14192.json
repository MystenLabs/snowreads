Current few-shot classification methods based on\nlocal descriptors primarily leverage underlying consistent features across\nvisible and invisible classes, facing challenges including redundant\nneighboring information, noisy representations, and limited interpretability.\nThis paper proposes a Feature Aligning Few-shot Learning Method Using Local\nDescriptors Weighted Rules (FAFD-LDWR). It innovatively introduces a\ncross-normalization method into few-shot image classification to preserve the\ndiscriminative information of local descriptors as much as possible; and\nenhances classification performance by aligning key local descriptors of\nsupport and query sets to remove background noise. FAFD-LDWR performs\nexcellently on three benchmark datasets , outperforming state-of-the-art\nmethods in both 1-shot and 5-shot settings. The designed visualization\nexperiments also demonstrate FAFD-LDWR's improvement in prediction\ninterpretability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
