In this work we conducted experiments with the goal of finding how much\nthe quality of a multilingual retrieval could be degraded if the query part of\na dual encoder is tuned on an English-only dataset (assuming scarcity of\ncross-lingual samples for the targeted domain or task). Specifically, starting\nwith a high quality multilingual embedding model, we observe that an\nEnglish-only tuning may not only preserve the original quality of the\nmultilingual retrieval, but even improve it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
