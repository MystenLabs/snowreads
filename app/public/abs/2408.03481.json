For a given\nindicator function, this filter equation was first considered by W. Layton, G.\nRebholz, and C. Trenchea to select eddies for damping based on the\nunderstanding of how nonlinearity acts in real flow problems. Numerically, this\nnonlinear filter equation was applied to the nonlinear term in the\nNavier-Stokes equations to provide a precise analysis of numerical diffusion\nand error estimates. Mathematically, the resulting alpha-model is described by\na doubly nonlinear parabolic-elliptic coupled system. We therefore undertake\nthe first theoretical study of this system by considering periodic boundary\nconditions in the spatial variable. Specifically, we address the existence and\nuniqueness of weak Leray-type solutions, their rigorous convergence to weak\nLeray solutions of the classical Navier-Stokes equations, and their long-time\ndynamics through the concept of the global attractor and some upper bounds for\nits fractal dimension. Handling the nonlinear filter equation together with the\nwell-known nonlinear transport term makes certain estimates delicate,\nparticularly when deriving upper bounds on the fractal dimension. For the\nlatter, we adapt techniques developed for hyperbolic-type equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
