State-of-the-art\nmodels often struggle to consider the data in the best way possible, intrinsic\nuncertainties, and the actual physics of the traffic. In this study, we propose\na novel framework to incorporate travel times between stations into a weighted\nadjacency matrix of a Graph Neural Network (GNN) architecture with information\nfrom traffic stations based on their data availability. To handle uncertainty,\nwe utilized the Adaptive Conformal Prediction (ACP) method that adjusts\nprediction intervals based on real-time validation residuals. To validate our\nresults, we model a microscopic traffic scenario and perform a Monte-Carlo\nsimulation to get a travel time distribution for a Vehicle Under Test (VUT)\nwhile it is navigating the traffic scenario, and this distribution is compared\nagainst the actual data. Experiments show that the proposed model outperformed\nthe next-best model by approximately 24% in MAE and 8% in RMSE and validation\nshowed the simulated travel time closely matches the 95th percentile of the\nobserved travel time value.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"K3vEkFk6Qllo_Ighe0V2NO9kZBkZ3F35_iv4Z_LGvBI","pdfSize":"1923789"}
