We explore\nthe influence of the Air Quality Index and weather features on solar energy\ngeneration, employing advanced Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques.\nOur methodology uses time series modeling and makes novel use of power\ntransform normalization and zero-inflated modeling. Various Machine Learning\nalgorithms and Conv2D Long Short-Term Memory model based Deep Learning models\nare applied to these transformations for precise predictions. Results\nunderscore the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating enhanced prediction\naccuracy with Air Quality Index and weather features. We achieved a 0.9691\n$R^2$ Score, 0.18 MAE, 0.10 RMSE with Conv2D Long Short-Term Memory model,\nshowcasing the power transform technique's innovation in enhancing time series\nforecasting for solar energy generation. Such results help our research\ncontribute valuable insights to the synergy between Air Quality Index, weather\nfeatures, and Deep Learning techniques for solar energy prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
