While no incremental\nsolution exists that simultaneously approximates the optimum for all budgets,\nwe show that a bicriterial $(\\alpha,\\mu)$-approximation is possible, i.e., a\nsolution that with budget $B+\\alpha$ for all $B \\in \\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ is a\nmultiplicative $\\mu$-approximation compared to the optimum solution with budget\n$B$. For the case that the underlying graph is a tree, we present a\npolynomial-time density-greedy algorithm that computes a\n$(\\chi,1)$-approximation, where $\\chi$ denotes the eccentricity of the root\nvertex in the underlying graph, and show that this is best possible. An\nadaptation of the density-greedy algorithm for general graphs is\n$(\\gamma,2)$-competitive where $\\gamma$ is the maximal length of a\nvertex-disjoint path starting in the root. While this algorithm does not run in\npolynomial time, it can be adapted to a $(\\gamma,3)$-competitive algorithm that\nruns in polynomial time. We further devise a capacity-scaling algorithm that\nguarantees a $(3\\chi,8)$-approximation and, more generally, a\n$\\smash{\\bigl((4\\ell - 1)\\chi, \\frac{2^{\\ell +\n2}}{2^{\\ell}-1}\\bigr)}$-approximation for every fixed $\\ell \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
