Computer-aided assessment of\nphysical rehabilitation entails evaluation of patient performance in completing\nprescribed rehabilitation exercises, based on processing movement data captured\nwith a sensory system, such as RGB and RGB-D cameras. As 2D and 3D human pose\nestimation from RGB images had made impressive improvements, we aim to compare\nthe assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises using movement data\nobtained from both RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect) and estimation from RGB\nvideos (OpenPose and BlazePose algorithms). A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is\nemployed from position (and orientation) features, with performance metrics\ndefined based on the log-likelihood values from GMM. The evaluation is\nperformed on a medical database of clinical patients carrying out low back-pain\nrehabilitation exercises, previously coached by robot Poppy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
