We investigate the structure of the fixed point algebra under the\ncanonical gauge action, and show that it arises from a continuous field of\n$C^*$-algebras over the base space, generalising results of Vasselli. We also\nanalyse the ideal structure, and show that for a free action, ideals correspond\nto open invariant subspaces of the base space. This shows that if the action is\nfree and minimal, then the Cuntz--Pimsner algebra is simple. Finally we\nestablish a bijective corrrespondence between tracial states and invariant\nmeasures on the base space, thereby calculating part of the Elliott invariant.\nThis generalizes results about the $C^*$-algebras associated to homeomorphisms\ntwisted by vector bundles of Adamo, Archey, Forough, Georgescu, Jeong, Strung\nand Viola.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
