Moreover, we define the non unital $A_\\infty$\n(resp. DG)categories with cofibrant morphisms and we prove that any non unital\n$A_\\infty$ (resp. DG)category has a resolution of this kind.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
