The axial confinement in q2D is\nshown to lift the three-fold degeneracy of 3D trimer (tetramer) in $p$-wave\nchannel and uniquely select the ground state with magnetic angular momentum\n$|m|=1$ ($m=0$). By varying the interaction or confinement strength, we explore\nthe dimensional crossover of these clusters from 3D to 2D, characterized by a\ngradual change of critical H-L mass ratio for their emergence and\nmomentum-space distribution. Importantly, we find that a finite effective range\nwill {\\it not} alter their critical mass ratios in the weak coupling regime.\nThere, we establish an effective 2D model to quantitatively reproduce the\nproperties of q2D clusters, and further identify the optimal interaction\nstrengths for their detections in experiments. Our results suggest a promising\nprospect for observing universal clusters and associated high-order correlation\neffects in realistic q2D ultracold Fermi mixtures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"u2sOULWsaDx-odiRSKvDmg6DUf76fQ1x2ZhIIcJ-lxA","pdfSize":"1478132"}
