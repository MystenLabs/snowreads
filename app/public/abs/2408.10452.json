This is a variation of\nSurrounding Cops and Robber but, in this model, a smallest possible group of\nbodyguards must surround the president and then maintain this protection\nindefinitely. We investigate some elementary bounds, then solve this problem\nfor the infinite graph families of complete graphs, wheels, trees, cycles,\ncomplete multipartite graphs, and two-dimensional grids. We also examine the\nproblem in more general Cartesian, strong, and lexicographic products.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
