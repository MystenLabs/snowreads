Monotone systems facilitate\nthe efficient computation of reachable sets and thus the straightforward\nformulation of a robust model predictive control approach optimizing over\nopen-loop predictions. We present an approach based on the division of\nreachable sets to incorporate feedback in the predictions, resulting in less\nconservative strategies. The concept of mixed-monotonicity enables an extension\nof our methodology to non-monotone systems. The potential of the proposed\napproaches is demonstrated through a nonlinear high-dimensional chemical tank\nreactor cascade case study.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
