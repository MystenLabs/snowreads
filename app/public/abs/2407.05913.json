This paper proposes\nto achieve semantic video object segmentation by learning a data-driven\nrepresentation which captures the synergy of multiple instances from continuous\nframes. To prune the noisy detections, we exploit the rich information among\nmultiple instances and select the discriminative and representative subset.\nThis selection process is formulated as a facility location problem solved by\nmaximising a submodular function. Our method retrieves the longer term\ncontextual dependencies which underpins a robust semantic video object\nsegmentation algorithm. We present extensive experiments on a challenging\ndataset that demonstrate the superior performance of our approach compared with\nthe state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UCmRFBHVWYheXDGDQaY0EWKUr50NQ5gMNgmOIH7tTa0","pdfSize":"12808904"}
