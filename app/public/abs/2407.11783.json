The exclude points of a Sidon set $S$ are the\nsums of three distinct points in $S$, and the exclude multiplicity of a point\nin $\\mathbb{F}_2^n \\setminus S$ is the number of such triples in $S$ it is\nequal to. We call the function $d_S \\colon \\mathbb{F}_2^n \\setminus S \\to\n\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$ taking points in $\\mathbb{F}_2^n \\setminus S$ to their\nexclude multiplicity the exclude distribution of $S$. We say that $d_S$ is\nuniform on $\\mathcal{P}$ if $\\mathcal{P}$ is an equally-sized partition\n$\\mathcal{P}$ of $\\mathbb{F}_2^n \\setminus S$ such that $d_S$ takes the same\nvalues an equal number of times on every element of $\\mathcal{P}$. In this\npaper, we use APN plateaued functions with all component functions unbalanced\nto construct Sidon sets $S$ in $(\\mathbb{F}_2^n)^2$ whose exclude distributions\nare uniform on natural partitions of $(\\mathbb{F}_2^n)^2 \\setminus S$ into\n$2^n$ elements. We use this result and a result of Carlet to determine exactly\nwhat values the exclude distributions of the graphs of the Gold and Kasami\nfunctions take and how often they take these values.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
