The spectral\nfunction of the ladder operator has an exact $\\delta$-function peak induced by\nthe QMBS states. As a concrete example, we show that in the one-dimensional\n(1D) spin-$1$ Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki model, the spectral function of\ntwo-magnon excitations exhibits a characteristic bow-tie shape composed of a\n$\\delta$-function resonance peak at momentum $k=\\pi$ and a continuum spectrum\nelsewhere. The two-magnon excitations can be observed with the resonant\ninelastic X-ray scattering spectroscopy on quasi-1D nickelates and other\nspin-$1$ antiferromagnetic materials, thus it paves the way to detecting the\n(approximate) QMBS states in realistic materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
