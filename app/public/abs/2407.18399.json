First, we study the kernel space of linear operator for a\ngeneral Grushin equation. Then, we provide an exact expression for the kernel\nspace of linear operator for a special Grushin equation. Finally, we prove the\nlinear operator related to the singularly perturbed Grushin equation is\ninvertible when restricted to the complement of its approximate kernel space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
