In this work, using\na recently defined quantum reality quantifier, we show that Alice's local\nquantum operations can be correlated with the erasure of the reality of\nobservables in Bob's causally disconnected laboratory. To this end, we\nimplement a modified optical quantum eraser experiment, ensuring that Alice's\nand Bob's measurements remain causally disconnected. Using an entangled pair of\nphotons and quantum state tomography, we experimentally verify that, even with\nthe total absence of any form of classical communication, the choice of quantum\noperation applied by Alice on her photon is correlated with the erasure of a\nspatial element of reality of Bob's photon. In this case, it is shown that\nBob's photon can entangle two extra non-interacting degrees of freedom, thus\nconfirming that Bob's photon path is not an element of physical reality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
