In each round, the guesser guesses a\npermutation (using information from previous rounds) and is told which entries\nof that permutation are correct. We describe a natural guessing strategy, which\nwe believe to be optimal. We show that the number of permutations this strategy\nsolves in $k+1$ rounds is the Eulerian number $A(n,k)$.\n  We also describe an extension to suited permutations: the setter chooses a\npermutation in $S_n$ and also a coloring of $[n]$ using $s$ colors. We\ngeneralize our strategy, give a recurrence for the number of suited\npermutations solved in $k+1$ rounds, and relate these numbers to the Eulerian\nnumbers. In the case of two suits, or signed permutations, we also relate these\nnumbers to the Eulerian numbers of type B.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
