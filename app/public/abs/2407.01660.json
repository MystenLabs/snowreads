These shocks, and their\nfeatures, are intimately related with the gravitational energy put into play\nduring galaxy cluster formation. Studying a sample of simulated galaxy clusters\nand their associated accretion shocks, we show that objects in our sample sit\nin a plane within the three dimensional-space of cluster total mass, shock\nradius, and Mach number (a measure of shock intensity). Using this relation,\nand considering that forthcoming new observations will be able to measure shock\nradii and intensities, we put forward the idea that the dark matter content of\ngalaxy clusters could be indirectly measured with an error up to around 30 per\ncent at the $1\\sigma$ confidence level. This procedure would be a new and\nindependent method to measure the dark matter mass in cosmic structures, and a\nnovel constraint to the accepted $\\Lambda$CDM paradigm.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
