However, conventional approaches cannot meet the\nrequirements of device performance, such as high dissymmetry factor, high\ndirectionality, narrowband emission, simplified device structure and low costs.\nHere, we demonstrate spin-valley-locked CP-OLEDs without chiral emitters, but\nbased on photonic spin-orbit coupling, where photons with opposite CP\ncharacteristics are emitted from different optical valleys. These spin-valley\nlocked OLEDs exhibit a narrowband emission of 16 nm, a high EQE of 3.65, a\nmaximum luminance of near 98000 cd/m2 and a gEL of up to 1.80, which are among\nthe best performances of active single-crystal CP-OLEDs, achieved with a simple\ndevice structure. This strategy opens an avenue for practical applications\ntowards three-dimensional displays and on-chip CP-OLEDs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
