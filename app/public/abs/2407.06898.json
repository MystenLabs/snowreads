To address poor adherence, physicians\nmay recommend adherence-improving interventions; however, such interventions\nare costly and limited in their availability. Knowing which patients will stop\nadhering helps distribute the available resources more effectively. We\ndeveloped a binary integer program (BIP) model to select patients for\nadherence-improving intervention under budget constraints. We further studied a\nlong-term adherence prediction model using dynamic logistic regression (DLR)\nmodel that uses patients' claim data, medical health factors, demographics, and\nmonitoring frequencies to predict the risk of future non-adherence. We trained\nand tested our predictive model to longitudinal data for cardiovascular disease\nin a large cohort of patients taking medication for cholesterol control seen in\nthe national Veterans Affairs health system. Our study shows the importance of\nincluding past adherence to increase prediction accuracy. Finally, we assess\nthe potential benefits of using the prediction model by proposing an algorithm\nthat combines the DLR and BIP models to decrease the number of CVD events in a\npopulation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
