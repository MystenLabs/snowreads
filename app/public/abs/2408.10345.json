Consistent with\nexperimental observations, we find a super-Maxwellian distribution of kinetic\nenergies of evaporated helium. This excess of kinetic energy over typical\nthermal expectations is explained by an effective continuum theory of\nevaporation based on a Fokker-Planck equation, parameterized molecularly by a\npotential of mean force and position-dependent friction. Using this\ndescription, we find that helium evaporation is strongly influenced by the\nfriction near the interface, which is anomalously small near the Gibbs dividing\nsurface due to the ability of the liquid-vapor interface to deform around the\ngas particle. Our reduced description provides a mechanistic interpretation of\ntrace gas evaporation as the motion of an underdamped particle in a potential\nsubject to a viscous environment that varies rapidly across the air-water\ninterface. From it we predict the temperature dependence of the excess kinetic\nenergy of evaporation, which is yet to be measured.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Hm0hOZ8p4bqDkjzR0XEd2-ayxIUxTFeY3JKEuxE3fD8","pdfSize":"4691634"}
