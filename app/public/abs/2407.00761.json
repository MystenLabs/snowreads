Using\nphysical applications, we show that $L_0$ sparsification prior to Stein\nvariational gradient descent ($L_0$+SVGD) is a more robust and efficient means\nof uncertainty quantification, in terms of computational cost and performance\nthan the direct application of SGVD or projected SGVD methods. Specifically,\n$L_0$+SVGD demonstrates superior resilience to noise, the ability to perform\nwell in extrapolated regions, and a faster convergence rate to an optimal\nsolution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
