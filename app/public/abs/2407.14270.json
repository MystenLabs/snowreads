Towards this, we developed a\nGNN-style model which can be toggled to operate in one of two modes: a\nnon-degenerate mode which incorporates path information, and a degenerate mode\nwhich leaves out path information. Thus, by comparing the performance of the\nnon-degenerate mode versus the degenerate mode on relevant QSAR datasets, we\nwere able to directly assess the significance of path information on those\ndatasets. Our results corroborate previous works, by suggesting that the\nusefulness of path information is datasetdependent. Unlike previous studies\nhowever, we took the very first steps towards building a model that could\npredict upfront whether or not path information would be useful for a given\ndataset at hand. Moreover, we also found that, albeit its simplicity, the\ndegenerate mode of our model yielded rather surprising results, which\noutperformed more sophisticated SOTA models in certain cases.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
