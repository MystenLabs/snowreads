MMIS consists of nearly 160,000 images. Each\nimage within the dataset is accompanied by its corresponding textual\ndescription and an audio recording of that description, providing rich and\ndiverse sources of information for scene generation and recognition. MMIS\nencompasses a wide range of interior spaces, capturing various styles, layouts,\nand furnishings. To construct this dataset, we employed careful processes\ninvolving the collection of images, the generation of textual descriptions, and\ncorresponding speech annotations. The presented dataset contributes to research\nin multi-modal representation learning tasks such as image generation,\nretrieval, captioning, and classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
