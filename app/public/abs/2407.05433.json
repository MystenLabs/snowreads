Our method's sequential runtime is linear in the number of stages and\nconstraints, and its parallel runtime is logarithmic in the number of stages.\nThe main technical contribution of this paper is the derivation of\nparallelizable techniques for eliminating the linear equality constraints while\npreserving the standard positive (semi-)definiteness requirements of LQR\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
