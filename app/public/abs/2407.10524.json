In the hadronic phase\nand in leading order in the kaon diluteness, $\\phi$ emission is isotropic and\ndriven by the flavor singlet and octet vector spectral functions. At next to\nleading order, the emissivities receive a non-isotropic correction from the\nflavor octet spectral function, and the non-equilibrium contributions\noriginating from the shear and bulk viscosities. Implications for the $\\phi$\nmeson alignment in heavy-ion collisions are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
