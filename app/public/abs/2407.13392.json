For safe and efficient navigation, it\nis key to assess the uncertainty of the predicted segments. Current uncertainty\nestimation methods are limited to a specific choice of model architecture, are\ncostly in terms of training time, require large memory for inference\n(ensembles), or involve complex model architectures (energy-based, hyperbolic,\nmasking). In this paper, we propose a simple, light-weight module that can be\nconnected to any pretrained image segmentation model, regardless of its\narchitecture, with marginal additional computation cost because it reuses the\nmodel's backbone. Our module is based on maximum separation of the segmentation\nclasses by respective prototype vectors. This optimizes the probability that\nout-of-distribution segments are projected in between the prototype vectors.\nThe uncertainty value in the classification label is obtained from the distance\nto the nearest prototype. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our module for\nterrain segmentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-jvzFP0QpHGB5cmgU5kRyFrEUsk_vW8aekv5HwOqsEc","pdfSize":"9156902"}
