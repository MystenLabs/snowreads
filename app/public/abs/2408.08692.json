Here, we study kinetic aspects of the model and show that it\nshould be extended to take into account subdiffusion rather than normal\ndiffusion to maintain consistency with the observed complex decay kinetics; we\nalso show that the PL decay kinetics is nonexponential even when the PL\nquenching is limited by surface reactions under subdiffusion. Our theoretical\nanalysis of the PL quantum yield and the PL decay kinetics provides a\ncomprehensive picture of mobile charge carriers, immobile polarons, and\nself-trapped excitons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1so_MRb7RWXP1MfXCvXRTayHFmHDdhYOjEVVb81pnBw","pdfSize":"866969"}
