The\nemergence of social technologies has had a considerable influence in e-learning\nsystems, and a number of experts state that their use is a good method to\nmotivate students and to increase their participation in activities. This study\nattempts to determine whether social networks and social applications should be\nviewed as many other tools or whether they can actually provide extra\nmotivation for students to participate. The study compared the percentage of\nstudent participation in tasks of self-assessment. The experiments covered\nthree traditional strategies of student motivation and another one in which\nsocial networks were used to introduce, explain and deliver the self-assessment\ntasks. The case with a higher participation was the one in which students\nobtained a reward from the completion of the activity. Despite this result, the\nstatistical analysis indicated that the use of social networks obtained similar\nresults as a strategy of continuous and regular motivational speeches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TjuM3vsYYk6SMDS6kSInxVq-gxIL8rvbIMicrqXt37o","pdfSize":"2544472","objectId":"0x7c9a91786940383305c48d249d542e6ec26a37cb3b46c405f06f77b0e926b898","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
