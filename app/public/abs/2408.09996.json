We prove that $X$ can be decomposed\ninto a connected sum of two Poincar\\'e complexes: one being $(n-1)$-connected,\nwhile the other having trivial $n$th homology group. Under the additional\nassumption that $H_n(X)=0$ and $Sq^2:H^{n-1}(X;\\mathbb{Z}_2)\\to\nH^{n+1}(X;\\mathbb{Z}_2)$ is trivial, we can prove that $X$ can be further\ndecomposed into connected sums of Poincar\\'e complexes whose $(n-1)$th homology\nis isomorphic to $\\mathbb{Z}$. As an application of this result, we classify\nthe homotopy types of such $2$-connected $8$-dimensional Poincar\\'e complexes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
