It is often explained that such universality is caused\nby the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade\nprocess. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research\n6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and\nproved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to\nsmall scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at\nsmall scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales,\nhere we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for the Sabra\nshell model. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be\ndecomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, we prove that the\nscale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This\nresult implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs\nmainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale\nlocality of the energy cascade.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
