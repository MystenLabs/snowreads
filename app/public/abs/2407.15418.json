We prove that $\\mu$ is exponentially mixing of all orders for all (not\nnecessarily bounded) plurisubharmonic observables, and that all\nplurisubharmonic functions satisfy the central limit theorem with respect to\n$\\mu$. Our results hold more generally for every H\\'enon-Sibony map on\n$\\mathbb{C}^k$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
