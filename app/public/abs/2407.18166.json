Although instrumental variables (IVs) are widely\nused to address unmeasured confounding, they may not always be available in the\nprimary population. Fortunately, IVs might have been used in previous\nobservational studies on similar causal problems, and these auxiliary studies\ncan be useful to infer causal effects in the primary population, even if they\nrepresent different populations. However, existing methods often assume\nhomogeneity or equality of conditional average treatment effects between the\nprimary and auxiliary populations, which may be limited in practice. This paper\naims to remove the homogeneity requirement and establish a novel\nidentifiability result allowing for different conditional average treatment\neffects across populations. We also construct a multiply robust estimator that\nremains consistent despite partial misspecifications of the observed data model\nand achieves local efficiency if all nuisance models are correct. The proposed\napproach is illustrated through simulation studies. We finally apply our\napproach by leveraging data from lower income individuals with cigarette price\nas a valid IV to evaluate the causal effect of smoking on physical functional\nstatus in higher income group where strong IVs are not available.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
