We also give an example of a shifted matroid which is not\nthreshold, answering a question of Deza and Onn. We conclude by exploring\nconsequences of our characterization of threshold matroids: We give a formula\nfor the number of isomorphism classes of threshold matroids on a groundset of\nsize $n$. This enumeration shows that almost all shifted matroids are not\nthreshold. We also present a polynomial time algorithm to check if a matroid is\nthreshold and provide alternative and simplified proofs of some of the main\nresults of Deza and Onn.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
