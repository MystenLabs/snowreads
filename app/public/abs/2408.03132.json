We color two vertices $x,y\\in V(G)$ with a same color, if there is a\nshortest $x,y$-path whose internal vertices have different colors than $x,y$.\nThe smallest number of colors needed in a mutual-visibility coloring of $G$ is\nthe mutual-visibility chromatic number of $G$, which is denoted\n$\\chi_{\\mu}(G)$. Relationships between $\\chi_{\\mu}(G)$ and its two parent ones,\nthe chromatic number and the mutual-visibility number, are presented. Graphs of\ndiameter two are considered, and in particular the asymptotic growth of the\nmutual-visibility number of the Cartesian product of complete graphs is\ndetermined. A greedy algorithm that finds a mutual-visibility coloring is\ndesigned and several possible scenarios on its efficiency are discussed.\nSeveral bounds are given in terms of other graph parameters such as the\ndiameter, the order, the maximum degree, the degree of regularity of regular\ngraphs, and/or the mutual-visibility number. For the corona products it is\nproved that the value of its mutual-visibility chromatic number depends on that\nof the first factor of the product. Graphs $G$ for which $\\chi_{\\mu}(G)=2$ are\nalso considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
