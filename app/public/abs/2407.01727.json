This condition can\nalso be seen as defining a quantum version of Penrose's Weyl curvature\nhypothesis. We comment on the relation of this picture to the `past hypothesis'\nand the different observed arrows of time, and we consider how quantum\ngeometrodynamics could serve as a unifying and more fundamental framework to\nexplain these observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
