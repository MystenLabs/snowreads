Diaconis and Shashahani proved that the traces\n$\\mathrm{tr}(M),\\mathrm{tr}(M^2),\\ldots,\\mathrm{tr}(M^k)$ converge in\ndistribution to independent normal random variables as $k$ is fixed and\n$n\\to\\infty$. Recently, Gorodetsky and Rodgers proved analogs for these results\nfor matrices chosen from certain finite matrix groups. For example, let $M$ be\nchosen uniformly at random from $U_n(\\mathbb{F}_q)$. They show that\n$\\{\\mathrm{tr}(M^i)\\}_{i=1,p\\nmid i}^{k}$ converge in distribution to\nindependent uniform random variables in $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ as $k$ is fixed and\n$n\\to\\infty$.\n  We prove analogs for these results over local fields. Let $\\mathcal{F}$ be a\nlocal field with a ring of integers $\\mathcal{O}$, a uniformizer $\\pi$, and a\nresidue field of odd characteristic. Let $\\mathcal{K}/\\mathcal{F}$ be an\nunramified extension of degree $2$ with a ring of integers $\\mathcal{R}$. Let\n$M$ be chosen uniformly at random w.r.t. the Haar measure on the unitary group\n$U_n(\\mathcal{O})$, and fix $k$. We prove that the traces of powers\n$\\{\\mathrm{tr}(M^i)\\}_{i=1,p\\nmid i}^k$ converge to independent uniform random\nvariables on $\\mathcal{R}$, as $n\\to\\infty$. We also consider the case where\n$k$ may tend to infinity with $n$. We show that for some constant $c$ (coming\nfrom the mod $\\pi$ distribution), the total variation distance from independent\nuniform random variables on $\\mathcal{R}$ is $o(1)$ as $n\\to\\infty$, as long as\n$k<c\\cdot n$. We also consider other matrix groups over local fields and prove\nsimilar results for them. Moreover, we consider traces of powers $M^{pi}$ and\ntraces of negative powers, and show that apart from certain necessary modular\nrestrictions, they also equidistribute in the limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
