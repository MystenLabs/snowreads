GPUs in\nparticular have dominated the accelerator landscape, offering unprecedented\nperformance in parallel workloads and unlocking new possibilities in fields\nlike AI and climate modeling. With many workloads becoming memory-bound,\nimproving the communication latency and bandwidth within the system has become\na main driver in the development of new architectures. The Grace Hopper\nSuperchip (GH200) is a significant step in the direction of tightly coupled\nheterogeneous systems, in which all CPUs and GPUs share a unified address space\nand support transparent fine grained access to all main memory on the system.\nWe characterize both intra- and inter-node memory operations on the Quad GH200\nnodes of the new Swiss National Supercomputing Centre Alps supercomputer, and\nshow the importance of careful memory placement on example workloads,\nhighlighting tradeoffs and opportunities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"HY9r_5qoYzxVgz3FUM3UoqC5zR9UCEvbK6V_tzES_X4","pdfSize":"4357900"}
