By starting from a fully\ndiscrete linear finite element scheme, we do not only prove the well-posedness\nof the model, but also provide a practicable and convergent scheme for its\nnumerical treatment. Conceptually, our discrete scheme relies on a recently\ndeveloped augmentation of the scalar auxiliary variable approach, which reduces\nthe requirements on the time regularity of the solution. By showing that fully\ndiscrete solutions to this scheme satisfy an energy estimate, we obtain first\nuniform regularity results. Establishing Nikolskii estimates with respect to\ntime, we are able to show convergence towards pathwise unique martingale\nsolutions by applying Jakubowski's generalization of Skorokhod's theorem.\nFinally, a generalization of the Gy\\\"ongy--Krylov characterization of\nconvergence in probability provides convergence towards strong solutions and\nthereby completes the proof.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
