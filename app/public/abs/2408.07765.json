In this\nsetting, existing flexible machine learning methods are highly sensitive to the\nweak instruments problem, in which the compliance rate is (locally) close to\nzero. Our main methodological contribution is to present a Bayesian Causal\nForest model for binary response variables in scenarios with noncompliance. By\nrepeatedly imputing individuals' compliance types, we can flexibly estimate\nheterogeneous treatment effects among compliers. Simulation studies demonstrate\nthe usefulness of our approach when compliance and treatment effects are\nheterogeneous. We apply the method to detect and analyze heterogeneity in the\ntreatment effects in the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, which not only\nfeatures heterogeneous and one-sided compliance but also several binary\noutcomes of interest. We demonstrate the methodology on three outcomes one year\nafter intervention. We confirm a null effect on the presence of a chronic\ncondition, discover meaningful heterogeneity impact of the intervention on\nmetabolic parameters though the average effect is null in classical partial\neffect estimates, and find substantial heterogeneity in individuals' perception\nof management prioritization of health and safety.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
