Inspired by the observation of protofilament -\nconstituent biopolymer of microtubule - this question is addressed by a\nconstructive approach. In our model a simple allosteric element in each module\ncouples with the neighboring modules at its interfaces, which gives rise to a\nsingle degree of freedom to control the global shape of the filament. The model\ncan be analyzed in analogy with discrete-time dynamical systems having a\nbifurcation of trans-critical type.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
