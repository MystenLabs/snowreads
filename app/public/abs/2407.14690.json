This\nscholarship aims to recognize a few selected faculty researchers for their\nscientific production, outstanding technology and innovation in their\nrespective areas of knowledge. In the present study, we evaluated the\nscientific production of the 185 researchers in the Computer Science area\ngranted with PQ scholarship in the last PQ selection notice. To evaluate the\nproductivity of each professor, we considered papers published in scientific\njournals and conferences (complete works) in a five years period (from 2017 to\n2021). We analyzed the productivity in terms of both quantity and quality. We\nalso evaluated its distribution over the country, universities and research\nfacilities, as well as, the co-authorship network produced.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mq4OmRiz7a6-Ip8NJbD9coChufUiMakUqG5BWGL4cTU","pdfSize":"570829"}
