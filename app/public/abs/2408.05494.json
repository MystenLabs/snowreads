In this paper, we show that the local stress tensor of\nthe 3d Carrollian conformal theory (without any additional sources) constructed\nin terms of the geometric structure at asymptotic null infinity naturally\nencodes both the leading and subleading soft graviton theorems. We relate the\n3d Carroll stress tensor to the 2d Celestial one and show how the 3d version\nnaturally localises the non-local 2d Celestial stress tensor. We also comment\non the relation with stress tensors in relativistic 3d CFTs and connections to\nthe flat limit of AdS/CFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hkbT2f1d7fcTBA4EOEPj3fDWBNCp7tmcnVal6wJP4V4","pdfSize":"523070"}
