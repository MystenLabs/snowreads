Processing-In-Memory (PIM) is a\npractical approach to overcome the memory wall bottleneck. The 4:2 compressor\nis suitable for implementing the processor's crucial arithmetic circuits,\nincluding multiplier. Some area-efficient memristive structures, like Material\nImplication (IMPLY) in serial architecture, are compatible with the crossbar\narray. This paper proposes a serial memristive IMPLY-based 4:2 compressor,\nwhich is applied to present new 4-bit and 8-bit multipliers. The proposed\ncircuits are evaluated regarding latency, area, and energy consumption.\nCompared to the existing serial compressor, the proposed 4:2 compressor's\nalgorithm improves the area, energy consumption, and speed by 36%, 17%, and\n15%, respectively. The proposed 4-bit and 8-bit multipliers are improved by\n7.3% and 10%, respectively, regarding the latency, and reduced energy\nconsumption by up to 12%, compared to the serial multiplier based on a 4:2\ncompressor with XOR/MUX design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
