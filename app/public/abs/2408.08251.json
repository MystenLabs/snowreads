Moreover,\nwe show that if $\\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$\nisomorphic to the binary tetrahedral group, to the binary octahedral group or\nto the binary icosahedral group, then the $\\Gamma$-fixed points of\n$\\mathcal{H}_n$ which are also fixed under $\\mathbb{T}_1$, the maximal diagonal\ntorus of $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$, are in fact\n$\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{C})$-fixed points. Finally, we prove that in that case,\nthe irreducible components of $\\mathcal{H}_n^{\\Gamma}$ containing a\n$\\mathbb{T}_1$-fixed point are of dimension $0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
