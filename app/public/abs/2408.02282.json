However, the role of\nnoise in Quantum Hypothesis Testing (QHT), traditionally assumed to undermine\nperformance and reduce success probability, has not been thoroughly explored.\nOur study bridges this gap by establishing sufficient conditions for noisy\ndynamics that can surpass the success probabilities achievable under noiseless\n(unitary) dynamics within certain time intervals. We then devise and\nexperimentally implement a noise-assisted QHT protocol in the setting of\nultralow-field nuclear magnetic resonance spin systems. Our experimental\nresults demonstrate that the success probability of QHT under the noisy\ndynamics can indeed surpass the ceiling set by unitary evolution alone.\nMoreover, we have shown that in cases where noise initially hampers the\nperformance, strategic application of coherent controls on the system can\ntransform these previously detrimental noises into advantageous factors. This\ntransformative approach demonstrates the potential to harness and leverage\nnoise in QHT, which pushes the boundaries of QHT and general quantum\ninformation processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
