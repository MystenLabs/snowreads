The problem seeks to find the optimal locations of space-based\nobservers to monitor a user-defined region of cislunar space, represented by a\nfinite set of targets with potentially time-varying observation requirements.\nThe optimization problem is posed as a time-expanded facility location problem\n(FLP); unlike a traditional FLP that focuses on assigning facilities to\nclients, the proposed formulation focuses on assigning observers to specific\npointing directions from a discretized set. To aid with the solving process of\nthe resulting large-scale binary linear program, a Lagrangean method (LM) based\non constraint relaxation and custom heuristics is provided. The performance of\nthe proposed formulation and method is demonstrated with several case studies\nthat obtained CSSA constellations for monitoring the lunar sphere of influence,\nthe cislunar Cone of Shame, and a transit window for low-energy transfers\nlocated in the Earth-Moon L2 neck region. The proposed problem formulation,\nalong with the LM, is demonstrated to enable a fast assessment of near-optimal\nCSSA constellations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
