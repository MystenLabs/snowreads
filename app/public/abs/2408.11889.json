We derive analytical\napproximations using the mode function solution in a de Sitter background and\nalso apply the steepest descent method. We study both positive and negative\nnonminimal couplings and show that their comoving number density spectra behave\ndifferently in the short and long wavelength regimes. We numerically compute\nthe comoving number density spectra and dark matter abundance for a broad range\nof superheavy spectator fields exceeding the Hubble scale during inflation,\nwith $m_{\\chi} > H_I$, and nonminimal couplings ranging from $-300 \\leq \\xi\n\\leq 300$. When computing the allowed dark matter parameter space, we impose\nthe maximum reheating temperature constraint, the Big Bang nucleosynthesis\nconstraint, and the isocurvature constraint. We show that the presence of a\npositive or negative coupling $\\xi$ can expand the parameter space up to $3$\norders of magnitude above the Hubble inflationary scale, allowing such dark\nmatter candidates to be as heavy as $\\sim 10^{16} \\, \\rm{GeV}$ in the\nStarobinsky model of inflation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uP7gfJ6WUtPDPtBOO5zDLmhDUtPzJvy3sDv0_D5Jsrw","pdfSize":"2843707"}
