Our\ninvestigation primarily focuses on five key aspects: The impact of training\ndata, the influence of various loss functions, the effectiveness of direct and\nindirect speech estimation techniques, the efficacy of masking, mapping, and\ndeep filtering methodologies, and the exploration of different model capacities\non noise reduction performance and speech quality. Through comprehensive\nexperimentation, we provide insights into the strengths, weaknesses, and\napplicability of these methods in low SNR environments. The findings derived\nfrom our analysis are intended to assist both researchers and practitioners in\nselecting better techniques tailored to their specific applications within the\ndomain of low SNR noise reduction.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GjYxQq_xYabvdzlGN5tVCDYu_7qSFgZlFGrSGwKkQMk","pdfSize":"1103153"}
