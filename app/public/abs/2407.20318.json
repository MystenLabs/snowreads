We report on flow-induced anisotropy, considering CB-silicone\nfilms generated via doctor blade coating. Cured films showed slight electrical\nanisotropy, with conductivity parallel to the coating direction being lower\nthan perpendicular to it. Furthermore, piezoresistive sensitivity was much\nlarger for stretch perpendicular to the coating direction than for parallel\nstretch. Structural analysis for length scales up to the CB agglomerate level\nyielded only weak evidence of anisotropy. Based on this evidence and insight\nfrom CB network simulations, we hypothesize that shear flow during coating\nfragments the CB network and then induces a preferential aggregate alignment,\nas well as increased inter-particle distances, parallel to the coating\ndirection. As a practical conclusion, already weak anisotropic structuration\nsuffices to cause significant electric anisotropy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4YJ3iJoQvl7MGFDnnBAu2g7RpQDdsTyzoQQozIBrbso","pdfSize":"8976085","objectId":"0x248120f7e144b92fd2a9395120f8052f863cf0a20f728b1c78328fbda763f44b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
