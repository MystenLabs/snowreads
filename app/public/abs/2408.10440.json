Here, we study\nthe evolution of electronic interaction parameters as a function of\n$d$-electron occupancy in an extended class of TM perovskite oxides $AB$O$_3$\n($A$=Sr, Ca, and $B$=3$d$-5$d$ TM elements) using the constrained\nrandom-phase-approximation method adopting two distinct models:\n$t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ and $d$-$dp$. For Sr$B$O$_3$ with $B$=Fe, Ru, and Ir, the\n$t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ model faces critical challenges, as the low-energy\nHamiltonian spanning $t_{2g}$ manifolds is ill-defined. The $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$\nmodel suggests that, for early $AB$O$_3$ series ($B$=$d^1$-$d^3$), the bare\nCoulomb interaction parameters $V$ remain nearly constant due to the\ncompetition between extended $t_{2g}$ Wannier orbitals and bandwidth reduction.\nAs the $d$-electron filling increases, both partially screened Coulomb\ninteraction parameters $U$ and fully screened Coulomb interaction parameters\n$W$ decrease, which are attributed to enhanced $e_g$-$t_{2g}$ and $e_g$-$p$\nscreenings. In contrast to the $t_{2g}$-$t_{2g}$ model, the $d$-$dp$ model\neffectively handles both early and late $AB$O$_3$ perovskites and reveals\ndifferent trends. Specifically, $V$ varies inversely with the spreads of\n$d$-orbitals. $W$ reaches its minimum at the $d^3$ occupancy due to an\ninterplay between increasing $d$-orbital localization and increasing screening\neffects. An unusual trend is observed for $U$, with local maxima at both $d^1$\nand $d^4$ occupations. This can be understood from two aspects: (1) the\nincreasing full screening effects from $d^1$ to $d^3$ and (2) the strongest\n$d$-$d$ and the weakest $d$-$p$ screening effects near $d^4$ for Sr$B$O$_3$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
