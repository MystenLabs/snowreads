We employ the light-front wave functions of the proton obtained\nfrom a light-front quantized Hamiltonian with quantum chromodynamics input\nusing BLFQ. Our investigation encompasses both the valence Fock sector with\nthree constituent quarks and an additional sector containing three quarks and a\ndynamical gluon. We analyze the gluon GPDs in the momentum space as well as in\nthe transverse position space. We further present the gluon's generalized form\nfactors derived from the Mellin moments of its chiral-odd GPDs. Using the\nproton transverse spin sum rule, we also present the $x$-dependence of the\nangular momentum carried by the polarized gluon and determine the relative\ncontributions of quarks and the gluon to the transversity asymmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
