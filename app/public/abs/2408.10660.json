Their connected, simply connected Lie groups admit\nsquare-integrable representations modulo the center. There are many examples of\nnilpotent Lie groups admitting families of dilations and square-integrable\nrepresentations, but so far no examples admitting square-integrable\nrepresentations for which the quotient by the center does not admit a family of\ndilations. In this paper we construct a two-parameter family of\ncharacteristically nilpotent Lie groups $G(\\alpha,\\beta)$ in dimension $11$,\nadmitting square-integrable representations modulo the center $Z$, such that\n$G(\\alpha,\\beta)/Z$ does not admit a family of dilations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G_LY5WDqy_YuXowWHYZ-ELFHD_EZegPGelfDVIHt9f8","pdfSize":"163573"}
