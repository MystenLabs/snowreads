While both processes in semiconductors can generate carriers and result\nin photon emission through electron-hole recombination, the low quantum yields\nin most materials have hindered direct observation of the Keldysh crossover.\nLeveraging the large quantum yields of photoluminescence in lead halide\nperovskites, we show that we can not only induce bright light emission from\nextreme sub-bandgap light excitation but also distinguish between\nphoton-induced and electric-field-induced processes. Our results are\nrationalized by the Landau-Dykhne formalism, providing insights into the\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of strong-field light-matter interactions. These\nfindings open new avenues for light upconversion and sub-bandgap photon\ndetection, highlighting the potential of lead halide perovskites in advanced\noptoelectronic applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
