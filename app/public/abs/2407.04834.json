In this paper, we will provide a survey\nof Khasminskii's Lyapunov method for classifying explosive behaviors of\nsolutions of stochastic differential equations. We will embark our expedition\nby examining the renowned Feller's test for explosion and observing its\nshortfalls. Afterwards, we will present Khasminskii's Lyapunov method for\nalmost-sure non-explosion, explosion with positive probability, and almost-sure\nexplosion. Ample examples will be provided to illuminate the power of\nKhasminskii's Lyapunov methods. Furthermore, quick layovers will be made to\nextend Khasminskii's Lyapunov method for almost-sure non-explosion and\nexplosion with positive probability for jump processes with constant Poisson\nintensities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"qH6SYpn6XH9_f1w2HelNBDMIsPqIFGQcy_2rNjpbjh0","pdfSize":"182499"}
