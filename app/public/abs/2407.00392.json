In an old and now almost\nforgotten publication, Duffin and McWhirter proposed a method for calculating\nthe electrostatic potentials of planar bodies by a skillful application of\nGreen's theorem. It is shown that this method significantly simplifies the\nproblem of calculating the electrostatic potential of a uniformly charged disk\nand makes it an almost trivial task.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
