One of its primary purposes is detecting and assessing changes in\nstructure conditions to increase safety and reduce potential maintenance\ndowntime. Recent advancements, especially in sensor technology, facilitate data\nmeasurements, collection, and process automation, leading to large data\nstreams. We propose a function-on-function regression framework for (nonlinear)\nmodeling the sensor data and adjusting for covariate-induced variation. Our\napproach is particularly suited for long-term monitoring when several months or\nyears of training data are available. It combines highly flexible yet\ninterpretable semi-parametric modeling with functional principal component\nanalysis and uses the corresponding out-of-sample phase-II scores for\nmonitoring. The method proposed can also be described as a combination of an\n``input-output'' and an ``output-only'' method.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
