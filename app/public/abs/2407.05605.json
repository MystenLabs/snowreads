The 2-class Gaussian Mixture Model classifier for genuine and\nspoofed speech is usually used as the baseline for spoofing detection. However,\nthe GMM classifier does not separately consider the scores of feature frames on\neach Gaussian component. In addition, the GMM accumulates the scores on all\nframes independently, and does not consider their correlations. We propose the\ntwo-path GMM-ResNet and GMM-SENet models for spoofing detection, whose input is\nthe Gaussian probability features based on two GMMs trained on genuine and\nspoofed speech respectively. The models consider not only the score\ndistribution on GMM components, but also the relationship between adjacent\nframes. A two-step training scheme is applied to improve the system robustness.\nExperiments on the ASVspoof 2019 show that the LFCC+GMM-ResNet system can\nrelatively reduce min-tDCF and EER by 76.1% and 76.3% on logical access\nscenario compared with the GMM, and the LFCC+GMM-SENet system by 94.4% and\n95.4% on physical access scenario. After score fusion, the systems give the\nsecond-best results on both scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
