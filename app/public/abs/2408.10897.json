In this work, we investigate the prospective sensitivity of the\nLarge High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) to measure the local burst\nrate density of PBHs. Our findings reveal that LHAASO is capable of searching\nfor the PBH bursts within a distance $\\sim0.1$ pc from the sun and thereby\nmeasure the local burst rate density $\\sim$ 1164 (or\n699)$\\,\\mathrm{pc}^{-3}\\,\\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ at $99\\%$ confidence level during a\n3 (or 5) year observing run. This stands for a sensitivity that is one order of\nmagnitude stronger than the strongest observational constraint from the High\nAltitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC). In addition, we further suggest an\nobserving strategy to search for the PBH bursts during upcoming observing runs\nof LHAASO.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
