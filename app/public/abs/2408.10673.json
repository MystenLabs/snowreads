Existing defenses\noften exhibit weaknesses when facing various attack algorithms and adaptive\nattacks or compromise accuracy for enhanced security. To address these\nchallenges, we have developed a novel and highly efficient\nnon-deep-learning-based image filter called the Iterative Window Mean Filter\n(IWMF) and proposed a new framework for adversarial purification, named\nIWMF-Diff, which integrates IWMF and denoising diffusion models. These methods\ncan function as pre-processing modules to eliminate adversarial perturbations\nwithout necessitating further modifications or retraining of the target system.\nWe demonstrate that our proposed methodologies fulfill four critical\nrequirements: preserved accuracy, improved security, generalizability to\nvarious threats in different settings, and better resistance to adaptive\nattacks. This performance surpasses that of the state-of-the-art adversarial\npurification method, DiffPure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
