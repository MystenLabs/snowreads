In the present paper, we display a more general $Q$-polynomial\nstructure for $L_N(q)$. Our new $Q$-polynomial structure is defined using a\nfree parameter $\\varphi$ that takes any positive real value. For $\\varphi=1$ we\nrecover the original $Q$-polynomial structure. We interpret the new\n$Q$-polynomial structure using the quantum group $U_{q^{1/2}}(\\mathfrak{sl}_2)$\nin the equitable presentation. We use the new $Q$-polynomial structure to\nobtain analogs of the four split decompositions that appear in the theory of\n$Q$-polynomial distance-regular graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
