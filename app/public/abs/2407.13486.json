The two poles owe their origin to different quark flavor\nirreducible representations in the meson-baryon coupled-channel interactions,\nthus they should be individually manifested in reactions that provide good\nflavor eigenstate sources. Hadronic decays of charmonia into\n$\\bar{\\Lambda}\\Sigma\\pi$ and $\\bar{\\Lambda}(1520)\\Sigma\\pi$ are such reactions,\nand the flavor octet and singlet poles can be approximately singled out in\nthese two decay modes. This SU(3) flavor filter works even considering the\nflavor symmetry breaking. With the huge charmonium data sets collected, it is\ntherefore promising to solve the long-standing $\\Lambda(1405)$ puzzle employing\nthe proposed flavor filter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
