The spectroscopic quantities are obtained as the eigenvalues of\nthe Dirac equation, where the nuclear densities computed via nuclear Density\nFunctional Theory and the effect of the anomalous magnetic moment are\nincorporated. The results indicate that the isovector term's contribution to\nthe optical potential is crucial for explaining the systematical differences in\nthe strong shifts between $^{40}$Ca and $^{48}$Ca. Furthermore, it is found\nthat both the strong shifts and the level widths exhibit significant dependence\non the nuclear density profiles. These findings provide critical insights into\nthe nuclear structures, particularly in the context of Calcium isotopes, by\noffering a more comprehensive understanding of the underlying nuclear-hadron\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
