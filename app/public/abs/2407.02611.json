We have conducted a focus group with a variety of\nprofessionals who regularly analyze large corpora of unstructured text. Our\npreliminary insights indicate there is an unmet need to visually explore the\ndynamics between entities and actors extracted from unstructured text.\nAdditionally, large corpora contain multiple perspectives on the same series of\nevents. There is a need to disentangle these perspectives and visually show the\nmultiple narratives present in the data. In our future work, we will co-design\nlow-fidelity prototypes to create a broad consideration space of possible\nsolutions for visualizing unstructured text.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k4en1StYAkOyJUbKosbrt2QWkrcDhSGlC7mdXNKNTWk","pdfSize":"57108","objectId":"0x87805a86cefb567f8879c902f3fbd55fbd2a9fe085be0a8f15aab34706b284d1","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
