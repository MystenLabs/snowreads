However, the current open-set text recognition solutions only focuses on\nhorizontal text, which fail to model the real-life challenges posed by the\nvariety of writing directions in real-world scene text. Multi-orientation text\nrecognition, in general, faces challenges from the diverse image aspect ratios,\nsignificant imbalance in data amount, and domain gaps between orientations. In\nthis work, we first propose a Multi-Oriented Open-Set Text Recognition task\n(MOOSTR) to model the challenges of both novel characters and writing direction\nvariety. We then propose a Multi-Orientation Sharing Experts (MOoSE) framework\nas a strong baseline solution. MOoSE uses a mixture-of-experts scheme to\nalleviate the domain gaps between orientations, while exploiting common\nstructural knowledge among experts to alleviate the data scarcity that some\nexperts face. The proposed MOoSE framework is validated by ablative\nexperiments, and also tested for feasibility on the existing open-set\nbenchmark.
