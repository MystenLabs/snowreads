All\ndata were analysed by representing all quantities as a function of the\nsusceptible population, as opposed to the usual dependence on time. The total\nnumber of deaths could be predicted for the first, second and third wave of the\npandemic in Germany with an accuracy of about 10\\%, shortly after the maximum\nof infectious people was reached. By using the presentation in phase space, it\ncould be shown that a classical SEIRD- and SIRD-model with constant parameters\nwill not be able to describe the first wave of the pandemic accurately.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"33gLy0QClaWxhfFf-PkLFNayzxawAdadAH9oGGEJI0I","pdfSize":"963175"}
