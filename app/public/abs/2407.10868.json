Furthermore, we study self-force-driven evolution\nof a scalar field, perturbing the Top-Star spacetime with a scalar charge\ncurrent. The latter for simplicity is taken to be circular, equatorial and\ngeodetic. To perform this study, besides solving all the self-force related\nproblem (regularization of all divergences due to the self-field, mode sum\nregularization, etc.), we had to adapt the 4D Mano-Suzuki-Takasugi formalism to\nthe present 5D situation. Finally, we have compared this formalism with the\n(quantum) Seiberg-Witten formalism, both related to the solutions of a Heun\nConfluent Equation, but appearing in different contexts in the literature,\nblack hole perturbation theory the first, quantum curves in super-Yang-Mills\ntheories the second.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
