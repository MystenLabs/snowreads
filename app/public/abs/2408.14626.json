By augmenting the\noriginal input features using three different autoencoder configurations, the\nmodel's predictive capabilities were significantly improved. The hybrid models\nwere trained and tested on a dataset of 7225 samples, with performance metrics\nincluding the coefficient of determination (R2), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency\n(NSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and normalized root-mean-squared error\n(NRMSE) used for evaluation. Among the tested models, the DCNN_3F-A2\nconfiguration demonstrated the highest accuracy, achieving an R2 of 0.9908\nduring training and 0.9826 during testing, outperforming the base model and\nother augmented versions. These results suggest that the proposed hybrid\napproach, combining deep learning with feature augmentation, offers a robust\nsolution for CHF prediction, with the potential to generalize across a wider\nrange of conditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
