Through qualitative and\nquantitative analyses, we evaluate the role of datasets like CIFAR-10 in\nadvancing computer vision and object recognition, which are central to the Deep\nLearning revolution. Our findings highlight CIFAR-10's crucial role and\nenduring influence on the field, as well as its importance in teaching ML\ntechniques. Results also indicate that dataset characteristics such as size,\nnumber of instances, and number of categories, were key factors. Econometric\nanalysis confirms that CIFAR-10, a small-but-sufficiently-large open dataset,\nplayed a significant and lasting role in technological advancements and had a\nmajor function in the development of the early scientific literature as shown\nby citation metrics.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"drgZn5ADzGym9Zw1dKKEljuYL5wohSshvX7i5dYjARg","pdfSize":"2208105"}
