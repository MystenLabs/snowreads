Here,\nthe total energy function for an eutectic system consisting of water, SCN$^-$,\nK$^+$ and acetamide is improved vis-a-vis experimentally measured properties.\nGiven the importance of electrostatic interactions, two different types of\nmodels are considered: the first (model M0) uses atom-centered multipole\nwhereas the other two (models M1 and M2) are based on fluctuating minimal\ndistributed charges (fMDCM) that respond to geometrical changes of SCN$^-$. The\nLennard-Jones parameters of the anion are adjusted to best reproduce\nexperimentally known hydration free energies and densities which are matched to\nwithin a few percent for the final models irrespective of the electrostatic\nmodel. Molecular dynamics simulations of the eutectic mixtures with varying\nwater content (between 0% and 100%) yield radial distribution functions and\nfrequency correlation functions for the CN-stretch vibration. Comparison with\nexperiments indicate that models based on fMDCM are considerably more\nconsistent that those using multipoles. Computed viscosities from models M1 and\nM2 are within 30% of measured values and their change with increasing water\ncontent is consistent with experiments. This is not the case for model M0.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pO2pJ6qrrXCrFtu8QnSOCuNYPOjzKPnVE7NMcl0_UHA","pdfSize":"3394663"}
