We also employ the random-phase approximation to quantify the\nfirst magnetic instability with increasing Hubbard coupling strength, also\nvarying $n$. Based on the spin structure factor $S(q)$, we have obtained a rich\nmagnetic phase diagram in the plane defined by $n$ and $U/W$, at fixed Hund\ncoupling. We have observed numerous states, such as A-AFM, Stripes, G-AFM, and\nC-AFM. For half-filling $n=2$ (two electrons per Ni site, corresponding to $N$\n= 16 electrons), the canonical superexchange interaction leads to a robust\nG-AFM state $(\\pi,\\pi,\\pi)$ with antiferromagnetic couplings in plane and\nbetween layers. By increasing or decreasing electronic densities, ferromagnetic\ntendencies emerge from the ``half-empty'' and ``half-full'' mechanisms, leading\nto many other interesting magnetic tendencies. In addition, the spin-spin\ncorrelations become weaker both in the hole or electron doping regions compared\nwith half-filling. At $n = 1.5$ (or $N=12$), density corresponding to\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we obtained the ``Stripe 2'' ground state (antiferromagnetic\ncoupling in one in-plane direction, ferromagnetic coupling in the other, and\nantiferromagnetic coupling along the $z$-axis) in the $2\\times2\\times2$\ncluster. In addition, we obtained a much stronger AFM coupling along the\n$z$-axis than the magnetic coupling in the $xy$ plane. The random-phase\napproximation calculations with varying $n$ give very similar results as\nLanczos. Meanwhile, a state with $q/\\pi = (0.6, 0.6, 1)$ close to the E-phase\nwavevector is found in our RPA calculations by slightly reducing the filling to\n$n=1.25$, possibly responsible for the E-phase SDW recently observed in\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
