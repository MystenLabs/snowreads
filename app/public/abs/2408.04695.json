Magnetic fields may\ninhibit this convection by stiffening the criterion for convective instability.\nWe consistently implemented the modified criterion in the stellar evolution\ncode MESA, and computed the cooling of white dwarfs as a function of their mass\nand magnetic field $B$. In contrast to previous estimates, we find that\nmagnetic fields can significantly change the cooling time $t$ even if they are\nrelatively weak $B^2\\ll 8\\pi P$, where $P$ is the pressure at the edge of the\ndegenerate core. Fields $B\\gtrsim 1\\textrm{ MG}$ open a radiative window that\ndecouples the core from the convective envelope, effectively lowering the\nluminosity to that of a fully radiative white dwarf. We identified a population\nof observed white dwarfs that are younger by $\\Delta t\\sim$ Gyr than currently\nthought due to this magnetic inhibition of convective energy transfer -\ncomparable to the cooling delay due to carbon-oxygen phase separation. In\nvolume-limited samples, the frequency and strength of magnetic fields increase\nwith age. Accounting for magnetic inhibition is therefore essential for\naccurate cooling models for cosmic chronology and for determining the origin of\nthe magnetic fields.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
