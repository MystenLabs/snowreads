This paper shows that seeded TA is a non-committal intrinsically\nuniversal model of self-assembly. We present a single universal Tile Automata\nsystem containing approximately 4600 states that can simulate (a) the output\nassemblies created by any other Tile Automata system G, (b) the dynamics\ninvolved in building G's assemblies, and (c) G's internal state transitions. It\ndoes so in a non-committal way: it preserves the full non-deterministic\ndynamics of a tile's potential attachment or transition by selecting its state\nin a single step, considering all possible outcomes until the moment of\nselection.\n  The system uses supertiles, each encoding the complete system being\nsimulated. The universal system builds supertiles from its seed, each\nrepresenting a single tile in G, transferring the information to simulate G to\neach new tile. Supertiles may also asynchronously transition states according\nto the rules of G. This result directly transfers to a restricted version of\nasynchronous Cellular Automata: pairwise Cellular Automata.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ANlQXLD4gEqIYw3zm76_wU0YLajj17vAI4sa6BrxsLE","pdfSize":"1975622"}
