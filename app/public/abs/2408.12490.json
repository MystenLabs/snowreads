The approach uses Homotopy Optimization, which,\nunlike standard continuation methods for solving homotopy problems, solves a\nsequence of constrained optimization problems rather than a sequence of\nnonlinear systems of equations. The insight behind our proposed algorithm is\nformulating the discovery of this sequence of optimization problems as a search\nproblem in a multidimensional homotopy parameter space. Our proposed algorithm,\nthe Probabilistic Homotopy Optimization algorithm, switches between solve and\nsample phases, using solutions to easy problems as initial guesses to more\nchallenging problems. We analyze how our algorithm performs in the presence of\ncommon challenges to homotopy methods, such as bifurcation, folding, and\ndisconnectedness of the homotopy solution manifold. Finally, we demonstrate its\nutility via a case study on two dynamic motion planning problems: the cart-pole\nand the MIT Humanoid.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kiFBD4gL76KjotGmeawhbi2tux5SMrZjV_m5pwSIb88","pdfSize":"4278011"}
