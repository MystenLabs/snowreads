Recent efforts have begun to harmonize\nthese treebanks' annotations to better train and evaluate morphological\ntaggers. However, the heterogeneity of these treebanks must be carefully\nconsidered to build effective and reliable data. In this work, we review\nexisting Latin treebanks to identify the texts they draw from, identify their\noverlap, and document their coverage across time and genre. We additionally\ndesign automated conversions of their morphological feature annotations into\nthe conventions of standard Latin grammar. From this, we build new time-period\ndata splits that draw from the existing treebanks which we use to perform a\nbroad cross-time analysis for POS and morphological feature tagging. We find\nthat BERT-based taggers outperform existing taggers while also being more\nrobust to cross-domain shifts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"bxm7i8vTQskNzqGYHaK7JDTb3fhbm2WYypWbHls2XuM","pdfSize":"1125921"}
