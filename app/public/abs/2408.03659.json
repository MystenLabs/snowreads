By using a comprehensive firm-establishment-employee linked\ndataset and a difference-in-differences estimation with firm-level variation in\ntreatment intensity, the analysis shows that the average minimum wage level\nreduces firms' financial leverage by about 0.5 to 0.9 percentage points,\ncorresponding to 1 to 2 percent of the mean of financial leverage. Further\ninvestigation of the mechanism shows that the minimum wage does not lead to\nsignificant capital-labor substitution; therefore, the labor share increases.\nFirms react to the increased labor share by deleveraging. The results suggest\nthat while the minimum wage benefits workers by allocating more earnings to the\nlabor force, it also introduces greater operating risks and encourages\nconservative financial behavior among firms.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
