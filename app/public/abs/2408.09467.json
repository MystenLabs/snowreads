In particular, Merca made\nconjectures on the non-negativity of the coefficient of $q^N$ in truncated\nseries from the Jacobi triple product identity and the quintuple product\nidentity. In this paper, using Wright's Circle Method, we establish asymptotic\nformulas for the coefficients of truncated theta series and prove that Merca's\nconjectures are true for sufficiently large $N$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
