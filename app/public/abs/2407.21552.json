By\nusing GPUs and applying acceleration techniques as empty space skipping, high\nframe rates are possible on modern hardware. This enables performance-critical\nuse-cases such as virtual reality volume rendering. The currently fastest known\ntechnique uses volumetric distance maps to skip empty sections of the volume\nduring ray-casting but requires the distance map to be updated per transfer\nfunction change. In this paper, we demonstrate a technique for subdividing the\nvolume intensity range into partitions and deriving what we call partitioned\ndistance maps. These can be used to accelerate the distance map computation for\na newly changed transfer function by a factor up to 30. This allows the\ncurrently fastest known empty space skipping approach to be used while\nmaintaining high frame rates even when the transfer function is changed\nfrequently.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o_-A0IRrY4Vkr6dyKB8A_Rkkk94_C8bxiUGOKx9QFBk","pdfSize":"2709808"}
