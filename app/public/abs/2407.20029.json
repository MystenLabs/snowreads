These are the $C^2$-regular mappings\nwhich are critical points of the second Dirichlet energy and satisfy the weak\nisotropicity condition. We investigate the geometry of such curves including\nthe comparison and maximum principles, the Harnack inequalities, the Liouville\ntheorems, the existence results, the Phragm\\`en-Lindel\\\"of theorem, as well as\nthe three spheres theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
