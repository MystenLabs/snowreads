The Lie group of all smooth diffeomorphisms of $M$ contains the Lie\nsubgroup of all diffeomorphisms which restrict to the identity on the boundary\nof the polytope. We give the quotient of the diffeomorphism group mod subgroup\na Lie group structure. This construction turns the canonical quotient\nhomomorphism into a smooth submersion, and we then obtain related results. We\nalso study controllability on $M$ and show that the identity component of the\ndiffeomorphism group is generated by the exponential image.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
