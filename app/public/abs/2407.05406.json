We prove that a\n$3$-dimensional complete minimal hypersurface with constant scalar curvature in\n$H^{4}(-1)$ satisfies $S\\leq \\frac{21}{29}$ by making use of the Generalized\nMaximum Principle, where $S$ denotes the squared norm of the second fundamental\nform of the hypersurface.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
