Here we report that\napplication of a magnetic field up to 14 T surprisingly breaks the signature\ntemperature-linearity of the heat capacity of both phases below 150 mK,\ninducing a rapid rise in the heat capacity by as much as 5000%, whereas the AC\nmagnetic susceptibility and the electrical resistivity show little response up\nto 14 T in the same milli-Kelvin temperature range. Furthermore, the magnetic\nfield readily suppresses the thermal conductivity, and more strongly with\ndecreasing temperature below 4 K by up to 40%. All these complex thermal\nphenomena indicate a powerful simplifying principle: Application of a magnetic\nfield adversely weakens the itineracy of spinons and eventually destroys it\nwith decreasing temperature, leading to an unprecedented quantum state\nfeaturing the astonishing rise in the heat capacity, thus entropy in the most\nunlikely circumstances of milli-Kelvin temperatures and strong magnetic fields.\nWe present and discuss possible explanations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
