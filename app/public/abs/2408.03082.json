In the first method, equations are analysed and inferred\nsome of their mathematical and physical properties, which are then used to\nderive the exact stationary solutions. In the second method, we demonstrate the\nDarboux transformation method and construct exact and more general soliton\nsolutions for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (NLS equation with external\npotential term). We have proved that the solutions were more general one by\nshowcasing all kinds of soliton pairs by manoeuvring the parameters suitably.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"a59FdZmbck9Q0TOZ5fPA9efjUjr3fW4tStwzgGc2Rp4","pdfSize":"419790"}
