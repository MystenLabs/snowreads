Recently, it has been employed in a global analysis that includes\npolarized inclusive and semi-inclusive deep-inelastic scattering measurements\nat small $x$. The analysis demonstrates an excellent agreement between the\nevolution and the data, but its predictions contain large uncertainties owing\nto the large number of free parameters in the initial conditions. The latest\ndevelopment aims to mitigate this issue by employing the valence quark model in\nthe polarized proton target in order to replace most of the free parameters in\nthe initial conditions by the physical information from the proton model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
