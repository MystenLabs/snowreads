When these capabilities are overestimated,\nthere is an enhanced risk of subjecting the public to dangerous or harmful\ntechnology, artificially restricting research and development directions, and\nenabling misguided or detrimental policy. The dangers of technological hype are\nparticularly relevant in the rapidly evolving space of AI. Centering the\nresearch community as a key player in the development and proliferation of\nhype, we examine the origins and risks of AI hype to the research community and\nsociety more broadly and propose a set of measures that researchers,\nregulators, and the public can take to mitigate these risks and reduce the\nprevalence of unfounded claims about the technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
