Each subtask is mapped to\nan Equipped Function or another Agent to execute. In order to reduce verbosity\n(and hence token usage), TaskGen uses StrictJSON that ensures JSON output from\nthe Large Language Model (LLM), along with additional features such as type\nchecking and iterative error correction. Key to the philosophy of TaskGen is\nthe management of information/memory on a need-to-know basis. We empirically\nevaluate TaskGen on various environments such as 40x40 dynamic maze navigation\nwith changing obstacle locations (100% solve rate), TextWorld escape room\nsolving with dense rewards and detailed goals (96% solve rate), web browsing\n(69% of actions successful), solving the MATH dataset (71% solve rate over 100\nLevel-5 problems), Retrieval Augmented Generation on NaturalQuestions dataset\n(F1 score of 47.03%)\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aUIkz1VPc10vpc9tkSwciHGr6AIUvncW1s79a8xOo1U","pdfSize":"9159469"}
