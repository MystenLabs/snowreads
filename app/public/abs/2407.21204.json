However, non-traffic noise sources with transient behavior, which\npeople complain frequently, are usually ignored by static maps. We propose here\na dynamic noise mapping approach using the data collected via low-power\nwide-area network (LPWAN, specifically LoRaWAN) based internet of things (IoT)\ninfrastructure, which is one of the most common communication backbones for\nsmart cities. Noise mapping based on LPWAN is challenging due to the low data\nrates of these protocols. The proposed dynamic noise mapping approach\ndiminishes the negative implications of data rate limitations using machine\nlearning (ML) for event and location prediction of non-traffic sources based on\nthe scarce data. The strength of these models lies in their consideration of\nthe spatial variance in acoustic behavior caused by the buildings in urban\nsettings. The effectiveness of the proposed method and the accuracy of the\nresulting dynamic maps are evaluated in field tests. The results show that the\nproposed system can decrease the map error caused by non-traffic sources up to\n51% and can stay effective under significant packet losses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
