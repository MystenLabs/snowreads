In this work, we prove that for a\ncompact, uniformly convex set $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$ and a\n$\\mathcal{C}^1$ curve of densities $\\{p_t\\} \\subset\n\\mathcal{C}^{1,\\alpha}(\\Omega)$ that are uniformly bounded away from zero and\ninfinity, the curve of transport maps $\\{\\nabla \\phi_t\\} \\subset\n\\mathcal{C}^{1,\\alpha}(\\Omega)$, pushing $Q$ forward to $P_t$ (where $P_t$\nadmits density $p_t$ and $Q$ is sufficiently regular), is also $\\mathcal{C}^1$.\nThe proof is based on applying the implicit function theorem to the\nMonge-Amp\\`ere equation with natural boundary conditions. To achieve this, we\nestablish the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the {\\it linearized\nMonge-Amp\\`ere equation}, an elliptic partial differential equation\ncharacterized by strictly oblique boundary conditions and a null zero-order\nterm. We emphasize two significant applications of this result. Firstly, it\nenables non-parametric inference on the Monge map, paving the way for the\nconstruction of confidence bands for the transport map. Secondly, it\nestablishes the regularity of the transport-based quantile regression function\nwith respect to the covariates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
