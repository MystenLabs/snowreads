Increasingly, applications seek signal and structure in a contrastive\nsetting: a foreground dataset relative to a background dataset. For this\npurpose, we propose contrastive independent component analysis (cICA). This\ngeneralizes independent component analysis to independent latent variables\nacross a foreground and background. We propose a hierarchical tensor\ndecomposition algorithm for cICA. We study the identifiability of cICA and\ndemonstrate its performance visualizing data and finding patterns in data,\nusing synthetic and real-world datasets, comparing the approach to existing\ncontrastive methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
