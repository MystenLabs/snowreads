However, the low\nresolution of images in eye datasets often hampers precise measurement. This\nstudy evaluates the impact of various upscaling methods, ranging from bicubic\ninterpolation to advanced super-resolution, on pupil diameter predictions. We\ncompare several pre-trained methods, including CodeFormer, GFPGAN, Real-ESRGAN,\nHAT, and SRResNet. Our findings suggest that pupil diameter prediction models\ntrained on upscaled datasets are highly sensitive to the selected upscaling\nmethod and scale. Our results demonstrate that upscaling methods consistently\nenhance the accuracy of pupil diameter prediction models, highlighting the\nimportance of upscaling in pupilometry. Overall, our work provides valuable\ninsights for selecting upscaling techniques, paving the way for more accurate\nassessments in psychological and physiological research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
