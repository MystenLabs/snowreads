Recently, this formalism was generalized to compute an arbitrary\nscalar, vector, and tensor type perturbations, including the gravitational\nwaves (GWs), sourced by an arbitrary bosonic fields. In this paper, we explain\nhow to use the generalized $\\delta N$ formalism (the g$\\delta N$ formalism),\nconsidering a model with U(1) gauge fields as a concrete example. Several new\nfindings on this model and prospects on future gravitational wave experiments\nare also discussed, including the condition for the two linear polarizations of\nGWs to have different amplitudes. This paper provides a detailed explanation of\nour previous paper published in Physical Review Letters. We also discuss the\nWeinberg's adiabatic mode for an anisotropic background, showing a qualitative\ndifference from the one for the FLRW background.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
