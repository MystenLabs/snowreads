We show that the stress levels,\ninstead of diverging as predicted by steady state flow rules, remain finite and\nare entirely determined by the coupling between the particle network dilation\nand the resulting Darcy backflow. System-spanning stress gradients along the\ndilation direction lead to cross-system stress differences scaling\nquadratically with the system size. Measured stress levels are quantitatively\ncaptured by a continuum model based on a Reynolds-like dilatancy law and the\nWyart-Cates constitutive model. Beyond globally jammed suspensions, our results\nenable the modeling of inhomogeneous flows where shear jamming is local, e.g.\nunder impact, which eludes usual shear thickening rheological laws.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
