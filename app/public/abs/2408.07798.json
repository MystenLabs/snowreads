We show that in contrast to the case\nof surfaces, the lifting map is generally not injective for most regular\nbranched covers of $3$-manifolds. This includes the double cover of $S^3$\nbranched over the unlink, which generalizes the hyperelliptic branched cover of\n$S^2$. In this case, we find a finite normal generating set for the kernel of\nthe lifting map.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
