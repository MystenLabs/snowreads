This generalisation encompasses Coincident\nGeneral Relativity (CGR) and the Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to GR\n(STEGR). Using the metric formalism, we derive the field equation of the\ntheory, which generalizes the field equations of $f(Q)$ gravity. From the study\nof the covariant divergence of the field equations, it follows that the\npresence of the geometry-matter coupling leads to the non-conservation of the\nmatter energy-momentum tensor. The cosmological implications of the theory are\ninvestigated in the case of a flat, homogeneous, and isotropic\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker geometry. As a first step in this\ndirection, we obtain the modified Friedmann equations for the $f(Q,L_m)$\ngravity in a general form. Specific cosmological models are investigated for\nseveral choices of $f(Q,L_m)$, including $f(Q,L_m)=-\\alpha Q + 2L_m + \\beta$,\nand $f(Q,L_m)=- \\alpha Q + (2L_m)^2 + \\beta$, respectively. Comparative\nanalyses with the standard $\\Lambda$ CDM paradigm are carried out, and the\nobservational implications of the models are investigated in detail.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RKnj8BZ2_AAHivfBfft6VNHuZ81QJ-Ur66Act_yBb68","pdfSize":"1363507"}
