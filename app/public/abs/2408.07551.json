This study extends GVM to incorporate\ncell division, a critical biological process involved in morphogenesis,\nhomeostasis, and disease progression. Like cellular rearrangements, cell\ndivision in GVM begins by identifying a subgraph of nodes and links, involved\nin the division, by matching suitable graph patterns or templates within the\nfull knowledge graph. The matched subgraph is then transformed to incorporate\ntopological changes within the knowledge graph, caused by the division event.\nImportantly, when this transformation is applied to a polygon in a 2D tiling,\nit performs the transformation, required to divide a polygon, indicating that\nthe 3D graph transformation is general and applicable also to 2D vertex models.\nOur extension of GVM enables the study of the dynamics of growing cell\naggregates in 3D to offer new insights into developmental processes and cancer\ngrowth.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
