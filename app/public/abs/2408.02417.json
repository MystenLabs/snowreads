While existing works have explored user emotions or similar\nconcepts in some ToD tasks, none has so far included emotion modelling into a\nfully-fledged ToD system nor conducted interaction with human or simulated\nusers. In this work, we incorporate emotion into the complete ToD processing\nloop, involving understanding, management, and generation. To this end, we\nextend the EmoWOZ dataset (Feng et al., 2022) with system affective behaviour\nlabels. Through interactive experimentation involving both simulated and human\nusers, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly enhances the\nuser's emotional experience as well as the task success.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
