The first result of this paper is a\nclassification of the orbits of this action. The Burau representation then\ndefines an action of $B_4$ on $\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{Z}(q))$, where $q$ is a\nformal parameter and $\\mathbb{Z}(q)$ is the field of rational functions in $q$\nwith integer coefficients. We study orbits of the $B_4$-action on\n$\\mathbb{P}^2(\\mathbb{Z}(q))$, and show existence of embeddings of the\n$q$-deformed projective line $\\mathbb{P}^1(\\mathbb{Z}(q))$ that precisely\ncorrespond to the notion of $q$-rationals due to Morier-Genoud and Ovsienko.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
