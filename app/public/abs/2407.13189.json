When, however, such knowledge is\nnot available and instead we are given a collection of training data, the goal\nof this work is to propose simple and purely data-driven means for estimating\ndirectly the desired conditional expectation. Because conditional expectations\nappear in the description of a number of stochastic optimization problems with\nthe corresponding optimal solution satisfying a system of nonlinear equations,\nwe extend our data-driven method to cover such cases as well. We test our\nmethodology by applying it to Optimal Stopping and Optimal Action Policy in\nReinforcement Learning.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
