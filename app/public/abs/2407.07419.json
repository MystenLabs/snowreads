In the NOMA-PON, the asynchronous\nclocks between the strong and weak optical network units (ONUs) cause the\ntiming error and phase noise on the signal of the weak ONU. The theoretical\nderivation shows that the timing error and phase noise can be independently\ncompensated. In this Letter, we propose a timing recovery (TR) algorithm based\non an absolute timing error detector (Abs TED) and a pilot-based carrier phase\nrecovery (CPR) to eliminate the timing error and phase noise separately. An\nexperiment for 25G NOMA-PON is set up to verify the feasibility of the proposed\nalgorithms. The weak ONU can achieve the 20% soft-decision forward error\ncorrection limit after compensating for timing error and phase noise. In\nconclusion, the proposed TR and the pilot-based CPR show great potential for\nthe NOMA-PON.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
