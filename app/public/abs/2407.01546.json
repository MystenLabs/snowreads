This technique\nbegins by solving a smaller problem with a subset of columns and gradually\ngenerates additional columns as needed. However, the generation of columns\noften requires solving difficult subproblems repeatedly, which can be a\nbottleneck for CG. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method called\nmachine learning enhanced ant colony optimization (MLACO), to efficiently\ngenerate multiple high-quality columns from a subproblem. Specifically, we\ntrain a ML model to predict the optimal solution of a subproblem, and then\nintegrate this ML prediction into the probabilistic model of ACO to sample\nmultiple high-quality columns. Our experimental results on the bin packing\nproblem with conflicts show that the MLACO method significantly improves the\nperformance of CG compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore,\nwhen our method is incorporated into a Branch-and-Price method, it leads to a\nsignificant reduction in solution time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
