We first present an updated version\nof a traditional argument that limitative results from computability and\ncomplexity theory show that proof discovery is an inherently difficult problem.\nWe then illustrate how several recent applications of artificial\nintelligence-inspired methods -- respectively involving automated theorem\nproving, SAT-solvers, and large language models -- do indeed raise novel\nquestions about the nature of mathematical proof. We also argue that the\nresults obtained by such techniques do not tell against our basic argument.\nThis is so because they are embodiments of brute force search and are thus\ncapable of deciding only statements of low logical complexity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
