This trend has fostered an environment where people\ngravitate towards information that aligns with their preconceived notions,\nleading to the formation of echo chambers and polarization within the society.\nRecently introduced activity-driven models have been successful in capturing\nthe dynamics of information propagation and polarization. The present study\nuses this model to explore the impact of social media on a polarized society.\nBy considering the varying influence of media, ranging from exposing\nindividuals to contradictory views to reinforcing existing opinions, a\nsupercritical pitchfork bifurcation is observed, triggering a transition from\nconsensus to polarization. The transition points from polarization to consensus\nare derived analytically and is validated through numerical simulations. This\nresearch sheds light on the complex interplay between social media dynamics and\nsocietal polarization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
