However, when faced with the cases of multiple wardens and highly\ncorrelated channels, FDA is limited by the frequency constraint and cannot\nprovide satisfactory covert performance. In this paper, we propose a novel\nmovable FDA (MFDA) antenna technology where positions of the antennas can be\ndynamically adjusted in a given finite region. Specifically, we aim to maximize\nthe covert rate by jointly optimizing the antenna beamforming vector, antenna\nfrequency vector and antenna position vector. To solve this non-convex\noptimization problem with coupled variables, we develop a two-stage alternating\noptimization (AO) algorithm based on the block successive upper-bound\nminimization (BSUM) method. Moreover, considering the challenge of obtaining\nperfect channel state information (CSI) at multiple wardens, we study the case\nof imperfect CSI. Simulation results demonstrate that MFDA can significantly\nenhance covert performance compared to the conventional FDA. In particular,\nwhen the frequency constraint is strict, MFDA can further increase the covert\nrate by adjusting the positions of antennas instead of the frequencies.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
