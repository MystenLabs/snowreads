In vanishing Reynolds number flows, the nonlinearity in\nthe polymer evolution equation alone can sustain inertialess 'elastic'\nturbulence (ET) while 'elasto-inertial' turbulence (EIT) appears to rely on an\ninterplay between elasticity and finite-$Re$ effects. Despite their distinct\nphenomenology and industrial significance, transition routes and possible\nconnections between these states are unknown. We identify here a common\nRuelle-Takens transition scenario for both of these chaotic regimes in\ntwo-dimensional direct numerical simulations of FENE-P fluids in a straight\nchannel. The primary bifurcation is caused by a recently-discovered 'polymer\ndiffusive instability' associated with small but non-vanishing polymer stress\ndiffusion which generates a finite-amplitude, small-scale travelling wave\nlocalised at the wall. This is found to be unstable to a large-scale secondary\ninstability which grows to modify the whole flow before itself breaking down in\na third bifurcation to either ET or EIT. The secondary large-scale instability\nwaves resemble 'centre' and 'wall' modes respectively - instabilities which\nhave been conjectured to play a role in viscoelastic chaotic dynamics but were\npreviously only thought to exist far from relevant areas of the parameter\nspace.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nz9MaVyUQWyvp2IHceq3_dgxilPoph_vndwcjIcrHsQ","pdfSize":"1533735"}
