A complete process of this formulation within the second order\nWRA is given, with explicit forms of charge and current densities, $\\rho ,\n\\vec{J}$, and electric and magnetic polarizations, $\\vec{P}$, $\\vec{M}$\ncontaining correction terms. They fulfill, not only the continuity equation,\nbut also the relations $\\nabla \\cdot \\vec{P}=-\\rho, \\ \\partial \\vec{P}/\\partial\nt + c \\nabla \\times \\vec{M} = \\vec{J}$, known in the classical EM theory for\nthe corresponding macroscopic variables. This theory should be able to describe\nall the EM responses within the second order WRA, and the least necessary\nvariables are ${\\phi, \\vec{A}, \\rho, \\vec{J}}$ (six independent components).\nFrom this viewpoint, there emerges a problem about the use of \"spin current\"\npopularly discussed in spintronics, because it does not belong to the group of\nleast necessary variables.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
