These properties are analyzed using published\ndata sets of zero, weak and moderately strong adverse-pressure-gradient (APG)\nTBLs across a decade of $Re_{\\tau}$, revealing similarity in energy-transfer\npathways for all these TBLs. It is found that both the inner and outer peaks of\n$\\overline{u^2}$ are always associated with local maxima in the\n$\\overline{u^2}$-production and its inter-component transport, and the regions\nbelow/above each of these peaks are always dominated by\nwall-ward/away-from-wall transport of $\\overline{u^2}$, thereby classifying the\n$\\overline{u^2}$-profiles into four distinct regimes. This classification\nreveals existence of phenomenologically similar energy-transfer mechanisms in\nthe `inner' and `outer' regions of moderately strong APG TBLs, which meet at an\nintermediate location coinciding with the minimum in $\\overline{u^2}$ profiles.\nGiven that the wall-ward/away-from-wall transport of $\\overline{u^2}$ is\ngoverned by the $\\rm Q_4$(sweeps)/$\\rm Q_2$(ejections) quadrants of the\nReynolds shear stress, it is argued that the emergence of the $\\overline{u^2}$\nouter peak corresponds with the statistical dominance of $\\rm Q_4$ events in\nthe outer region. Besides unravelling the dynamical significance of $\\rm Q_2$\nand $\\rm Q_4$ events in the outer region of turbulent boundary layers, the\npresent analysis also proposes new phenomenological arguments for testing on\ncanonical wall-turbulence data at very high $Re_{\\tau}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ffWkvCHlxaSTth7QSgj4pztB5eG1emQPK3t4cE4maOI","pdfSize":"1996194"}
