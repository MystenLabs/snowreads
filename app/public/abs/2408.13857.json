Pressure enhances the deviation of $B_{\\rm\nc}(T)$ from the parabolic behavior, expected for a typical type-I\nsuperconductor, suggesting a weakening of the coupling strengths\n$\\alpha=\\langle\\Delta\\rangle /k_{\\rm B}T_{\\rm c}$ ($\\langle\\Delta\\rangle$ is\nthe average value of the superconducting energy gap, $T_{\\rm c}$ is the\ntransition temperature and $k_{\\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant). As pressure\nincreases from 0.0 to $\\simeq 3.0$ GPa $\\alpha$ decreases linearly, by\napproaching the limiting weak-coupling BCS value $\\alpha_{\\rm BCS}=1.764$.\nAnalysis of the data within the framework of the Eliashberg theory reveals that\nonly part of the pressure effect on $\\alpha$ can be attributed to the effect of\nhardening of the phonon spectra, which is reflected by a decrease of the\nelectron-phonon coupling constant. Nearly 40% of the effect is caused by\nincreased anisotropy of the superconducting energy gap.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
