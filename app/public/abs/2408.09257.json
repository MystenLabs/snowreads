One can use this identity to prove\ninequalities that constrain the fusion coefficients $N_{\\mu\\nu}^l$ in the case\nof RCFTs that descend from current algebras. It also leads to a statement\nregarding the conjugacy symmetry of the sums of squares of fusion coefficients\nfor current algebras admitting complex representations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
