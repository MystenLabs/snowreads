Here, we develop an\natomistic tight-binding model demonstrating a possible contribution to this\neffect arising from the pumping of atomic electron orbital angular momentum of\nTi by chiral motion of oxygen atoms coordinating it, and facilitated by the\ndegeneracy of its t2g orbitals allowing unquenched transient orbital moments.\nThe proposed mechanism may be relevant to other materials with orbitally\ndegenerate or quasi-degenerate electron states, and is attractive for efficient\norbital moment generation in orbitronic applications without electric currents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
