Since Diffusion Models (DMs) have strong capabilities\nin generating high-frequency details, we consider introducing DMs into the\nvideo deblurring task. However, we found that directly applying DMs to the\nvideo deblurring task has the following problems: (1) DMs require many\niteration steps to generate videos from Gaussian noise, which consumes many\ncomputational resources. (2) DMs are easily misled by the blurry artifacts in\nthe video, resulting in irrational content and distortion of the deblurred\nvideo. To address the above issues, we propose a novel video deblurring\nframework VD-Diff that integrates the diffusion model into the Wavelet-Aware\nDynamic Transformer (WADT). Specifically, we perform the diffusion model in a\nhighly compact latent space to generate prior features containing\nhigh-frequency information that conforms to the ground truth distribution. We\ndesign the WADT to preserve and recover the low-frequency information in the\nvideo while utilizing the high-frequency information generated by the diffusion\nmodel. Extensive experiments show that our proposed VD-Diff outperforms SOTA\nmethods on GoPro, DVD, BSD, and Real-World Video datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
