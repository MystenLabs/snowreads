We\ninvestigate whether an anomalous U(1)${}_R$ can be identified as the PQ\nsymmetry suitable for solving the strong CP problem within supersymmetric\nextensions of the Standard Model. In this case, U(1)${}_R$ is broken at some\nintermediate scale and the QCD axion is the R-axion. Moreover, the R-symmetry\ncan be naturally gauged via the Green-Schwartz mechanism within completions to\nsupergravity, thus evading the axion quality problem. Obstacles to realizing\nthis scenario are highlighted and phenomenologically viable approaches are\nidentified.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
