The SLE is also solved numerically\nusing a second-order finite difference method with a correlated noise model.\nBoth theoretical and numerical solutions, validated through molecular dynamics,\nindicate that surface tension forces due to specific external perturbations\novercome the random effects of thermal fluctuations, determining both the\nthermal capillary waves and the evolution of perturbation growth. The results\nalso show two distinct regimes: (i) the hydrodynamic regime, where external\nperturbations dominate, leading to uniform ruptures, and (ii) the\nthermal-fluctuation regime, where external perturbations are surpassed by\nthermal fluctuations, resulting in non-uniform ruptures. The transition between\nthese regimes, modelled by a criterion developed from the linear instability\ntheory, exhibits a strong dependence on the amplitudes and wavenumbers of the\nexternal perturbations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
