We determine the enantiospecific sign of\nthe nonlinear conductance and identify anomalies in its carrier-density\ndependence. Our findings, combined with the Boltzmann equation, are attributed\nto a chiral orbital texture, namely a chiral distribution of the orbital\nmagnetic moment in reciprocal space. This study underscores the efficacy of\nnonlinear transport measurements in probing orbital-related effects, whose\ndifferentiation from spin counterparts is often demanding in the linear\nresponse regime of electron transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X3QVq5hraqZVUQKKe6oxH5Ho1ONa_DCLY56LsNbhmJE","pdfSize":"34876898"}
