Wald \\ea, Appl. Opt. \\textbf{62}, 1-7\n(2023), we use the Red Pitaya STEMlab 125-14 platform to digitally generate and\ndemodulate an auxiliary radio-frequency tone whose beat with the optical\ncarrier probes the I/Q modulator's phase imbalances. We implement a\nmultiple-input, multiple-output integral feedback controller which accounts for\nunavoidable cross-couplings in the phase biases to lock the error signals at\nexactly zero where optical power fluctuations have no impact on phase\nstability. We demonstrate $>23\\,\\rm dB$ suppression of the optical carrier\nrelative to the desired sideband at $+3.4\\,\\rm GHz$ over a period of $15$ hours\nand over temperature variations of $20^\\circ\\rm C$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-VTEF54AOJn_YVMuHqJoqn8aKS6-8nTOf79thBWxNfc","pdfSize":"1412223"}
