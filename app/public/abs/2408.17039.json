Our analysis focused on\nobservations with quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) of frequencies greater\nthan 1 Hz, revealing that all of them belong to type C QPOs. We found a strong\ncorrelation between the QPO frequency and the hardness ratio, as well as a\nlinear relationship between the QPO RMS and the hardness ratio. The bicoherence\nanalysis revealed a transition from a \"web\" pattern to a \"hypotenuse\" pattern\nin the LE and HE energy bands. In the bicoherence patterns, there are\ncorrelations between horizontal and vertical bicoherence at $f_1=f_2=f_{\\rm\nQPO}$ with count rates. The diagonal structure at $f_1+f_2=f_{\\rm QPO}$ becomes\nmore prominent with increasing energy. Additionally, we discovered a new\nbicoherence pattern in the medium energy band from 10 -- 20 keV, the diagonal\nstructure at $f_1+f_2=f_{\\rm har}$ is prominent only in this energy band, which\nwe refer to as the \"parallel\" pattern. The bicoherence analysis indicates that\nthe source is likely a low-inclination source.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
