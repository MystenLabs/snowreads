For a 2D-layer\nconfiguration, we show that the interplay between molecular chirality and\nspatial dispersion of the cavity-modes, results in a gyrotropic coupling $\\chi$\nat the origin of a differential shift in polaritonic energy-spectra. This\ndifferential shift is proportional to $\\chi$, while for 3D bulk-aggregate\nconfigurations it is shown to vanish. We interpret physically the former\n2D-chiral effect by analogy with the classical Newtonian motion of a fictive\nparticle in presence of 3D restoring force, and static magnetic field. The\ngyrotropic coupling is shown to directly perturbate the anholonomy angle of the\nclassical trajectories, and the fictive particle undergoes cyclotron gyrations\nupon entering the ultrastrong light-matter coupling regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"C4qEZhskLsExeHIBV8nm0ZismkHh2AJryU0G9RxgT6g","pdfSize":"1685618"}
