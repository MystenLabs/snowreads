With these apps handling sensitive personal and financial data,\nensuring their security is paramount. While previous research has explored\nmobile app developer practices, there is limited knowledge about the common\npractices and challenges that developers face in securing their apps. Our study\naddresses this need through a global survey of 137 experienced mobile app\ndevelopers, providing a developer-centric view of mobile app security. Our\nfindings show that developers place high importance on security, frequently\nimplementing features such as authentication and secure storage. They face\nchallenges with managing vulnerabilities, permissions, and privacy concerns,\nand often rely on resources like Stack Overflow for help. Many developers find\nthat existing learning materials do not adequately prepare them to build secure\napps and provide recommendations, such as following best practices and\nintegrating security at the beginning of the development process. We envision\nour findings leading to improved security practices, better-designed tools and\nresources, and more effective training programs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
