Such a UV\ntail of the PGW energy spectrum has a spurious logarithmic divergence. We study\nthe origin of such a divergence, and find that it comes from the instantaneous\ninflation-to-post-inflation transition, which can be removed by considering a\nfinite duration. For the first time, we obtain a semi-analytical expression for\nthe PGW energy spectrum. We find that the UV tail decays exponentially, while\nthe decay rate depends solely on the transition rate. When there is a stiff\npost-inflationary stage, the enhanced PGW displays a characteristic spectral\nshape of power-law increasing and exponential decaying. We propose a fitting\nformula which can be used for signal searching.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
