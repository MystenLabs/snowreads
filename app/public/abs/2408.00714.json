We build a data\nengine, which improves model and data via user interaction, to collect the\nlargest video segmentation dataset to date. Our model is a simple transformer\narchitecture with streaming memory for real-time video processing. SAM 2\ntrained on our data provides strong performance across a wide range of tasks.\nIn video segmentation, we observe better accuracy, using 3x fewer interactions\nthan prior approaches. In image segmentation, our model is more accurate and 6x\nfaster than the Segment Anything Model (SAM). We believe that our data, model,\nand insights will serve as a significant milestone for video segmentation and\nrelated perception tasks. We are releasing a version of our model, the dataset\nand an interactive demo.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
