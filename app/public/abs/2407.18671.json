To derive the\ncompressed operator, we construct a hierarchical basis of an approximate\nsolution space, with superlocalized basis functions that are quasi-orthogonal\nacross hierarchy levels with respect to the inner product induced by the energy\nnorm. The superlocalization is achieved through a novel variant of the\nSuper-Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method that is built upon corrections\nof basis functions arising from the Localized Orthogonal Decomposition method.\nThe hierarchical basis not only induces a sparse compression of the solution\nspace but also enables an orthogonal multiresolution decomposition of the\napproximate solution operator, decoupling scales and solution contributions of\neach level of the hierarchy. With this decomposition, the solution of the PDE\nreduces to the solution of a set of independent linear systems per level with\nmesh-independent condition numbers that can be computed simultaneously. We\npresent an accuracy study of the compressed solution operator as well as\nnumerical results illustrating our theoretical findings and beyond, revealing\nthat desired optimal error rates with well-behaved superlocalized basis\nfunctions can still be attained even in the challenging case of coefficients\nwith high-contrast channels.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
