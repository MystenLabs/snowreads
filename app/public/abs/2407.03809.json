Due to the limited availability of speech translation data for\nEstonian, we created additional training data by web scraping and synthesizing\ndata from speech recognition datasets using machine translation. We evaluated\nthree publicly available end-to-end models: Whisper, OWSM 3.1, and SeamlessM4T.\nOur results indicate that fine-tuning with synthetic data enhances translation\naccuracy by a large margin, with SeamlessM4T matching or surpassing cascaded\nspeech translation systems that use state-of-the-art speech recognition and\nmachine translation models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
