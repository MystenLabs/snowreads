A comparative\nanalysis of multilingual and English transformer models was performed on a\ndataset of over twenty million data points. The analysis included a wide range\nof metrics and performance indicators to compare dynamic profile embeddings\nversus non-embeddings (effectively static profile embeddings). A comparative\nstudy using degradation functions was conducted. Extensive testing and research\nconfirmed that dynamic embedding successfully tracks users' changing tastes and\npreferences, providing more accurate recommendations and higher user\nengagement. These results are important for social media platforms aiming to\nimprove user experience through relevant features and sophisticated\nrecommendation engines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZYjxytxduii9A5Kc5C2QTj5Tw7gPr2bXlJknEzPNrw8","pdfSize":"1854220"}
