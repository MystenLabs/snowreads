We first establish the joint tail distribution of $W_\\infty$\nand the global minimum of this branching random walk. Next, conditioned on the\nevent that the minimum is atypically small or conditioned on very large\n$W_\\infty$, we study the branching random walk viewed from the minimum and\nobtain the convergence in law in the vague sense. As a byproduct, we also get\nthe right tail of the limit of derivative martingale.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
