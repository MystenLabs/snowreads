As a consequence of the\nholonomy reduction, these manifolds are Ricci-flat. These metrics are built on\nthe total spaces of principal $T^2$-bundles over asymptotically conical Calabi\nYau manifolds. The resulting metrics have a new geometry at infinity that we\ncall asymptotically $T^2$-fibred conical ($AT^2C$) and which generalizes to\nhigher dimensions the ALG metrics of 4-dimensional hyperk\\\"ahler geometry,\nanalogously to how ALC metrics generalize ALF metrics. As an application of\nthis construction, we produce infinitely many diffeomorphism types of $AT^2C$\n$\\operatorname{Spin}(7)$-manifolds and the first known example of complete\ntoric $\\operatorname{Spin}(7)$-manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
