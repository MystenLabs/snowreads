We show\nthat $(i)$ quantum-classical dynamics along such a Hamiltonian maintains\nmomentum conservation and $(ii)$ diagonalizing such a Hamiltonian can recover\nthe electronic momentum and electronic current density reasonably well. In\nconjunction with other reports in the literature that such a phase-space\napproach can also recover vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectra, we\nsubmit that the present phase-space approach offers a testable and powerful\napproach to post-Born-Oppenheimer electronic structure theory. Moreover, the\napproach is inexpensive and can be immediately applied to simulations of chiral\ninduced spin selectivity experiments (where the transfer of angular momentum\nbetween nuclei and electrons is considered critical).\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
