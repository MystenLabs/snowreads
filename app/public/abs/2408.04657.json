To\nthis end, the flow between two parallel surfaces is numerically addressed by\ncomputing two-dimensional numerical simulations. One of the surfaces moves with\na uniform rectilinear motion, while the other is fixed, with a cavity in the\nmiddle. The steady-state flow is laminar and monophasic with a low Reynolds\nnumber. The reduction of the wall shear stress caused by a vortex in the\ncavity, with respect to a Couette flow, looks like the creation of an\nequivalent slip of the fluid on the wall at a macroscopic scale.Three methods\nare used to calculate the slip length: one is based on the wall shear stress\nand the other two are based on the speed of the fluid flow. When the slip\nlength is calculated according to these three methods, the obtained results\ndiffer. The differences show that the slip often used in the literature is a\nmacroscopic representation of local effects that are not necessarily slippery.\nThe speed profiles and the streamlines are then discussed, in order to propose\nan explanation for this difference.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
