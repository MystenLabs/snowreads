Despite its potential to improve perception\naccuracy and robustness, the large amount of raw sensor data inevitably results\nin high communication overhead. To mitigate this issue, we propose TOCOM-V2I, a\ntask-oriented communication framework for V2I cooperative perception, which\nreduces bandwidth consumption by transmitting only task-relevant information,\ninstead of the raw data stream, for perceiving the surrounding environment. Our\ncontributions are threefold. First, we propose a spatial-aware feature\nselection module to filter out irrelevant information based on spatial\nrelationships and perceptual prior. Second, we introduce a hierarchical entropy\nmodel to exploit redundancy within the features for efficient compression and\ntransmission. Finally, we utilize a scaled dot-product attention architecture\nto fuse vehicle-side and infrastructure-side features to improve perception\nperformance. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of TOCOM-V2I.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
