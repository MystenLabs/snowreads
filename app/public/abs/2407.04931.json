Approximate $G$-samplers may\nintroduce multiplicative and/or additive errors to this probability, and some\nhave a non-trivial probability of failure.\n  In this paper we focus on the exact $G$-sampling problem, where $G$ is\nselected from the class $\\mathcal{G}$ of Laplace exponents of non-negative,\none-dimensional L\\'evy processes, which includes several well studied classes\nsuch as $p$th moments $G(z)=z^p$, $p\\in[0,1]$, logarithms $G(z)=\\log(1+z)$,\nCohen and Geri's soft concave sublinear functions, which are used to\napproximate concave sublinear functions, including cap statistics. We develop\n$G$-samplers for a vector $\\mathbf{x} \\in \\mathbb{R}_+^n$ that is presented as\nan incremental stream of positive updates. In particular:\n  * For any $G\\in\\mathcal{G}$, we give a very simple $G$-sampler that uses 2\nwords of memory and stores at all times a $v_*\\in [n]$, such that $\\Pr(v_*=v)$\nis exactly $G(\\mathbf{x}(v))/G(\\mathbf{x})$.\n  * We give a ``universal'' $\\mathcal{G}$-sampler that uses $O(\\log n)$ words\nof memory w.h.p., and given any $G\\in \\mathcal{G}$ at query time, produces an\nexact $G$-sample.\n  With an overhead of a factor of $k$, both samplers can be used to $G$-sample\na sequence of $k$ indices with or without replacement. Our sampling framework\nis simple and versatile, and can easily be generalized to sampling from more\ncomplex objects like graphs and hypergraphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
