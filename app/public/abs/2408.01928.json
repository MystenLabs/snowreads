Most existing query\nintent classification methods rely on the users' click behavior as a supervised\nsignal to construct training samples. However, these methods based entirely on\nposterior labels may lead to serious category imbalance problems because of the\nMatthew effect in click samples. Compared with popular categories, it is\ndifficult for products under long-tail categories to obtain traffic and user\nclicks, which makes the models unable to detect users' intent for products\nunder long-tail categories. This in turn aggravates the problem that long-tail\ncategories cannot obtain traffic, forming a vicious circle. In addition, due to\nthe randomness of the user's click, the posterior label is unstable for the\nquery with similar semantics, which makes the model very sensitive to the\ninput, leading to an unstable and incomplete recall of categories.\n  In this paper, we propose a novel Semi-supervised Multi-channel Graph\nConvolutional Network (SMGCN) to address the above problems from the\nperspective of label association and semi-supervised learning. SMGCN extends\ncategory information and enhances the posterior label by utilizing the\nsimilarity score between the query and categories. Furthermore, it leverages\nthe co-occurrence and semantic similarity graph of categories to strengthen the\nrelations among labels and weaken the influence of posterior label instability.\nWe conduct extensive offline and online A/B experiments, and the experimental\nresults show that SMGCN significantly outperforms the strong baselines, which\nshows its effectiveness and practicality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
