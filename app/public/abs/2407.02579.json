A semantic\n  analysis of how politics and democracy are treated in SIGCHI conference\n  papers","authors":"Matti Nelimarkka, Ville Vuorenmaa","authorsParsed":[["Nelimarkka","Matti",""],["Vuorenmaa","Ville",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2024 18:02:10 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-04","timestamp":1719943330000,"abstract":"  Human-computer interaction scholars are increasingly touching on topics\nrelated to politics or democracy. As these concepts are ambiguous, an\nexamination of concepts' invoked meanings aids in the self-reflection of our\nresearch efforts. We conduct a thematic analysis of all papers with the word\n`politics' in abstract, title or keywords ($n$=378) and likewise 152 papers\nwith the word `democracy.' We observe that these words are increasingly being\nused in human-computer interaction, both in absolute and relative terms. At the\nsame time, we show that researchers invoke these words with diverse levels of\nanalysis in mind: the early research focused on mezzo-level (i.e., small\ngroups), but more recently the work has begun to include macro-level analysis\n(i.e., society and politics as played in the public sphere). After the\nincreasing focus on the macro-level, we see a transition towards more normative\nand activist research, in some areas it replaces observational and empirical\nresearch. These differences indicate semantic differences, which -- in the\nworst case -- may limit scientific progress. We bring these differences visible\nto help in further exchanges of ideas and human-computer interaction community\nto explore how it orients itself to politics and democracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
