One of these is the data\nsubjects' right to access their personal data being collected by services (data\ncontrollers), complemented with a new right to data portability. Based on\nthese, data controllers are obliged to provide respective data and allow data\nsubjects to use them at their own discretion.\n  However, the subjects' possibilities for actually using and harnessing said\ndata are severely limited so far. Among other reasons, this can be attributed\nto a lack of research dedicated to the actual use of controller-provided\nsubject access request packages (SARPs). To open up and facilitate such\nresearch, we outline a general, high-level method for generating,\npre-processing, publishing, and finally using SARPs of different providers.\nFurthermore, we establish a realistic dataset comprising two users' SARPs from\nfive services. This dataset is publicly provided and shall, in the future,\nserve as a starting and reference point for researching and comparing novel\napproaches for the practically viable use of SARPs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
