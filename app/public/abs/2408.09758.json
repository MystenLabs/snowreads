The required information for this\ncalculation includes the fixed points of the orbifold and the manner in which\nthe spatial symmetries act on these points, unlike previous studies that\nnecessitated the calculation of zero modes. Since the fixed point theorem can\nbe applied to any fermionic theory on any orbifold, it allows us to determine\nthe index even on orbifolds where the calculation of zero modes is challenging\nor in the presence of non-trivial gauge configurations.\n  We compute the indices on the $T^{2}/ \\mathbb{Z}_N\\,(N=2,3,4,6)$ and $T^{4}/\n\\mathbb{Z}_N\\,(N=2,3,5)$ as examples. Furthermore, we also attempt to compute\nthe indices on a Coxeter orbifold related to the $D_4$ lattice.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
