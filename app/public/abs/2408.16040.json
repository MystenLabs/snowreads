Each of these domains has special properties or\nstructure that can complicate learning. A theme throughout this thesis is\nthinking about ways in which a `plain' empirical risk minimization algorithm\nwill be misleading or ineffective because of a mis-match between classical\nlearning theory assumptions and specific properties of some data distribution\nin the wild. Theoretical understanding in eachof these domains can help guide\nbest practices and allow for the design of effective, reliable, and robust\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"cDQ9ATJCb-IvbaEI71mogF8E1fKmHAudGqdtyZbUmi8","pdfSize":"3972735"}
