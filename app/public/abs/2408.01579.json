This study presents a 3D shape and\ncolor-based descriptor, TOPS2, for point clouds generated from RGB-D images and\nan accompanying recognition framework, THOR2. The TOPS2 descriptor embodies\nobject unity, a human cognition mechanism, by retaining the slicing-based\ntopological representation of 3D shape from the TOPS descriptor while capturing\nobject color information through slicing-based color embeddings computed using\na network of coarse color regions. These color regions, analogous to the\nMacAdam ellipses identified in human color perception, are obtained using the\nMapper algorithm, a topological soft-clustering technique. THOR2, trained using\nsynthetic data, demonstrates markedly improved recognition accuracy compared to\nTHOR, its 3D shape-based predecessor, on two benchmark real-world datasets: the\nOCID dataset capturing cluttered scenes from different viewpoints and the UW-IS\nOccluded dataset reflecting different environmental conditions and degrees of\nobject occlusion recorded using commodity hardware. THOR2 also outperforms\nbaseline deep learning networks, and a widely-used ViT adapted for RGB-D inputs\non both the datasets. Therefore, THOR2 is a promising step toward achieving\nrobust recognition in low-cost robots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
