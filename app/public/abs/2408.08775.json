In this paper, we present a silent self-stabilising,\ndeterministic, stationary, election algorithm for particles having constant\nmemory, assuming that the system is simply connected. Our algorithm is elegant\nand simple, and requires constant memory per particle. We prove that our\nalgorithm always stabilises to a configuration with a unique leader, under a\ndaemon satisfying some fairness guarantees (Gouda fairness [Gouda 2001]). We\nuse the special geometric properties of programmable matter in 2D triangular\ngrids to obtain the first self-stabilising algorithm for such systems. This\nresult is surprising since it is known that silent self-stabilising algorithms\nfor election in general distributed networks require $\\Omega(\\log{n})$ bits of\nmemory per node, even for ring topologies [Dolev et al. 1999].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
