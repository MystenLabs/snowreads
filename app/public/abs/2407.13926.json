Representatives from the National AI Research\nInstitutes that had been established as of January 2023 were invited to attend;\nresearchers representing 14 Institutes attended and participated. The\nconference focused on three questions: What are the main challenges that the\nNational AI Institutes are facing with regard to the responsible design of AI\nsystems? What are promising lines of inquiry to address these challenges? What\nare possible points of collaboration? Over the course of the conference, a\nrevised version of the first question became a focal point: What are the\nchallenges that the Institutes face in identifying ethical and responsible\ndesign practices and in implementing them in the AI development process? This\ndocument summarizes the challenges that representatives from the Institutes in\nattendance highlighted.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-2s7xz2ujmF4IXbW34kcIVG-YBwK2u87Qa88Z4HCIeQ","pdfSize":"191402"}
