Although an unbounded infinite limit is not a problem\nin itself, it raises the possibility of unfamiliar phenomena when the Reynolds\nnumber is large, and has motivated attempts to avoid it. We review the subject\nand point to possible pitfalls stemming from uncritical extrapolation from low\nReynolds numbers, or from an over-simplification of the multiscale nature of\nturbulence. It is shown that large attached eddies dominate the\nhigh-Reynolds-number regime of the near-wall layer, and that they behave\ndifferently from smaller-scale ones. In that limit, the near-wall layer is\ncontrolled by the outer flow, the large-scale fluctuations reduce to turbulent\nlayers modulated by a variable friction velocity, and the kinetic-energy peak\nis substituted by a deeper structure with a secondary outer maximum. The\nfriction velocity is then not necessarily the best velocity scale. While the\nnear-wall energy peak probably becomes unbounded in wall units, it tends to\nzero when expressed in terms of the outer velocity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
