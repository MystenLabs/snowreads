From a\ndiachronic corpus based on French media archives spanning 60 years from 1955 to\n2015, automatic transcription and forced alignment allowed extracting the\ncentral frame of each vowel. More than one million frames were obtained from\nover a thousand speakers across gender and age categories. Their formants were\nused from these vocalic frames to fit the parameters of Maeda's articulatory\nmodel. Evaluations of the quality of these processes are provided. We focus\nhere on two parameters of Maeda's model linked to total vocal tract length: the\nrelative position of the larynx (higher for females) and the lips protrusion\n(more protruded for males). Implications for voice quality across genders are\ndiscussed. The effect across periods seems gender independent; thus, the\nassertion that females lowered their pitch with time is not supported.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
