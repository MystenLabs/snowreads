Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have led to\ntheir use in generating high-quality commit messages, such as the Omniscient\nMessage Generator (OMG). This method employs GPT-4 to produce state-of-the-art\ncommit messages. However, the use of proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 in coding\ntasks raises privacy and sustainability concerns, which may hinder their\nindustrial adoption. Considering that open-source LLMs have achieved\ncompetitive performance in developer tasks such as compiler validation, this\nstudy investigates whether they can be used to generate commit messages that\nare comparable with OMG. Our experiments show that an open-source LLM can\ngenerate commit messages that are comparable to those produced by OMG. In\naddition, through a series of contextual refinements, we propose lOcal MessagE\nGenerAtor (OMEGA) , a CMG approach that uses a 4-bit quantized 8B open-source\nLLM. OMEGA produces state-of-the-art commit messages, surpassing the\nperformance of GPT-4 in practitioners' preference.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
