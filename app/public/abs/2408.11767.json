However, with this work, we question this procedure,\nhighlighting that it would further damage the pipeline of any multimodal\nrecommender system. First, we show that the lack of (some) modalities is, in\nfact, a widely-diffused phenomenon in multimodal recommendation. Second, we\npropose a pipeline that imputes missing multimodal features in recommendation\nby leveraging traditional imputation strategies in machine learning. Then,\ngiven the graph structure of the recommendation data, we also propose three\nmore effective imputation solutions that leverage the item-item co-purchase\ngraph and the multimodal similarities of co-interacted items. Our method can be\nplugged into any multimodal RSs in the literature working as an untrained\npre-processing phase, showing (through extensive experiments) that any data\npre-filtering is not only unnecessary but also harmful to the performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5K-Ol0-x1tNKgUGktDusJigl8fFuzgu-t289sDL60Dk","pdfSize":"648220"}
