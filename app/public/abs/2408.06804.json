This research delves deeply into the complex field of\nSpeaker Identification (SID), examining its essential components and\nemphasising Mel Spectrogram and Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) for\nfeature extraction. Moreover, this study evaluates six slightly distinct model\narchitectures using extensive analysis to evaluate their performance, with\nhyperparameter tuning applied to the best-performing model. This work performs\na linguistic analysis to verify accent and gender accuracy, in addition to bias\nevaluation within the AB-1 Corpus dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
