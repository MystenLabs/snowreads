However, whence traversing the path to the destination, the\nvehicle's mobility necessitates frequent handovers among the access points\n(APs) to maintain continuous and uninterrupted wireless connections to maintain\nthe network's Quality of Service (QoS). These frequent handovers subsequently\nlead to task migrations among the edge servers associated with the respective\nAPs. This paper addresses the joint problem of task migration and access-point\nhandover by proposing a deep reinforcement learning framework based on the Deep\nDeterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. A joint allocation method of\ncommunication and computation of APs is proposed to minimize computational\nload, service latency, and interruptions with the overarching goal of\nmaximizing QoS. We implement and evaluate our proposed framework on simulated\nexperiments to achieve smooth and seamless task switching among edge servers,\nultimately reducing latency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
