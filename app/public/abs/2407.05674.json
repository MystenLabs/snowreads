These agents must retrieve and\nprovide consistent, accurate, and relevant information to address user's\nqueries and needs. Yet such agents generate unfounded responses\n(\"hallucinate\"). Traditional dialogue trees can only handle a limited number of\nconversation flows, making them inherently brittle. To this end, we present\nKITA - a programmable framework for creating task-oriented conversational\nagents that are designed to handle complex user interactions. Unlike LLMs, KITA\nprovides reliable grounded responses, with controllable agent policies through\nits expressive specification, KITA Worksheet. In contrast to dialog trees, it\nis resilient to diverse user queries, helpful with knowledge sources, and\noffers ease of programming policies through its declarative paradigm. Through a\nreal-user study involving 62 participants, we show that KITA beats the GPT-4\nwith function calling baseline by 26.1, 22.5, and 52.4 points on execution\naccuracy, dialogue act accuracy, and goal completion rate, respectively. We\nalso release 22 real-user conversations with KITA manually corrected to ensure\naccuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
