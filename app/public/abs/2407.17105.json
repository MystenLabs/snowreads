This paper concretely constructs\nsuch Grothendieck topoi, including the presheaf topos of the free monoid\ngenerated by countably infinite elements $\\mathbf{PSh}(M_\\omega)$. Utilizing\nthe combinatorics of the classifying topos of the theory of inhabited objects\nand considering pairing functions, the problem is reduced to making rigid\nrelational structures. This is accomplished by using Kunen's theorem on\nelementary embeddings in set theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
