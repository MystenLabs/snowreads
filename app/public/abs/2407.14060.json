While based on Barrow's idea of fractal black hole horizon,\nones [Phys. Lett. B 831 (137181) 2022] had proposed that for a spherically\nfractal structure the minimal increase of the horizon area is the area of the\nsmallest bubble sphere. And the corresponding black hole entropy is of a\nlogarithmic form, which is similar to that of Boltzmann entropy under a certain\ncondition. Based on these, we re-derive the entropy of the Barrow's\nEinstein-power-Yang-Mills (EPYM) AdS black hole, and calculate the temperature\nand heat capacity of the Barrow's EPYM AdS black hole. There exists an\ninteresting phenomena that the ratio between the Barrow's temperature and the\nHawking temperature of the EPYM AdS black hole is fully consistent with that of\nother Schwarzschild-like black holes. The Barrow's temperature and Hawking\ntemperature with the certain range of $\\Lambda$ are monotonically increasing\nand the corresponding heat capacities are all positive, which means these black\nholes are thermodynamically stable. Besides, for the Barrow's EPYM AdS black\nhole its heat capacity has a Schottky anomaly-like behavior, which may reflect\nthe existence of the discrete energy level and the microscopical degree of\nfreedom.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v_L1eaRbJz7ZNOXBkwbbp9Xp46BjtNcYVuTVQFFqNlY","pdfSize":"176005"}
