The fully reduced model combines reduced basis approximations of\nthe system dynamics and of the manifold of optimal final time adjoint states to\nachieve a computational complexity independent of the original state space.\nSuch a combination is particularly beneficial in the case where a deviation in\na low-dimensional output is penalized. In addition, an offline-online\ndecomposed a posteriori error estimator bounding the error between the\napproximate final time adjoint with respect to the optimal one is derived and\nits reliability proven. We propose different strategies for building the\ninvolved reduced order models, for instance by separate reduction of the\ndynamical systems and the final time adjoint states or via greedy procedures\nyielding a combined and fully reduced model. These algorithms are evaluated and\ncompared for a two-dimensional heat equation problem. The numerical results\nshow the desired accuracy of the reduced models and highlight the speedup\nobtained by the newly combined reduced order model in comparison to an exact\ncomputation of the optimal control or other reduction approaches.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
