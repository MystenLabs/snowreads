Existing solutions for distributed\nruntime verification under partial synchrony against temporal logic\nspecifications are exact but suffer from significant computational overhead. In\nthis paper, we propose an \\emph{approximate} distributed monitoring algorithm\nfor Signal Temporal Logic (STL) that mitigates this issue by abstracting away\npotential interleaving behaviors. This conservative abstraction enables a\nsignificant speedup of the distributed monitors, albeit with a tradeoff in\naccuracy. We address this tradeoff with a methodology that combines our\napproximate monitor with its exact counterpart, resulting in enhanced\nefficiency without sacrificing precision. We evaluate our approach with\nmultiple experiments, showcasing its efficacy in both real-world applications\nand synthetic examples.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
