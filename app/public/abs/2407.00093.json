The middleware facilitates seamless integration of RIs\nthrough specifically designed transport layers, while the uAPI provides a\nsimplified and standardized interface to ease deployment. A motivating case\nstudy explores the provision of power-to-heat services in a local multi-energy\ndistrict, involving laboratories in Denmark, Greece, Italy, the Netherlands,\nand Norway, and analyzing their impact on electrical and thermal networks. This\npaper not only demonstrates the practical application of Geographically\nDistributed Simulations and Hardware-in-the-Loop technologies but also\nhighlights their effectiveness in enhancing system flexibility and managing\ngrid dynamics under various operational scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
