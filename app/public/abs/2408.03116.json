Previous analyses have insufficiently or incorrectly modeled the\ninteraction between ahead-of-time auctions and just-in-time (JIT) auctions. We\nstudy a model where bidders compete in an execution auction ahead of time, and\nthen the winner holds a JIT auction to resell the proposal rights when the slot\narrives. During the execution auction, bidders only know the distribution of\ntheir valuations. Bidders then draw values from their distributions and compete\nin the JIT auction. We show that a bidder who wins the execution auction is\nsubstantially advantaged in the JIT auction since they can set a reserve price\nhigher than their own realized value for the slot to increase their revenue. As\na result, there is a strong centralizing force in the execution auction, which\nallows the ex-ante strongest bidder to win the execution auction every time,\nand similarly gives them the strongest incentive to buy up all the tickets.\nSimilar results trivially apply if the resale market is imperfect, since that\nonly reinforces the advantages of the ex-ante strong buyer. To reiterate, these\nresults do not require the bidders to employ multi-block MEV strategies,\nalthough if they did, it would likely amplify the centralizing effects.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
