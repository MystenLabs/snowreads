At $z>3$, these galaxies are increasingly rare, and difficult to\nidentify as they are interspersed among the more numerous dust-obscured galaxy\npopulation at $z=1-3$, making efforts to secure confident spectroscopic\nredshifts expensive, and sometimes unsuccessful. In this work, we present the\nExtended Mapping Obscuration to Reionization with ALMA (Ex-MORA) Survey -- a\n2mm blank-field survey in the COSMOS-Web field, and the largest ever ALMA\nblank-field survey to-date covering 577 arcmin$^2$. Ex-MORA is an expansion of\nthe MORA survey designed to identify primarily $z>3$ dusty, star-forming\ngalaxies while simultaneously filtering out the more numerous $z<3$ population\nby leveraging the very negative $K$-correction at observed-frame 2mm. We\nidentify 37 significant ($>$5$\\sigma$) sources, 33 of which are robust thermal\ndust emitters. We measure a median redshift of $\\langle z \\rangle =\n3.6^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$, with two-thirds of the sample at $z>3$, and just under half\nat $z>4$, demonstrating the overall success of the 2mm-selection technique. The\nintegrated $z>3$ volume density of Ex-MORA sources is $\\sim1-3\\times10^{-5}$\nMpc$^{-3}$, consistent with other surveys of infrared luminous galaxies at\nsimilar epochs. We also find that techniques using rest-frame optical emission\n(or lack thereof) to identify $z>3$ heavily dust-obscured galaxies miss at\nleast half of Ex-MORA galaxies. This supports the idea that the dusty galaxy\npopulation is heterogeneous, and that synergies across observatories spanning\nmultiple energy regimes are critical to understanding their formation and\nevolution at $z>3$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"T_TfyP5o-ck21oveYO9dP4N-_11KTVy6KNm14_mL8c4","pdfSize":"11110397"}
