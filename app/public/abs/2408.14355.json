The class of\nthese groups contains extraordinary examples like Grigorchuk group, which is\nknown to be non-linear, thus making some of existing attacks against SCSP\ninapplicable. The groups in this class admit a natural normal form based on the\nnotion of a nucleus portrait, that plays a key role in our approach. While for\nsome groups in the class the conjugacy search problem has been studied, there\nare many groups for which no algorithms solving it are known. Moreover, there\nare some self-similar groups with undecidable conjugacy problem. We discuss\nbenefits and drawbacks of using these groups in group-based cryptography and\nprovide computational analysis of variants of the length-based attack on SCSP\nfor some groups in the class, including Grigorchuk group, Basilica group, and\nothers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
