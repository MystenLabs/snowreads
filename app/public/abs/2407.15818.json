Afterwards, we show how to control the homotopy\nconnectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres in terms of coverings of\nspheres and projective spaces. Let $S^n$ be the $n$-sphere with the geodesic\nmetric, and of diameter $\\pi$, and let $\\delta > 0$. Suppose that the first\nnontrivial homotopy group of the Vietoris-Rips complex\n$\\mathrm{VR}(S^n;\\pi-\\delta)$ of the $n$-sphere at scale $\\pi-\\delta$ occurs in\ndimension $k$, i.e., suppose that the connectivity is $k-1$. Then\n$\\mathrm{cov}_{S^n}(2k+2) \\le \\delta < 2\\cdot \\mathrm{cov}_{\\mathbb{R}P^n}(k)$.\nIn other words, there exist $2k+2$ balls of radius $\\delta$ that cover $S^n$,\nand no set of $k$ balls of radius $\\frac{\\delta}{2}$ cover the projective space\n$\\mathbb{R}P^n$. As a corollary, the homotopy type of $\\mathrm{VR}(S^n;r)$\nchanges infinitely many times as the scale $r$ increases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
