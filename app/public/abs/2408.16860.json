Define $\\lambda^* = \\rho^{1/2} + \\rho^{-1/2} \\approx 2.01980$, where\n$\\rho$ is the unique real root of $x^3 = x + 1$. We show that for every\n$\\lambda < \\lambda^*$, there exists $n \\in \\mathbb{N}$ such that if a symmetric\nhollow integer matrix has an eigenvalue less than $-\\lambda$, then one of its\nprincipal submatrices of order at most $n$ does as well. However, the same\nconclusion does not hold for any $\\lambda \\ge \\lambda^*$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
