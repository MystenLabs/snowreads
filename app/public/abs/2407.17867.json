This opens a new avenue for field-free switching of\nperpendicular magnetization, which is required for the next-generation\ninformation storage technology. We develop the microscopic theory of this\neffect, and clarify its quantum origin in band geometric quantities which can\nbe enhanced by topological nodal features. Combined with first-principles\ncalculations, we predict pronounced effects at room temperature in topological\nmetals $\\mathrm{PbTaSe_{2}}$ and PdGa. Our work establishes a fundamental\nnonlinear response in spin transport, and opens the door to exploring\nspintronic applications based on nonlinear spin Hall effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
