We found that the correlation length decreases with number\ndensity, consistent with theoretical expectations. We also observed that\nincreasing the coupling between the rings leads to greater overall coherence in\nthe system. The phase fluctuations increased with a change from periodic to\nclosed boundary conditions as we applied a potential barrier at one point in a\nring. These results are relevant for the implementation of proposals to utilize\nultracold quantum gases in large and elongated circuit-like geometries,\nespecially those that require deterministic preparation and control of\nquantized circulation states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vbbLwfl88ETyj4m-9BjtBr3sjKXd0yD2reQlv-N_2fQ","pdfSize":"8863956"}
