The bounds are Singleton like, depending on the\nlength, rank, and alphabet size of the code. Codes meeting such bounds are\nreferred to as Maximum Lee Distance (MLD) Codes. We present some new bounds,\nproved using combinatorial arguments. The new bounds provide improvements over\nthose in the literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TT0heiB7TozuBhqJcZltg4Xj3qKmNlBipNeEILhd6ag","pdfSize":"171064"}
