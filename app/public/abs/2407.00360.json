The two stars around each other in an almost circular orbit\n(e=0.186) with a period of about 3.32 years. We aim to explore the physical\nproperties of the two components using the radial velocity method and\nasteroseismology. Our results show that the $\\delta$ Scuti variable is a\npost-main sequence star with a helium core ($M_{\\rm He}$=\n0.1671$^{+0.0028}_{-0.0045}$ M$_{\\odot}$ and $R_{\\rm He}$=\n0.1414$^{+0.0035}_{-0.0020}$ R$_{\\odot}$) surrounded by a burning hydrogen\nshell; its fundamental parameters is accurately calculated to be\n$M$=1.82$^{+0.04}_{-0.02}$ M$_{\\odot}$, $R$=2.91$^{+0.02}_{-0.02}$ R$_{\\odot}$,\n$L$=17.07$^{+1.28}_{-2.61}$ L$_{\\odot}$, and $X_c$=0.078$^{+0.021}_{-0.004}$;\nthe mass of the invisible object is thus estimated to be $M_{\\rm co}$=1.68\n$^{+0.62}_{-0.60}$ M$_{\\odot}$. Combined with the low-resolution LAMOST\nspectrum, we suggest that the unseen object is an neutron star candidate. Our\nwork demonstrates the methodology of using the radial velocity method and\nasteroseismology to detect the compact object in such an astrometric binary.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
