However, current techniques\neither exhibit a high loss of fault detection ability or face scalability\nchallenges due to the NP-hard nature of the problem, which limits their\npractical utility. We propose TripRL, a novel technique that integrates\ntraditional criteria such as statement coverage and fault detection ability\nwith test coverage similarity into an Integer Linear Program (ILP), to produce\na diverse reduced test suite with high test effectiveness. TripRL leverages\nbipartite graph representation and its embedding for concise ILP formulation\nand combines ILP with effective reinforcement learning (RL) training. This\ncombination renders large-scale test suite minimization more scalable and\nenhances test effectiveness. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that\nTripRL's runtime scales linearly with the magnitude of the MCTSM problem.\nNotably, for large test suites where existing approaches fail to provide\nsolutions within a reasonable time frame, our technique consistently delivers\nsolutions in less than 47 minutes. The reduced test suites produced by TripRL\nalso maintain the original statement coverage and fault detection ability while\nhaving a higher potential to detect unknown faults.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
