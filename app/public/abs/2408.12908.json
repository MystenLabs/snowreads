With\nthat, they rely on the validity of the quasi-particle picture for electrons and\nphonons, which is known to fail in strongly anharmonic systems. In this work,\nwe demonstrated the relevance of effects beyond the quasi-particle picture by\ncombining ab initio molecular dynamics and the Kubo-Greenwood (KG) formalism to\nestablish a non-perturbative, stochastic method to calculate carrier mobilities\nwhile accounting for all orders of anharmonic and electron-vibrational\ncouplings. In particular, we propose and exploit several numerical strategies\nthat overcome the notoriously slow convergence of the KG formalism for both\nelectronic and nuclear degree of freedom in crystalline solids. The capability\nof this method is demonstrated by calculating the temperature-dependent\nelectron mobility of the strongly anharmonic oxide perovskites SrTiO3 and\nBaTiO3 across a wide range of temperatures. We show that the\ntemperature-dependence of the mobility is largely driven by anharmonic,\nhigher-order coupling effects and rationalize these trends in terms of the\nnon-perturbative electronic spectral functions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
