A widely-quoted reason for their exceptional performance is their\nability to tolerate defects, enabling long charge-carrier lifetimes despite\nhigh defect densities. Realizing defect tolerance in broader classes of\nmaterials would have a substantial impact on the semiconductor industry.\nSignificant effort has been made over the past decade to unravel the underlying\norigins of defect tolerance to design stable alternatives to LHPs comprised of\nnontoxic elements. However, it has become clear that understanding defect\ntolerance in LHPs is far from straightforward. This review discusses the models\nproposed for defect tolerance in halide perovskites, evaluating the\nexperimental and theoretical support for these models, as well as their\nlimitations. We cover attempts to apply these models to identify materials\nbeyond the lead-halide system that could also exhibit defect tolerance, and the\nsuccesses and pitfalls encountered over the past decade. Finally, a discussion\nis made of some of the important missing pieces of information required for a\ndeeper understanding and predictive models that enable the inverse design of\ndefect tolerant semiconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
