The widest of\nthese can eventually become disrupted due to a combination of kicks from\npassing stars and the Galactic tidal field. If the Galactic disk were purely\naxisymmetric, the stars from a disrupted binary system would slowly drift apart\non nearly identical orbits. We study how the existence of non-axisymmetric\nstructures, such as a rigidly rotating bar, can greatly alter this picture. In\nparticular, we show how the orbital dynamics near the resonances sourced by\nthese perturbations can create local fluctuations in the distribution of\ndisrupted binary separations. We simulate the evolution of wide binary systems\nembedded in gravitational potentials with rotating galactic bars, and show how\nfeatures and fluctuations in the distribution of disrupted binaries can be used\nto locate bar resonances and constrain the bar's pattern speed and amplitude.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
