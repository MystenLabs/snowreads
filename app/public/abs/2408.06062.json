We argue against tables with numbers on the basis of their\nepistemic irrelevance, their environmental impact, their role in enabling and\nexacerbating social inequalities, and their deep ties to commercial\napplications and profit-driven research. We substantiate our arguments with\nempirical evidence drawn from a meta-analysis of computational linguistics\nresearch over the last decade.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
