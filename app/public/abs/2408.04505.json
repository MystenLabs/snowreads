We demonstrate how the VQ-VAE can be\ntailored to specific propagation environments, focusing on systems with low\npilot overhead, which is crucial in massive multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO). Extensive simulations with real-world measurement data show that our\nproposed feedback scheme outperforms state-of-the-art autoencoder (AE)-based\ncompression schemes and conventional Discrete Fourier transform (DFT)\ncodebook-based schemes. These improvements enable the deployment of systems\nwith fewer feedback bits or pilots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tE4pjW_QWyk8zy_kK3APCMQhtcQazxmCVKQvqPTiu-Q","pdfSize":"871528"}
