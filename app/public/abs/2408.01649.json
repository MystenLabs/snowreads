This paper introduces an efficient framework\ndesigned to enhance LiDAR-based LAS through strategic trajectory generation,\nknown as Perception-aware Planning. Unlike vision-based frameworks, the\nLiDAR-based requires different considerations due to unique sensor attributes.\nOur approach focuses on two main aspects: firstly, assessing the impact of\nLiDAR observations on LAS. We introduce a perturbation-induced metric to\nprovide a comprehensive and reliable evaluation of LiDAR observations.\nSecondly, we aim to improve motion planning efficiency. By creating a Static\nObservation Loss Map (SOLM) as an intermediary, we logically separate the\ntime-intensive evaluation and motion planning phases, significantly boosting\nthe planning process. In the experimental section, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed metrics across various scenes and the feature of\ntrajectories guided by different metrics. Ultimately, our framework is tested\nin a real-world scenario, enabling the robot to actively choose topologies and\norientations preferable for localization.
