We formalize this general situation within the framework of\nwork extraction from nonequilibirum systems using feedback control.\nSpecifically, we analyze the combined and separate effects of noisy\nmeasurements, memory limitations, and the access to only a limited set of\npossible control operations, quantifying the amount of extractable work under\nall such constraints. Such analysis allows us to provide a general recipe to\nconstruct repertoires of allowed control operations that minimize the expected\nlosses during the feedback protocol, i.e., that minimize expected entropy\nproduction. Our results highlight the importance and benefits of feedback\ncontrol over uninformed (random) actions beyond the information gain under\ncontrol restrictions and are applied to several situations including uncertain\ninitial distributions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
