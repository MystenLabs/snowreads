However, existing graph deep\nlearning methods face limitations that curb their expressive power. To address\nthis, we explore the integration of vast molecular domain knowledge from Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) with the complementary strengths of Graph Neural\nNetworks (GNNs) to enhance performance in property prediction tasks. We\nintroduce a Multi-Modal Fusion (MMF) framework that synergistically harnesses\nthe analytical prowess of GNNs and the linguistic generative and predictive\nabilities of LLMs, thereby improving accuracy and robustness in predicting\nmolecular properties. Our framework combines the effectiveness of GNNs in\nmodeling graph-structured data with the zero-shot and few-shot learning\ncapabilities of LLMs, enabling improved predictions while reducing the risk of\noverfitting. Furthermore, our approach effectively addresses distributional\nshifts, a common challenge in real-world applications, and showcases the\nefficacy of learning cross-modal representations, surpassing state-of-the-art\nbaselines on benchmark datasets for property prediction tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
