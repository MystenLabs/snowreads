DGPs typically rely on local inducing point\napproximations across intermediate GP layers. Recent advances in DGP inference\nhave shown that incorporating global Fourier features from Reproducing Kernel\nHilbert Space (RKHS) can enhance the DGPs' capability to capture complex\nnon-stationary patterns. This paper extends the use of these features to\ncompositional GPs involving linear transformations. In particular, we introduce\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE) -based RKHS Fourier features that allow\nfor adaptive amplitude and phase modulation through convolution operations.\nThis convolutional formulation relates our work to recently proposed deep\nlatent force models, a multi-layer structure designed for modelling nonlinear\ndynamical systems. By embedding these adjustable RKHS Fourier features within a\ndoubly stochastic variational inference framework, our model exhibits improved\npredictive performance across various regression tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
