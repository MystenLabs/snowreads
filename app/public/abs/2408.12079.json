It typically translates\nfrom the target to the source language to ensure high-quality translation\nresults. This paper proposes a novel way of utilizing a monolingual corpus on\nthe source side to assist Neural Machine Translation (NMT) in low-resource\nsettings. We realize this concept by employing a Generative Adversarial Network\n(GAN), which augments the training data for the discriminator while mitigating\nthe interference of low-quality synthetic monolingual translations with the\ngenerator. Additionally, this paper integrates Translation Memory (TM) with\nNMT, increasing the amount of data available to the generator. Moreover, we\npropose a novel procedure to filter the synthetic sentence pairs during the\naugmentation process, ensuring the high quality of the data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
