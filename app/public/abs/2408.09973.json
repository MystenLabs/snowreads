We prove\nan extended Parseval identity and a reconstruction formula for this transform,\nas well as results for the continuity of both the directional Stockwell\ntransform and its synthesis transform on the appropriate space of test\nfunctions. Additionally, we develop a distributional framework for the\ndirectional Stockwell transform on the Lizorkin space of distributions\n$\\mathcal{S}_{0}'(\\mathbb{R}^n)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
