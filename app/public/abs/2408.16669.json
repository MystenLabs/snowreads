In order to draw conclusions about the deleterious\neffects of potential contaminant gases inside Rydberg electrometry vapor cells,\nwe revisit collisional broadening and shifts of both the D$_2$ line and Rydberg\nlevels of rubidium. Specifically, we measure the broadening and shifts of the\n$5{\\rm S}_{1/2}\\rightarrow 5{\\rm P}_{3/2}$ (i.e., the D$_2$ line) and $5{\\rm\nS}_{1/2}\\rightarrow 5{\\rm P}_{3/2}\\rightarrow (25{\\rm D},27{\\rm S},30{\\rm\nD},32{\\rm S},35{\\rm D},37{\\rm S})$ transitions of $^{85}$Rb due to He, Ne,\nN$_2$ and Ar. By combining these measurements with observations of velocity\nchanging collisions in the sub-Doppler spectrum of the D$_2$ line, we conclude\nthe following: (1) that contaminant gases are most likely not the cause of\nirregular line shapes or shifts of Rydberg transitions due to the high\npressures required, and (2) the sub-Doppler spectrum of the D$_2$ line, through\nits accompanying loss of contrast at high pressures, can validate that a vapor\ncell is sufficiently free of contaminant gas for EIT electrometry. We use the\ntheory of Omont, J. Phys. France 38, 1343 (1977), to extend our results to a\nwide variety of possible contaminant gases and further derive scaling laws\napplicable to all gases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
