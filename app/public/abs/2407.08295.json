In the Hybrid k-Clusetring\nproblem, given a set P of points in R^d, an integer k, and a non-negative real\nr, our objective is to position k closed balls of radius r to minimize the sum\nof distances from points not covered by the balls to their closest balls.\nEquivalently, we seek an optimal L_1-fitting of a union of k balls of radius r\nto a set of points in the Euclidean space. When r=0, this corresponds to\nk-median; when the minimum sum is zero, indicating complete coverage of all\npoints, it is k-center.\n  Our primary result is a bicriteria approximation algorithm that, for a given\n\\epsilon>0, produces a hybrid k-clustering with balls of radius (1+\\epsilon)r.\nThis algorithm achieves a cost at most 1+\\epsilon of the optimum, and it\noperates in time 2^{(kd/\\epsilon)^{O(1)}} n^{O(1)}. Notably, considering the\nestablished lower bounds on k-center and k-median, our bicriteria approximation\nstands as the best possible result for Hybrid k-Clusetring.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xpoiITCDyS3riSMcGQCrNOwZevPdQfp8wf75IADU6eg","pdfSize":"1124244"}
