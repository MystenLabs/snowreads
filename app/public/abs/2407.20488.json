We use this notion to give short proofs\nof some classical theorems on (left) Artinian rings and modules, due to\nAkizuki, Anderson, Hopkins, and Levitzki, as well as of some new results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
