It is known that when a finite group $ G $ acts on a\nfinite set $ X $ , a finite number of elements in this monoid are sufficient to\ngenerate it along with its group of units. The minimum number of elements\nrequired to generate the monoid is called the relative rank. This paper\npresents two particular cases where $ G $ is a finite group, $ X $ is an\ninfinite set, and the relative rank of the monoid of $ G $ -equivariant\nfunctions is finite; moreover, we compute it.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
