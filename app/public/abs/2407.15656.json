It is usually performed by experienced professionals,\nwhere scanning and attack tools are applied. By automating the execution of\nsuch tools, the need for human interaction and decision-making could be\nreduced. In this work, a Network Attack Simulator (NASim) was used as an\nenvironment to train reinforcement learning agents to solve three predefined\nsecurity scenarios. These scenarios cover techniques of exploitation,\npost-exploitation and wiretapping. A large hyperparameter grid search was\nperformed to find the best hyperparameter combinations. The algorithms\nQ-learning, DQN and A3C were used, whereby A3C was able to solve all scenarios\nand achieve generalization. In addition, A3C could solve these scenarios with\nfewer actions than the baseline automated penetration testing. Although the\ntraining was performed on rather small scenarios and with small state and\naction spaces for the agents, the results show that a penetration test can\nsuccessfully be performed by the RL agent.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
