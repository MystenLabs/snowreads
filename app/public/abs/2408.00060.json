The model contains a PQ-charged\nscalar} leptoquark which can interact with the SM quarks only via mass-mixing\nof the latter with vector-like quarks. The mixing between SM and vector-like\nquarks is determined by the PQ mass scales and can explain the excess $B^+\\to\nK^+ + E_{\\text{miss}}$ events while respecting other flavour constraints. The\nsame PQ-charged scalar leptoquarks and vector-like quarks also mediate the\ntwo-loop radiative neutrino masses.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
