We wish to design an incentive-compatible\n(IC) online learning scheme to maximize an application-specific objective\nwithin a given class of mechanisms, without prior knowledge of the agents' type\ndistributions. Even if each mechanism in this class is IC in a single round, if\nan algorithm naively chooses from this class on each round, the entire learning\nprocess may not be IC against non-myopic buyers who appear over multiple\nrounds. On each round, our method randomly chooses between the recommendation\nof a weakly differentially private online learning algorithm (e.g., Hedge), and\na commitment mechanism which penalizes non-truthful behavior. Our method is IC\nand achieves $O(T^{\\frac{1+h}{2}})$ regret for the application-specific\nobjective in an adversarial setting, where $h$ quantifies the long-sightedness\nof the agents. When compared to prior work, our approach is conceptually\nsimpler,it applies to general mechanism design problems (beyond auctions), and\nits regret scales gracefully with the size of the mechanism class.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
