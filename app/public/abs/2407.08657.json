However, most\ncurrent deep learning-based approaches for speech dereverberation are not\ninterpretable for room acoustics, and can be considered as black-box systems in\nthat regard. In this work, we address this problem by regularizing the training\nloss using a novel physical coherence loss which encourages the room impulse\nresponse (RIR) induced by the dereverberated output of the model to match the\nacoustic properties of the room in which the signal was recorded. Our\ninvestigation demonstrates the preservation of the original dereverberated\nsignal alongside the provision of a more physically coherent RIR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
