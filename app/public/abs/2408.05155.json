Devising strategies to\nreduce their thermal conductivity may provide a substantial improvement in\ntheir thermoelectric performance also at lower temperatures. We have carried\nout an ab initio investigation of the thermal conductivity of SiGe alloys with\nrandom and spatially correlated mass disorder employing the Quasi-Harmonic\nGreen-Kubo (QHGK) theory with force constants computed by density functional\ntheory. Leveraging QHGK and the hydrodynamic extrapolation to achieve size\nconvergence, we obtained a detailed understanding of lattice heat conduction in\nSiGe and demonstrated that colored disorder suppresses thermal transport across\nthe acoustic vibrational spectrum, leading to up to a 4-fold enhancement in the\nintrinsic thermoelectric figure of merit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
