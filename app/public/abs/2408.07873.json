With only 7% of those affected receiving any form of help, societal\nstigma not only discourages individuals with SUD from seeking help but isolates\nthem, hindering their recovery journey and perpetuating a cycle of shame and\nself-doubt. This study investigates how stigma manifests on social media,\nparticularly Reddit, where anonymity can exacerbate discriminatory behaviors.\nWe analyzed over 1.2 million posts, identifying 3,207 that exhibited\nstigmatizing language towards people who use substances (PWUS). Using Informed\nand Stylized LLMs, we develop a model for de-stigmatization of these\nexpressions into empathetic language, resulting in 1,649 reformed phrase pairs.\nOur paper contributes to the field by proposing a computational framework for\nanalyzing stigma and destigmatizing online content, and delving into the\nlinguistic features that propagate stigma towards PWUS. Our work not only\nenhances understanding of stigma's manifestations online but also provides\npractical tools for fostering a more supportive digital environment for those\naffected by SUD. Code and data will be made publicly available upon acceptance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"egjg6UsdzHypDpxpM92MEjI1q6OudBp9S5UmwVgoLvc","pdfSize":"5464453"}
