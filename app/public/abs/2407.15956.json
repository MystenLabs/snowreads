This shift highlights the complexities\nof modern domestic life, with the household landscape now featuring diverse\ncohabiting units like co-housing and communal living arrangements. These\nagentic technologies present specific design challenges and opportunities as\nthey become integrated into everyday routines and activities. Our workshop\nenvisions smart homes as dynamic, user-shaped spaces, focusing on the\nintegration of these technologies into daily life. We aim to explore how these\ntechnologies transform household dynamics, especially through boundary\nfluidity, by uniting researchers and practitioners from fields such as design,\nsociology, and ethnography. Together, we will develop a taxonomy of challenges\nand opportunities, providing a structured perspective on the integration of\nagentic technologies and their impact on contemporary living arrangements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HRKysPLvZgg7sDZymQQIJBjdNdY8HBOUAVrxBhaN8j8","pdfSize":"279913"}
