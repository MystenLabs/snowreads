We show that then $G$ itself admits a\nBorel embedding into the Schreier graph of a free Borel action of $\\mathbb\nZ^{O(d)}$. This strengthens an earlier result of the authors, in which $O(d)$\nis replaced by $O(\\rho \\log \\rho)$, where $\\rho$ is the polynomial growth rate\nof $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
