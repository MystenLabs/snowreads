No solutions for p>1\nwere known previously in the literature. For p=1, four of the solution families\ncontain bright/dark Davydov solitons of the 1st and 2nd kind, obtained in\nrecent work by basic ansatze applied to the ODE system for travelling waves.\nAll of the new solution families have interesting features, including\nbright/dark peaks with (up to) p symmetric pairs of side peaks in the amplitude\nand a kink profile for the nonlinear part in the phase. The present method is\nfully systematic and involves several novel steps which reduce the travelling\nwave ODE system to a single nonlinear base ODE for which all polynomial\nsolutions are found by symbolic computation. It is applicable more generally to\nother coupled nonlinear dispersive wave equations as well as to nonlinear ODE\nsystems of generalized H\\'enon-Heiles form.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
