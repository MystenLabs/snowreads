Thus, which species are the main carriers of sulfur is an open\nquestion. Recent studies have proposed S$_n$ species as potential sulfur\nreservoirs. Among the various sulfur allotropes, the most stable one is the\nS$_8$ ring, detected in the asteroid Ryugu and Orgueil meteorite. Shorter\nspecies, namely S$_3$ and S$_4$, have been found in the comet 67P/C-G, but\ntheir presence in the ISM remains elusive. In this study, we compute the\nbinding energies (BEs) of S$_n$ (n = 1-8) species on an amorphous water-ice\nsurface model and analyze their infrared (IR) and Raman spectral features to\nprovide data for their identification in the ISM. Our computations reveal that\nthese species exhibit lower BEs than previously assumed and that their spectral\nfeatures experience minimal shifts when adsorbed on water ice, because of the\nweak and nonspecific S$_n$-ice interactions. Furthermore, these species display\nvery low IR band intensities and, therefore, very accurate instruments\noperating in the mid-IR range are required for detecting the presence of these\nspecies in dense interstellar environments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
