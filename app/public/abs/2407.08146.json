Compared to\nconventional methods, the current approach can be universally applied to any\nweakly strained system including semi-infinite crystals that diffract\ndynamically. It addresses issues such as the curved wavefront and re-divergence\nof the focused incident beam. We show excellent agreement against experimental\ndata on a strained La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 thin film on SrTiO3 substrate, and a path to\nextracting physical information using automatic differentiation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
