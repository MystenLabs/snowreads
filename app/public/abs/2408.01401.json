To\ndo so we find an asymptotic formula for $z^{th}$-moments of such $h(d)$'s, over\n$d\\leq x$, uniformly for a complex number $z$ in a range of the form\n$|z|\\leq(\\log x)^{1+o(1)}$, $\\Re(z)\\geq -1$. This is achieved by constructing a\nprobabilistic random model for these values, which we will use to obtain\nestimates for the distribution function of $h(d)$ over our family. As another\napplication, we give an asymptotic formula for the number of $d$'s such that\n$h(d)\\leq H$ and $\\varepsilon_d\\leq d^{1/2+\\alpha}$ where $H$ is a large real\nnumber.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
