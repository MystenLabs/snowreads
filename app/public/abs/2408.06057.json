As a corollary, we obtain a new set of\nAlexandrov-Fenchel-type inequalities for non-convex domains.\n  In the second part, we derive a Poincar\\'{e} type inequality for $k$-convex\nhypersurfaces which complements a more general version of the well-known\nHeintze-Karcher inequality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zfv9_ZChQ2hA9pXjHrRb4CHqtT5RMLLVyTzw8ZtJGds","pdfSize":"325041"}
