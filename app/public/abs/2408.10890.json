PLACID incorporates a customized spatial light modulator (SLM)\nacting as a dynamically addressed focal-plane phase mask (FPM) coronagraph in\nthe H-Ks bands. This new approach to high-contrast imaging will be applied\non-sky in late 2024/early 2025. We present a first estimate of the science\ndiscovery space for PLACID, in terms of known exoplanets and brown dwarfs,\nconsidering raw lab contrast, contrast ratios, limiting magnitudes,\ncoronagraphic inner working angle etc. In the future, we will also look into\npredicted disk and binary or multiple stars systems imaging performance, with\nthe latter being a possible niche science case for the instrument (adaptive FPM\nfor multiple stars). This work will inform on the first light PLACID\ncommissioning activities and early science on the DAG telescope and is deemed\nto evolve in function of future developments on the DAG AO instrumentation\nsuite.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
