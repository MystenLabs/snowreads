In particular, we show that the dynamics towards saturation precisely\ndistinguish between chaotic and integrable systems. For chaotic models, the\nsaturation value of complexity reaches its infinite time average at a finite\nsaturation time. In this case, depending on the initial state, it may also\nexhibit a peak before saturation. In contrast, in integrable models, complexity\napproaches the infinite time average value from below at a much longer\ntimescale. We confirm this distinction using numerical results for specific\nspin models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
