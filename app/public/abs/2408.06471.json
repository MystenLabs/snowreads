To reduce scanning times and radiation doses\nin medical CT settings, enhancing the reconstruction quality of the FBP method\nis essential. To this end, this paper focuses on analytically optimizing the\napplied filter function. We derive a formula for the filter that minimizes the\nexpected squared $\\mathrm{L}^2$-norm of the difference between the FBP\nreconstruction, given infinite noisy measurement data, and the true target\nfunction. Additionally, we adapt our derived filter to the case of finitely\nmany measurements. The resulting filter functions have a closed-form\nrepresentation, do not require a training dataset, and, thus, provide an\neasy-to-implement, out-of-the-box solution. Our theoretical findings are\nsupported by numerical experiments based on both simulated and real CT data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
