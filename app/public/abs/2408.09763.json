In the absence of flow, this system\nexhibits motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To investigate the interplay\nbetween MIPS and flow-induced mixing, we introduce dimensionless parameters: a\nscaled time, $\\tau$, and a scaled velocity, ${\\rm v}$, characterizing the ratio\nof ABP to fluid time and velocity scales, respectively. The parameter space\ndefined by $\\tau$ and ${\\rm v}$ reveals three distinct ABP distribution\nregimes. At low velocities ${\\rm v} \\ll 1$, flow dominates, leading to a\nhomogeneous mixture. Conversely, at high velocities ${\\rm v} \\gg 1$, motility\nprevails, resulting in MIPS. In the intermediate regime (${\\rm v} \\sim 1$), the\nsystem's behavior depends on $\\tau$. For $\\tau <1$, a moderately mixed\nhomogeneous phase emerges, while for $\\tau >1$, a novel phase, termed\nflow-induced phase separation (FIPS), arises due to the combined effects of\nflow topology and ABP motility and size. To characterize these phases, we\nanalyze drift velocity, diffusivity, mean-squared displacement, giant number\nfluctuations, radial distribution function, and cluster-size distribution.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
