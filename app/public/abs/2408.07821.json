We study a\ndecentralized variant of fair division inspired by the dynamics observed in\ncommunity-based targeting, mutual aid networks, and community resource\nmanagement paradigms. We develop an approach for decentralized fair division\nand compare it with a centralized approach with respect to fairness and social\nwelfare guarantees. In the context of the existing literature, our\ndecentralized model can be viewed as a relaxation of previous models of\nsequential exchange in light of impossibility results concerning the inability\nof those models to achieve desirable outcomes. We find that in settings\nrepresentative of many real world situations, the two models of resource\nallocation offer contrasting fairness and social welfare guarantees. In\nparticular, we show that under appropriate conditions, our model of\ndecentralized allocation can ensure high-quality allocative decisions in an\nefficient fashion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
