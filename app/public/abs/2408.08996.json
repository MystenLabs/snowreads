We discuss a method for strain-assisted cleaving of\nperovskite single crystals, using a setup easily transferable between different\nexperimental systems. The details of the cleaving device and the procedure were\noptimized in a systematic study on the model SrTiO$_3$. The large-area\nmorphology and typical distribution of surface terminations on cleaved\nSrTiO$_3$(001) is presented, with specific guidelines on how to distinguish\nwell-cleaved surfaces from conchoidally fractured ones. The cleaving is\napplicable to other cubic perovskites, as demonstrated on KTaO$_3$(001) and\nBaTiO$_3$(001). This approach opens up a pathway for obtaining high-quality\nsurfaces of this promising class of materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
