Although efforts to\nenhance B-frame coding are ongoing, their compression performance is still far\nbehind that of traditional bi-directional video codecs. In this paper, we\nintroduce a bi-directional deep contextual video compression scheme tailored\nfor B-frames, termed DCVC-B, to improve the compression performance of deep\nB-frame coding. Our scheme mainly has three key innovations. First, we develop\na bi-directional motion difference context propagation method for effective\nmotion difference coding, which significantly reduces the bit cost of\nbi-directional motions. Second, we propose a bi-directional contextual\ncompression model and a corresponding bi-directional temporal entropy model, to\nmake better use of the multi-scale temporal contexts. Third, we propose a\nhierarchical quality structure-based training strategy, leading to an effective\nbit allocation across large groups of pictures (GOP). Experimental results show\nthat our DCVC-B achieves an average reduction of 26.6% in BD-Rate compared to\nthe reference software for H.265/HEVC under random access conditions.\nRemarkably, it surpasses the performance of the H.266/VVC reference software on\ncertain test datasets under the same configuration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
