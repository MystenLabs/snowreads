While most approaches focus solely on the system of interest,\nwe propose that a universal notion of internal energy should also account for\nthe environment in order to keep consistency with the closed-system energy of\nthe universe. As an illustration, we study a particular two-qubit universe\nmodel, obtaining the exact master equations for both parties and calculating\ntheir effective Hamiltonians and internal energies as given by the recently\ndevised minimal dissipation approach. In this case, we show that internal\nenergies are not additive, which leads to unphysical features. Finally, we\nintroduce an abstract framework to describe all effective Hamiltonian-based\napproaches and address a rigorous definition of energy additivity in this\ncontext, in both a weak and a strong forms, discussing the underlying\nsubtleties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
