How rapidly are magic\nresources generated by generic many-body dynamics under constraints of\nlocality? We address this problem by exploring magic spreading in brick-wall\nrandom unitary circuits. Inspired by the algebraic structure of the Clifford\ngroup, we propose a scalable measure of non-stabilizerness, the\nCalderbank-Shor-Steane entropy, which generalizes the notion of stabilizer\nentropy and mirrors its qualitative behavior. This metric enables the\ninvestigation of non-stabilizerness dynamics for systems of up to N = 1024\nqudits. Our main finding is that magic resources equilibrate on timescales\nlogarithmic in system size N, akin to anticoncentration and Hilbert space\ndelocalization measures, but differently from entanglement entropy. We\nconjecture that our findings describe the phenomenology of non-stabilizerness\ngrowth in a broad class of chaotic many-body systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
