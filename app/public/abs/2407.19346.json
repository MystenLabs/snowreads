But previously proposed simple function classes like linear regression\nor multi-layer-perceptrons lack the structure required to explore things like\nprompting and alignment within models capable of in-context-learning. We\npropose univariate polynomial regression as a function class that is just rich\nenough to study prompting and alignment, while allowing us to visualize and\nunderstand what is going on clearly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
