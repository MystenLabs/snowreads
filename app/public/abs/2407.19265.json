Few-shot class-incremental learning addresses challenges arising\nfrom limited incoming data. Existing methods often integrate additional\ntrainable components or rely on a fixed embedding extractor post-training on\nbase sessions to mitigate concerns related to catastrophic forgetting and the\ndangers of model overfitting. However, using cross-entropy loss alone during\nbase session training is suboptimal for audio data. To address this, we propose\nincorporating supervised contrastive learning to refine the representation\nspace, enhancing discriminative power and leading to better generalization\nsince it facilitates seamless integration of incremental classes, upon arrival.\nExperimental results on NSynth and LibriSpeech datasets with 100 classes, as\nwell as ESC dataset with 50 and 10 classes, demonstrate state-of-the-art\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vJZvHy8hd0mkbrCP_Itan8Gl1b1BiE0Y3QK6C-7oX2Q","pdfSize":"5697932","objectId":"0x669da4948f234f0e12a10440df4c2cd386000a53f6664e14910659316bb77992","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
