We show that the resulting alphabet is described by a $G_2$ cluster\nalgebra, enlarging the $C_2$ cluster algebra found to cover all previously\nknown integrals relevant for this process. The cluster algebra connection we\nfind reveals new adjacency relations, which significantly reduce the function\nspace dimension of the non-planar triple ladder integral. These adjacencies may\nbe understood in part by embedding $G_2$ inside higher-rank cluster algebras.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
