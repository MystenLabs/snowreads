Such problems can often be solved more\neffectively by treating the various terms individually with specialized methods\nrather than simultaneously in a monolithic fashion. This paper describes\n\\pythOS, a Python software library for the systematic solution of differential\nequations by operator-splitting methods. The functionality of \\pythOS\\ focuses\non fractional-step methods, including those with real and complex coefficients,\nbut it also implements additive Runge--Kutta methods, generalized additive\nRunge--Kutta methods, and multi-rate, and multi-rate infinitesimal methods.\nExperimentation with the solution of practical problems is facilitated through\nan interface to the \\Firedrake\\ library for the finite element spatial\ndiscretization of partial differential equations and further enhanced by the\nconvenient implementation of exponential time-integration methods and fully\nimplicit Runge--Kutta methods available from the \\Irksome\\ software library.\nThe functionality of \\pythOS\\ as well as some less generally appreciated\naspects of operator-splitting methods are demonstrated by means of examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
