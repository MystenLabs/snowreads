Of several\nproposed mechanisms, here we test the hypothesis that pairs of self-doped\nligand holes spatially condense to provide local spin moments that are\nantiferromagnetically coupled to Ni spins. These singlet-like states provide a\nbasis for long-range bond and spiral spin order. Using magnetic resonant X-ray\nscattering on NdNiO$_3$ thin films, we observe the chiral nature of the\nspin-disproportionated state, with spin spirals propagating along the\ncrystallographic (101)$_\\mathrm{ortho}$ direction. These spin spirals are found\nto preferentially couple to X-ray helicity, establishing the presence of a\nhitherto-unobserved macroscopic chirality. The presence of this chiral magnetic\nconfiguration suggests a potential multiferroic coupling between the\nnoncollinear magnetic arrangement and improper ferroelectric behavior as\nobserved in prior studies on NdNiO$_3$ (101)$_\\mathrm{ortho}$ films and\nRENiO$_3$ single crystals. Experimentally constrained theoretical\ndouble-cluster calculations confirm the presence of an energetically stable\nspin-disproportionated state with Zhang-Rice singlet-like combinations of Ni\nand ligand moments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G-1BHVITYzMhy3OcdmnWlJoOQGz7iK7YFBe7YUx9794","pdfSize":"16407928"}
