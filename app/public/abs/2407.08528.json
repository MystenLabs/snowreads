This approach converts\nthe problem of predicting the number (a regression problem) and the position (a\nclassification problem) of occupied child nodes into a 255-dimensional\nclassification problem. As a result, it fails to accurately measure the\ndifference between the one-hot encoding and the predicted probability\ndistribution. We first analyze why the cross-entropy loss function fails to\naccurately measure the difference between the one-hot encoding and the\npredicted probability distribution. Then, we propose an attention-based child\nnode number prediction (ACNP) module to enhance the context models. The\nproposed module can predict the number of occupied child nodes and map it into\nan 8- dimensional vector to assist the context model in predicting the\nprobability distribution of the occupancy of the current node for efficient\nentropy coding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed module\nenhances the coding efficiency of octree-based context models.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
