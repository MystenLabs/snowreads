In this study, the effect of these perturbations are analyzed via\ncomputational fluid dynamics simulations of a square, two-dimensional, lid\ndriven cavity containing varying area fractions of suspended particles. The\nevolution over time of these particle-particle and particle-fluid interactions\ngenerate two-dimensional disturbance velocity changes in the flow field. In\norder to better understand the characteristics and effects of these changes,\nproper orthogonal decomposition analysis is performed on the velocity\ndifference flow field to determine the dominant flow structures over the\nsimulation time domain. The resulting eigenvectors and eigenvalues represent\nthe varying dominant flow structures and their respective dominance over the\nsimulation time, respectively. This is carried out at particle suspension area\nfractions from 10\\% - 50\\% and for Reynolds numbers of 100, 400, 700, and 1000.\nCritical flow regimes and particle suspension area fractions are discussed in\norder to characterize the stability of this particle-in-fluid system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
