By using a quotient bundle approach, we remedy\nthis problem by proving directly that, indeed, under the null energy condition\nevent horizons of stationary black holes are totally geodesic null\nhypersurfaces as regular as the metric. Only later, by using this result, we\nshow that the cross-sections, whose existence was postulated in previous works,\ndo indeed exist. These results hold true under weak causality conditions.\nSubsequently, we prove that under the dominant energy condition stationary\nblack hole event horizons indeed admit constant surface gravity, a result that\ndoes not require any non-degeneracy assumption, requirements on existence of\ncross-sections or a priori smoothness conditions. We are able to make sense of\nthe angular velocity and of the value (not just sign) of surface gravity as\nquantities related to the horizon, without the need of assuming Einstein's\nvacuum equations and the Killing extension. Physically, the result means that\nunder very general conditions every stationary black hole has indeed a constant\ntemperature (the zeroth law of black hole thermodynamics).\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
