While space-based photometry has\nrevealed frequent white-light flares for vast numbers of stars, only a handful\nof coronal mass ejections have been detected. Space-based photometry reveals\nthe timing and detailed structure of flares. To detect CME signatures, however,\noptical spectroscopy is essential, as the ejected plasma can be detected by\nDoppler-shifted emission bumps in the Balmer-regions. We present a dedicated\nground-based multi-object spectroscopic observations of the young, nearby\nPraesepe (600 Myr) and Pleiades (135 Myr) clusters to detect CMEs and flares\nparallel with the observations of Praesepe by the TESS satellite. During the 10\ndays of overlapping observations, we did not find any obvious signs of CMEs or\nflares in the H$\\alpha$ region.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
