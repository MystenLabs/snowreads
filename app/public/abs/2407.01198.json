The weight of a subgraph is the sum of\nweights of vertices and edges in the subgraph. The problem of determining the\nlargest order $f(k)$ of a weighted complete directed graph that does not\ncontain a directed cycle of weight divisible by $k$, for an integer $k \\ge 2$,\nwas raised by Alon and Krivelevich [J. Graph Theory 98 (2021) 623-629]. They\nshowed that $f(k)$ is $O(k\\log k)$ and $f(k) \\le 2k-2$ if $k$ is prime. The\nbest bounds known to us are $f(k) \\le 2k-2$ for all $k$ and $f(k) < (3k-1)/2$\nfor prime $k$. It is also known that $f(k) \\ge k$ and this is believed to be\nthe correct value. We prove that $f(k) < k+2\\Omega(k)$, where $\\Omega(k)$ is\nthe number of prime factors, not necessarily distinct, in the prime\nfactorization of $k$.\n  We also show that any weighted undirected graph of minimum degree $2k-1$\ncontains a cycle of weight divisible by $k$. This result is proved in the more\ngeneral setting in which the weights are from a finite abelian group of order\n$k$, and the cycle has weight equal to the group identity. We conjecture that\nthis holds for undirected graphs with minimum degree $k+1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
