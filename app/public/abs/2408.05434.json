Its accuracy depends\nstrongly on the quality of the potential energy surfaces, and its affordability\nfor long direct-dynamic simulations with adequate ensemble averaging depends\nstrongly on the cost of the required electronic structure calculations.\nLinearized pair-density functional theory (L-PDFT) is a recently developed\npost-self-consistent field multireference method that can model potential\nenergy surfaces with an accuracy similar to expensive multireference\nperturbation theories but at a computational cost similar to the underlying\nmulticonfiguration self-consistent field method. Here we integrate the SHARC\ndynamics and PySCF electronic structure code to utilize L-PDFT for\nelectronically nonadiabatic calculations and use the combined programs to study\nthe photoisomerization reaction of cis-azomethane. We show that L-PDFT is able\nto successfully simulate the photoisomerization and yields results similar to\nthe more expensive extended multi-state complete active space second-order\nperturbation theory. This shows that L-PDFT can model internal conversion, and\nit demonstrates its promise for broader photodynamics applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
