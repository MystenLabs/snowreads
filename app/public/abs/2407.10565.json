Graph lifts have found numerous interesting applications and\nconnections to a variety of areas over the years. Of particular importance is\nthe random graph model obtained by considering an $\\ell$-lift of a graph\nsampled uniformly at random. This model was first introduced by Amit and Linial\nin 1999, and has been extensively investigated since. In this paper, we study\nthe size of the largest topological clique in random lifts of complete graphs.\n  In 2006, Drier and Linial raised the conjecture that almost all $\\ell$-lifts\nof the complete graph on $n$ vertices contain a subdivision of a clique of\norder $\\Omega(n)$ as a subgraph provided $\\ell$ is at least linear in $n$. We\nconfirm their conjecture in a strong form by showing that for $\\ell \\ge\n(1+o(1))n$, one can almost surely find a subdivision of a clique of order $n$.\nWe prove that this is tight by showing that for $\\ell \\le (1-o(1))n$, almost\nall $\\ell$-lifts do not contain subdivisions of cliques of order $n$.\n  Finally, for $2 \\le \\ell \\ll n$, we show that almost all $\\ell$-lifts of\n$K_n$ contain a subdivision of a clique on $(1-o(1))\\sqrt{\\frac{2n\n\\ell}{1-1/\\ell}}$ vertices and that this is tight up to the lower order term.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
