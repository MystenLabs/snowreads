The Lorentz factor evolutions of forward and\nreverse shocks induced by the interaction between magnetized ejecta and an\nambient medium are investigated for a wide range of magnetization and width of\nthe ejecta. The forward shock evolution is described by the magnetic\nacceleration, coasting, transition, and self-similar deceleration phases.\nAccording to our simulation results, we numerically calculate the corresponding\nradiation. Based on our numerical results, to model afterglow light curves in\ngeneral cases, we construct semi-analytical formulae for the Lorentz factor\nevolutions. The magnetization and ejecta width dependence are clearly seen in\nthe reverse shock light curves. The transition phase with a reasonable ejecta\nwidth can reproduce the shallow decay phase in the observed GRB afterglow. The\ninverse Compton emission in the magnetic acceleration phase can be responsible\nfor the very steep rise of the early TeV emission in GRB221009A.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
