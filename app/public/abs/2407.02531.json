We consider different models of this gravity to discuss the presence\nof symmetry generators together with conserved integrals using Nother Gauge\nsymmetry scheme. In most of the cases, we obtain temporal and scaling\nsymmetries that yield conservation of energy and linear momentum, respectively.\nIn the absence of contracted Ricci and energy-momentum tensors, we obtain\nmaximum symmetries but none of them correspond to any standard symmetry or\nconservation law. We formulate exact solutions and construct graphical analysis\nof standard cosmological parameters. We observe realistic nature of new models\nvia squared speed of sound, viability conditions suggested by Dolgov-Kawasaki\ninstability and state-finder parameters. We investigate the behavior of\nfractional densities and check the compatibility with Planck 2018 observational\ndata. The new models are stable and viable preserving compatibility with\n$\\Lambda$CDM and Chaplygin gas models. It is concluded that most of the\nsolutions favor accelerated cosmic expansion.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
