This imposes a pressing need to develop fast and accurate methods for\ncomputing the matter power spectrum $P(k)$, or equivalently, the matter\ntransfer function $T(k)$. In previous works, we introduced precise fitting\nformulas for these quantities within the standard cosmological model, including\nextensions such as the presence of massive neutrinos and modifications of\ngravity. However, these formulations overlooked a key characteristic imprinted\nin $P(k)$: the baryon acoustic oscillation signal. Here, we leverage our\nunderstanding of the well-known physics behind this oscillatory pattern to\nimpose constraints on our genetic algorithm, a machine learning technique. By\nemploying this ``physics-informed'' approach, we introduce an expression that\naccurately describes the matter transfer function with sub-percent mean\naccuracy. The high interpretability of the output allows for straightforward\nextensions of this formulation to other scenarios involving massive neutrinos\nand modifications of gravity. We anticipate that this formula will serve as a\ncompetitive fitting function for $P(k)$, meeting the accuracy requirements\nessential for cosmological analyses.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
