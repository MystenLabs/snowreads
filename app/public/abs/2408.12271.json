Here, we utilize deep\nreinforcement learning to control individual evolutions of coupled harmonic\noscillators in an oscillator network. Our work showcases a numerical approach\nto actively cool internal oscillators to their thermal ground states through\nmodulated forces imparted to the external oscillators in the network. We\npresent our results for thermal cooling of all oscillators in multiple network\nconfigurations and introduce the utility of our scheme in the quantum regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
