We present Desk2Desk, an\noptimization-based approach for remote collaboration in which the hybrid\nworkspaces of two collaborators are fully integrated to enable immersive\nside-by-side collaboration. The optimization adjusts each user's workspace in\nlayout and number of shared monitors and creates a mapping between workspaces\nto handle inconsistencies between workspaces due to physical constraints (e.g.\nphysical monitors). We show in a user study how our system adaptively merges\ndissimilar physical workspaces to enable immersive side-by-side collaboration,\nand demonstrate how an optimization-based approach can effectively address\ndissimilar physical layouts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
