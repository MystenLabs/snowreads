This galaxy hosts one of the lowest ionised gas mass outflow\nrates (Mout~0.005 M/yr) in a sample of six AGN with similar bolometric\nluminosities (log Lbol~44erg/s) within the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow\nSurvey (GATOS). We aim to understand the properties of the ionised gas outflow,\nmainly using the emission lines from the neon transitions, that cover a broad\nrange of ionisation potentials (IP) from ~20 eV to ~130 eV. We applied\nparametric and non-parametric methods to characterise the line emission and\nkinematics. The low excitation lines (IP<25eV, e.g.[NeII]) trace the rotating\ndisc emission. The high excitation lines (IP>90eV, e.g.[NeV]), which are likely\nphotoionised exclusively by the AGN, are expanding in the direction nearly\nperpendicular to the disc of the galaxy, with maximum projected velocities of\n~350-500 km/s. In particular, [NeV] and [NeVI] lines reveal a biconical ionised\ngas outflow emerging N-S from the nuclear region, extending at least ~2.5\"N and\n3.8\"S (projected distance of ~450 and 680 pc). Most of the emission arising in\nthe northern part of the cone was not previously detected due to obscuration.\nGiven the almost face-on orientation of the outflow and the almost edge-on\norientation of the galaxy, NGC7172 may be a case of weak coupling.\nNevertheless, we found evidence for positive feedback in two distinct\noutflowing clumps at projected distances of 3.1\" and 4.3\" (i.e. ~560 and 780\npc) SW from the AGN. We estimated a star formation rate in these regions using\nthe [NeII] and [NeIII] luminosities of 0.08 M/yr, that is ~10% of that found in\nthe circumnuclear ring. The star formation activity might have been triggered\nby the interaction between the ionised gas outflow and the ISM of the galaxy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
