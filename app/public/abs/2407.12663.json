State-of-the-art local tracking and\ntrajectory planning are typically performed using camera sensor input to the\nflight control algorithm, but the extent to which environmental disturbances\nlike rain affect the performance of these systems is largely unknown. In this\npaper, we first describe the development of an open dataset comprising ~335k\nimages to examine these effects for seven different classes of precipitation\nconditions and show that a worst-case average tracking error of 1.5 m is\npossible for a state-of-the-art visual odometry system (VINS-Fusion). We then\nuse the dataset to train a set of deep neural network models suited to mobile\nand constrained deployment scenarios to determine the extent to which it may be\npossible to efficiently and accurately classify these `rainy' conditions. The\nmost lightweight of these models (MobileNetV3 small) can achieve an accuracy of\n90% with a memory footprint of just 1.28 MB and a frame rate of 93 FPS, which\nis suitable for deployment in resource-constrained and latency-sensitive\nsystems. We demonstrate a classification latency in the order of milliseconds\nusing typical flight computer hardware. Accordingly, such a model can feed into\nthe disturbance estimation component of an autonomous flight controller. In\naddition, data from unmanned aerial vehicles with the ability to accurately\ndetermine environmental conditions in real time may contribute to developing\nmore granular timely localised weather forecasting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
