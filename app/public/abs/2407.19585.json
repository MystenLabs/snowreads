A classical theorem of McAdam shows that\nthe analytic spread of an ideal $I$ in a formally equidimensional local ring is\nequal to the dimension of the ring if and only if the maximal ideal is an\nassociated prime of $R/\\overline{I^n}$ for some $n$. We show in Theorem 1.6\nthat McAdam's theorem holds for $\\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an\nequidimensional local ring which is essentially of finite type over a field.\nThis generalizes an earlier result for $\\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtrations in an\nequicharacteristic zero excellent local domain by the author. This theorem does\nnot hold for more general filtrations.\n  We consider the question of the asymptotic behavior of the function $n\\mapsto\n\\lambda_R(R/I_n)$ for a $\\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration $\\mathcal I=\\{I_n\\}$\nof $m_R$-primary ideals on a $d$-dimensional normal excellent local ring. It is\nknown from earlier work of the author that the multiplicity $$ e(\\mathcal I)=d!\n\\lim_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda_R(R/I_n)}{n^d} $$ can be irrational. We\nshow in Lemma 4.1 that the limsup of the first difference function $$\n\\limsup_{n\\rightarrow\\infty}\\frac{\\lambda_R(I_n/I_{n+1})}{n^{d-1}} $$ is always\nfinite for a $\\mathbb Q$-divisorial filtration. We then give an example in\nSection 4 showing that this limsup may not exist as a limit.\n  In the final section, we give an example of a symbolic filtration\n$\\{P^{(n)}\\}$ of a prime ideal $P$ in a normal two dimensional excellent local\nring which has the property that the set of Rees valuations of all the symbolic\npowers $P^{(n)}$ of $P$ is infinite.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
