By applying the reduction argument, we find and characterize a\npositive value $\\lambda_0$ such that if $\\lambda-\\lambda_0>0$ is small enough,\nthen the above problem admits a solution, which blows up and concentrates at\nthe critical point of the Robin function as $\\lambda\\rightarrow \\lambda_0$.\nMoreover, we consider the above problem under zero Neumann boundary condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
