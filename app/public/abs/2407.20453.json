We especially focus on the remnants of system-specific\ninformation that modify the late-time behavior of correlation functions like\nthe spectral form factor, or the inclusion of explicit system-dependent\nHamiltonian corrections not captured by the RMT regime. The consistency of the\npredictions in the new ensemble with respect to the universal (Haar) one is\nmade explicit by showing how that for arbitrary systems it defines an unitary\n1-design and for strongly chaotic systems it becomes an approximated 2-design.\nWhile we are able to provide universal expressions for two- and four-point\nensemble-averaged correlation functions and show how system-dependent\ninformation is spectrally decoupled, we also show that for small energy windows\ncorrelation functions defined by the new ensemble reduce to the predictions of\nthe ETH.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
