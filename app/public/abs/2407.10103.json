SuperBIT achieved precise pointing\ncontrol through the use of three nested frames in conjunction with an optical\nFine Guidance System (FGS), resulting in an average image stability of 0.055\"\nover 300-second exposures. The SuperBIT FGS includes a tip-tilt fast-steering\nmirror that corrects for jitter on a pair of focal plane star cameras. In this\npaper, we leverage the empirical data from SuperBIT's successful 45-night\nstratospheric mission to inform the FGS design for the next-generation\nballoon-borne telescope. The Gigapixel Balloon-borne Imaging Telescope\n(GigaBIT) is designed to be a 1.35m wide-field, high resolution imaging\ntelescope, with specifications to extend the scale and capabilities beyond\nthose of its predecessor SuperBIT. A description and analysis of the SuperBIT\nFGS will be presented along with methodologies for extrapolating this data to\nenhance GigaBIT's FGS design and fine pointing control algorithm. We employ a\nsystems engineering approach to outline and formalize the design constraints\nand specifications for GigaBIT's FGS. GigaBIT, building on the SuperBIT legacy,\nis set to enhance high-resolution astronomical imaging, marking a significant\nadvancement in the field of balloon-borne telescopes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
