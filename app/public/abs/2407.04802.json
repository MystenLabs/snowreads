This is achieved\nusing expanded polyethylene foam (EPE) modules as the soft material. In\nsituations like post-earthquake search operations, these dual-purpose robots\ncould play a vital role. The soft continuum manipulator with a camera attached\nto the tip can manually search for survivors in the debris. On the other hand,\nthe soft snake robot can be made by attaching an active wheel to the soft\ncontinuum manipulator. This mobile robot can reach places humans cannot and\ngather information about survivors. This work presents the design, fabrication,\nand experimental validation of the dual soft continuum robot.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
