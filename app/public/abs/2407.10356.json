The results on the\nequivalence groups are double-checked with the algebraic method. Within these\nclasses, the remarkable Fokker-Planck and the fine Kolmogorov backward\nequations are distinguished by their exceptional symmetry properties. We extend\nthe known results on these two equations to their counterparts with respect to\na distinguished discrete equivalence transformation. Additionally, we carry out\nLie reductions of the equations under consideration up to the point\nequivalence, exhaustively study their hidden Lie symmetries and generate wider\nfamilies of their new exact solutions via acting by their recursion operators\non constructed Lie-invariant solutions. This analysis reveals eight powers of\nthe space variable with exponents -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 as values of the\ndiffusion coefficient that are prominent due to symmetry properties of the\ncorresponding equations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
