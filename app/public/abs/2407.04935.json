Suppose that\n$\\varphi$ is non-contracting; that is, for any linearly independent vectors\n$v_1,\\ldots,v_k$ in $\\mathbb R^n$, $\\varphi(t).(v_1\\wedge\\cdots\\wedge\nv_k)\\not\\to0$ as $t\\to\\infty$. Then, there exists a unique smallest subgroup\n$H_\\varphi$ of $\\text{SL}(n,\\mathbb R)$ generated by unipotent one-parameter\nsubgroups such that $\\varphi(t)H_\\varphi\\to g_0H_\\varphi$ in\n$\\text{SL}(n,\\mathbb R)/H_\\varphi$ as $t\\to\\infty$ for some $g_0\\in\n\\text{SL}(n,\\mathbb R)$.\n  Let $G$ be a closed subgroup of $\\text{SL}(n,\\mathbb R)$ and $\\Gamma$ be a\nlattice in $G$. Suppose that $\\varphi([0,\\infty))\\subset G$. Then\n$H_\\varphi\\subset G$, and for any $x\\in G/\\Gamma$, the trajectory\n$\\{\\varphi(t)x:t\\in [0,T]\\}$ gets equidistributed with respect to the measure\n$g_0\\mu_{Lx}$ as $T\\to\\infty$, where $L$ is a closed subgroup of $G$ such that\n$\\overline{Hx}=Lx$ and $Lx$ admits a unique $L$-invariant probability measure,\ndenoted by $\\mu_{Lx}$.\n  A crucial new ingredient in this work is proving that for any\nfinite-dimensional representation $V$ of $\\text{SL}(n,\\mathbb R)$, there exist\n$T_0>0$, $C>0$, and $\\alpha>0$ such that for any $v\\in G$, the map $t\\mapsto\n\\|\\varphi(t)v\\|$ is $(C,\\alpha)$-good on $[T_0,\\infty)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
