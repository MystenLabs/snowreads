However, current FFT-based methods\nface challenges that limit their applicability to intricate material models or\ncomplex mechanical problems. These challenges include the manual implementation\nof constitutive laws and the use of computationally expensive and complex\nalgorithms to couple microscale mechanisms to macroscale material behavior.\nHere, we incorporate automatic differentiation (AD) within the FFT framework to\nmitigate these challenges. We demonstrate that AD-enhanced FFT-based methods\ncan derive stress and tangent stiffness directly from energy density\nfunctionals, facilitating the extension of FFT-based methods to more intricate\nmaterial models. Additionally, AD simplifies the calculation of homogenized\ntangent stiffness for microstructures with complex architectures and\nconstitutive properties. This enhancement renders current FFT-based methods\nmore modular, enabling them to tackle homogenization in complex multiscale\nsystems, especially those involving multiphysics processes. Our work will\nsimplify the numerical implementation of FFT-based methods for complex solid\nmechanics problems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3fY3oSg283FAtnHUYxdCQN9GC7bkPbbAJBqokPaeMk4","pdfSize":"1188630"}
