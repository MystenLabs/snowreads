Subjects are taught to program in one of two virtual\nreality (VR) applications developed by the researcher that use interactable\nobjects representing programming concepts. The different versions are the basis\nfor two experimental groups. One version of the app uses textual code for the\ninteractable programming objects and the other version uses everyday objects as\nvisual metaphors for the CS concepts the programming objects represent. For the\ntwo experimental groups, the study compares the results of self-efficacy\nsurveys and CS knowledge tests taken before and after the VR activity\nintervention. An attitudinal survey taken after the intervention examines\nlearners' sense of productivity and engagement with the VR activity. While\nfurther iterations of the study with a larger sample size would be needed to\nconfirm any results, preliminary findings from the pilot study suggest that\nboth methods of teaching basic programming concepts in VR can lead to increased\nlevels of self-efficacy and knowledge regarding CS, and can contribute toward\nproductive mental states.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
