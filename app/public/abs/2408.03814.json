In this work, we solve\nthis open problem of poised lattice generation (PLG) via an interdisciplinary\nresearch of approximation theory, abstract algebra, and artificial intelligence\n(AI). Specifically, we focus on the triangular lattices in approximation\ntheory, study group actions of permutations upon triangular lattices, prove an\nisomorphism between the group of permutations and that of triangular lattices,\nand dynamically organize the AI state space of permutations so that a\ndepth-first search of poised lattices has optimal efficiency. Based on this\nalgorithm, we further develop the PLG finite difference method that retains the\nsimplicity of Cartesian grids yet overcomes the disadvantage of legacy finite\ndifference methods in handling irregular geometries. Results of various\nnumerical tests demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm and the\nsimplicity, efficiency, and fourth-order accuracy of the PLG finite difference\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
