In this study, we predict\nthe constraint strength on the $f(R)$ theory using the mock data generated from\nthe China Space Station Telescope (CSST) Ultra-Deep Field (UDF) Type Ia\nsupernova (SN Ia) survey and wide-field slitless spectroscopic baryon acoustic\noscillation (BAO) survey. We explore three popular $f(R)$ models, and introduce\na parameter $b$ to characterize the deviation of the f(R) theory from the\n$\\Lambda$CDM theory. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method is employed to\nconstrain the parameters in the $f(R)$ models, and the nuisance parameters and\nsystematical uncertainties are also considered in the model fitting process.\nBesides, we also perform model comparisons between the $f(R)$ models and the\n$\\Lambda$CDM model. We find that the constraint accuracy using the CSST SN\nIa+BAO dataset alone is comparable to or even better than the result given by\nthe combination of the current relevant observations, and the CSST SN Ia+BAO\nsurvey can distinguish the $f(R)$ models from the $\\Lambda$CDM model. This\nindicates that the CSST SN Ia and BAO surveys can effectively constrain and\ntest the $f(R)$ theory.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
