Typically, variable and check nodes generate\nand replace old messages in every iteration. We show that, under coarse\nquantization, discarding old messages involves a significant loss of mutual\ninformation. The loss is avoided with additional memory, improving performance\nup to 0.36 dB. We propose a modified information bottleneck algorithm to design\nnode operations taking messages from the previous iteration(s) into account as\nside information. Finally, we reveal a 2-bit row-layered decoder that can\noperate within 0.25 dB w.r.t. 32-bit belief propagation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
