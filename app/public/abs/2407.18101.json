This is\ndone by studying the case $X=S^{[2]}$ where $S$ is an elliptic $K3$ surface. We\nshow that in this case there is an irreducible component of the moduli space of\nstable vector bundles on $S^{[2]}$ which is birational to a moduli space of\nsheaves on $S$. We expect that if the moduli space of sheaves on $S$ is a\nsmooth HK variety (necessarily of type $K3^{[a^2+1]}$) then the following more\nprecise version holds: the closure of the moduli space of slope stable vector\nbundles on $(X,h)$ in the moduli space of Gieseker-Maruyama semistable sheaves\nwith its GIT polarization is a general polarized HK variety of type\n$K3^{[a^2+1]}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
