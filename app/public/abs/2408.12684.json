This representation\nleads to the calculation of the hyperbolic volume of the complement of the knot\nthat is the closure of the corresponding braid. In this paper, based on the\nHikami-Inoue representation discussed above, we construct a representation for\nthe virtual braid group. We show that the so-called \"forbidden relations\" do\nnot hold in the image of the resulting representation. In addition, based on\nthe developed method, we construct representations for the flat braid group and\nthe flat virtual braid group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3YHQTm8HHvqFF8QF1hcGDZq3-UOByyOIKyXhI_AdYMg","pdfSize":"180964"}
