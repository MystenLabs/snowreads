Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) is a top-level ontology ISO/IEC\nstandard used to structure a wide variety of ontologies, such as the OBO\nFoundry ontologies and the Common Core Ontologies (CCO). To enhance\ninteroperability between these two ontologies, their extensions, and data\norganized by them, an alignment is presented according to a specific mapping\ncriteria and methodology which prioritizes structural and semantic\nconsiderations. The ontology alignment is evaluated by checking its logical\nconsistency with canonical examples of PROV-O instances and querying terms that\ndo not satisfy the mapping criteria as formalized in SPARQL. A variety of\nsemantic web technologies are used in support of FAIR (Findable, Accessible,\nInteroperable, Reusable) principles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
