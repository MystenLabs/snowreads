It is shown that every necklicial nerve can be\nlifted to the templicial objects of arXiv:2302.02484v2. Building on the work of\nDugger and Spivak, we give sufficient conditions under which the left-adjoint\nof a necklicial nerve can be described more explicitly. As an application, we\nobtain novel and simple expressions for the left-adjoints of the dg-nerve and\ncubical nerve.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
