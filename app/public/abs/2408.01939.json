In this work, electronic\nstructure of $\\beta$-TeO$_2$ and its point defects are investigated using the\nHSEsol functional with the band-gap-tuned mixing parameter. Our calculations\nreveal that $\\beta$-TeO$_2$ exhibits a significant difference between the\nfundamental and optical band gaps because lower energy optical transitions are\ndipole forbidden. Additionally, it has a low hole effective mass, especially\nin-plane. The point defect calculations show that $\\beta$-TeO$_2$ is\nintrinsically an insulator. From systematic calculations of the trivalent\ndopants as well as hydrogen, Bi doping is suggested as the best candidate as an\nacceptor dopant. This work paves the way for the material design of the\n$p$-type $\\beta$-TeO$_2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
