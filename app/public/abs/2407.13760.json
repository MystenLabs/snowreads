We present a neural network\narchitecture for predicting front tire lateral force as a drop-in replacement\nfor physics-based approaches. With a full-scale automated vehicle purpose-built\nfor the drifting application, we deploy these models in a nonlinear model\npredictive controller tuned for tracking a reference drifting trajectory, for\ndirect comparisons of model performance. The neural network tire model exhibits\nsignificantly improved path tracking performance over the brush tire model in\ncases where front-axle braking force is applied, suggesting the neural\nnetwork's ability to express previously unmodeled, latent dynamics in the\ndrifting condition.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
