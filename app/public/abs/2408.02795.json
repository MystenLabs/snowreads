Although this\nis typically the only method for obtaining the relevant documents, it is not\nthe sole approach when dealing with entity-centric questions. In this study, we\npropose Entity Retrieval, a novel retrieval method which rather than relying on\nquestion-document similarity, depends on the salient entities within the\nquestion to identify the retrieval documents. We conduct an in-depth analysis\nof the performance of both dense and sparse retrieval methods in comparison to\nEntity Retrieval. Our findings reveal that our method not only leads to more\naccurate answers to entity-centric questions but also operates more\nefficiently.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
