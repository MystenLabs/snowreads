The potential energy equation of the mechanism is derived. A\nsimulation of the arm going through the basketball shooting motion is done on\nthe mechanism. Throughout the motion the total potential energy is constant.\nThus, the proposed arm exoskeleton is indeed gravity balanced with the use of\ntwo springs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
