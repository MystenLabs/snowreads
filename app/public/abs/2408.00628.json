The starting point was an Exact RG for the boundary theory. The bulk\naction is obtained from the evolution operator for this ERG followed by a field\nredefinition. This procedure guarantees that the boundary correlators are all\nrecovered correctly. In this paper we use the same method in an attempt to\nconstruct a holographic dual action for the free $O(N)$ model where the bulk is\nflat Euclidean space with a plane boundary wall. The scalar cubic interaction\nis found to be local (in $D=3$) but depends on the distance from the boundary -\nwhich can be interpreted as a non constant background dilaton field. The spin 2\n- scalar - scalar interaction is found to be non local - in contrast to the AdS\ncase. A field redefinition that makes the kinetic term quartic in derivatives\ncan be done to mitigate (but not eliminate) this non locality. It is shown\nthat, in spite of the non locality, the action can be obtained by gauge fixing\nan action that has the linearized gauge invariance associated with general\ncoordinate invariance. Boundary correlators (two point and three point) are\nshown to be reproduced by bulk calculations - as expected in this approach to\nholography.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T-C90DkB0NiUrAKsqOxIf5zX0lk3TdaC8NB8OFeZ22o","pdfSize":"279500"}
