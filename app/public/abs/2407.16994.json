We further propose estimators for cost and\nfailure rate, and based on those estimators and experimental data tailored to\nthe application, we propose an algorithm that achieves a desired failure rate\nat the least possible cost. We demonstrate that, under these models, failure\nrate decreases exponentially as a function of cost when voter count and\nthreshold are chosen according to the algorithm, and that the models reasonably\nestimate the actual performance of such a system in action, even with limited\ndata.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
