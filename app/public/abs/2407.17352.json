We apply this to classify\nalmost invariant subspaces of the backward shift and represent a more refined\nversion of nearly invariant subspaces. Kernels of certain perturbed Toeplitz\noperators are examples of the newly introduced nearly invariant subspaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
