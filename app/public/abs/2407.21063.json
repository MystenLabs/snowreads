Like other researchers, we\nidentify the most important employees and detect communities using network\nscience methods. We find that the importance of a person depends on the\ncentrality measure used; while the communities we detected resembled the formal\norganizational structure of the company. In addition, because previous work\nrequired that 10 e-mails be sent and received for an e-mail relationship to\nexist, we analyzed the effect of different thresholds on the results and found\nthat results were very dependent on the threshold used. We also performed\nsentiment analyses on the e-mails to evaluate whether sentiment changed over\ntime and found that the sentiments of the e-mails do not give insight into the\nfinancial wellbeing of Enron. Our results provide insight into how information\nflowed through Enron, who the key employees were, and e-mail sentiment before\nand after the crisis\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cIZAC6IgNa5QWXy7147R-VeQfUdIph6Hs9A6_ytMc-U","pdfSize":"442747"}
