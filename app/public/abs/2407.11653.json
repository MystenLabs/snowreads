Our study reveals\nthat the WKB approximation is invalid in this scenario. We derive an analytic\nsolution for the conversion probability with unitary evolution feature. This\nsolution aligns in form with previous studies on photon-gravitational wave\nconversion. Interestingly, it is applicable in situations where the WKB\napproximation fails. We extend the unitary evolution solution to other\nconversion processes, such as axion-photon and dark photon-photon conversions.\nWhen the WKB approximation conditions are met, this solution reduces to the WKB\nresult. We compute the characteristic strain of gravitational waves resulting\nfrom dark photon conversion in the solar magnetic field, spanning frequencies\nfrom $10^{-5}$ Hz to $10^3$ Hz. Our findings indicate that the characteristic\nstrain derived from the unitary evolution solution differs significantly from\nthat of the WKB solution. The resulting strain signal is far below the\nsensitivity of current gravitational wave interferometers. Nevertheless, we\nhave proposed an exotic gravitational wave source, especially at high\nfrequencies, from the dark photon dark matter local conversion inside the Sun.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
