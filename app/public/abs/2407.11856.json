Previous approaches to the\nanalysis of obliging games have been small-step in the sense that they have\nbeen based on a reduction to standard (non-obliging) games in which single\nmoves correspond to single moves in the original (obliging) game. Here, we\npropose a novel, large-step view on obliging games, reducing them to standard\ngames in which single moves encode long-term behaviors in the original game.\nThis not only allows us to give a meaningful definition of the environment\nwinning in obliging games, but also leads to significantly improved bounds on\nboth strategy sizes and the solution runtime for obliging games.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
