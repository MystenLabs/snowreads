We exhibit initial data undergoing finite but arbitrary\nlarge Sobolev norm explosion: their initial norm is arbitrary small in Sobolev\nspaces of high regularity, but at a later time becomes arbitrary large. We\ndevelop a novel mechanism producing instability, which is based on extracting,\nvia paradifferential normal forms, an effective equation driving the dynamics\nwhose leading term is a non-trivial transport operator with non-constant\ncoefficients. We prove that such operator is responsible for energy cascades\nvia a positive commutator estimate inspired by Mourre's commutator theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
