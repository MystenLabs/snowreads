A Margulis\nspace-time is a noncompact complete Lorentz flat $3$-manifold $E/\\Gamma$ with a\nfree isometry group $\\Gamma$ of rank $g \\geq 2$. We consider the case when\n$\\Gamma$ contains a parabolic element. We show that sufficiently small\ndeformations of $\\Gamma$ still act properly on $E$. We use our previous work\nshowing that $E/\\Gamma$ can be compactified relative to a union of solid tori\nand some old idea of Carri\\`ere in his famous work. We will show that the there\nis also a decomposition of $E/\\Gamma$ by crooked planes that are disjoint and\nembedded in a generalized sense. These can be perturbed so that $E/\\Gamma$\ndecomposes into cells. This partially affirms the conjecture of\nCharette-Drumm-Goldman.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aibIH7Z4OnZQWysPocKn3T1SO__libKr7omu-3i9Qb8","pdfSize":"346099"}
