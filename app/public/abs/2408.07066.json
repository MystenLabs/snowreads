If we use the same hold-out data set both to select a model\n(the model that yields the smallest conformal prediction sets) and then to\nconstruct a conformal prediction set based on that selected model, we suffer a\nloss of coverage due to selection bias. Alternatively, we could further\nsplitting the data to perform selection and calibration separately, but this\ncomes at a steep cost if the size of the dataset is limited. In this paper, we\naddress the challenge of constructing a valid prediction set after\nefficiency-oriented model selection. Our novel methods can be implemented\nefficiently and admit finite-sample validity guarantees without invoking\nadditional sample-splitting. We show that our methods yield prediction sets\nwith asymptotically optimal size under certain notion of continuity for the\nmodel class. The improved efficiency of the prediction sets constructed by our\nmethods are further demonstrated through applications to synthetic datasets in\nvarious settings and a real data example.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
