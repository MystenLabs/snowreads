We present an\napparently weakest acyclicity condition under which the $\\omega$-category\npresented by a diagram shape is freely generated in the sense of polygraphs. We\nthen consider stronger conditions under which this $\\omega$-category is\nequivalent to one obtained from an augmented directed chain complex in the\nsense of Steiner, or consists only of subsets of cells in the diagram. Finally,\nwe study the stability of these conditions under the operations of pasting,\nsuspensions, Gray products, joins and duals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
