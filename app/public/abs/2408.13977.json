The system monitors a user's execution of\nregistered services on their smartphones (via accessibility service) and\nproactively requests a single-sentence reason from the user. By utilizing a\nLarge Language Model (LLM), SayRea parses the reason and predicts contextual\nrelationships between the observed service and potential contexts (such as\nsetting the alarm clock deep in the evening). In this way, SayRea can\nsignificantly reduce the cognitive load on users in anticipating future needs\nand selecting contextual attributes. A 10-day field study involving 20\nparticipants showed that SayRea accumulated an average of 62.4 rules per user\nand successfully recommended 45% of service usage. The participants provided\npositive feedback on the system's usability, interpretability, and\ncontrollability. The findings highlight SayRea's effectiveness in personalized\nservice recommendations and its potential to enhance user experience in mobile\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aWqOWQB_9q51iQwstP4mCMDogv-tnaqX6GZHvc9FmZ8","pdfSize":"1659709"}
