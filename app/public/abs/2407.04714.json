It necessitates a machine\nlearning algorithm capable of managing real-world odor interference, ensuring\nresource efficiency for mobile robotics, and accurately estimating gas features\nfor critical tasks such as odor mapping, localization, and alarm generation.\nThis paper introduces a hybrid approach that exploits neuromorphic computing in\ncombination with probabilistic inference to address these demanding\nrequirements. Our approach implements a combination of a convolutional spiking\nneural network for feature extraction and a Bayesian spiking neural network for\nodor detection and identification. The developed algorithm is rigorously tested\non a dataset for sensor drift compensation for robustness evaluation.\nAdditionally, for efficiency evaluation, we compare the energy consumption of\nour model with a non-spiking machine learning algorithm under identical dataset\nand operating conditions. Our approach demonstrates superior efficiency\nalongside comparable accuracy outcomes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ASWfvmGN2tJSiN1OF8ZmaxZ9pcv4DGOO_qXz2hixCnI","pdfSize":"1481483"}
