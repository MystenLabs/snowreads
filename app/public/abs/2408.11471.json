It solves a linearized inverse problem that requires regularization to\ncomplement the echo shift data with a priori constraints. Spatial gradient\nregularization has been used to enforce smooth solutions, but SoS estimates\nwere found to be biased depending on tissue layer geometry. Here, we propose to\ntrain a linear operator to minimize SoS errors on average over a large number\nof random tissue models that sample the distribution of geometries and SoS\nvalues expected in vivo. In an extensive simulation study on liver imaging, we\ndemonstrate that biases are strongly reduced, with residual biases being the\nresult of a partial non-linearity in the actual physical problem. This approach\ncan either be applied directly to echo-shift data or to the SoS maps estimated\nwith gradient regularization, where the former shows slightly better\nperformance, but the latter is computationally more efficient. Experimental\nphantom results confirm the transferability of our results to real ultrasound\ndata.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
