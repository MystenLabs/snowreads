It not only affects student performance and\nconfidence, but also can lead to avoidance of further math/STEM classes and\ncareers. Cooperative learning (i.e., group work) is a proven strategy that can\nreduce math anxiety and has additional social and pedagogical benefits.\nHowever, depending on the individuals involved, some peer interactions may\nmitigate anxiety while others exacerbate it. Mathematical modeling is one\napproach to help untangle this complex dynamic. In this work we introduce a\nbounded confidence model to evaluate how math anxiety levels are affected by\nstudent group work. Although the model is quite simple, it captures non-obvious\nphenomena including how varying group sizes and frequency of switching groups\ncan affect anxiety levels. The model is easily adaptable to incorporate\nadditional personal and societal factors making it ripe for future research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
