Specifically, quadratic unconstrained binary optimization\nproblems are solved with the help of machine learning, e.g., factorization\nmachines with annealing, which convert a raw parameter to binary variables.\nThis work investigates the dependence of the convergence speed and the accuracy\non binary labeling method, which can influence the cost function shape and thus\nthe probability of being captured at a local minimum solution. By exemplifying\ntraveling salesman problem, we propose and evaluate Gray labeling, which\ncorrelates the Hamming distance in binary labels with the traveling distance.\nThrough numerical simulation of traveling salesman problem up to 15 cities at a\nlimited number of iterations, the Gray labeling shows less local minima\npercentages and shorter traveling distances compared with natural labeling.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
