Thus, unlike the case of previously\nknown ballooning modes their amplitudes are not separable functions of time and\nspace. The relevant resonance conditions are intrinsically different from those\nof the well-known Landau conditions for (ordinary) plasma waves: they involve\nthe mode geometry and affect different regions of the distribution in momentum\nspace at different positions in configuration space. A process for a transfer\nof energy among different particle populations is envisioned\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
