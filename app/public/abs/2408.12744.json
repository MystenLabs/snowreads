The devices employ a circular mesa design with low-resistivity\ncontacts and an SiO$_2$ passivation layer. The I-V and C-V characteristics of\nthe 4H-SiC LGADs are compared with complementary 4H-SiC PiN diodes to confirm a\nhigh breakdown voltage and low leakage current. Both LGADs and PiN diodes were\nirradiated with $\\alpha$ particles from a $^{210}_{84}\\rm{Po}$ source. The\ncharge collected by each device was compared, and it was observed that low-gain\ncharge carrier multiplication is achieved in the 4H-SiC LGAD.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1CUaDDq92pqMGJuAUeTHzzDeKqNuxzBIwZMPCFEl6Mc","pdfSize":"6559206"}
