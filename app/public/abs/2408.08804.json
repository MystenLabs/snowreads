However, the effects of the non-Hermiticity, arising\nfrom the coupling to the environment and dissipation, have remained unexplored.\nHere we investigate a possibly simplest non-Hermitian version of twisted\nbilayer graphene (NH TBG) obtained by relative twisting of two NH graphene\nmonolayers with the non-Hermiticity encoded in imbalance in the in-plane\nnearest-neighbor hopping amplitudes in the opposite directions. In particular,\nwithin the Bistritzer-MacDonald approach generalized to the NH systems, we\nobtain the corresponding continuum Dirac-like Hamiltonian for the NH TBG, which\nexhibits two kinds of magic angles. First, it hosts two exceptional magic\nangles at which the band structure changes from being purely real to purely\nimaginary, thereby featuring the flat bands in real energy and an infinite\nlifetime. In between them, the bands remained flattened, and Hermitian magic\nangle emerges, for which the imaginary part of the energy is maximal and\ndirectly corresponds with the usual magic angle in the non-dissipative, purely\nHermitian TBG. Our results suggest the robustness of the flat bands in open\nsystems and should motivate studies of the interplay between the non-Hermitian\neffects and electron interactions in the NH moire bands.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
