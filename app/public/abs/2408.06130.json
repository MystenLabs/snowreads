We present the design\nand implementation of FaasMeter, a FaaS control plane which provides energy\nmonitoring, accounting, control, and pricing as first-class operations. The\nhighly diverse and dynamic workloads of FaaS create additional complexity to\nmeasuring and controlling energy usage which FaasMeter can mitigate.\n  We develop a new statistical energy disaggregation approach to provide\naccurate and complete energy footprints for functions, despite using noisy and\ncoarse-grained system-level power (not just CPU power readings). Our accurate\nand robust footprints are achieved by combining conventional power models with\nKalman filters and Shapley values. FaasMeter is a full-spectrum energy\nprofiler, and fairly attributes energy of shared resources to functions (such\nas energy used by the control plane itself). We develop new energy profiling\nvalidation metrics, and show that FaasMeter's energy footprints are accurate to\nwithin 1\\% of carefully obtained marginal energy ground truth measurements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
