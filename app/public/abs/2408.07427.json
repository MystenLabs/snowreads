Inspired by the rise of\nlarge language models (LLMs) in various AI applications, there is a surge of\nwork on LLM-based SRS. Despite their attractive performance, existing LLM-based\nSRS still exhibit some limitations, including neglecting intra-item relations,\nignoring long-term collaborative knowledge and using inflexible architecture\ndesigns for adaption. To alleviate these issues, we propose an LLM-based SRS\nnamed MixRec. Built on top of coarse-grained adaption for capturing inter-item\nrelations, MixRec is further enhanced with (1) context masking that models\nintra-item relations to help LLM better understand token and item semantics in\nthe context of SRS, (2) collaborative knowledge injection that helps LLM\nincorporate long-term collaborative knowledge, and (3) a dynamic adaptive\nmixture-of-experts design that can flexibly choose expert architectures based\non Bayesian optimization to better incorporate different sequential\ninformation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MixRec can effectively\nhandle sequential recommendation in a dynamic and adaptive manner.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
