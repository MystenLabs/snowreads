Large language models (LLMs) have emerged\nas particularly promising tools, offering significant potential in assisting\nradiologists with report generation, clinical decision support, and patient\ncommunication. This paper presents an advanced radiology-focused large language\nmodel: MGH Radiology Llama. It is developed using the Llama 3 70B model,\nbuilding upon previous domain-specific models like Radiology-GPT and\nRadiology-Llama2. Leveraging a unique and comprehensive dataset from\nMassachusetts General Hospital, comprising over 6.5 million de-identified\nmedical reports across various imaging modalities, the model demonstrates\nsignificant improvements in generating accurate and clinically relevant\nradiology impressions given the corresponding findings. Our evaluation,\nincorporating both traditional metrics and a GPT-4-based assessment, highlights\nthe enhanced performance of this work over general-purpose LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
