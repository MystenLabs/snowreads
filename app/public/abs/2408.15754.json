Here we\nconsider the 3d-5d double-perovskite Ba$_{2}$CoWO$_{6}$, which features\nmirror-symmetry-protected nodal-lines, strong Co-site interactions, and\nspin-orbit coupling (SOC) at W sites. Our first principles and exact\ndiagonalization results reveal a half-metallic ground state with high-spin Co\nand topologically non-trivial bands. We demonstrate that SOC gaps out nodal\npoints, causes band-inversion and generates anomalous Hall response. A\nsemi-classical Monte Carlo finite-temperature simulation of five-orbital\nHubbard model uncovers an emergent Co-spin scalar chirality and colossal\npositive transverse-magnetoresponse. We predict the temperature and magnetic\nfield scales for the tunability of scalar-chirality and magnetoresponse.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
