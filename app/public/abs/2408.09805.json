In particular, the NLO treatment of\ndiffractive: 1) exclusive dijet, 2) exclusive longitudinally polarized light\nvector meson and 3) semi-inclusive single or double hadron photo- or\nelectroproduction with large $p_T$, on a nucleon or a nuclei. Finally, we\ndiscuss the more complicated 4) exclusive transversely polarized light vector\nmeson production, which starts at the next-to-leading power and therefore\nrequires a beyond leading twist treatment. This new class of processes provides\nan access to precision physics of gluon saturation dynamics, with very\npromising future phenomenological studies at the EIC, or, at the LHC in $p A$\nand $A A$ scattering, using Ultra Peripheral Collisions (UPC).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
