The curvature term\nbehaves as a perfect fluid with the equation of state parameter w_K = -1/3\nUsing suitable transformation of variables, the evolution equations are reduced\nto an autonomous system for both power law and exponential form of the scalar\npotential. The critical points are analyzed with center manifold theory and\nstability has been discussed. Also, critical points at infinity have been\nstudied using the notion of Poincare sphere. Finally, the cosmological\nimplications of the critical points and cosmological bouncing scenarios are\ndiscussed. It is found that the cosmological bounce takes place near the points\nat infinity when the non-isolated critical points on the equator of the\nPoincare sphere are saddle or saddle-node in nature.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S1zz2UDguTOl1oqaSX4bfVgemNqeBHnQG6itzFg-xas","pdfSize":"1630619"}
