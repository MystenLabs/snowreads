We refer to these behaviors as\nDynamic Loco-Manipulation (DLM). To successfully complete these tasks, humans\ncontrol the position of their bodies and contact forces at their hands. To\nenable similar whole-body control in humanoids, we introduce loco-manipulation\nretargeting strategies with switched position and force control modes in a\nbilateral teleoperation framework. Our proposed locomotion mappings use the\npitch and yaw of the operator's torso to control robot position or\nacceleration. The manipulation retargeting maps the operator's arm movements to\nthe robot's arms for joint-position or impedance control of the end-effector. A\nHuman-Machine Interface captures the teleoperator's motion and provides haptic\nfeedback to their torso, enhancing their awareness of the robot's interactions\nwith the environment. In this paper, we demonstrate two forms of DLM. First, we\nshow the robot slotting heavy boxes (5-10.5 kg), weighing up to 83% of the\nrobot's weight, into desired positions. Second, we show human-robot\ncollaboration for carrying an object, where the robot and teleoperator take on\nleader and follower roles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
