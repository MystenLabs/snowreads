We show\nthat the graded average of the orders of $n$ consecutive $K(1)$-local homotopy\ngroups of a finite spectrum $X$ grows asymptotically like\n$\\frac{-\\log_p(n)}{2}$ times the total Iwasawa $\\lambda$-invariant of $X$. We\nshow that the Iwasawa $\\mu$-invariants of finite spectra are all zero. Finally,\nwe prove a spectral analogue of a weak form of the Iwasawa Main Conjecture,\ndescribing the orders of the $K(1)$-local homotopy groups of a certain\n``torsion-free replacement'' of $X$ in terms of the characteristic polynomials\nof the Iwasawa modules associated to $X$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
