The holographically dual theory,\noften referred to as warped CFT$_2$, exhibits a single copy of the\nVirasoro-Kac-Moody algebra. Consequently, the asymptotic density of states in\nthe right-moving sector is described by the charged Cardy formula that we\nreview in detail. By defining specific linear combinations of the gravitational\nthermodynamic potentials, we are able to present the gravitational left- and\nright-moving on-shell actions directly in the grand-canonical ensemble. This\nallows us to demonstrate that, apart from the charged Cardy behavior in the\nright-moving sector, the dual field theory exhibits an additional frozen\nleft-moving state giving rise to non-zero entropy contribution. Our findings\nelucidate the nature of warped CFTs and reveal subtle yet fundamental\ndifferences from the existing literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
