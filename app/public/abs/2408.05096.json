Based on\nthe assumption of time-scale separation between a fast contagion process and a\nslower movement response, the underlying interaction networks have been\npreviously assumed to be static, determined by the spatial structure at the\nonset of the collective escape response. This idealization does not account for\nthe temporal evolution of the spatial network structure, which may have a major\nimpact on the behavioral contagion dynamics. Here, we propose a\nspatially-explicit, agent-based model for the coupling between behavioral\ncontagion and the network dynamics originating from the spreading movement\nresponse. We explore the impact of movement parameters (startle speed, initial\ndirectionality, and directional noise) on average cascade size. By conducting\nnumerical simulations for different density levels, we show that increasing\nescape speed suppresses the cascade size in most cases, that the cascade size\ndepends strongly on the movement direction of the initially startled\nindividual, and that large variability in the direction of individual escape\nmovements (rotational noise) will typically promote the spread of behavioral\ncontagion through spatial groups. Our work highlights the importance of\naccounting for movement dynamics in behavioral contagion, and facilitates our\nunderstanding of rapid coordinated response and collective information\nprocessing in animal groups.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
