While previous diffusion-based\ngraph generation methods have shown promising results, they often struggle to\nscale to large graphs. In this work, we propose ARROW-Diff (AutoRegressive\nRandOm Walk Diffusion), a novel random walk-based diffusion approach for\nefficient large-scale graph generation. Our method encompasses two components\nin an iterative process of random walk sampling and graph pruning. We\ndemonstrate that ARROW-Diff can scale to large graphs efficiently, surpassing\nother baseline methods in terms of both generation time and multiple graph\nstatistics, reflecting the high quality of the generated graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
