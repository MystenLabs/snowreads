In a society\nwith an ever increasing reliance on technology, we often neglect the fact that\nsoftware development processes and practices unintentionally marginalize\ncertain groups of end users. While the Inspire program and its first iteration\nin 2022 are described in detail in CHAPTER 26, here we describe our insights\nfrom an analysis of the development processes and practices used by the teams.\nWe found that empathy-based requirements gathering techniques and certain\ninfluences on the software development teams' motivation levels impact the\nteams' ability to build inclusive software. This chapter begins with an\nexplanation of the Inspire program and a discussion on what the term\n``inclusive software'' actually means in our context before highlighting useful\npractices for designing inclusive software.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"a_xRMUAqWXeY6361sJTL_3i40Pt0U3nV1jYM_eHUOVM","pdfSize":"917385"}
