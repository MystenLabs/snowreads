Despite this empirical\nreality, prior social choice literature frequently analyzes fairness criteria\nunder the assumption that all voters provide a complete ranking of the\ncandidates. We introduce new fairness criteria for multiwinner ranked-choice\nelections concerning truncated ballots. In particular, we define notions of the\nindependence of losing voters blocs and independence of winning voters blocs,\nwhich state that the winning committee of an election should not change when we\nremove partial ballots which rank only losing candidates, and the winning\ncommittee should change in reasonable ways when removing ballots which rank\nonly winning candidates. Of the voting methods we analyze, the\nChamberlin-Courant rule performs the best with respect to these criteria, the\nexpanding approvals rule performs the worst, and the method of single\ntransferable vote falls in between.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XmDJBZSGeL5_YxHWrkT3mLLsTaiwl9E58GB2TmUB9WQ","pdfSize":"258006"}
