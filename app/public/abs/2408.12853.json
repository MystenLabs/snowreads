These models are coarse-grained\nand often make either too strong or too weak assumptions about the network.\nThis paper introduces a new timing model called granular synchrony that models\nthe network as a mixture of synchronous, partially synchronous, and\nasynchronous communication links. The new model is not only theoretically\ninteresting but also more representative of real-world networks. It also serves\nas a unifying framework where current mainstream models are its special cases.\nWe present necessary and sufficient conditions for solving crash and Byzantine\nfault-tolerant consensus in granular synchrony. Interestingly, consensus among\n$n$ parties can be achieved against $f \\geq n/2$ crash faults or $f \\geq n/3$\nByzantine faults without resorting to full synchrony.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tYF5lV2xkH-XO_c4M1OmU4U5wG2QjZ-uxHqIYYfdX98","pdfSize":"525722"}
