[arXiv:2406.16178 [physics.optics]]\nregarding a precision gyroscope based on the intrinsic spin of light. To this\nend, we analyze the propagation of electromagnetic radiation in a physical\nsystem that uniformly rotates about the direction of wave propagation in the\npresence of an ambient medium. Finally, we consider the possibility of using\nthis type of spin-of-light gyroscope to measure gravitomagnetic fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
