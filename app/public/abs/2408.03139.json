Both linear and nonlinear mountain waves are modeled in idealized\nsimulations within the pseudo-incompressible flow solver PincFlow.\nTwo-dimensional flows over monochromatic orographies are considered, using\nMS-GWaM either in its fully transient implementation or in a steady-state\nimplementation that represents classic mountain-wave parameterizations.\nComparisons of wave-resolving simulations (not using MS-GWaM) and\ncoarse-resolution simulations (using MS-GWaM) show that allowing for transience\nleads to a significantly more accurate forcing of the resolved mean flow. The\nmodel is able to reproduce the transient forcing of linearly generated mountain\nwaves that slowly propagate upwards, in contrast to the instantaneous\ndistribution of wave energy in classic parameterizations. At high altitudes,\nwave breaking induces a wind reversal that is captured by the transient model\nbut inhibited in steady-state simulations, due to the assumption of critical\nlevel formation. This shows that transience can have a substantial impact in\nthe interaction between mountain waves and mean flow.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
