While\ntraditional adversarial training (AT) techniques offer some resilience, they\noften focus on defending against a single type of attack, e.g., the\n$\\ell_\\infty$-norm attack, which can fail for other types. This paper\nintroduces a computationally efficient multilevel $\\ell_p$ defense, called the\nEfficient Robust Mode Connectivity (EMRC) method, which aims to enhance a deep\nlearning model's resilience against multiple $\\ell_p$-norm attacks. Similar to\nanalytical continuation approaches used in continuous optimization, the method\nblends two $p$-specific adversarially optimal models, the $\\ell_1$- and\n$\\ell_\\infty$-norm AT solutions, to provide good adversarial robustness for a\nrange of $p$. We present experiments demonstrating that our approach performs\nbetter on various attacks as compared to AT-$\\ell_\\infty$, E-AT, and MSD, for\ndatasets/architectures including: CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 / PreResNet110,\nWideResNet, ViT-Base.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
