We show many results regarding this class, among\nthem: that the class contains all zonotopes, that it is dense in dimension\n$n=2$, that any polytope can be summed with a zonotope so that the sum is in\nthis class, and that a strong form of the celebrated \"Maurey Lemma\" holds for\npolytopes in this class. We introduce for every polytope a parameter which\nmeasures how far it is from being vertex-generated, and show that when this\nparameter is small, strong covering properties hold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
