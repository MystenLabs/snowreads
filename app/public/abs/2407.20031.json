For constant-size\nchanges, it is known that constant-depth circuits or, equivalently, first-order\nupdates suffice for maintaining many important queries, among them\nreachability, tree isomorphism, and the word problem for context-free\nlanguages. In other words, these queries are in the dynamic complexity class\nDynFO. We show that most of the existing results for constant-size changes can\nbe recovered for batch changes of polylogarithmic size if one allows circuits\nof depth O(log log n) or, equivalently, first-order updates that are iterated\nO(log log n) times.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
