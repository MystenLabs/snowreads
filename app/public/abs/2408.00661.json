Arrays of such sensors would allow noise cancellation,\ndirectionality, increased sensitivity and in the quantum regime the potential\nto exploit correlation and entanglement. We use neuromorphic detection via a\nsingle event-based camera to record the motion of an array of levitated\nmicrospheres. We present a truly scalable method for arbitrary multiparticle\ncontrol by implementing real-time feedback to cool the motion of three objects\nsimultaneously, the first demonstration of neuromorphic sensing for real-time\ncontrol at the microscale.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
