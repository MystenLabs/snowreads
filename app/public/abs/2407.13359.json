Abelian models were\nstudied both with compact gauge fields and in a mixed formulation in which the\ncoupling with matter fields is in compact form while the gauge fields\nLagrangian is written in terms of non-compact gauge fields, getting quite\ndifferent results. Such a mixed formulation is not permissible for non-Abelian\ntheories, for which however there exists an entirely non-compact formulation\n(in which exact gauge invariance is enforced by help of auxiliary fields), that\nfor SU(2) was shown to yield in the scaling window a larger physical volume\nthan Wilson's one. The corresponding U(1) non-compact regularization is derived\nin the present work. In both Abelian and SU(2) cases there is only one\nauxiliary field which for large mass has a linear coupling with the other\nfields and it can be integrated out. The coupling with the auxiliary field\nmight make the inversion of the fermion matrix easier.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_TjWGZJSG3hp_2HN9GaAoTRqWFT02kEk8r1GswVuLqQ","pdfSize":"215160"}
