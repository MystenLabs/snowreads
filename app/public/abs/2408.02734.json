Utilizing R-matrix theory, we computed new K\nphotoabsorption cross-sections for {\\rm Ar}~{\\sc i}--{\\rm Ar}~{\\sc xvi}\nspecies. For each X-ray source, we estimated column densities for the {\\rm\nAr}~{\\sc i}, {\\rm Ar}~{\\sc ii}, {\\rm Ar}~{\\sc iii}, {\\rm Ar}~{\\sc xvi}, {\\rm\nAr}~{\\sc xvii} and {\\rm Ar}~{\\sc xviii} ions, which trace the neutral, warm and\nhot components of the gaseous Galactic interstellar medium. We examined their\ndistribution as a function of Galactic latitude, longitude, and distances to\nthe sources. However, no significant correlations were discerned among\ndistances, Galactic latitude, or longitude. Future X-ray observatories will\nallow us to benchmark the atomic data as the main resonance lines will be\nresolved.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
