First, the limit of this\ngenerically highly transcendental mapping is shown to exist. Second, we show\nthat the limiting map is bi-rational and describe it explicitly.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
