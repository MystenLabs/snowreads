While there have been many advancements in the\npast decade, they tend to focus on describing 'what' the threats are. What\nisn't entirely clear yet is 'how' to actually find these threats. Privacy is a\ncomplex domain. We propose to use four conceptual layers (feature, ecosystem,\nbusiness context, and environment) to capture this privacy complexity. These\nlayers can be used as a frame to structure and specify the privacy analysis\nsupport in a more tangible and actionable way, thereby improving applicability\nof the analysis process.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mrILGbq6-_QpkW9zQD_e9b4CtmgZkT1SToFsWpe8ROQ","pdfSize":"151554"}
