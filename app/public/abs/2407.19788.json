Two approaches have\nbeen applied, one based on the factorization method combined with the Field\nMethod, and a second one relying on Painlev\\'e analysis. Both procedures allow\nus to find the same exact solutions to the problem. The Lagrangian formalism\nfor this system is also derived. Moreover, some examples for particular choices\nof the time-dependent coefficients, and their corresponding general and\nparticular exact solutions are presented.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
