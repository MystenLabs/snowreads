Albeit the successes of the\nweighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) algorithm and their variants, they\nlack careful investigations about computational complexity that scales with the\nnumber of antennas and APs. We propose a generalized and reduced WMMSE\n(G-R-WMMSE) approach whose complexity is significantly lower than conventional\nWMMSE. We partition the set of beamforming coefficients into subvectors, with\neach subvector corresponding to a specific AP. Such a partitioning approach\ndecomposes the original WMMSE problem across individual APs. By leveraging the\nLagrange duality analysis, a closed-form solution can be derived for each\nsubproblem, which substantially reduces the computation burden. Additionally,\nwe present a parallel execution of the proposed G-R-WMMSE with adaptive step\nsizes, aiming at further reducing the time complexity. Numerical results\nvalidate that the proposed G-R-WMMSE schemes achieve over 99% complexity\nsavings compared to the conventional WMMSE scheme while maintaining almost the\nsame performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
