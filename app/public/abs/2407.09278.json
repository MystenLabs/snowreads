This study\nextends these findings by precisely characterizing the local distribution of\nthe spectral measure for dense small potentials, including a notable result for\nany subcritical almost Mathieu operators. Additionally, we investigate the\nstratified H\\\"older continuity of the spectral measure at subcritical energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
