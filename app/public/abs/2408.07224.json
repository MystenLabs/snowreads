As a group of\nexperimental musicians and researchers, we are enthusiastic about the creative\npotential of these tools and have sought to understand and evaluate them from\nperspectives of prompt creation, control, usability, understandability,\nexplainability of the AI process, and overall aesthetic effectiveness of the\nresults. One of the challenges we have identified that is not explicitly\naddressed by these tools is the inherent semantic gap in using text-based tools\nto describe something as abstract as music. Other gaps include explainability\nvs. useability, and user control and input vs. the human creative process. The\naim of this pictorial is to raise questions for discussion and make a few\ngeneral suggestions on the kinds of improvements we would like to see in\ngenerative AI music tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
