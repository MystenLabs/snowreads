The quotient space of equivalence\nclasses on which the signature is constant yields unparameterised path space.\nThe study of topologies on unparameterised path space, initiated in [CT24b] for\npaths of bounded variation, has practical bearing on the use of signature based\nmethods in a variety applications. This note extends the majority of results\nfrom [CT24b] to unparameterised weakly geometric rough path space. We study\nthree classes of topologies: metrisable topologies for which the quotient map\nis continuous; the quotient topology derived from the underlying path space;\nand an explicit metric between the tree-reduced representatives of each\nequivalence class. We prove that topologies of the first type (under an\nadditional assumption) are separable and Lusin, but not locally compact or\ncompletely metrisable. The quotient topology is Hausdorff but not metrisable,\nwhile the metric generating the third topology is not complete and its topology\nis not locally compact. We also show that the third topology is Polish when\n$p=1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uUWo9qaRJW_LsTFBmbE5eHVwH3Q2PIJCw_C_kurDCME","pdfSize":"215230"}
