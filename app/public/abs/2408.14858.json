Here, we\nreport the appearance of an NFL phase in a discontinuous metal-NFL-insulator\ntransition in a ``non-engineered'' Hamiltonian of the Holstein model away from\nhalf-filling. The discontinuity of the phase transition between NFL and Fermi\nliquid metal renders the ground state at the phase boundary a mixture between\nthem over an extended range like the extended criticality observed in cuprates\nand other quantum materials. The dynamical mean-field theory was employed in\ncombination with Wilson's numerical renormalization group technique. We\nidentify the origin of the NFL metal phase as the opening of a spin gap in the\nabsence of a charge gap. Also, strong lattice fluctuations emerge at the\nboundary which should enhance superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
