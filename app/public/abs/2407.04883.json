Meissner and H. Nicolai, Eur. Phys. J. C\n{\\bf 84}, 269 (2024)]. In this paper we present a detailed analysis of the\nspecific signature of such gravitino-induced events for the JUNO detector. The\nproposed method of detection relies on the `glow' produced by photons during\nthe passage of such particles through the detector liquid, which would last for\nabout a few to a few hundred microseconds depending on its velocity and the\ntrack. The cross sections for electronic excitation of the main component of\nthe scintillator liquid, namely linear alkylbenzene (LAB), by the passing\ngravitino, are evaluated using quantum-chemical methods. The results show that,\nif such particles exist, the resulting signals would lead to a unique and\nunmistakable signature, for which we present event simulations as they would be\nseen by the JUNO photomultipliers. Our analysis brings together two very\ndifferent research areas, namely fundamental particles physics and the search\nfor a fundamental theory on the one hand, and methods of advanced quantum\nchemistry on the other.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
