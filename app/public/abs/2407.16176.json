The concatenated quantum\nHamming code is one of the potential candidates that allows for constant space\noverhead and efficient decoding. We study the concatenation of surface codes\nwith quantum Hamming codes as a quantum memory, and estimate its error\nthreshold, resource overhead and decoding time. A high error threshold is\nachieved, which can in principle be pushed up to the threshold of the surface\ncode. Furthermore, the concatenated codes can suppress logical errors to a much\nlower level than the surface codes, under the assumption of comparable amount\nof resource overhead. The advantage in suppressing errors starts to show for a\nquantum memory of intermediate scale. Concatenating surface codes with quantum\nHamming codes therefore provides a promising avenue to demonstrate small-scale\nfault-tolerant quantum circuits in the near future, and also paves a way for\nlarge-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wA_saH7F-ywnqdr5HHr8a4w4PjbKlazu7SLFM-TD95s","pdfSize":"1272335"}
