We\ndescribe a language in which it admits relative quantifier elimination up to\nthe field sort. Using a new criterion which does not rely on a stationary\nindependence relation, we prove that if the field is NSOP$_1$, then the model\ncompanion is NSOP$_4$. We also prove that if the field is algebraically closed,\nthen the model companion is $c$-NIP.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
