Although the core assumption of\nmass-action models of homogeneously mixed population is often implausible, they\nare nevertheless routinely used in studying epidemics and provide useful\ninsights. Network models can account for the heterogeneous mixing of\npopulations, which is especially important for studying sexually transmitted\ndiseases. Despite the abundance of research on mass-action and network models,\nthe relationship between them is not well understood. Here, we attempt to\nbridge the gap by first identifying a spreading rule that results in an exact\nmatch between disease spreading on a fully connected network and the classic\nmass-action models. We then propose a method for mapping epidemic spread on\narbitrary networks to a form similar to that of mass-action models. We also\nprovide a theoretical justification for the procedure. Finally, we show the\nadvantages of the proposed methods using synthetic data that is based on an\nempirical network. These findings help us understand when mass-action models\nand network models are expected to provide similar results and identify reasons\nwhen they do not.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rVQn_uaBB8bQHaVveYCoBS1vQa8KdBHje1zzRwspgnw","pdfSize":"989499"}
