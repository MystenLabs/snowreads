Unfortunately, its wide bandgap typically imposes the use of\nwavelengths in the ultra-violet range, hence complicating practical\napplications. Here we probe the photocurrent response of water surrounded by\nsingle-crystal diamond surfaces engineered to host shallow nitrogen-vacancy\n(NV) centers. We observe clear signatures of diamond-induced photocurrent\ngeneration throughout the visible range and for wavelengths reaching up to 594\nnm. Experiments as a function of laser power suggest that NV centers and other\nco-existing defects - likely in the form of surface traps - contribute to\ncarrier injection, though we find that NVs dominate the system response in the\nlimit of high illumination intensities. Given our growing understanding of\nnear-surface NV centers and adjacent point defects, these results open new\nperspectives in the application of diamond-liquid interfaces to\nphoto-carrier-initiated chemical and spin processes in fluids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nPDbUYDbGfqkJtbrGEqn3tEh1p-szL9qBDUHpdw8XrE","pdfSize":"3415565"}
