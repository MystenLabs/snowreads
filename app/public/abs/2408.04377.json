Traditional methods typically focus on identifying anomalies in\nimmediate subsequent steps, often underestimating the significance of temporal\ndynamics such as delay time and horizons of anomalies, which generally require\nextensive post-analysis. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting\ntime series anomalies called Anomaly Prediction, incorporating temporal\ninformation directly into the prediction results. We propose a new dataset\nspecifically designed to evaluate this approach and conduct comprehensive\nexperiments using several state-of-the-art time series forecasting methods. The\nresults demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in providing timely and\naccurate anomaly predictions, setting a new benchmark for future research in\nthis field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W6gAH-tRY5N459gYoHEYqEQDubL1p8mEqeNbjnz0P1g","pdfSize":"1808852"}
