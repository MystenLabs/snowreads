We achieved\naccurate predictions for a range of affinity values associated with\nligand-protein interactions on out-of-sample data in a zero-shot setting. Only\nthe SMILES string of the ligand and the amino acid sequence of the protein were\nused as the model inputs. Our results demonstrate a clear improvement over\nmachine learning (ML) and free-energy perturbation (FEP+) based methods in\naccurately predicting a range of ligand-protein interaction affinities, which\ncan be leveraged to further accelerate drug discovery campaigns against\nchallenging therapeutic targets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
