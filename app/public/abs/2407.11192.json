Recently, we derived an expression\nfor the resonant conversion of axions to photons in inhomogeneous media using\nkinetic theory to derive photon transport equations. In this work, we show how\nthe same expression for the conversion probability can be obtained from the\nclassical wave equations of axion-electrodynamics by deriving an equivalent\ntransport equation along the photon worldline. This result provides further\ncorroboration of this expression for the resonant production of photons from\nlight particles, which has also recently been supported by independent\nnumerical simulations of full axion-electrodynamics. In addition, this new\napproach provides a more general expression that accounts for mixing away from\nresonance, which is integrated along the whole worldline of the photon in a way\nthat naturally incorporates a curved photon trajectory relevant to refractive\nmedia where the photon and light-particle worldlines differ.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
