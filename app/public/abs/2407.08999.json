The generic analogue gravity model involves the phonon\nfield which is coupled to the acoustic metric. We work in the special\nrelativity limit of the acoustic analogue. By assuming a time dependent\nexternal potential on the fluid system, we are able to model a source term for\nthe scalar field. Upon quantisation, phonon creation due to the source is\nstudied.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
