However,\ndemanding requirements, such as real-time operation, energy and computational\nefficiency, robustness, and reliability, make most current solutions unsuitable\nfor real-world challenges. Thus, researchers are forced to seek innovative\napproaches, such as bio-inspired solutions. Indeed, animals have the intrinsic\nability to efficiently perceive, understand, and navigate their unstructured\nsurroundings. To do so, they exploit self-motion cues, proprioception, and\nvisual flow in a cognitive process to map their environment and locate\nthemselves within it. Computational neuroscientists aim to answer ''how'' and\n''why'' such cognitive processes occur in the brain, to design novel\nneuromorphic sensors and methods that imitate biological processing. This\nsurvey aims to comprehensively review the application of brain-inspired\nstrategies to autonomous navigation, considering: neuromorphic perception and\nasynchronous event processing, energy-efficient and adaptive learning, or the\nimitation of the working principles of brain areas that play a crucial role in\nnavigation such as the hippocampus or the entorhinal cortex.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
