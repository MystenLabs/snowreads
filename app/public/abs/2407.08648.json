However,\napplying this effectiveness in healthcare is challenging due to the limited\navailability of public datasets. Federated learning presents an exciting\nsolution, allowing the use of extensive databases from hospitals and health\ncenters without centralizing sensitive data, thus maintaining privacy and\nsecurity. Yet, research in multimodal federated learning, particularly in\nscenarios with missing modalities a common issue in healthcare datasets remains\nscarce, highlighting a critical area for future exploration. Toward this, we\npropose a novel method for multimodal federated learning with missing\nmodalities. Our contribution lies in a novel cross-modal data augmentation by\nretrieval, leveraging the small publicly available dataset to fill the missing\nmodalities in the clients. Our method learns the parameters in a federated\nmanner, ensuring privacy protection and improving performance in multiple\nchallenging multimodal benchmarks in the medical domain, surpassing several\ncompetitive baselines.
