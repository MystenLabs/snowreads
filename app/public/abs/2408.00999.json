This makes it\ndifficult for them to evaluate network performance, identify outrages and\ndowntimes, or even to show the current site locations. In this paper, we\npropose the Community Cellular Networks Coverage Visualizer, a performance\ndashboard to help reduce the workload of technicians and gain trust from\nillustrating the reliability of the networks. The map displays the overall and\nin-depth performance for each current and future CCNs sites with\nprivacy-focused implementation, while the multi-series line chart emphasizes on\nproviding the capability of network overtime. Not only it will help users\nidentify locations that have stronger and reliable signals nearby, but our\napplicaiton will also be an essential tool for volunteers and engineers to\ndetermine the optimal locations to install a new site and quickly identify\npossible network failures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cNUVw5-vgVE59YNCFM8UU9HyYDvdpTu8TXgu_7THOmo","pdfSize":"4358188"}
