In this work, the rigorous atomic space\ntessellating (AST) method without any empirical parameters is introduced to\nevaluate the correlated contributions in wavelength dependent optical\nresponses. The NLO crystal CsSbF2SO4 with significant asymmetric electron\ndistribution of Sb3+ was selected as the case study. This study indicates that\nthere are significant differences in atomic and dipole moment contributions\nbetween static and dynamic second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility.\nUsing only the information obtained from NLO-active unit analysis of static SHG\nsusceptibilities to explain the NLO phenomenon in actual photoexcitation can\neven lead to qualitative errors. Among all the transitions in SHG effects, the\non-site transition of Sb has the largest component, while the O-Sb off-site\ntransition with multiple transition channels contributes the most to the\nmacroscopic SHG susceptibilities. The relevant methods have also been extended\nto linear optics and used to study first-order susceptibilities anisotropy,\nwhich is important for achieving phase matching. Sb3+ contributes significantly\nto the linear optical anisotropy with the same sign as SO42-.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
