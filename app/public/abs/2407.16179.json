After proving uniqueness and\nnon-degeneracy of the positive solution $u_\\omega$ for all $\\omega>0$, our main\nresults establish the asymptotic behavior of $u_\\omega$ in the limit $\\omega\\to\n0^+$. Three different regimes arise, termed 'subcritical', 'critical' and\n'supercritical', corresponding respectively (when $N\\ge3$) to\n$1<p<\\frac{N+2}{N-2}$, $p=\\frac{N+2}{N-2}$ and\n$\\frac{N+2}{N-2}<p<\\frac{3N+2}{N-2}$. In each case a limit equation is\nexhibited which governs, in a suitable scaling, the behavior of $u_\\omega$ in\nthe limit $\\omega\\to 0^+$. The critical case is the most challenging,\ntechnically speaking. In this case, the limit equation is the famous\nLane-Emden-Fowler equation. A substantial part of our efforts is dedicated to\nthe study of the function $\\omega\\mapsto M(\\omega)=\\int_{\\mathbb{R}^N}\nu_\\omega^2$. We find that, for small $\\omega>0$, $M(\\omega)$ is increasing if\n$1<p\\le 1+\\frac4N$ and decreasing if $1+\\frac4N< p\\le\\frac{N+2}{N-2}$. In the\nsupercritical case, the monotonicity of $M(\\omega)$ depends on the dimension,\nexcept in the regime $p\\ge 3+\\frac4N$, where $M(\\omega)$ is always decreasing\nclose to $\\omega=0$. The crucial role played by $M(\\omega)$ for the orbital\nstability of the standing wave $e^{i\\omega t}u_\\omega$, and for the uniqueness\nof normalized ground states, is discussed in the introduction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
