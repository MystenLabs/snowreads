NPS relies on defined\ncontributions from both employees and employers to build a corpus during the\nemployee's service period. Upon retirement, employees use the corpus fund to\nsustain their livelihood. A critical concern for individuals is whether the\ncorpus will grow sufficiently to be sustainable or if it will deplete, leaving\nthem financially vulnerable at an advanced age. We explore the impact of market\nrisks on the performance of the corpus resulting from the NPS. To address this,\nwe quantify market risks using Monte Carlo simulations with historical data to\nmodel their impact on NPS. We quantify the risk of pension corpus being\ninsufficient and the cost to the Government to hedge the risk arising from\nguaranteeing the pension.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
