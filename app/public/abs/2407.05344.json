That is, given $\\mathbf{y}\\in \\mathbb{R}^m$ and\n$\\psi:\\mathbb{N}\\to\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq 0}$ such that $\\sum (\\varphi(q)\\psi(q)/q)^m\n= \\infty$, we show that for almost every $\\mathbf{x} \\in\\mathbb{R}^m$ there are\ninfinitely many rational vectors $\\mathbf{a}/q$ such that $\\vert q\\mathbf{x} -\n\\mathbf{a} - \\mathbf{y}\\vert<\\psi(q)$ and such that each component of\n$\\mathbf{a}$ is coprime to $q$. This is an inhomogeneous extension of a\nhomogeneous conjecture of Sprind\\v{z}uk which was itself proved in 1990 by\nPollington and Vaughan. In fact, our main result generalizes Pollington-Vaughan\nnot only to the inhomogeneous case, but also to the setting of moving targets,\nwhere the inhomogeneous parameter $\\mathbf{y}$ is free to vary with $q$. In\ncontrast, we show by an explicit construction that the (1-dimensional)\ninhomogeneous Duffin-Schaeffer conjecture fails to hold with a moving target,\nimplying that any successful attack on the one-dimensional problem must use the\nfact that the inhomogeneous parameter is constant. We also introduce new\nquestions regarding moving targets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
