We critically evaluate these\nmethods by employing different chiral potentials at\nnext-to-next-to-leading-order -- all of which include both two- and\nthree-nucleon contributions -- and by exploring various many-body truncations.\nOur investigation yields highly precise results for pure neutron matter and\nrobust predictions for symmetric nuclear matter, particularly with soft\ninteractions. Moreover, the new calculations demonstrate that the $\\rm{\nNNLO_{sat} }(450)$ and $\\Delta \\rm{NNLO_{go}}(394)$ potentials are consistent\nwith the empirical constraints on the saturation point of symmetric nuclear\nmatter. Additionally, this benchmark study reveals that diagrammatic expansions\nwith similar architectures lead to consistent many-body correlations, even when\napplied across different methods. This consistency underscores the robustness\nof the diagrammatic approach in capturing the essential physics of nucleonic\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
