The focus is\non recent NNLO fits to high-precision LHC data at 8 and 13 TeV, including\nDrell-Yan, jet, and top-quark pair production, pursued on the way toward the\nrelease of the new generation of CTEQ-TEA general-purpose PDFs. The report also\ndiscusses advancements in statistical and numerical methods for PDF\ndetermination and uncertainty quantification, highlighting the importance of\nrobust and replicable uncertainties for high-stakes observables. Additionally,\nit covers phenomenological studies related to PDF determination, such as the\ninterplay of experimental constraints, exploration of correlations between\nhigh-$x$ nucleon sea and low-energy parity-violating measurements, fitted charm\nin the nucleon, the photon PDF in the neutron, and simultaneous SMEFT-PDF\nanalyses.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
