We determine\n$a_{34}$ by inducing oscillations in a trapped Bose-Einstein condensate of\n$^4$He$^*$ and measuring the damping rate of these oscillations due to the\npresence of $^3$He$^*$ atoms. The deduced value of $a_{34}=29\\pm3$\\,nm is in\ngood agreement with theoretical predictions. The knowledge of this scattering\nlength is important for many fundamental experiments between these helium\nisotopes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
