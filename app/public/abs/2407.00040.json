MRI is a key neuroimaging tool due to its\nease of use and cost effectiveness. This study analyzes machine learning\nmethods for MRI based biomarker selection and classification to distinguish\nbetween healthy controls and those who develop mild cognitive impairment within\nfive years. Using 3 Tesla MRI data from ADNI and OASIS 3, we applied various\nmachine learning techniques, including MATLAB Classification Learner app,\nnested cross validation, and Bayesian optimization. Data harmonization with\npolynomial regression improved performance. Consistent features identified were\nthe entorhinal, hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and lateral orbitofrontal\nregions. For balanced ADNI data, Naive Bayes with z score harmonization\nperformed best. For balanced OASIS 3, SVM with z score correction excelled. In\nimbalanced data, RUSBoost showed strong performance on ADNI and OASIS 3. Z\nscore harmonization highlighted the potential of a semi automatic pipeline for\nearly AD detection using MRI.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
