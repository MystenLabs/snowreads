Several heuristic and exact approaches exist for CNOT optimization.\nIn this paper, we investigate more complicated variations of optimal synthesis\nby allowing qubit permutations and handling layout restrictions. We encode such\nproblems into Planning, SAT, and QBF. We provide optimization for both CNOT\ngate count and circuit depth. For experimental evaluation, we consider standard\nT-gate optimized benchmarks and optimize CNOT sub-circuits. We show that\nallowing qubit permutations can further reduce up to 56% in CNOT count and 46%\nin circuit depth. In the case of optimally mapped circuits under layout\nrestrictions, we observe a reduction up to 17% CNOT count and 19% CNOT depth.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
