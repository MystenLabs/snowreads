Our focus is on investigating the\ninterpreter optimality for this language as the reference machine for the\nCoding Theorem Method (CTM). A method advanced to deal with applications to\nalgorithmic complexity different to the popular traditional lossless\ncompression approach based on the principles of algorithmic probability. The\nchosen model of computation is proven to be suitable for this task and a\ncomparison to other models and methods is performed. Our findings show that CTM\napproximations using our model do not always correlate with results from\nlower-level models of computation. This suggests some models may require a\nlarger program space to converge to Levin's universal distribution.\nFurthermore, we compare CTM with an upper bound to Kolmogorov complexity and\nfind a strong correlation, supporting CTM's validity as an approximation method\nwith finer-grade resolution of K.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
