Its phase diagram as\nfunction of normal-state resistivity features a superconducting dome with a\nmaximum critical temperature Tc well above the Tc = 1.2 K of pure aluminum.\nHere we show how the maximum Tc of this superconducting dome grows if the\nsubstrate temperature during deposition is lowered from 300 K to cooling with\nliquid nitrogen (150 K and 100 K) and liquid helium (25 K). The highest Tc we\nobserve is 3.27 K. These results highlight that granular aluminum is a model\nsystem for complex phase diagrams of superconductors and demonstrate its\npotential in the context of high kinetic inductance applications. This is\naugmented by our observation of comparably sharp superconducting transitions of\nhigh-resistivity samples grown at cryogenic temperatures and by a thickness\ndependence even for films substantially thicker than the grain size.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
