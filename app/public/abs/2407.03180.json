In this paper, we propose a multi objective combinatorial optimisation\ntechnique for large scale population synthesis. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach by generating a synthetic population for selected\nregions and validating it on contingency tables from real population data. Our\napproach supports complex hierarchical structures between individuals and\nhouseholds, is scalable to large populations and achieves minimal contigency\ntable reconstruction error. Hence, it provides a useful tool for policymakers\nand researchers for simulating the dynamics of complex populations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
