In\nthe estimation process of CATE, the unconfoundedness assumption is typically\nrequired to ensure the identifiability of the regression problems. When\nestimating CATE using high-dimensional data, there have been many variable\nselection methods and neural network approaches based on representation\nlearning, while these methods do not provide a way to verify whether the subset\nof variables after dimensionality reduction or the learned representations\nstill satisfy the unconfoundedness assumption during the estimation process,\nwhich can lead to ineffective estimates of the treatment effects. Additionally,\nthese methods typically use data from only the treatment or control group when\nestimating the regression functions for each group. This paper proposes a novel\nneural network approach named \\textbf{CrossNet} to learn a sufficient\nrepresentation for the features, based on which we then estimate the CATE,\nwhere cross indicates that in estimating the regression functions, we used data\nfrom their own group as well as cross-utilized data from another group.\nNumerical simulations and empirical results demonstrate that our method\noutperforms the competitive approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
