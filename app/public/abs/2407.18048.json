Unlike the monostatic BC (MoBC), the\nbistatic BC (BiBC) has the possibility to decrease the round-trip path loss by\nhaving the carrier emitter (CE) and the reader in different locations.\nTherefore, this work investigates the BiBC in the context of cell-free\nmultiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks by exploring the optimal\nselection of CE and reader among all access points, leveraging prior knowledge\nabout the area where the backscatter device (BD) is located. First, a maximum a\nposteriori probability (MAP) detector to decode the BD information bits is\nderived. Then, the exact probability of error for this detector is obtained. In\naddition, an algorithm to select the best CE-reader pair for serving the\nspecified area is proposed. Finally, simulation results show that the error\nperformance of the BC is improved by the proposed algorithm compared to the\nbenchmark scenario.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
