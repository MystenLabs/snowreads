In particular, the algorithms\nfor computing the $\\mathfrak{F}$-hypercenter for the following classes of\ngroups are suggested: hereditary local formations with the Shemetkov property,\nrank formations, formations of all quasinilpotent, Sylow tower, $p$-nilpotent,\nsupersoluble, $w$-supersoluble and $SC$-groups. For some of these formations\nalgorithms for the computation of the intersection of all maximal\n$\\mathfrak{F}$-subgroups are suggested.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
