Cuprous oxide ($\\text{Cu}_{2}\\text{O}$) has\nrecently emerged as a promising medium for scalable quantum technology due to\nits high-lying Rydberg excitonic states, akin to those in hydrogen atoms. To\nharness these nonlinearities for quantum applications, the confinement\ndimensions must match the Rydberg blockade size, which can reach several\nmicrons in $\\text{Cu}_{2}\\text{O}$. Using a CMOS-compatible growth technique,\nthis study demonstrates the bottom-up fabrication of site-selective arrays of\n$\\text{Cu}_{2}\\text{O}$ microparticles. We observed Rydberg excitons up to the\nprincipal quantum number $n$=5 within these $\\text{Cu}_{2}\\text{O}$ arrays on a\nquartz substrate and analyzed the spatial variation of their spectrum across\nthe array, showing robustness and reproducibility on a large chip. These\nresults lay the groundwork for the deterministic growth of\n$\\text{Cu}_{2}\\text{O}$ around photonic structures, enabling substantial\nlight-matter interaction on integrated photonic platforms and paving the way\nfor scalable, on-chip quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
