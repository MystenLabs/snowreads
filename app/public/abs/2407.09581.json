Despite numerous efforts to improve work\nenvironments, many organizations still need help with challenges primarily\nrooted in unaddressed issues or poorly understood behavioral patterns. In this\npaper, we have focused on recognizing this pattern and the dynamics of complex\nsystems in organizational behavior and studying how factors influence the\nsystems overall behavior using Wolframs Cellular Automata theory. Over the\ncycle, we observe how leadership influences team dynamics, influences the\norganization, and drives employee behavior to foster a positive environment.\n  Keywords: Cellular Automata, Employee Behavior, team dynamics, Leadership\nInfluence.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"I7bs9A40gxDqcw5LXiuk-i65TrleWegvuFVrmfmQVyk","pdfSize":"175969"}
