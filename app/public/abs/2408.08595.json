The main technique is to\nfind the saddle point through two backward stochastic differential equations\n(BSDEs) with unbounded coefficients. We further show that the robust stochastic\ncontrol problem shares the same optimal control and optimal value with the\nstochastic control problem with a mean-variance cost functional. The results\nobtained are then applied to monotone mean-variance and mean-variance portfolio\nselection problems and monotone mean-variance and mean-variance\ninvestment-reinsurance problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
