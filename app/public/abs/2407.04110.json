In this paper, we propose that the CPV of baryon\ndecays can be generated with the rescatterings of a nucleon and a pion into\nsome final states, i.e. $N\\pi\\to N\\pi$ or $N\\pi\\pi$. Benefited by the fruitful\ndata of $N\\pi$ scatterings, we can model-independently analyse the strong\nphases of $b$-baryon decays using the partial wave amplitudes of $N\\pi$\nscatterings. Avoiding the most difficult problem of non-perturbative dynamics,\nit makes a great advantage to predict the CPV of baryon decays with a\nrelatively reliable understanding of the decay dynamics. We study the processes\nof $\\Lambda_b^0\\to (p\\pi^+\\pi^-)h^-$ and $(p\\pi^0)h^-$ with $h=\\pi$ or $K$. It\nis found that the global CPV of the above processes in the invariant mass\nregions of $N\\pi$ scatterings are at the order of several percent. More\nimportantly, the local CPV in some regions of the Dalitz plots can reach the\norder of $10\\%$, or be even larger. Considering the predicted results and the\nexperimental data samples, we strong suggest to measure the CPV of\n$\\Lambda_b^0\\to (p\\pi^+\\pi^-)K^-$, which has a large possibility to achieve the\nfirst observation of CPV in the baryon system.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
