This task has been exceedingly challenging, primarily due to\nthe considerable computational time required, which stems from the substantial\nscale difference between galaxies (~ 0.1 Mpc) and star clusters (~ pc). Yet,\nthis significant scale separation means that particles within star clusters\nperceive those outside the star cluster in a semi-stationary state. By\nleveraging this aspect, we integrate the direct N-body code (Nbody6++GPU) into\nthe cosmological (magneto-)hydrodynamic code (Enzo) through the utilization of\nthe semi-stationary background acceleration approximation. We solve the\ndynamics of particles within star clusters using the direct N-body solver with\nregularization for few-body interactions, while evolving particles outside --\ndark matter, gas, and stars -- using the particle-mesh gravity solver and\nhydrodynamic methods. We demonstrate that Enzo-N successfully simulates the\nco-evolution of star clusters and their parent galaxies, capturing phenomena\nsuch as core collapse of the star cluster and tidal stripping due to galactic\ntides. This comprehensive framework opens up new possibilities for studying the\nevolution of star clusters within galaxies, offering insights that were\npreviously inaccessible.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
