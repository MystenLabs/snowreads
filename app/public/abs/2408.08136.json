We prove that the random field associated to a marginal in\nhorospherical coordinates has asymptotically arbitrarily small fluctuations for\nlarge enough interactions, uniformly in the size of the boxes. This can be\nviewed as a strong version of spontaneous breaking of the Lorentz boost\nsymmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
