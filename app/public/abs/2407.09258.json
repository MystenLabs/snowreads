We continue the study of $T$-closed subsets of a continuum $X$. We\nprove that for a continuum $X$, the statements: $\\Delta_X$ is a nonblock\nsubcontinuum of $X^2$, $\\Delta_X$ is a shore subcontinuum of $X^2$ and\n$\\Delta_X$ is not a strong centre of $X^2$ are equivalent, this result answers\nin the negative Questions 35 and 36 and Question 38 ($i\\in\\{4,5\\}$) of the\npaper ``Diagonals on the edge of the square of a continuum, by A. Illanes, V.\nMart\\'inez-de-la-Vega, J. M. Mart\\'inez-Montejano and D. Michalik''. We also\ninclude an example, giving a negative answer to Question 1.2 of the paper\n``Concerning when $F_1(X)$ is a continuum of colocal connectedness in\nhyperspaces and symmetric products, Colloquium Math., 160 (2020), 297-307'', by\nV. Mart\\'inez-de-la-Vega, J. M. Mart\\'inez-Montejano. We characterised the\n$T$-closed subcontinua of the square of the pseudo-arc. We prove that the\n$T$-closed sets of the product of two continua is compact if and only if such\nproduct is locally connected. We show that for a chainable continuum $X$,\n$\\Delta_X$ is a $T$-closed subcontinuum of $X^2$ if and only if $X$ is an arc.\nWe prove that if $X$ is a continuum with the property of Kelley, then the\nfollowing are equivalent: $\\Delta_X$ is a $T$-closed subcontinuum of $X^2$,\n$X^2\\setminus\\Delta_X$ is strongly continuumwise connected, $\\Delta_X$ is a\nsubcontinuum of colocal connectedness, and $X^2\\setminus\\Delta_X$ is\ncontinuumwise connected. We give models for the families of $T$-closed sets and\n$T$-closed subcontinua of various families of continua.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V1N8UOO4p4_lFvR_DXG9oH9wDv7pkZRm4KY4hArjOY4","pdfSize":"292996"}
