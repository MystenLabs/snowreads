This paper introduces the Interaction-driven Game\nEngine (IGE) powered by LLM, which allows everyone to develop a custom game\nusing natural language through Human-LLM interaction. To enable an LLM to\nfunction as an IGE, we instruct it to perform the following processes in each\nturn: (1) $P_{script}$ : configure the game script segment based on the user's\ninput; (2) $P_{code}$ : generate the corresponding code snippet based on the\ngame script segment; (3) $P_{utter}$ : interact with the user, including\nguidance and feedback. We propose a data synthesis pipeline based on the LLM to\ngenerate game script-code pairs and interactions from a few manually crafted\nseed data. We propose a three-stage progressive training strategy to transfer\nthe dialogue-based LLM to our IGE smoothly. We construct an IGE for poker games\nas a case study and comprehensively evaluate it from two perspectives:\ninteraction quality and code correctness.
