Employing the\nQualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA) method, it examines the responses of\nthese nations to Generative AI in higher education settings, scrutinizing the\ndiversity in their approaches within this group. While all four countries\nexhibit a positive attitude toward Generative AI in higher education, Japan and\nthe USA prioritize a human-centered approach and provide direct guidance in\nteaching and learning. In contrast, China and Mongolia prioritize national\nsecurity concerns, with their guidelines focusing more on the societal level\nrather than being specifically tailored to education. Additionally, despite all\nfour countries emphasizing diversity, equity, and inclusion, they consistently\nfail to clearly discuss or implement measures to address the digital divide. By\noffering a comprehensive comparative analysis of attitudes and policies\nregarding Generative AI in higher education across these countries, this study\nenriches existing literature and provides policymakers with a global\nperspective, ensuring that policies in this domain promote inclusion rather\nthan exclusion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DYAX4jMpwaoeStJcLyBmepq4s1UlH6UliDlxmQMLvOo","pdfSize":"290982"}
