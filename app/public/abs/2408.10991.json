Each cryomodule consists of eight TESLA-shaped\nsuperconducting elliptical cavities equipped with two High Order Mode (HOM)\ncoupler ports. Measurement of the HOM spectrum is part of the incoming quality\ncontrol of cavities at room temperature and the final qualification cold test\nof cryomodules at the Cryomodule Test Facility (CMTF). In this paper we\ndescribe the procedure for measuring the HOM spectrum along with further data\nprocessing. Finally, we present accumulated statistics of individual HOM\nfrequencies and quality factors related to various cavity vendors and discuss\nthe possible contribution of HOMs to heat loads and beam dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dZnGnU2FKLSZoQTDnzzkXkOR2xOG13vwpNi2EvFRh1s","pdfSize":"736668"}
