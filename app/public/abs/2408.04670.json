Nojiri and S. D. Odintsov,\n2017, European Physical Journal C, 77, pp.1-8. The holographic dark fluid that\nis mostly used for late-time acceleration has been implemented to reconstruct\ntowards realisation of cosmological bounce. We first used the most generalized\nNojiri-Odintsov(NO) cutoff to implement the holographic dark fluid.\nAccordingly, we have reconstructed this dark fluid via some solutions of scale\nfactors. With those solutions, we have explored the evolution of different\ncosmological parameters. We have examined the effects of each reconstructed\nparameter in the context of the realization of the cosmic bounce. Next, we use\nthe analytical inferences of the scalar spectral index, tensor-to-scalar ratio,\nand slow-roll characteristics of the model to study a bounce inflationary\nscenario. Since inflation is usually associated with the existence of scalar\nfields, we looked at a possible relationship between NO generalized holographic\ndark energy and scalar field models. Plotting the evolution of the potential\nthat results from the scalar fields against time. Finally, we investigated the\nGSL of thermodynamics in the pre-and post-bounce scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zYhoDJOUVJpLBEJ5RftZ3WvgaPCS9-PmOvs1nGfHiag","pdfSize":"602075"}
