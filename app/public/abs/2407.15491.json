Among\nresolution-determining factors, the amplification stage plays a crucial role\nand optimisations of detector geometry are pursued to maximise spatial\nresolution. To compare MicroPattern Gaseous Detector (MPGD) technologies,\nfocused low-energy X-ray beams at the SOLEIL synchrotron facility were used to\nrecord and extract point spread function widths with Micromegas and GEM\ndetectors. Point spread function width of $\\approx$108\\,\\microns for Micromegas\nand $\\approx$127\\,\\microns for GEM foils were extracted. The scanning of the\nbeam with different intensities, energies and across the detector active region\ncan be used to quantify resolution-limiting factors and improve imaging\ndetectors using MPGD amplification stages.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
