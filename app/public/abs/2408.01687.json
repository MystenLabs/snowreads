This paper presents a comprehensive\nanalysis of the OpenAI Developer Forum, focusing on (1) popularity trends and\nuser engagement patterns, and (2) a taxonomy of challenges and concerns faced\nby developers. We first employ a quantitative analysis of the metadata from\n29,576 forum topics, investigating temporal trends in topic creation, the\npopularity of topics across different categories, and user contributions at\nvarious trust levels. We then qualitatively analyze content from 9,301 recently\nactive topics on developer concerns. From a sample of 886 topics, we construct\na taxonomy of concerns in the OpenAI Developer Forum. Our findings uncover\ncritical concerns raised by developers in creating AI-powered applications and\noffer targeted recommendations to address them. This work not only advances\nAI-assisted software engineering but also empowers developer communities to\nshape the responsible evolution and integration of AI technology in society.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
