We introduce AudienceView, an online tool to help journalists\ncategorize and interpret this feedback by leveraging large language models\n(LLMs). AudienceView identifies themes and topics, connects them back to\nspecific comments, provides ways to visualize the sentiment and distribution of\nthe comments, and helps users develop ideas for subsequent reporting projects.\nWe consider how such tools can be useful in a journalist's workflow, and\nemphasize the importance of contextual awareness and human judgment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
