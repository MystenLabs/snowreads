We\nderive the meson-baryon interaction potentials using the vector meson exchange\nmechanism within the extended local hidden gauge formalism. The scattering\namplitudes are computed by solving the coupled-channel Bethe-Salpeter equation,\nrevealing several bound systems. By analyzing the poles of these amplitudes in\nthe complex plane, we determine the masses and widths of these bound states.\nAdditionally, we evaluate the couplings and compositeness of different channels\nwithin each bound system to assess their molecular characteristics. Our\npredictions include four $\\Omega_{ccc}$-like states, four $\\Omega_{bbb}$-like\nstates, fourteen $\\Omega_{bcc}$-like states, and ten $\\Omega_{bbc}$-like\nstates, which could be targets for future experimental investigations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
