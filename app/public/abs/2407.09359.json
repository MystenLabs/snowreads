However, existing strategies have limitations in the coverage and\ncontrollability of anomaly synthesis, particularly for weak defects that are\nvery similar to normal regions. In this paper, we propose Global and Local\nAnomaly co-Synthesis Strategy (GLASS), a novel unified framework designed to\nsynthesize a broader coverage of anomalies under the manifold and hypersphere\ndistribution constraints of Global Anomaly Synthesis (GAS) at the feature level\nand Local Anomaly Synthesis (LAS) at the image level. Our method synthesizes\nnear-in-distribution anomalies in a controllable way using Gaussian noise\nguided by gradient ascent and truncated projection. GLASS achieves\nstate-of-the-art results on the MVTec AD (detection AUROC of 99.9\\%), VisA, and\nMPDD datasets and excels in weak defect detection. The effectiveness and\nefficiency have been further validated in industrial applications for woven\nfabric defect detection.
