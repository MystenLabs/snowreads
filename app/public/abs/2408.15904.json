Initially,\nemploying a tailored martingale decomposition specifically designed for the\nstatistical challenge at hand, we establish convergence rates surpassing those\nfound in existing literature. Subsequently, we refine the attained rate for the\ncase where $H < \\frac{1}{2}$ by incorporating bounds on the density of the\nsemi-group. This enhancement outperforms previous rates. Finally, our results\nweaken the usual convexity assumptions on the drift component, allowing to\nconsider settings where strong convexity only holds outside a compact set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NCnNxc890deg0E7jGfLBIKXP_T1G95a9irwnzDj7n9M","pdfSize":"346834"}
