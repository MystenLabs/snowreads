At multiple stages of this process, performance and internal\nmodel data can be logged and made available. However, due to the sheer\ncomplexity and scale of this data and process, model developers often resort to\nevaluating their model performance based on abstract metrics like accuracy and\nloss. We argue that a structured analysis of data along the model's\narchitecture and at multiple abstraction levels can considerably streamline the\ndebugging process. Such a systematic analysis can further connect the\ndeveloper's design choices to their impacts on the model behavior, facilitating\nthe understanding, diagnosis, and refinement of deep learning models. Hence, in\nthis paper, we (1) contribute a conceptual framework structuring the data space\nof deep learning experiments. Our framework, grounded in literature analysis\nand requirements interviews, captures design dimensions and proposes mechanisms\nto make this data explorable and tractable. To operationalize our framework in\na ready-to-use application, we (2) present the iNNspector system. iNNspector\nenables tracking of deep learning experiments and provides interactive\nvisualizations of the data on all levels of abstraction from multiple models to\nindividual neurons. Finally, we (3) evaluate our approach with three real-world\nuse-cases and a user study with deep learning developers and data analysts,\nproving its effectiveness and usability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
