From this foundation, we derive a\ntransformation equation that describes the relative rate of TCL with respect to\nGeocentric Coordinate Time (TCG). This equation serves as the cornerstone for\nconstructing a relativistic TCL--TCG time conversion algorithm. Using this\nalgorithm, we can compute both secular and periodic variations in the rate of\nan atomic clock placed on the Moon, relative to an identical clock on Earth.\nThe algorithm accounts for various effects, including time dilation caused by\nthe Moon's orbital motion around Earth, gravitational potentials of both Earth\nand Moon, and direct and indirect time dilation effects due to tidal\nperturbations caused by the Sun. Our approach provides exquisite details of the\nTCL--TCG transformation, accurate to a precision of 1 nanosecond. To validate\nour methodology for lunar coordinate time, we compare it with the formalism of\nlocal inertial frames applied to the Earth-Moon system and confirm their\nequivalence.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
