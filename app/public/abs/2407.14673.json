In\nthis context, we show that such NP interactions also affect lifetime difference\nin neutral meson-antimeson mixing. We consider general dimension-six effective\nquark interactions involving a pair of DM particles and calculate their\ncontributions to lifetime difference in beauty and charm meson systems. We use\nthe latest data on mixing observables to constrain the relevant effective\noperators. We find that lifetime differences provide novel and complementary\nflavor constraints compared to those obtained from heavy meson decays.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"alWIV6wRc62qbaGyJca-q4l-0E15wQc1ZQgvbBu0cHo","pdfSize":"1518612"}
