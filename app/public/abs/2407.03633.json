Specifically, we investigate the effect of\nangular momentum on the interquark distance, free energy, binding energy,\nentropy, entropic force, and internal energy of heavy quarkonium from the\nthermodynamic relationship. Our findings indicate that the angular momentum\nreduces the maximum value of interquark distance, suggesting that it promotes\nthe dissociation of quarkonium. Additionally, we observe that the angular\nmomentum suppresses free energy. From the results of binding energy, the\nangular momentum favors the melting of meson into a free quark and antiquark.\nMoreover, the results show that angular momentum increases the entropy and\nentropic force, thus accelerates the dissociation of quarkonium. The angular\nmomentum increases the internal energy at large interquark distance. Finally,\nwe find that the angular momentum has a more pronounced effect on quarkonium\nwhen the axis of quark pair $Q\\overline{Q}$ is transverse to the direction of\nangular momentum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
