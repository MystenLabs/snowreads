Nevertheless, a significant obstacle\nfor quantum EP-based devices is their limited success rate in generating highly\nentangled states, stemming from an inherent trade-off relation between\nentanglement degree and success rate in all lossy EP systems. Our study\ndemonstrates that this limitation can be effectively overcome by harnessing a\ntruly parity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$)-symmetric system, which possesses balanced\ngain and loss, thereby enabling maximal entanglement with rapid speed, high\nsuccess rates, and greater resilience to non-resonant errors. We believe this\napproach can efficiently prepare multi-qubit entanglement and use not only\nbipartite but also tripartite entanglement as examples to illustrate, even when\nthe precise gain-loss balance is not strictly maintained. Our analytical\nfindings are in excellent agreement with numerical simulations, confirming the\npotential of $\\mathcal{PT}$-devices as a powerful tool for creating and\nengineering diverse quantum resources for applications in quantum information\ntechnology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
