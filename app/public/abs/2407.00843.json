Their\nperformance derives from aggregating predictions of multiple decision trees,\nwhich are renowned for their interpretability properties. However, tree\nensemble methods do not reliably exhibit interpretable output. Our work aims to\nextract an optimized list of rules from a trained tree ensemble, providing the\nuser with a condensed, interpretable model that retains most of the predictive\npower of the full model. Our approach consists of solving a clean and neat set\npartitioning problem formulated through Integer Programming. The proposed\nmethod works with either tabular or time series data, for both classification\nand regression tasks, and does not require parameter tuning under the most\ncommon setting. Through rigorous computational experiments, we offer\nstatistically significant evidence that our method is competitive with other\nrule extraction methods and effectively handles time series.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
