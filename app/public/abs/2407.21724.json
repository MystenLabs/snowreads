This\npaper introduces an efficient boundary element method specifically tailored for\nmetasurfaces, leveraging the Poggio-Miller-Chang-Harrington-Wu-Tsai (PMCHWT)\nformulation. Our method combines the Multilevel Fast Multipole Algorithm\n(MLFMA) with a representation of surface current density unknowns using static\nmodes, a set of entire domain basis functions dependent only on object shape.\nThe reduction in the number of unknowns by the static mode expansion (SME),\ncombined with the \\(\\mathcal{O}(N \\log N)\\) complexity of MLFMA matrix-vector\nproducts, significantly reduces CPU time and memory requirements for solving\nscattering problems from metasurfaces compared to classical MLFMA with RWG\nbasis functions. The MLFMA-SME method offers substantial benefits for the\nanalysis and optimization of metalenses and metasurfaces.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
