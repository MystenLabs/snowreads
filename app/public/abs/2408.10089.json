Frachon, P. Hansbo, E. Nilsson, S. Zahedi, SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 46 (2024)]\nfor the Darcy interface problem to unfitted outer boundaries. We impose\nessential boundary conditions on unfitted meshes with a stabilized Lagrange\nmultiplier method. The stabilization term for the Lagrange multiplier is\nimportant for stability but it may perturb the approximate solution at the\nboundary. We study different stabilization terms from cut finite element\ndiscretizations of surface partial differential equations and trace finite\nelement methods. To reduce the perturbation we use a Lagrange multiplier space\nof higher polynomial degree compared to previous work on unfitted\ndiscretizations. We propose a symmetric method that results in 1) optimal rates\nof convergence for the approximate velocity and pressure; 2) well-posed linear\nsystems where the condition number of the system matrix scales as for fitted\nfinite element discretizations; 3) optimal approximation of the divergence with\npointwise divergence-free approximations of solenoidal velocity fields. The\nthree properties are proven to hold for the lowest order discretization and\nnumerical experiments indicate that these properties continue to hold also when\nhigher order elements are used.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
