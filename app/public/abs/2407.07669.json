Furthermore, the proximity of the entities, such\nas edge servers and User Plane Functions (UPFs) that provide these resources is\nof paramount importance. However, with the ever-increasing demand from these\napplications, operators often find their resources insufficient to accommodate\nall requests. Some of these demands can be forwarded to external entities, not\nowned by the operator. This introduces a cost, reducing the operator's profit.\nHence, to maximize operator's profit, it is important to place the demands\noptimally in internal or external edge nodes. To this end, we formulate a\nconstrained optimization problem that captures this objective and the\ninter-play between different parameters, which turns out to be NP-hard.\nTherefore, we resort to proposing a heuristic algorithm which ranks the demands\naccording to their value to the operator and amount of resources they need.\nResults show that our approach outperforms the benchmark algorithms, deviating\nfrom the optimal solution by only ~3% on average.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
