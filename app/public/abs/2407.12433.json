During content discovery, Bitswap reveals the interest of\na peer in content to all neighbors, enabling the tracking of user interests. In\nour paper, we propose a modification of the Bitswap protocol, which enables\nsource obfuscation using proxies for content discovery. The proxies are\nselected via a random-walk. Enabling content discovery through proxies\nintroduces plausible deniability. We evaluate the protocol modification with a\nsimulation. The protocol modification demonstrates enhanced privacy, while\nmaintaining acceptable performance levels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
