This convergence enables\nmultifaceted analysis of complex transaction patterns, improving detection\naccuracy and resilience against complex fraudulent activities. A key novelty of\nthis paper is the use of multilayer perceptrons (MLPS) to estimate node\nsimilarity, effectively filtering out neighborhood noise that can lead to false\npositives. This intelligent purification mechanism ensures that only the most\nrelevant information is considered, thereby improving the model's understanding\nof the network structure. Feature weakening often plagues graph-based models\ndue to the dilution of key signals. In order to further address the challenge\nof feature weakening, GNN-CL adopts reinforcement learning strategies. By\ndynamically adjusting the weights assigned to central nodes, it reinforces the\nimportance of these influential entities to retain important clues of fraud\neven in less informative data. Experimental evaluations on Yelp datasets show\nthat the results highlight the superior performance of GNN-CL compared to\nexisting methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
