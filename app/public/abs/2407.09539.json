Inkjet printers produce probabilistic droplet\npatterns that appear to be distinct for each printer model and as such we\ninvestigate the utilization of droplet characteristics including frequency\ndomain features extracted from printed document scans for the classification of\nthe underlying printer model. We collect and publish a dataset of high\nresolution document scans and show that our extracted features are informative\nenough to enable a neural network to distinguish not only the printer\nmanufacturer, but also individual printer models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
