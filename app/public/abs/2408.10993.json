The goal is to generate an image that can be matched\nwith two identities thereby undermining the security of a face recognition\nsystem. To deal with this problem, several morph attack detection techniques\nhave been developed. But these methods do not extract any information about the\nunderlying bonafides used to create them. Demorphing addresses this limitation.\nHowever, current demorphing techniques are mostly reference-based, i.e, they\nneed an image of one of the identities to recover the other. In this work, we\ntreat demorphing as an ill-posed decomposition problem. We propose a novel\nmethod that is reference-free and recovers the bonafides with high accuracy.\nOur method decomposes the morph into several identity-preserving feature\ncomponents. A merger network then weighs and combines these components to\nrecover the bonafides. Our method is observed to reconstruct high-quality\nbonafides in terms of definition and fidelity. Experiments on the\nCASIA-WebFace, SMDD and AMSL datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
