Addressing these two tasks with separate\nnetworks is no longer the mainstream direction in developing computer vision\nalgorithms, particularly with the recent advances in large vision models and\nembodied artificial intelligence. The trend is shifting towards combining them\nwithin a joint learning framework, especially emphasizing feature sharing\nbetween the two tasks. The major contributions of this study lie in\ncomprehensively tightening the coupling between semantic segmentation and\nstereo matching. Specifically, this study introduces three novelties: (1) a\ntightly coupled, gated feature fusion strategy, (2) a hierarchical deep\nsupervision strategy, and (3) a coupling tightening loss function. The combined\nuse of these technical contributions results in TiCoSS, a state-of-the-art\njoint learning framework that simultaneously tackles semantic segmentation and\nstereo matching. Through extensive experiments on the KITTI and vKITTI2\ndatasets, along with qualitative and quantitative analyses, we validate the\neffectiveness of our developed strategies and loss function, and demonstrate\nits superior performance compared to prior arts, with a notable increase in\nmIoU by over 9%.
