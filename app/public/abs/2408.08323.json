Utilizing wearable sensors, including smart eyeglasses, and a\nmodified Cozie app, environmental and physiological data were collected, along\nwith pre-screening, onboarding, and recurring surveys. Peripheral cues\nfacilitated participant engagement with micro-EMA surveys, minimizing\ndisruption over a 5-day collection period. The dataset offers insights into\nurban comfort dynamics, highlighting the interplay between environmental\nconditions, physiological responses, and subjective perceptions. Researchers\ncan utilize this dataset to deepen their understanding of indoor environmental\nquality and inform the design of healthier built environments. Access to this\ndataset can advance indoor environmental research and contribute to the\ncreation of more comfortable and sustainable indoor spaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
