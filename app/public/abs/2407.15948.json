This allows to\nstudy conformal boundary conditions, and we investigate the three boundary\nuniversality classes of the 3d Ising CFT. These include the ordinary,\nextraordinary, and special boundary conditions. We identify the qualitative\nsignatures of boundary conformal invariance, and in the cases of ordinary and\nextraordinary boundary conditions, obtain numerical estimates for the spectrum\nof low-lying boundary primaries. For the special boundary conditions, we are\nonly able to see their qualitative features, while reliable estimates of the\nscaling dimensions of boundary primaries are left for the future work.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
