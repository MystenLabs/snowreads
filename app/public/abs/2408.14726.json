A robot's exploration behavior can be inherently\naffected by the performance of its Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)\nsubsystem, although SLAM and exploration are generally studied separately. In\nthis paper, we formulate exploration as an active mapping problem and extend it\nwith semantic information. We introduce a novel active metric-semantic SLAM\napproach, leveraging recent research advances in information theory and\nspectral graph theory: we combine semantic mutual information and the\nconnectivity metrics of the underlying pose graph of the SLAM subsystem. We use\nthe resulting utility function to evaluate different trajectories to select the\nmost favorable strategy during exploration. Exploration and SLAM metrics are\nanalyzed in experiments. Running our algorithm on the Habitat dataset, we show\nthat, while maintaining efficiency close to the state-of-the-art exploration\nmethods, our approach effectively increases the performance of metric-semantic\nSLAM with a 21% reduction in average map error and a 9% improvement in average\nsemantic classification accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
