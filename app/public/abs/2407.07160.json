We prove by linking the QFT\nproperty of micro-causality to the wavepacket behavior that the tunneling\ndynamics is fully causal, precluding instantaneous or superluminal effects that\nhave recently been reported in the literature. We illustrate these results by\nperforming numerical computations for an electron tunneling through a potential\nbarrier for standard tunneling as well for Klein tunneling. In all cases (Klein\ntunneling \\ or regular tunneling across a standard or a supercritical\npotential) the transmitted wavepacket remains in the causal envelope of the\npropagator, even when its average position lies ahead of the average position\nof the corresponding freely propagated wavepacket.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
