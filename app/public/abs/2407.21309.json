In the first paper of this series, we presented\nfive morphological and kinematic criteria that aid in asserting the binary\nnature of a protoplanetary disc. In this work we study the kinematic signatures\nof circumbinary discs in the residuals of their velocity maps. We show that\nDoppler-flips, spiral arms, eccentric gas motion, fast flows inside of the\ncavity, and vortex-like kinematic signatures are commonly observed. Unlike in\nthe planetary mass companion case, Doppler-flips in circumbinary discs are not\nnecessarily centred on a companion, and can extend towards the cavity edge. We\nthen compare the kinematic signatures in our simulations with observations and\nsee similarities to the Doppler-flip signal in HD 100546 and the vortex-like\nkinematic signatures in HD 142527. Our analysis also reveals kinematic evidence\nfor binarity in several protoplantary disks typically regarded as circumstellar\nrather than circumbinary, including AB Aurigae and HD 100546.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
