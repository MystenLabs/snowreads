Learning a visualization requires mastering\nits visual grammar and decoding information presented through visual marks,\ngraphical encodings, and spatial configurations. To help people learn network\nvisualization designs and extract meaningful information, we introduce the\nconcept of interactive pattern explanation that allows viewers to select an\narbitrary area in a visualization, then automatically mines the underlying data\npatterns, and explains both visual and data patterns present in the viewer's\nselection. In a qualitative and a quantitative user study with a total of 32\nparticipants, we compare interactive pattern explanations to textual-only and\nvisual-only (cheatsheets) explanations. Our results show that interactive\nexplanations increase learning of i) unfamiliar visualizations, ii) patterns in\nnetwork science, and iii) the respective network terminology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fa_esLRdbjMxeE0PsifeOsS0TYyGRyv54FGu0Dm8ro0","pdfSize":"5804711","txDigest":"8nmw3Lm5LnyG2RNeLeYyhqZViZLQcvWmVGcRMqa8d1uf","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
