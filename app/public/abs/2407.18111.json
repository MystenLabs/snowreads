Balas' local refinement is used\nto improve feasible solutions. Heuristic approaches are combined with Mixed\nInteger Programming and Constraint Programming approaches. We discuss our\nresults via computational experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
