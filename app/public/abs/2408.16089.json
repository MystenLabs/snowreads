In order to do this, we\naggregated datasets of Reddit comments labeled with the Myers-Briggs Type\nIndicator (MBTI) of the author and built different supervised classifiers based\non BERT to try to predict the personality of an author given a text. Despite\nexperiencing issues with the unfiltered character of the dataset, we can\nobserve potential in the classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
