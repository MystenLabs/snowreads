Existing solutions for the design space exploration (DSE)\nadopt either heuristic methods, lacking essential information for further\noptimization potential, or predictive models, missing sufficient generalization\ndue to the time-consuming nature of HLS and the exponential growth of the\ndesign space. To address these challenges, we propose Deep Inverse Design for\nHLS (DID4HLS), a novel approach that integrates graph neural networks and\ngenerative models. DID4HLS iteratively optimizes hardware designs aimed at\ncompute-intensive algorithms by learning conditional distributions of design\nfeatures from post-HLS data. Compared to four state-of-the-art DSE baselines,\nour method achieved an average improvement of 42.5% on average distance to\nreference set (ADRS) compared to the best-performing baselines across six\nbenchmarks, while demonstrating high robustness and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ftcNUhZY4duNYfXXGmjkrQV73XdlCHtLZmOVInyCSAk","pdfSize":"3413871"}
