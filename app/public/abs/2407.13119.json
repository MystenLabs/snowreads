This is based on a general\ncategorical result that expands on methods of J.Y. Guo, which proves that\ncertain orbital rings are prime or domains. We apply this method to prove that\nif $A = kQ/I$ is a Koszul twisted Calabi-Yau algebra of dimension 2, such that\n$Q$ is connected with every vertex having outdegree at least 2, then $A$ is a\nprime piecewise domain. In particular, the preprojective algebra of a connected\nquiver whose underlying graph has minimum degree at least 2 is a prime\npiecewise domain.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
