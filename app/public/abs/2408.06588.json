To further increase the capacity for rapidly increasing\ncapacity demand of wireless communications, it is potential to use the twist\nwave, which has the orbital angular momentum (OAM). In this paper, we discuss\nthe OAM based wireless communications in the aspect of orthogonality, degree of\nfreedom (DoF), and capacity, where both the transmitter and the receiver use\nuniform circular array (UCA) antennas. In particular, we compare OAM based\nwireless communications with multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) based\nwireless communications in terms of DoF and capacity. Numerical results are\npresented to validate and evaluate that the DoF of OAM based wireless\ncommunications is greater than or equal to that of correlated MIMO based\nwireless communications when the transmitter and the receiver antennas are\naligned well. The OAM based wireless communications can achieve larger capacity\nthan the correlated MIMO in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) region under\nline-of-sight scenario.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
