This study investigated the effect of strand molecular weight\non the fracture characteristics of the networks made from star-branched\nprepolymers with various node functionalities $3 \\le f \\le 8$ and conversion\nratios $0.6 \\le {\\phi}_c \\le 0.95$ via molecular simulations with phantom\nchains. The networks were created via end-linking reactions of star polymers\nwith the arm molecular weight $N_a$ = 2, 5, and 10, simulated by a Brownian\ndynamics scheme. The cycle rank of the percolated network ${\\xi}$ was entirely\nconsistent with the mean-field theory, implying that the reaction occurred\nindependently and the network connectivity was statistically fair. Afterward,\nthe networks were alternatively subjected to energy minimization and uniaxial\nstretch until the break. From the stress-strain curves recorded during the\nstretch, the stretch and stress at the break, ${\\lambda}_b$ and ${\\sigma}_b$,\nand work for fracture $W_b$ were obtained. For these values, the following\nrelations were found: ${\\lambda}_b \\sim N_a^{(1/2)} {\\xi}^{(-1/3)}$,\n${\\sigma}_b \\sim {\\nu}_{br} N_a^{(4/3)} {\\xi}^{(2/3)}$, and $W_b \\sim\n{\\nu}_{br} N_a^{(4/3)} {\\xi}^{(2/3)}$, where ${\\nu}_{br}$ is the branch point\ndensity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
