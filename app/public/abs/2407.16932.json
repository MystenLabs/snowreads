Then we give a description of\nrepresentations of $T$ in terms of representations of $L(T)$ with certain\nadditional data. Similarly, if $(T, \\sigma)$ is an infinitesimal $s$-manifold\nsuch that $L(T)$ is semisimple, then any representation of $(T, \\sigma)$ comes\nfrom a representation of $L(T)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
