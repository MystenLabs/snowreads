However, the growing demand for consultations exceeds\nthe availability of ophthalmologists. By leveraging large pre-trained language\nmodels, we can design effective dialogues for specific scenarios, aiding in\nconsultations. Traditional fine-tuning strategies for question-answering tasks\nare impractical due to increasing model size and often ignoring patient-doctor\nrole function during consultations. In this paper, we propose EyeDoctor, an\nophthalmic medical questioning large language model that enhances accuracy\nthrough doctor-patient role perception guided and an augmented knowledge base\nwith external disease information. Experimental results show EyeDoctor achieves\nhigher question-answering precision in ophthalmology consultations. Notably,\nEyeDoctor demonstrated a 7.25% improvement in Rouge-1 scores and a 10.16%\nimprovement in F1 scores on multi-round datasets compared to second best model\nChatGPT, highlighting the importance of doctor-patient role differentiation and\ndynamic knowledge base expansion for intelligent medical consultations.
