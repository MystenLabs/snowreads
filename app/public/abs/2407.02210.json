We explore\nthe non-linearity of the BAO in different environments using the density-split\nstatistics and compare them to the case of the conventional two-point\ncorrelation function (2PCF). We detect density-dependent shifts for the\nposition of the BAO with respect to its linear version using halos from N-body\nsimulations. Around low/high-densities, the scale of the BAO expands/contracts\ndue to non-linear peculiar velocities. As the simulation evolves from redshift\n1 to 0, the difference in the magnitude of the shifts between high- and\nlow-density regions increases from the sub-percent to the percent level. In\ncontrast, the scale of the BAO does not evolve in the total 2PCF in the same\nredshift range. The width of the BAO around high density regions increases as\nthe universe evolves, similar to the known broadening of the BAO in the 2PCF\ndue to non-linear evolution. In contrast, the width is smaller and stable for\nlow density regions. We discuss possible implications for the reconstructions\nof the BAO in light of our results.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
