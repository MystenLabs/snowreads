We find water, methane, and CO absorption features in both\ncomponents, including the 3.3 $\\mu$m methane absorption feature and a tentative\ndetection of small grain ($<$ 1$\\mu$m) silicate absorption at $>$8.5 $\\mu$m in\nWISE 1049A. Both components vary significantly ($>$1$\\%$), with WISE 1049B\ndisplaying larger variations than WISE 1049A. Using K-means clustering, we find\nthree main transition points in wavelength for both components of the binary:\n1) change in behavior at $\\sim$2.3 $\\mu$m coincident with a CO absorption\nbandhead, 2) change in behavior at 4.2 $\\mu$m, close to the CO fundamental band\nat $\\lambda >$ 4.4 $\\mu$m, and 3) change in behavior at 8.3-8.5 $\\mu$m,\npotentially corresponding to silicate absorption. We interpret the lightcurves\nobserved with both NIRSpec and MIRI as likely stemming from 1) a deep pressure\nlevel driving the double-peaked variability seen in WISE 1049B at wavelengths\n$<$2.3 $\\mu$m and $>$8.5 $\\mu$m, 2) an intermediate pressure level shaping the\nlightcurve morphology between 2.3 and 4.2 $\\mu$m, and 3) a higher-altitude\npressure level producing single-peaked and plateaued lightcurve behavior\nbetween 4.2 and 8.5 $\\mu$m.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hZBHCVRo_7LGxvCAWIuJwklR5Cn5YcqCBx5WjLfJrJE","pdfSize":"63491637"}
