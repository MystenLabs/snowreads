However, deriving\nthis expression from first principles involves solving a non-linear\ndifferential equation using the small angle approximation, which may appear\nobscure to a student in the early stages of learning calculus. Therefore, we\npropose an alternative approach to the derivation of this formula employing\ngeometry, algebra, and physical intuition. Our method follows the ideas of the\nfathers of calculus, replacing the circular path of the pendulum with a\nsuccessive collection of infinitesimal inclined planes and summing the travel\ntimes of each plane in the limit as the number of planes becomes very large.\nNotably, the evaluation of this limit relies solely on geometry, making it\naccessible to any student, even those not yet familiar with calculus\ntechniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"igJjrlvtV6FKpIQJKHBazNucEa3PwAX3Wr57iGex5uk","pdfSize":"687453"}
