Here\nwe present a formalism to incorporate a geometric phase into quench dynamics of\nmixed quantum states, a process named the Uhlmann quench, based on the Uhlmann\nparallel transport. To overcome the incompatibility between the Uhlmann\nparallel-transport condition and Hamiltonian dynamics, we formulate the\nevolution of purification of the density matrix in a form which not only\nrespects the dynamics according to the density matrix but also follows the\nUhlmann parallel-transport condition to generate a geometric phase after a\nquantum quench. For cyclic processes exemplified by a spin-1/2 system,\ngeometric DQPTs (GDQPTs) can emerge with both singular behavior in the dynamic\nanalogue of the free energy and jumps of the geometric phase. Moreover, the\nUhlmann phase reflecting the holonomy is generated at the end of each cycle.\nThe Uhlmann quench thus paves the way for investigating the interplay between\nquantum dynamics and geometric processes in mixed states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
