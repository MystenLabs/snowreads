To address the above problem, we\npresent a novel task-oriented and semantics-aware communication framework for\naugmented reality (TSAR) to enhance communication efficiency and effectiveness\nsignificantly. We first present an analysis of the traditional wireless AR\npoint cloud communication framework, followed by a detailed summary of our\nproposed semantic information extraction within the end-to-end communication.\nThen, we detail the components of the TSAR framework, incorporating semantics\nextraction with deep learning, task-oriented base knowledge selection, and\navatar pose recovery. Through rigorous experimentation, we demonstrate that our\nproposed TSAR framework considerably outperforms traditional point cloud\ncommunication framework, reducing wireless AR application transmission latency\nby 95.6% and improving communication effectiveness in geometry and color\naspects by up to 82.4% and 20.4%, respectively.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ik1uBZqbYoPEr_AMZDjGx6444NPaeVqROf1w9jvxYKQ","pdfSize":"2419322","txDigest":"5GjMELgsuNLy5mSg4T5UwsDsbw4yLLJsA338ZLwwUy67","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
