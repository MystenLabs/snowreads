The main difficulties to obtain rate efficiency in\nestimating these quantities arise from the superposition of the diffusion\ncomponent with jumps of infinite variation. Extending the approach proposed in\nMies (2020), we address the joint estimation of the volatility, scaling and\njump activity parameters from high-frequency observations of the process and\nprove that the proposed estimators are rate optimal up to a logarithmic factor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
