We argue that such problems require human-AI cooperation\nand that the current state of the art in generative AI is unable to play the\nrole of a reliable partner due to a multitude of shortcomings, including\ninability to keep track of a complex solution artifact (e.g., a software\nprogram), limited support for versatile human preference expression and lack of\nadapting to human preference in an interactive setting. To address these\nchallenges, we propose HAI-Co2, a novel human-AI co-construction framework. We\nformalize HAI-Co2 and discuss the difficult open research problems that it\nfaces. Finally, we present a case study of HAI-Co2 and demonstrate its efficacy\ncompared to monolithic generative AI models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cL9SipLMPw66taRMNwV829ZQAK_hg5A6_ZoH4nljJJA","pdfSize":"665695"}
