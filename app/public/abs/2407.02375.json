This in\nparticular recovers the pipe dream and slide polynomial expansions. We also\nshow that slide polynomials satisfy an analogue of the divided difference\nformalisms for Schubert polynomials and forest polynomials, which gives a\nsimple method for extracting the coefficients of slide polynomials in the slide\npolynomial decomposition of an arbitrary polynomial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
