However, one important question is what it is happening\nwith conlang in the academic world. This paper aims to have an overall\nunderstanding of the literature on conlang research. With this we aim to give a\nrealistic picture of the field in present days. We have implemented a\ncomputational linguistic approach, combining bibliometrics and network analysis\nto examine all publications available in the Scopus database. Analysing over\n2300 academic publications since 1927 until 2022, we have found that Esperanto\nis by far the most documented conlang. Three main authors have contributed to\nthis: Garv\\'ia R., Fiedler S., and Blanke D. The 1970s and 1980s have been the\ndecades where the foundations of current research have been built. In terms of\nmethodologies, language learning and experimental linguistics are the ones\ncontributing to most to the preferred approaches of study in the field. We\npresent the results and discuss our limitations and future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EK6khIDJLy0i5ddLUjZpKp4lnqJmGMi5DEfWRkm_I2M","pdfSize":"271965","objectId":"0x2e1350b699b964e83b0f02e35b7b66ae3fb9fd4010d1115709a59a601fef3577","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
