Specifically, to\nstandardize the physical spacing of imaging voxels in heterogeneous inference\nsettings, images are typically resampled before being processed by deep\nlearning models. However, down-sampling results in loss of information, whereas\nupsampling introduces redundant information leading to inefficient resource\nutilization. To overcome these issues, we propose to condition segmentation\nmodels on the voxel spacing using hypernetworks. Our approach allows processing\nimages at their native resolutions or at resolutions adjusted to the hardware\nand time constraints at inference time. Our experiments across multiple\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach achieves competitive performance\ncompared to resolution-specific models, while offering greater flexibility for\nthe end user. This also simplifies model development, deployment and\nmaintenance.
