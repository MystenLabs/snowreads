However, the extreme sensitivity near\nEPs poses significant challenges due to fabrication errors and system noises,\nwhich degrade sensing performance. To address this, we introduce a novel\napproach leveraging the polarization degrees of freedom to achieve controllable\nEPs. By expressing tunable polarization as equivalent gain, we establish a\ndirect relation between the polarization and the phase of the coupled system,\nand achieve the polarization-controlled singularity even post-fabrication. The\npolarization angle can be utilized as a sensing index, which enables indirect\nand accurate measurement near the EPs. The theoretical approach is\nexperimentally validated using a general design of THz non-Hermitian\nmetasurface sensors. Our results indicate that this method enhances robustness\nand sensitivity, opening new avenues for practical applications in\nultra-sensitive sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
