Large Language Model (LLM) can offer new\npossibilities to assist students' oral presentations with real-time feedback.\nThis paper investigates how ChatGPT can be effectively integrated into EFL oral\npresentation practice to provide personalized feedback. We introduce a novel\nlearning platform, CHOP (ChatGPT-based interactive platform for oral\npresentation practice), and evaluate its effectiveness with 13 EFL students. By\ncollecting student-ChatGPT interaction data and expert assessments of the\nfeedback quality, we identify the platform's strengths and weaknesses. We also\nanalyze learners' perceptions and key design factors. Based on these insights,\nwe suggest further development opportunities and design improvements for the\neducation community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
