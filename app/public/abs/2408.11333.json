We prove the existence of some\nuniversal constructions in this and some similar categories. By analogy with\nholomorphically finitely generated algebras of Pirkovskii, a finitely\n$C^\\infty$-generated algebra is defined as a quotient of a finite-rank algebra\nof `free $C^\\infty$-functions'. The latter notion was introduced in a previous\narticle of the author. We prove in a full generality a structure result for\n`free $C^\\infty$-functions', which was announced in that article and proved in\ndimension at most $2$.\n  The central result asserts that the projective tensor product of a finite\ntuple of finitely $C^\\infty$-generated algebras is finitely\n$C^\\infty$-generated. In particular, this makes it natural to consider\n$C^\\infty$-finitely generated topological Hopf algebras. Furthermore, a\nconstruction called `envelope' provides a functor from the category of affine\nreal Hopf algebras to the category of $C^\\infty$-finitely generated Hopf\nalgebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
