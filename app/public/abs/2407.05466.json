In\nthis paper, we study the impact of using TensorFlow and PyTorch bindings in C#,\nRust, Python and JavaScript on the software quality in terms of correctness\n(training and test accuracy) and time cost (training and inference time) when\ntraining and performing inference on five widely used deep learning models. Our\nexperiments show that a model can be trained in one binding and used for\ninference in another binding for the same framework without losing accuracy.\nOur study is the first to show that using a non-default binding can help\nimprove machine learning software quality from the time cost perspective\ncompared to the default Python binding while still achieving the same level of\ncorrectness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
