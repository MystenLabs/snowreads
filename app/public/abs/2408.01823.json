Topics include characterizing\nuncertainties using information theory, UQ in linear and nonlinear dynamical\nsystems, UQ via data assimilation, the role of uncertainty in diagnostics, and\nUQ in advancing efficient modeling. The surprisingly simple examples in each\ntopic explain why and how UQ is essential. Both Matlab and Python codes are\nmade available for these simple examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BnFrRzy-oWKZO-lG9tyHVEkMF-HDP0_2pCHVEFJrn74","pdfSize":"4127544","txDigest":"BSDqKik2HfVdC2R9RFaxnwTy53eRvn4yRLFCKW8w7wy9","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
