However, the production of high-quality sketches\nremains a formidable task, primarily due to the challenges and flaws associated\nwith three key factors: (1) the scarcity of artist-drawn data, (2) the\nconstraints imposed by limited style types, and (3) the deficiencies of\nprocessing input information in existing models. To address these difficulties,\nwe propose a lightweight end-to-end synthesis model that efficiently converts\nimages to corresponding multi-stylized sketches, obviating the necessity for\nany supplementary inputs (\\eg, 3D geometry). In this study, we overcome the\nissue of data insufficiency by incorporating semi-supervised learning into the\ntraining process. Additionally, we employ a feature extraction module and style\nembeddings to proficiently steer the generative transformer during the\niterative prediction of masked image tokens, thus achieving a continuous\nstylized output that retains facial features accurately in sketches. The\nextensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms\nprevious algorithms across multiple benchmarks, exhibiting a discernible\ndisparity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
