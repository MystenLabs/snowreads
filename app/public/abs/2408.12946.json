It\ncan be applied recursively. The class of Reed-Muller (RM) codes is a particular\nexample. Also, a special class of generalized concatenated codes (GCC) can be\ndescribed as recursive Plotkin construction. Exploiting a property of the code\nwords constructed by the recursive Plotkin construction, we present novel\nsoft-decision decoders. These are based on the decoding of hidden code words\nwhich are inherent contained in the constructed code words and can be uncovered\nby adding particular parts of the overall code word. The main idea is to use\nmore than one decoding variant where each variant starts with the decoding of a\ndifferent hidden code word. The final decoding decision selects the best of the\ndecisions of the used variants. The more variants are used the closer the\nperformance gets to the maximum-likelihood (ML) decoding performance. This is\nverified by an ML-bound for the cases where the ML performance is not known.\nThe decoding algorithms use only additions, comparisons, and sign operations.\nFurther, due to the recursive structure, only relatively short codes have to be\ndecoded, thus, the decoding complexity is very low. In addition, we introduce\ntwo novel classes of half-rate codes based on recursive Plotkin constructions\nwith RM codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
