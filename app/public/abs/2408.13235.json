After the introduction of Section 1, Section 2 examines a\nnumber of commonly used estimators for p > n. Section 3 introduces prediction\nwith p > n. Section 4 introduces notational changes to facilitate discussion of\noverfitting and Section 5 illustrates the phenomenon of double descent. We\nconclude with some final comments.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
