In particular, this\nclass of theories admits the electromagnetic waves propagating at non-unit\nspeed, which in turn allows to relax the constraints on Horndeski theories\nfollowing from multi-messenger speed test. In this work we prove that both\ngravitational wave and its electromagnetic counterpart propagate at the same,\nalthough non-unit, speed above an arbitrarily time-dependent, spherically\nsymmetric background within the theories in question. Hence, we support the\nstatement that several subclasses of Horndeski theories are not necessarily\nruled out after the GW170817 event provided the photon-Galileon couplings are\nallowed. We also formulate the set stability conditions for an arbitraty\nsolution within the discussed theoretical setting.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
