Current methodologies often suffer from an exponential\nscaling of the sampling cost or require auxiliary qubits and deep quantum\ncircuits. To address these limitations, we propose an efficient auxiliary-free\nreplica shadow (AFRS) framework, which leverages the power of the joint\nentangling operation on a few input replicas while integrating the mindset of\nshadow estimation. We rigorously prove that AFRS can offer exponential\nimprovements in estimation accuracy compared with the conventional shadow\nmethod, and facilitate the simultaneous estimation of various nonlinear\nproperties, unlike the destructive swap test. Additionally, we introduce an\nadvanced local-AFRS variant tailored to estimating local observables with even\nconstant-depth local quantum circuits, which significantly simplifies the\nexperimental realization compared with the general swap test. Our work paves\nthe way for the application of AFRS on near-term quantum hardware, opening new\navenues for efficient and practical quantum measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
