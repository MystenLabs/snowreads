In this paper, we discover all Mordell\nequations of the form $y^2 = x^3 + k$, where $k \\in \\mathbb Z$, with exactly\n$|k|$ integral solutions. We also discover explicit bounds for Mordell\nequations, parameterized families of elliptic curves and twists on elliptic\ncurves. Using the connection between Mordell curves and binary cubic forms, we\nimprove the lower bound for the number of integral solutions of a Mordell curve\nby looking at a pair of curves with unusually high rank.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5r1ECqvgI4w4Qooriz5aANb2juftZU8e18xZ7uxKxW4","pdfSize":"256151"}
