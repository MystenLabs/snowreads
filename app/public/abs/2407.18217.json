An\nexplicit representation for its distribution is obtained in terms of Bell\npolynomials. We then extend it to a compound Poisson process and time\nfractional compound Poisson process (TFCPP). It is shown that the\none-dimensional distributions of the TFCPP exhibit over-dispersion property,\nare not infinitely divisible and possess the long-range dependence property.\nAlso, their moments and factorial moments are derived. Finally, the fractional\ndifferential equation associated with the TFCPP is also obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6s3EwtOaULSSIf597wnOe6KeFxbRPB0B4ZPk_5LAqlc","pdfSize":"271729"}
