These are the first individual stellar metallicities in\nAnd~XVI (95 stars). Our And~XXVIII sample (191 stars) is a factor of $\\sim15$\nincrease over literature metallicities. For And~XVI, we measure $\\langle\n\\mbox{[Fe/H]}\\rangle = -2.17^{+0.05}_{-0.05}$,\n$\\sigma_{\\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.33^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, and $\\nabla_{\\mbox{[Fe/H]}} =\n-0.23\\pm0.15$ dex $R_e^{-1}$. We find that And XVI is more metal-rich than MW\nUFDs of similar luminosity, which may be a result of its unusually extended\nstar formation history. For And XXVIII, we measure $\\langle\n\\mbox{[Fe/H]}\\rangle = -1.95^{+0.04}_{-0.04}$,\n$\\sigma_{\\mbox{[Fe/H]}}=0.34^{+0.07}_{-0.07}$, and $\\nabla_{\\mbox{[Fe/H]}} =\n-0.46 \\pm 0.10$~dex~$R_e^{-1}$, placing it on the dwarf galaxy mass-metallicity\nrelation. Neither galaxy has a metallicity distribution function with an abrupt\nmetal-rich truncation, suggesting that star formation fell off gradually. The\nstellar metallicity gradient measurements are among the first for faint ($L\n\\lesssim 10^6~L_{\\odot}$) galaxies outside the Milky Way halo. Both galaxies'\ngradients are consistent with predictions from the FIRE simulations, where an\nage-gradient strength relationship is the observational consequence of stellar\nfeedback that produces dark matter cores. We include a catalog for community\nspectroscopic follow-up, including 19 extremely metal poor ($\\mbox{[Fe/H]} <\n-3.0$) star candidates, which make up 7% of And~XVI's MDF and 6% of\nAnd~XXVIII's.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
