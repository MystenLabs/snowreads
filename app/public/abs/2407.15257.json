We compared student's performance on both numeric and\nconceptual problems administered on a multi-attempt, asynchronous quiz to their\nperformance on isomorphic problems administered on a subsequent single-attempt,\nsynchronous exam. We computed the phi coefficient and the McNemar's test\nstatistic for the correlation matrix between paired problems on both\nassessments as a function of the number of attempts considered on the quiz. We\nfound that for the conceptual problems, a multi-attempt quiz with five allowed\nattempts could potentially replace similar problems on a single-attempt exam,\nwhile there was a much weaker association for the numerical questions beyond\ntwo quiz attempts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
