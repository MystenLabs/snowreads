This approach is a viable alternative\nto conventional methods, such as system-size expansion, allowing for the\ndetermination of analytical expressions for the mean and variance in an exact\nform and thus valid for any system size. In particular, this approach was used\nto study Bernoulli-Laplace and Ehrenfest urns, for which analytic expressions\ndescribing their evolution were found. This approach and the results will\ncontribute to a more comprehensive understanding of stochastic systems and\nstatistical physics for small-sized systems, where the thermodynamic limit\ncannot be assumed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sH1qQyZ_LMOm3GtvOTKUxw_vWEQMqYVEajkViDF3pWA","pdfSize":"426020"}
