We find a decoupled modified Teukolsky equation that rules\nthe gravitational perturbations and that separates into an angular and a radial\nequation. The angular equation leads to a deformation of the spin-weighted\nspheroidal harmonics, while the radial equation takes the same form as in Kerr\nexcept for a modification of the angular separation constants. We provide a\ndetailed analysis of the corrections to these angular separation constants and\nfind analytic results for axisymmetric modes as well as in the eikonal limit.\nAs an application, we reproduce recent results that show that extremal Kerr\nblack holes in higher-derivative gravity become singular under certain\ndeformations and extend them by including parity-breaking corrections, which we\nshow lead to the same effect. Finally, we obtain constraints on the form of the\nfull modified Teukolsky radial equation by demanding that it has the right\nnear-horizon limit. These results serve as an stepping stone towards the study\nof quasinormal modes of near-extremal black holes in higher-derivative\nextensions of GR.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
