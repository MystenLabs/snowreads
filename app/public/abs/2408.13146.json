In an online setting,\nwhere new data samples arrive sequentially, it is crucial to continuously test\nwhether these samples originate from a different distribution. Ideally, the\ndetection algorithm should be distribution-free to ensure robustness in\nreal-world applications. In this paper, we reproduce a recently proposed online\nchange-point detection algorithm based on an efficient kernel-based scan\nB-statistic, and compare its performance with two commonly used parametric\nstatistics. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the scan B-statistic\nconsistently delivers superior performance. In more challenging scenarios,\nparametric methods may fail to detect changes, whereas the scan B-statistic\nsuccessfully identifies them in a timely manner. Additionally, the use of\nsubsampling techniques offers a modest improvement to the original algorithm.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
