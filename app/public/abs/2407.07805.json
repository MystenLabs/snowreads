Similarly, the\ncorresponding labels are linearly combined by a fixed ratio $\\lambda$ by l. The\nobjects in two images may be overlapped during the mixing process, so some\nsemantic information is corrupted in the mixed samples. In this case, the mixed\nimage does not match the mixed label information. Besides, such a label may\nmislead the deep learning model training, which results in poor performance. To\nsolve this problem, we proposed a novel approach named SUMix to learn the\nmixing ratio as well as the uncertainty for the mixed samples during the\ntraining process. First, we design a learnable similarity function to compute\nan accurate mix ratio. Second, an approach is investigated as a regularized\nterm to model the uncertainty of the mixed samples. We conduct experiments on\nfive image benchmarks, and extensive experimental results imply that our method\nis capable of improving the performance of classifiers with different\ncutting-based mixup approaches.
