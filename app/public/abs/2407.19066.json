However, the nuclear-to-cell volume ratio (N/C ratio)\nremains nearly constant. In this paper, we build on existing deterministic\nmodels of N/C ratio homeostasis and develop a simplified gene translation model\nto study the effect of stochasticity on the N/C ratio homeostasis. We solve the\ncorresponding chemical master equation and obtain the mean and variance of the\nN/C ratio. We also use a Taylor expansion approximation to study the effects of\nthe system size on the fluctuations of the N/C ratio. We then combine the\ntranslation model with a cell division model to study the effects of extrinsic\nnoises from cell division on the N/C ratio. Our model demonstrates that the N/C\nratio homeostasis is maintained when the stochasticity in cell growth is taken\ninto account, that the N/C ratio is largely determined by the gene fraction of\nnuclear proteins, and that the fluctuations in the N/C ratio diminish as the\nsystem size increases.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eGmm0grNhhYKRiSUbSS3nzhQsci_6HJ-GBHKhU6BPOk","pdfSize":"2005527"}
