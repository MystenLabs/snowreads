This asymptotics creates a time scale separation which results in the\nformation of a condensate of all particles, which then evolves according to a\ncontinuous-time Markov chain with jump rates depending in a nontrivial way on\nboth the underlying mutation dynamics and the relative speed of growth to\ninfinity of the killing rate between neighbouring sites. We prove the\nconvergence of the particle system and completely describe the dynamics of the\ncondensate in the case where the number of particles is kept fixed, and\npartially in the case when the number of particles goes to infinity together\nwith (but slower than) the minimal killing rate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
