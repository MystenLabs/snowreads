Short-period contact systems, such as CC Com\nare particularly important for binary evolution. Close binary systems,\nespecially those with multiple system members, have significant period\nvariations, angular momentum loss mechanisms predominance, and pre-merger\nstellar evolution, making them valuable astrophysical laboratories. In this\nstudy, observations of CC Com, previously reported as a binary system, and new\nobservations from the T\\\"UB\\.ITAK National Observatory (TUG) and the\nspace-based telescope TESS have revealed that there is a third object with a\nperiod of about eight years and a fourth object with a period of about a\ncentury orbiting the binary system. From simultaneous analysis of all available\nlight curves and radial velocities, the sensitive orbital and physical\nparameters of the system components are derived. The orbital parameters of the\ncomponents are P$_{\\rm A}=0.221\\pm0$ days, P$_{\\rm B}=7.9\\pm0.1$ yr, P$_{\\rm\nC}=98\\pm5$ yr, $e_3$ = 0.06, $e_4$ = 0.44 and the physical parameters as\nM$_{\\rm A1}=0.712\\pm0.009$ M$_{\\odot}$, M$_{\\rm A2}=0.372\\pm0.005$ M$_{\\odot}$,\n$m_{B;i'=90^\\circ}$=0.074 M$_{\\odot}$, $m_{C;i'=90^\\circ}$=0.18 M$_{\\odot}$,\nR$_{\\rm A1}=0.693\\pm0.006$ R$_{\\odot}$, R$_{\\rm A2}=0.514\\pm0.005$ R$_{\\odot}$,\nL$_{\\rm A1}$ = 0.103 L$_\\odot$, L$_{\\rm A2}$ = 0.081 L$_\\odot$. Finally, the\nevolutionary status of the multiple system CC Com and its component stars is\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
