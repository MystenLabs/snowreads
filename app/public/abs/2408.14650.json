The\ntotal photon yield strongly depends on the pulse area and has an upper bound at\nhigh intensities. Resonant scattering yields with attosecond pulses can be an\norder of magnitude higher than those far from resonances. Interference between\nresonant fluorescence and elastic scattering channels depends on the pulse area\nand initial state. Our results suggest that resonant x-ray scattering can be\nexploited for high-resolution, site-specific imaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
