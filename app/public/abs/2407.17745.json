However, current KGA models fall short in\nachieving a ``complete'' knowledge graph alignment. Existing models primarily\nemphasize the linkage of cross-graph entities but overlook aligning relations\nacross KGs, thereby providing only a partial solution to KGA. The semantic\ncorrelations embedded in relations are largely overlooked, potentially\nrestricting a comprehensive understanding of cross-KG signals. In this paper,\nwe propose to conceptualize relation alignment as an independent task and\nconduct KGA by decomposing it into two distinct but highly correlated\nsub-tasks: entity alignment and relation alignment. To capture the mutually\nreinforcing correlations between these objectives, we propose a novel\nExpectation-Maximization-based model, EREM, which iteratively optimizes both\nsub-tasks. Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that EREM\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in both entity alignment and\nrelation alignment tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
