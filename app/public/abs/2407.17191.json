In practice, the GRAVITY fringe tracker still\nobserves high frequency OPD components that limit the exposure time, its\nprecision and limiting magnitude. Perturbations seem to come from mechanical\nvibrations in the train of mirrors. As part of the GRAVITY+ efforts,\naccelerometers were added to all the mirrors of the coud\\'e train to compensate\nin real-time the optical path using the main delay lines. We show their\neffectiveness on vibrations peaks between 40 and 200Hz and outline prospects\nfor the upgrade of the deformable mirrors and the beam-compressor differential\ndelay lines.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
