The model describes interactions among\ndifferent populations of human cells, motion of immune cells stimulated by\ncytokines, consumption of myelin sheath due to anomalously activated\nlymphocytes and its restoration by oligodendrocytes. Successively, we introduce\na therapy term representing injection of low-dose IL-2 interleukine. A natural\nstep is then to study the system, investigating the formation of spatial\npatterns by means of a Turing instability analysis of the problem. In\nparticular, we get spatial patterns oscillating in time that may reproduce\nbrain lesions characteristic of the early stage of the pathology, in both\nnon-treatment and treatment scenarios.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
