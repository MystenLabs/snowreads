In this paper, we consider a semilinear reaction diffusion system of\nSIR model which involves the birth rate and the death rate. We first prove the\nnon-negativity and global existence theorem to ensure that the model makes\nsense. We prove the uniform convergence of the infection-free solution and\nstudy an example that separable solutions can be computed. We also focus on the\nsteady state solution, which we prove the non-uniqueness of the solution and\ninvestigate the regularity of the general solution. In the end we also\nintroduce an interesting phenomenon, which is called the Turing instability\ncaused by the diffusion in the model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
