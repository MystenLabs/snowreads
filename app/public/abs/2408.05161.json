In this paper, we introduce a variation of optimal\ntransportation problem which we call quadratic transportation problem that\nconsiders a total cost $\\iint c d\\pi d\\pi$ which is quadratic in $\\pi$. We\ncompare this problem with other variations of optimal transportation problem,\nand prove some properties of the solutions to the problem. Then, we introduce\nsquared cost function, which let us consider the total cost $\\iint c d\\pi d\\pi$\nas a positive semi-definite bilinear operator on probability measures, and show\nKantorovich duality formula when we have a squared cost function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
