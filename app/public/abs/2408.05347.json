This\napproach is particularly valuable for early case detection in epidemic\nmanagement, especially when early-stage data are scarce. This research\nintroduces a novel hybrid method for anomaly detection that combines distance\nand density measures, enhancing its applicability across various infectious\ndiseases. Our method is especially relevant in pandemic situations, as\ndemonstrated during the COVID-19 crisis, where traditional supervised\nclassification methods fall short due to limited data. The efficacy of our\nmethod is evaluated using COVID-19 chest X-ray data, where it significantly\noutperforms established unsupervised techniques. It achieves an average AUC of\n77.43%, surpassing the AUC of Isolation Forest at 73.66% and KNN at 52.93%.\nThese results highlight the potential of our hybrid anomaly detection method to\nimprove early detection capabilities in diverse epidemic scenarios, thereby\nfacilitating more effective and timely responses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
