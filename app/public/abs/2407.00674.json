Inspired by the emergent following effect in real-life crowd\nscenarios, in this work, we develop a method for implicitly grouping moving\nagents. We achieve this by analyzing local information around each agent and\nrotating its preferred velocity accordingly. Each agent could automatically\nform an implicit group with its neighboring agents that have similar\ndirections. In contrast to an explicit group, there are no strict boundaries\nfor an implicit group. If an agent's direction deviates from its group as a\nresult of positional changes, it will autonomously exit the group or join\nanother implicitly formed neighboring group. This implicit grouping is\nautonomously emergent among agents rather than deliberately controlled by the\nalgorithm. The proposed method is compared with many crowd simulation models,\nand the experimental results indicate that our approach achieves the lowest\ncongestion levels in some classic scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate that\nadjusting the preferred velocity of agents can actually reduce the\ndissimilarity between their actual velocity and the original preferred\nvelocity.
