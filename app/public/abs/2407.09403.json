{"id":"2407.09403","title":"A short proof of the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture","authors":"Guantao Chen, Yanli Hao, Xingxing Yu, Wenan Zang","authorsParsed":[["Chen","Guantao",""],["Hao","Yanli",""],["Yu","Xingxing",""],["Zang","Wenan",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 12 Jul 2024 16:30:03 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-15","timestamp":1720801803000,"abstract":"  For a multigraph $G$, $\\chi'(G)$ denotes the chromatic index of $G$,\n$\\Delta(G)$ the maximum degree of $G$, and $\\Gamma(G) = \\max\\left\\{\\left\\lceil\n\\frac{2|E(H)|}{|V(H)|-1} \\right\\rceil: H \\subseteq G \\text{ and } |V(H)| \\text{\nodd}\\right\\}$. As a generalization of Vizing's classical coloring result for\nsimple graphs, the Goldberg-Seymour conjecture, posed in the 1970s, states that\n$\\chi'(G)=\\max\\{\\Delta(G), \\Gamma(G)\\}$ or $\\chi'(G)=\\max\\{\\Delta(G) + 1,\n\\Gamma(G)\\}$. Hochbaum, Nishizeki, and Shmoys further conjectured in 1986 that\nsuch a coloring can be found in polynomial time. A long proof of the\nGoldberg-Seymour conjecture was announced in 2019 by Chen, Jing, and Zang, and\none case in that proof was eliminated recently by Jing (but the proof is still\nlong); and neither proof has been verified. In this paper, we give a proof of\nthe Goldberg-Seymour conjecture that is significantly shorter and confirm the\nHochbaum-Nishizeki-Shmoys conjecture by providing an $O(|V|^5|E|^3)$ time\nalgorithm for finding a $\\max\\{\\Delta(G) + 1, \\Gamma(G)\\}$-edge-coloring of\n$G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
