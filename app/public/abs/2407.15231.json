We show that the Landauer limit is satisfied in this\ncase, which implies that the information erasure at the cosmological apparent\nhorizon happens in the most efficient way possible. We also show that our\nresults hold for extensions of the standard entropy formulations. We also\ndiscuss about the connections this result provides between information loss at\nblack holes and that at the cosmological apparent horizon, and we term the\n\"Cosmological Information Paradox\". This is the first work which directly\nprovides a correspondence between information dynamics and expanding cosmic\nhorizons, and we discuss several interesting implications of this result.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
