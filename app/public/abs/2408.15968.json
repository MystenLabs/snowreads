The key object is the maximal weak subslope of an arbitrary causal\nfunction, which plays the role of the (Lorentzian) modulus of its differential.\nIt is shown to satisfy certain chain and Leibniz rules, certify a locality\nproperty, and be compatible with its smooth analog. In this setup, we propose a\nquadraticity condition termed infinitesimal Minkowskianity, which singles out\ngenuinely Lorentzian structures among Lorentz-Finsler spacetimes. Moreover, we\nestablish a comparison theorem for a nonlinear yet elliptic $p$-d'Alembertian\nin a weak form under the timelike measure contraction property. As a particular\ncase, this extends Eschenburg's classical estimate past the timelike cut locus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
