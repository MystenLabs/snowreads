However, the existing road-level traffic prediction has\nmainly studied how significantly micro traffic events propagate to the adjacent\nroads in terms of short-term prediction. On the other hand, recent attempts\nhave been made to incorporate regional knowledge such as POIs, road\ncharacteristics, and real-time social events to help traffic prediction.\nHowever, these studies lack in understandings of different modalities of\nroad-level and region-level spatio-temporal correlations and how to combine\nsuch knowledge. This paper proposes a novel method that embeds real-time\nregion-level knowledge using POIs, satellite images, and real-time LTE access\ntraces via a regional spatio-temporal module that consists of dynamic\nconvolution and temporal attention, and conducts bipartite spatial transform\nattention to convert into road-level knowledge. Then the model ingests this\nembedded knowledge into a road-level attention-based prediction model.\nExperimental results on real-world road traffic prediction show that our model\noutperforms the baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aGdrKl_Hwixc7mnNikFHOsMvNR6rr3ZSDxLwyymDCFs","pdfSize":"4688145"}
