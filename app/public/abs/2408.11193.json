I show that existing tests can be arbitrarily oversized in this\nsetup. Then, I develop a valid procedure that is robust to weak instrument\nasymptotics and heterogeneous treatment effects. The procedure targets a JIVE\nestimand, calculates an LM statistic, and compares it with critical values from\na normal distribution. To establish this procedure's validity, this paper shows\nthat the LM statistic is asymptotically normal and a leave-three-out variance\nestimator is unbiased and consistent. The power of the LM test is also close to\na power envelope in an empirical application.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
