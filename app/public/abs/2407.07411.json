We\nachieve 246 teraFLOPS of sustained performance, an improvement of more than\n2.5x compared to the performance achieved on the DGX-A100 architectures and an\n80x acceleration compared to an OpenMP parallelized implementation on a\n128-core CPU architecture. Our work highlights the ability of tensor network\nalgorithms to efficiently utilize high-performance GPU hardware and shows that\nthe combination of tensor networks with modern large-scale GPU accelerators can\npave the way towards solving some of the most challenging problems in quantum\nchemistry and beyond.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
