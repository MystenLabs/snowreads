Recent work has explored using Large Language Models\n(LLMs) for ATP action selection, but these methods can be resource-intensive.\nThis study introduces FEAS, an agent that enhances the COPRA in-context\nlearning framework within Lean. FEAS refines prompt generation, response\nparsing, and incorporates domain-specific heuristics for functional equations.\nIt introduces FunEq, a curated dataset of functional equation problems with\nvarying difficulty. FEAS outperforms baselines on FunEq, particularly with the\nintegration of domain-specific heuristics. The results demonstrate FEAS's\neffectiveness in generating and formalizing high-level proof strategies into\nLean proofs, showcasing the potential of tailored approaches for specific ATP\nchallenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"StZOjUMLbzog2iAuGyZlfKXAJXBXq3KT888fstercQY","pdfSize":"870092"}
