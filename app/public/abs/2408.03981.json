To formulate this\nextension, we define a `higher spin' action of the stable orthogonal group $O$\non appropriate spacetime manifolds, which extends both the reflection\ninvolution and spin flip. On the algebraic side, we define a `higher\nstatistics' action of $O$ on the universal target for invertible field\ntheories, $I\\mathbb{Z}$, which extends both complex conjugation and fermion\nparity $(-1)^F$. We prove that every unitary invertible quantum field theory\nintertwines these actions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
