Furthermore, we apply the formalism to the recently\nintroduced bouncing model in VCDM, and show that the bispectrum still respects\ncurrent observational constraints. Future measurements on non-Gaussianities of\nthe local type should provide the test ground for the model's validity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
