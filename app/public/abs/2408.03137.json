This approach corresponds better to reality since logical\nreasons behind asymmetric behavior exist and need to be considered in empirical\ninvestigations. Hatemi-J (2012) introduced the asymmetric causality tests via\npartial cumulative sums for positive and negative components of the variables\noperating within the vector autoregressive (VAR) model. However, since the\nresiduals across the equations in the VAR model are not independent, the\nordinary least squares method for estimating the parameters is not efficient.\nAdditionally, asymmetric causality tests mean having different causal\nparameters (i.e., for positive or negative components), thus, it is crucial to\nassess not only if these causal parameters are individually statistically\nsignificant, but also if their difference is statistically significant.\nConsequently, tests of difference between estimated causal parameters should\nexplicitly be conducted, which are neglected in the existing literature. The\npurpose of the current paper is to deal with these issues explicitly. An\napplication is provided, and ten different hypotheses pertinent to the\nasymmetric causal interaction between two largest financial markets worldwide\nare efficiently tested within a multivariate setting.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OWeDvg1Ww2JjmD3GZZ7YuEHtIGQOQ1xhfJ9IX6UwNCM","pdfSize":"236898"}
