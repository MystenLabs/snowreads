As the key to model training, IoU (Intersection\nover Union) greatly shows the difference between the current prediction box and\nthe Ground Truth box. Subsequent researchers have continuously added more\nconsiderations to IoU, such as center distance, aspect ratio, and so on.\nHowever, there is an upper limit to just refining the geometric differences;\nAnd there is a potential connection between the new consideration index and the\nIoU itself, and the direct addition or subtraction between the two may lead to\nthe problem of \"over-consideration\". Based on this, we propose a new IoU loss\nfunction, called Unified-IoU (UIoU), which is more concerned with the weight\nassignment between different quality prediction boxes. Specifically, the loss\nfunction dynamically shifts the model's attention from low-quality prediction\nboxes to high-quality prediction boxes in a novel way to enhance the model's\ndetection performance on high-precision or intensive datasets and achieve a\nbalance in training speed. Our proposed method achieves better performance on\nmultiple datasets, especially at a high IoU threshold, UIoU has a more\nsignificant improvement effect compared with other improved IoU losses.
