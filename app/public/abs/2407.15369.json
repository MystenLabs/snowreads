Current tensor decomposition methods emphasize\nrepresenting small targets with sparsity but struggle to separate targets from\ncomplex backgrounds due to insufficient use of intrinsic directional\ninformation and reduced target visibility during decomposition. To address\nthese challenges, this study introduces a Sparse Differential Directionality\nprior (SDD) framework. SDD leverages the distinct directional characteristics\nof targets to differentiate them from the background, applying mixed sparse\nconstraints on the differential directional images and continuity difference\nmatrix of the temporal component, both derived from Tucker decomposition. We\nfurther enhance target detectability with a saliency coherence strategy that\nintensifies target contrast against the background during hierarchical\ndecomposition. A Proximal Alternating Minimization-based (PAM) algorithm\nefficiently solves our proposed model. Experimental results on several\nreal-world datasets validate our method's effectiveness, outperforming ten\nstate-of-the-art methods in target detection and clutter suppression.
