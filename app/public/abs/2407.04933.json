This component model is shown to be useful, in particular, for the\nmodeling of time series with two types of seasonality, a long-period and a\nshort period. This component model is also shown to be effective in the case of\nordinary seasonal time series with only one seasonal component, if the seasonal\npattern is simple and can be well represented by a small number of\ntrigonometric components. As examples, electricity demand data, bi-hourly\ntemperature data, CO2 data, and two economic time series are considered. The\nlast section summarizes the findings from the emperical studies.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
