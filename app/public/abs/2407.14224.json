To build a robust SL recognition system, we need a\nconsiderable amount of data which is lacking particularly in Indian sign\nlanguage (ISL). In this paper, we propose a large-scale isolated ISL dataset\nand a novel SL recognition model based on skeleton graph structure. The dataset\ncovers 2,002 daily used common words in the deaf community recorded by 20 (10\nmale and 10 female) deaf adult signers (contains 40033 videos). We propose a SL\nrecognition model namely Hierarchical Windowed Graph Attention Network (HWGAT)\nby utilizing the human upper body skeleton graph structure. The HWGAT tries to\ncapture distinctive motions by giving attention to different body parts induced\nby the human skeleton graph structure. The utility of the proposed dataset and\nthe usefulness of our model are evaluated through extensive experiments. We\npre-trained the proposed model on the proposed dataset and fine-tuned it across\ndifferent sign language datasets further boosting the performance of 1.10,\n0.46, 0.78, and 6.84 percentage points on INCLUDE, LSA64, AUTSL and WLASL\nrespectively compared to the existing state-of-the-art skeleton-based models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
