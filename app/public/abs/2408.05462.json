However, the high cost of data sharing between simulation sources\nand visualization resources poses a significant challenge. This paper\nintroduces a novel framework that leverages lossy compression to accelerate\nin-transit isosurface generation. Our approach involves a Compressed\nHierarchical Representation (CHR) and topology-preserving compression to ensure\nthe fidelity of the isosurface generation. Experimental evaluations demonstrate\nthat our framework can achieve up to 4x speedup in visualization workflows,\nmaking it a promising solution for real-time scientific data analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
