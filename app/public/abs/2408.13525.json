At the same\ntime, synchronous detection of neutron stars mergers by gamma-ray and GW\ndetectors will make it possible not only to study in detail the physical\nprocesses occurring at the time of the catastrophe, but also to determine the\nfull gamma ray beam pattern, including the average jet divergence angle and the\nreal energy of the explosion. A gamma detector that has the required\nsensitivity at a relatively low flight weight is proposed. The latter, in turn,\nwill make it possible to clarify our ideas about the genesis of double\nrelativistic stars in the Universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q9Uk6V41C62kDvxx6LaRs8Mj8LEuGnlc8kJPFkKcCMg","pdfSize":"1015149"}
