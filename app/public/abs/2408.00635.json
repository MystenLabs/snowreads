The driving leads across finite-size precursors of the first- and\nsecond-order quantum phase transition from factorized to entangled ground-state\nphases, aiming at the preparation of the complex ground state of the system at\nthe final parameter point with maximal fidelity. During the drive, the system\nis coupled to a heat bath with a constant temperature, the dynamics being\ndetermined in a nonpertubative way by the method of Hierarchical Equations of\nMotion. It is shown that the presence of the heat bath in combination with\nspecific patterns of avoided crossings affecting the ground and excited states\nin the parameter region around the quantum phase transition may considerably\nimprove the fidelity of preparation of the target ground state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
