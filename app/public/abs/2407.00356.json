We present a surprising finding that, when recovering the\noriginal model accuracy is the sole objective, it can be achieved effectively\nthrough the weight reconstruction objective alone. Additionally, we explore the\nunderlying factors for improving weight reconstruction under\nparameter-efficiency constraints, and propose a novel training scheme that\ndecouples the reconstruction objective from auxiliary objectives such as\nknowledge distillation that leads to significant improvements compared to\nstate-of-the-art approaches. Finally, these results pave way for more practical\nscenarios, where one needs to achieve improvements on both model accuracy and\npredictor network parameter-efficiency simultaneously.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
