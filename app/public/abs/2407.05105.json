New data types, such as interval-valued data, have\nbrought fresh theoretical and methodological problems to be solved. In this\npaper, we derive explicit formulas for computing the Mallows' distance, also\nknown as $L_2$ Wasserstein distance, between two \\textit{p}-dimensional\nintervals, using information regarding the distribution of the microdata. We\nestablish this distance as a Mahalanobis' distance between two\n2\\textit{p}-dimensional vectors. Our comprehensive analysis leads to the\ngeneralisation of the definitions of the expected value and covariance matrix\nof an interval-valued random vector. These novel results bring theoretical\nsupport and interpretability to state-of-the-art contributions. Additionally,\nwe discuss real examples that illustrate how we can model different levels of\navailable information on the microdata, leading to proper estimates of the\nmeasures of location and association.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
