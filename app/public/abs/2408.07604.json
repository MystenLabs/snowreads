Among the different types of barchan-barchan interaction,\nthere is one, known as chasing, in which the dunes remain close but without\ntouching each other. In this paper, we investigate the origins of this\nbarchan-barchan dune repulsion by carrying out grain-scale numerical\ncomputations in which a pair of granular heaps is deformed by the fluid flow\ninto barchan dunes that interact with each other. In our simulations, data such\nas position, velocity and resultant force are computed for each individual\nparticle at each time step, allowing us to measure details of both the fluid\nand grains that explain the repulsion. We show the trajectories of grains,\ntime-average resultant forces, and mass balances for each dune, and that the\ndownstream barchan shrinks faster than the upstream one, keeping, thus, a\nrelatively high velocity although in the wake of the upstream barchan. In its\nturn, this fast shrinkage is caused by the flow disturbance, which induces\nhigher erosion on the downstream barchan and its circumvention by grains\nleaving the upstream dune. Our results help explaining the mechanisms behind\nthe distribution of barchans in dune fields found on Earth and Mars.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
