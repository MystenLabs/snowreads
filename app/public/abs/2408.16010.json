More precisely, this\nthesis concerns statistical-based modeling and empirical analyses with\napplications in finance, forecasting, production processes and game theory. In\nthese areas the time dependence of probability distributions is of prime\ninterest and can be measured or exactly calculated for model systems. The\ncorrelation coefficients and moments are among the useful quantities to\ndescribe the dynamics and the correlations between random variables. However,\nthe full investigation can only be achieved if the probability distribution\nfunction of the variable is known; its derivation is one of the main focuses of\nthe present work.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BoPWk5bR10TKCbTwi7iU4_fFLR4L3zFmd2l82rslZ0U","pdfSize":"2551043"}
