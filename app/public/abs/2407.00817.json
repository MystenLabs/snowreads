Common-centroid (CC) type layouts have been shown to mitigate\nprocess-induced variations and are widely used to match circuit elements.\nNevertheless, selecting the most suitable CC topology necessitates careful\nconsideration of important layout constraints. Manual handling of these\nconstraints becomes challenging, especially with large size problems.\nState-of-the-art CC placement methods lack an optimization framework to handle\nimportant layout constraints collectively. They also require manual efforts and\nconsequently, the solutions can be suboptimal. To address this, we propose a\nunified framework based on multi-objective optimization for CC placement of\nanalog transistors. Our method handles various constraints, including degree of\ndispersion, routing complexity, diffusion sharing, and layout dependent\neffects. The multi-objective optimization provides better handling of the\nobjectives when compared to single-objective optimization. Moreover, compared\nto existing methods, our method explores more CC topologies. Post-layout\nsimulation results show better performance compared to state-of-the-art\ntechniques in generating CC layouts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cYfwVVp3vd7NVgVgLTY1nxexjN15n1SOf-NQhPB4bBo","pdfSize":"1704171"}
