In this paper, we consider the\nproblem of characterizing a given frame sequence to be a weak R-dual of a given\nframe. Further, we apply these characterization results to the Gabor frame\nsetting and prove that the weak R-duality of the adjoint Gabor system leads to\nthe R-duality of the same, thereby indicating an approach to answer the famous\nproblem of the adjoint Gabor system being an R-dual of a given Gabor frame.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
