We use a cluster state in continuous variables as the main resource\nto realize this protocol. In the paper, we obtain a family of configurations of\ncluster states in continuous variables that can be used to realize the\nbidirectional quantum teleportation protocol. From the whole family of\nconfigurations, we have chosen those that realize the protocol with the\nsmallest possible error.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
