By introducing a suitable spectral\nlocalization, we prove low regularity error estimates for the time\ndiscretization corresponding to an adapted Lie-Trotter splitting scheme. The\nproof is based on tools from spectral theory and pseudodifferential calculus in\norder to obtain various estimates on the spectral localization, including\ndiscrete Strichartz estimates which support the nonlinear analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
