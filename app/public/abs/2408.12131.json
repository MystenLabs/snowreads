In this work, we study the kurtosis\nof the elliptical model, which is an important parameter in many statistical\nanalysis. Based on U-statistics, we develop an estimation method.\nTheoretically, we show that the proposed estimator is consistent under regular\nconditions, especially we relax a moment condition and the restriction that the\ndata dimension and the sample size are of the same order. Furthermore, we\nderive the asymptotic normality of the estimator and evaluate the asymptotic\nvariance through several examples, which allows us to construct a confidence\ninterval. The performance of our method is validated by extensive simulations\nand real data analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CN6qpxd6l7rBfo-L9x93p69wewqzCN1JzkAzZCVJ0H4","pdfSize":"218872"}
