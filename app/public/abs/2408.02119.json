For specific nongeneric coupling, these tori are\nequilibria relative to a continuous symmetry action. We analyze how the\ninvariant tori deform under forced symmetry breaking as more general network\ninteraction terms are introduced. We first show in general that perturbed tori\nthat are relative equilibria can be computed using a parametrization method;\nthis yields an asymptotic expansion of an embedding of the perturbed torus, as\nwell as the local dynamics on the torus. We then apply this result to a coupled\noscillator network, and we numerically study the dynamics on the persisting\ntori in the network by looking for bifurcations of their periodic orbits in a\nboundary-value-problem setup. This way we find new bifurcating stable synchrony\npatterns that can be the building blocks of larger global structures such as\nheteroclinic cycles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
