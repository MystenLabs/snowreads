Here, $f \\colon X\n\\rightarrow X$ is a regular surjective self-map for $X$ a geometrically\nirreducible projective variety over $\\KK$. Given a non-zero and effective\n$f$-quasi-polarizable Cartier divisor $D$ on $X$ and defined over $\\KK$, our\nmain result gives a sufficient condition, that is formulated in terms of the\n$f$-dynamics of $D$, for non-Zariski density of certain dynamically defined\nsubsets of $\\mathrm{O}_f(x)$. For the case of $(D,S)$-integral points, this\nresult gives a sufficient condition for non-Zariski density of integral points\nin $\\mathrm{O}_f(x)$. Our approach expands on that of Yasufuku,\n\\cite{Yasufuku:2015}, building on earlier work of Silverman\n\\cite{Silverman:1993}. Our main result gives an unconditional form of the main\nresults of loc.~cit.; the key arithmetic input to our main theorem is the\nSubspace Theorem of Schmidt in the generalized form that has been given by Ru\nand Vojta in \\cite{Ru:Vojta:2016} and expanded upon in\n\\cite{Grieve:points:bounded:degree} and \\cite{Grieve:qualitative:subspace}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
