In the chemical etching\ntechnique, a two-step process involves 40% and 24% of hydrofluoric acid\nsolutions for the first and second steps, respectively. The measured diameters\nof MNFs range is 0.34 $\\mu$m - 1.4 $\\mu$m. In the gas-flame technique, we\ndesign the pulling parameters in a four-step process to achieve the desired\ndiameter of MNFs. The single-mode fiber is adiabatically tapered using\nhigh-precision stages while heating the fiber with hydrogen-oxygen flame. The\nmeasured diameters of pulled MNFs range is 0.48 $\\mu$m - 0.53 $\\mu$m, showing\ngood correspondence with the designed diameters. Due to the strong confinement\nof the field around the MNF, it has diverse applications in various fields,\nsuch as sensing, nanophotonics, quantum optics, quantum photonics, and\nnonlinear optics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
