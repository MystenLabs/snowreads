It argues for the need to question established patterns of\nthought and traditional authorities, including core concepts such as autonomy,\nmorality, and ethics. These concepts are increasingly inadequate to deal with\nthe complexities introduced by emerging AI and autonomous agents. This critique\nhas several key components: clarifying conceptual ambiguities, honestly\naddressing epistemic issues, and thoroughly exploring fundamental normative\nproblems. The ultimate goal is to reevaluate and possibly redefine some\ntraditional ethical concepts to better address the challenges posed by AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kKyoMvruF53Yud3wrgt9QCRy7tWr2wAQvkdWV6bE8UQ","pdfSize":"158682"}
