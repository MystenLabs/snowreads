The model is combined\nwith edge tracing, where edges are ordered sequences of connected pixels. The\nobjective is to provide a versatile preprocessing method for tasks such as\nfigure-ground segmentation, object recognition, topological analysis, etc. By\nusing only a small set of straightforward principles, the results are intuitive\nto describe. This helps to implement subsequent processing steps, such as\nresolving ambiguous edge connections at junctions. By using an augmented edge\nmap, neighboring edges can be directly accessed using quick local search\noperations. The edge tracing uses recursion, which leads to compact programming\ncode. We explain our algorithm using pseudocode, compare it with related\nmethods, and show how simple modular postprocessing steps can be used to\noptimize the results. The complete algorithm, including all data structures,\nrequires less than 50 lines of pseudocode. We also provide a C++ implementation\nof our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NmIlbhFprlRh6vToiZ33sBQKatfCTEx_kgmE3BChbjc","pdfSize":"976965","txDigest":"CpZAcZYakFJVbMVohZJ1JPmkhaoCDTawBgVEQaedVc96","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
