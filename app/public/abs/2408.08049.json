When the OT-manifold has no proper infinite\ncomplex-analytic subsets, it then follows by known model-theoretic results that\nits cartesian powers have no interesting complex-analytic families of\nsubvarieties. The methods of proof, which are similar to [Moosa, Moraru, and\nToma ``An essentially saturated surface not of K\\\"ahler-type\", {\\em Bull. of\nthe LMS}, 40(5):845--854, 2008], require studying finite unramified covers of\nOT-manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
