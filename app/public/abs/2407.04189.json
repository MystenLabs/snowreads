Unlike traditional machine\nlearning methods focusing on learning a specific task, meta-learning aims to\nleverage experience from previous tasks to enhance future learning. This\napproach is particularly beneficial in scenarios where the available data for a\nnew task is limited, but there exists abundant data from related tasks. By\nextracting and utilizing the underlying structure and patterns across these\ntasks, meta-learning algorithms can achieve faster convergence and better\nperformance with fewer data. The following notes are mainly inspired from\n\\cite{vanschoren2018meta}, \\cite{baxter2019learning}, and\n\\cite{maurer2005algorithmic}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
