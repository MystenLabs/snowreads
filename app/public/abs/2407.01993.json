In order to reveal this quark dynamics,\nwe perform a systematic analysis of $NN$, $D_{03}$, and $D_{30}$ systems in the\n(extended) chiral SU(3) constituent quark models. By comparing results\ncalculated with different models and different parameter sets, the effects of\none gluon exchange and vector meson exchange terms are carefully examined. The\nresults indicate that the vector meson exchange interactions dominate the short\nrange interactions between $u/d$ quarks, while the small residual one gluon\nexchange coupling strength is also allowed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
