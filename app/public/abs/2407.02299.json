This leads to explicit estimators which have good asymptotic\nproperties (close to efficiency) and therefore lead to interesting alternatives\nto classical maximum likelihood methods or more recent score matching\nestimators. We perform competitive simulation studies to assess the quality of\nthe new estimators. Finally, the practical relevance of our estimators is\nillustrated on a real data application in spherical latent representations of\nhandwritten numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
