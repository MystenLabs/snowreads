This inquiry is\nfruitful, as extending classical results to new contexts can lead to a better\nand deeper understanding of those classical results. Our main objective is to\nintroduce a new fractional Caputo-derivative Orlicz space, denoted by\n$\\mathcal{O}^{\\alpha,G}(\\Lambda, \\mathbb{R}) $. We are interested in several\nqualitative properties of this space, such as reflexivity, completeness, and\nseparability. Additionally, we establish a continuous embedding results of this\nspace into a suitable Orlicz space and the space of continuous functions. As an\napplication, we use the mountain-pass theorem (MPT) to ensure the existence of\na nontrivial weak solution for a new class of fractional-type problems in\nOrlicz space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rNlQVJ9DHB3vx_TAeUl2QmL5K7SUUrbwQNgwZU3XSjw","pdfSize":"269347"}
