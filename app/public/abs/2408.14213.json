Deep neural networks (DNNs)\nhave been shown to be able to extract that information for acoustic distance\nestimation. Since there exists only a very limited amount of annotated data,\ne.g., RIRs with distance information, training a DNN for acoustic distance\nestimation has to rely on simulated RIRs, resulting in an unavoidable mismatch\nto RIRs of real rooms. In this contribution, we show that this mismatch can be\nreduced by a novel combination of geometric and stochastic modeling of RIRs,\nresulting in a significantly improved distance estimation accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
