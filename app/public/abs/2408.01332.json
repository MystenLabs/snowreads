However, most of them only consider\nmodeling in a single multi-distribution manner, ignoring that mixed\nmulti-distributions often coexist and form hierarchical relationships. To\naddress these challenges, we propose a flexible modeling paradigm, named\nHierarchical Multi-Distribution Network (HMDN), which efficiently models these\nhierarchical relationships and can seamlessly integrate with existing\nmulti-distribution methods, such as Mixture of-Experts (MoE) and Dynamic-Weight\n(DW) models. Specifically, we first design a hierarchical multi-distribution\nrepresentation refinement module, employing a multi-level residual quantization\nto obtain fine-grained hierarchical representation. Then, the refined\nhierarchical representation is integrated into the existing single\nmulti-distribution models, seamlessly expanding them into mixed\nmulti-distribution models. Experimental results on both public and industrial\ndatasets validate the effectiveness and flexibility of HMDN.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
