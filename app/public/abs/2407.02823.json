We solve the\nclassical Kirchhoff-Love equation for rectangular wires and explore the\ndispersion relation for both the symmetric and antisymmetric solutions. Then,\nwe study the phonon transport of these modes within the second quantization\nframework by analyzing the mean quadratic displacement, from which the energy\ndensity current, the temperature field, and conductance are determined. We\nidentify the relevant modes contributing to thermal transport and explore the\naverage temperature difference to reach the high-temperature limit. We expect\nour results to pave the way for understanding phonon-mediated thermal transport\nin two-dimensional mesoscopic quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
