PAMSO tunes\nparameters in a low-fidelity model to assist in solving a higher-fidelity\nmulti-time scale optimization model. These parameters represent the mismatch\nbetween the two models. PAMSO defines a black-box function with tunable\nparameters as inputs and multi-scale cost as output, optimized using\nDerivative-Free Optimization methods. This scalable algorithm allows optimal\nparameters from one problem to be transferred to similar problems. Case studies\ndemonstrate its effectiveness on an MINLP model for integrated design and\nscheduling in a resource task network with around 67,000 variables and an MILP\nmodel for integrated planning and scheduling of electrified chemical plants and\nrenewable resources with around 26 million variables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
