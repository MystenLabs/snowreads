However, standard miniKanren programs\nthat produce infinite results do not run as expected in stableKanren. According\nto stable model semantics, the contradictions are created by negations. A\nstandard miniKanren's relations do not involve negation, and the coarse\ncontradictions handling in stableKanren causes this compatibility issue.\nTherefore, we provide a find-grinded contradiction handling to restrict the\nchecking scope. As a result, standard miniKanren relations can produce answers.\nWe also add a ``run-partial'' interface so that standard miniKanren's relations\nimplemented with ``define''/``defineo'' can generate answers even if they\ncoexist with non-terminating or unsatisfiable stableKanren relations in the\nsame environment. The ``run-partial'' interface also supports running\nstratified negation programs faster without checking global unavoidable\ncontradictions. A dependency graph analysis can be applied to the input query\nin the future, so the ``run'' interface can implicitly decide whether to\nperform unavoidable contradictions checking to improve usability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
