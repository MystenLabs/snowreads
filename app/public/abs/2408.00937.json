In this paper,\nwe present a semi-analytical approach for calculating RF-induced temporal\njitter from klystron and RF cavity parameters. Our approach allows fast\nestimation of temporal jitter for MeV-UED beamlines and can serve as a virtual\ntiming tool when shot-to-shot measurements of RF amplitude and phase jitters\nare available. A simulation study for the SLAC MeV-UED instrument is presented\nand the temporal resolution for several beamline configurations are compared.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DGWE_FMonbDHJb_b9qBCR85UoNnVcT1V9qlqnZQnaVg","pdfSize":"579244"}
