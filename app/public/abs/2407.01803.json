An\nunconditionally stable discretisation method is proposed based on a finite\nelement approximation in space and a variational time discretization strategy.\nThe proposed method preserves the energy-dissipation structure of the\nunderlying system exactly and allows to establish a fully discrete nonlinear\nstability estimate in natural norms based on the concept of relative energy.\nThese estimates are used to derive order optimal error estimates for the method\nunder minimal smoothness assumptions on the problem data, despite the presence\nof various strong nonlinearities in the equations. The theoretical results and\nmain properties of the method are illustrated by numerical simulations which\nalso demonstrate the capability to reproduce the relevant physical effects\nobserved in experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
