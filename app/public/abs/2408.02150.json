This is possible\nusing the sun-dual framework, which is not immediate from the duality of the\ninput and output maps. This extension enables the testing of admissibility for\na broader range of examples, in particular for state space of continuous\nfunctions or $L^1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
