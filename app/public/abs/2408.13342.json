The Lorentz\ntransformation facilitating the move from one co-frame to the other is also\npresented in factored form. The factored form also illustrates the nature of\nthe two degrees of freedom found in the spin connection. The choice of\ncoordinates in restricting the number of arbitrary functions is also presented.\nBeginning with a thorough presentation of teleparallel gravity using the metric\naffine gauge theory approach and concentrating on f(T) teleparallel gravity, we\nexpress the field equations in the diagonal co-frame. We argue that the choice\nof diagonal co-frame may be more advantageous over the proper co-frame choice.\nFinally, assuming one additional symmetry, we restrict ourselves to the\nKantowski-Sachs tele-parallel geometries, and determine some solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
