I propose a thought experiment that raises questions\nabout the normative appeal of Commutativity. I propose a weakened version of\nCommutativity and show how that assumption plays central roles in the\ncharacterization of linear belief aggregation, multiple-weight aggregation, and\nan aggregation rule which can be viewed as the outcome of a game played by\n\"dual-selves,\" Pessimism and Optimism. Under suitable conditions, I establish\nequivalences between various relaxations of Commutativity and classic axioms\nfor decision-making under uncertainty, including Independence, C-Independence,\nand Ambiguity Aversion.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
