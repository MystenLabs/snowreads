Such approaches tend to\noveremphasize the causal relationships between invariant sub-graphs and labels,\nthereby neglecting the non-negligible role of environment in real-world\nscenarios. In contrast to previous studies that impose rigid independence\nassumptions on environments and invariant sub-graphs, this paper presents the\ntheorems of environment-label dependency and mutable rationale invariance,\nwhere the former characterizes the usefulness of environments in determining\ngraph labels while the latter refers to the mutable importance of graph\nrationales. Based on analytic investigations, a novel variational inference\nbased method named ``Probability Dependency on Environments and Rationales for\nOOD Graphs on Real-world Data'' (DEROG) is introduced. To alleviate the adverse\neffect of unknown prior knowledge on environments and rationales, DEROG\nutilizes generalized Bayesian inference. Further, DEROG employs an EM-based\nalgorithm for optimization. Finally, extensive experiments on real-world\ndatasets under different distribution shifts are conducted to show the\nsuperiority of DEROG.
