Our primary finding reveals that, for almost\nall convex polygonal domains, there exist at most finitely many non-congruent\ndomains with the same Steklov spectrum. Moreover, we obtain explicit upper\nbounds for the maximum number of mutually Steklov isospectral non-congruent\npolygonal domains. Along the way, we obtain isoperimetric bounds for the\nSteklov eigenvalues of a convex polygon in terms of the minimal interior angle\nof the polygon.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
