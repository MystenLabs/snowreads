However, such work has typically\nfocused on globally-experienced identities or centered Western contexts. In\nthis paper, we address interpretations, representations, and stereotypes\nsurrounding a tragically underexplored context in T2I research: caste. We\nexamine how the T2I Stable Diffusion displays people of various castes, and\nwhat professions they are depicted as performing. Generating 100 images per\nprompt, we perform CLIP-cosine similarity comparisons with default depictions\nof an 'Indian person' by Stable Diffusion, and explore patterns of similarity.\nOur findings reveal how Stable Diffusion outputs perpetuate systems of\n'castelessness', equating Indianness with high-castes and depicting\ncaste-oppressed identities with markers of poverty. In particular, we note the\nstereotyping and representational harm towards the historically-marginalized\nDalits, prominently depicted as living in rural areas and always at protests.\nOur findings underscore a need for a caste-aware approach towards T2I design,\nand we conclude with design recommendations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
