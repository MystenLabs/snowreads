Expanding up to second order in scattering shifts, it is\nfound that besides the known Goos-H\\\"anchen or Imbert-Fedorov spatial offset,\nas well as the Wigner delay time, new momentum and frequency shifts appear.\nFurthermore, the width of the scattered wave packet becomes modified as well,\nwhich can lead to a shrinking of pulses by multiple scattering. For a model of\ndielectric material characterized by a longitudinal and transverse dielectric\nfunction the shifts are calculated analytically. From the Goos-H\\\"anchen and\nImbert-Fedorov shifts one can access the longitudinal and transversal\ndielectric function. Perfectly aligned crystal symmetry axes with respect to\nscattering beam shows no Imbert-Fedorov effect. It is found that the\nGoos-H\\\"anchen and Imbert-Fedorov effect are absent for homogeneous materials.\nOppositely it is found that the Wigner delay time and the shrinking of the\ntemporal pulse width allows to access the dielectric function independent on\nthe beam geometry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
