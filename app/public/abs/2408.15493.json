By solving the inverse scattering\nproblem, we derive the $p$-$\\Omega$ potentials from a quark model. The effects\nof Coulomb interaction and spin-averaging are discussed. According to our\nresults, the depletion of the $p$-$\\Omega$ correlation functions, attributed to\nthe $J^P = 2^+$ bound state not observed in the ALICE Collaboration's\nmeasurements [Nature \\textbf{588}, 232 (2020)], can be explained by the\ncontribution of the attractive $J^P = 1^+$ component in spin-averaging.\nAdditionally, there is a subtle sub-unity part of the correlation function,\nwhich can also be seen in the experimental data, supporting the existence of\nthe $p$-$\\Omega$ bound state. So far, we have completed the consistent\ndescription of the $p$-$\\Omega$ system from the perspective of the quark model\nin terms of energy spectrum, scattering phase shift, and correlation function.\nThe existence of the $p$-$\\Omega$ bound state has been confirmed from these\nthree aspects. In Appendix, we learn the relationship between correlation\nfunctions and interaction potentials by using simplified square potential\nmodels and find a periodic-like variation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IIzZba3jLynLMtrnPUMoD_AncEW4Z0FXmDKJQDxoCug","pdfSize":"607508"}
