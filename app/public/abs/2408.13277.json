This\nhighlights the need to covertly embed information and verify the authenticity\nand integrity of audio. Digital Audio Watermarking plays a crucial role in this\ncontext. This study presents an improved Phase Coding audio steganography\nalgorithm that segments the audio signal dynamically, embedding data into the\nmid-frequency phase components. This approach enhances resistance to\nsteganalysis, simplifies computation, and ensures secure audio integrity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
