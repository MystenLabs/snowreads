We begin by discussing different methods of generating the\nSierpinski gasket. Then we show how the transition from random to uniform\nselection reduces the Sierpinski gasket to simple periodic orbits. Next, we\nprovide a simple formula for the attractor of each of the introduced dynamical\nsystems based only on the contraction ratio and the regular n-gon on which the\ngame is played. Finally, we show how the basins of attraction of a particular\ndynamical system can generate some novel motifs that can tile the plane.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
