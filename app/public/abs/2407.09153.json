However, experimental evidence of topological surface states has yet to\nbe verified. Here, via angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and\nscanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), we probe the magnetic Weyl states of the\nferromagnetic electride $[Gd_{2}$C]^{2+}\\cdot2e^{-}$. In particular, the\npresence of Weyl cones and Fermi-arc states is demonstrated through photon\nenergy-dependent ARPES measurements, agreeing with theoretical band structure\ncalculations. Notably, the STM measurements reveal that the Fermi-arc states\nexist underneath a floating quantum electron liquid on the top Gd layer,\nforming double-stacked surface states in a heterostructure. Our work thus not\nonly unveils the non-trivial topology of the $[Gd_{2}$C]^{2+}\\cdot2e^{-}$\nelectride but also realizes a surface heterostructure that can host phenomena\ndistinct from the bulk.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
