This study focuses on stacking faults in\nsilicon and germanium, forming hexagonal inclusions within the cubic crystal\nand creating quantum wells that modify electronic properties. By modeling\ndefective structures with varying hexagonal layer counts, we calculated\nformation energies and electronic band structures. Our results show that\nhexagonal inclusions in Si and Ge exhibit a direct band gap, changing with\ninclusion thickness, effectively functioning as quantum wells. We find that Ge\ninclusions have a direct band gap and form Type-I quantum wells. This research\nhighlights the potential of manipulating extended defects to engineer the\noptoelectronic properties of Si and Ge, offering new pathways for advanced\nelectronic and photonic device applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
