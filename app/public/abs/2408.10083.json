Our study uses\nGaussian Process modeling under a Bayesian regime to analyze the Earth Entry\nSystem's resilience against operational stress. This Bayesian framework allows\nfor a detailed probabilistic evaluation of the risk of containment not assured,\nindicating the feasibility of meeting the mission's stringent safety goal of\n0.999999 probability of success. The findings underscore the effectiveness of\nBayesian methods for complex uncertainty quantification analyses of computer\nsimulations, providing valuable insights for computational reliability analysis\nin a risk-averse setting.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
