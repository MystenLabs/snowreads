We prove that any planar Euler graph\ncan be approximated, in a strong sense, by a homeomorphic rational lemniscate.\nThis generalizes Hilbert's lemniscate theorem; he proved that any Jordan curve\ncan be approximated (in the same strong sense) by a polynomial lemniscate that\nis also a Jordan curve. As consequences, we obtain a sharp quantitative version\nof the classical Runge's theorem on rational approximation, and we give a new\nresult on the approximation of planar continua by Julia sets of rational maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
