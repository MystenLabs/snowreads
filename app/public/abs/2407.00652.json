The theoretical framework we adopt here is both novel and\nessential because it emphasises the crucial role played by the normally ignored\naxial components of the twisted light fields of these modes. We show that the\ninclusion of the axial field components enables the intrinsic properties of the\nPoincare modes, notably their angular momentum, both spin and orbital as well\nas their helicity and chirality, to be determined. We predict significant\nenhancements of the intrinsic properties of these modes when compared with\nthose due to the zero order LG modes. In particular, we show that higher order\nLG Poincare modes exhibit super-chirality and, significantly so, even in the\ncase of the first order\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
