In this work, we analyze CoT prompting from a\nstatistical estimation perspective, providing a comprehensive characterization\nof its sample complexity. To this end, we introduce a multi-step latent\nvariable model that encapsulates the reasoning process, where the latent\nvariable encodes the task information. Under this framework, we demonstrate\nthat when the pretraining dataset is sufficiently large, the estimator formed\nby CoT prompting is equivalent to a Bayesian estimator. This estimator\neffectively solves the multi-step reasoning problem by aggregating a posterior\ndistribution inferred from the demonstration examples in the prompt. Moreover,\nwe prove that the statistical error of the CoT estimator can be decomposed into\ntwo main components: (i) a prompting error, which arises from inferring the\ntrue task using CoT prompts, and (ii) the statistical error of the pretrained\nLLM. We establish that, under appropriate assumptions, the prompting error\ndecays exponentially to zero as the number of demonstrations increases.\nAdditionally, we explicitly characterize the approximation and generalization\nerrors of the pretrained LLM. Notably, we construct a transformer model that\napproximates the target distribution of the multi-step reasoning problem with\nan error that decreases exponentially in the number of transformer blocks. Our\nanalysis extends to other variants of CoT, including Self-Consistent CoT,\nTree-of-Thought, and Selection-Inference, offering a broad perspective on the\nefficacy of these methods. We also provide numerical experiments to validate\nthe theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
