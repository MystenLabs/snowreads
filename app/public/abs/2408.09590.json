We examine the consequences of modeling agents capable of\na certain sort of reflection. Such agents face a formal difficulty due to\nL\\\"ob's Theorem, called L\\\"ob's Obstacle in the literature. We show how the\nmost popular axiom schemes of epistemic and doxastic logics suffer from L\\\"ob's\nObstacle, and present two axiom schemes that that avoid L\\\"ob's Obstacle, which\nwe call Reasonable L\\\"ob-Safe Epistemic Doxastic logic (${LSED}^R$) and\nSupported L\\\"ob-Safe Epistemic Doxastic logic (${LSED}^S$).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-kixEyJOjJMlk1sODHOgT3TqJR7jeBOOyCDft9SBZ80","pdfSize":"170496"}
