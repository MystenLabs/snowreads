This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the\ndata availability and current state-of-the-art multimodal ML applications for\nmental health. It discusses key challenges that must be addressed to advance\nthe field. The insights from this survey aim to deepen the understanding of the\npotential and limitations of multimodal ML in mental health, guiding future\nresearch and development in this evolving domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
