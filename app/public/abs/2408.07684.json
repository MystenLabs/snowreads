We generalize the construction of shadow operator for\nsuperconformal field theories. We demonstrate that shadow formalism yields\nknown expressions for the large-c limit of the four-point superconformal block\non a plane and of the one-point superconformal block on a torus. We also\nexplicitly find the two-point global torus superconformal block in the necklace\nchannel and check it against the Casimir differential equation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
