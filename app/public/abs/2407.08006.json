A less explored possibility with comparably far-reaching\ntechnological applicability is the quantum simulation of classical nonlinear\ndynamics. Attempts to develop digital quantum algorithms based on the Koopman\nvon Neumann formalism have met with challenges because of the necessary\nprojection step from an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space to the\nfinite-dimensional subspace described by a collection of qubits. This\nfinitization produces numerical artifacts that limit solutions to very short\ntime horizons. In this paper we review continuous-variable quantum computing\n(CVQC), which naturally avoids such obstacles, and a CVQC algorithm for KvN\nsimulation of classical nonlinear dynamics is advocated. In particular, we\npresent explicit gate synthesis for product-formula Hamiltonian simulation of\nanharmonic vibrational dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
