This paper introduces a novel dataset designed for\nsummarizing multiple scientific articles into a section of a survey. Our\ncontributions are: (1) SurveySum, a new dataset addressing the gap in\ndomain-specific summarization tools; (2) two specific pipelines to summarize\nscientific articles into a section of a survey; and (3) the evaluation of these\npipelines using multiple metrics to compare their performance. Our results\nhighlight the importance of high-quality retrieval stages and the impact of\ndifferent configurations on the quality of generated summaries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
