Employing Soft Collinear\nEffective Theory, we provide a complete framework for jet production and\nevolution by separating the jet dynamics from the universal medium physics to\nall orders in perturbation theory in terms of gauge invariant operators. The\nEFT allows us to precisely define the domain of validity of different\napproximations and to systematically go beyond leading order results in the\nliterature through radiative corrections. For this observable, we show where\nthe leading order GLV and BDMPS-Z results are valid and infer that higher order\nradiative corrections lead to both DGLAP and BFKL evolutions. We further show\nthe impact of BFKL resummation on the medium induced jet function for two point\nenergy correlator. Crucially, the EFT approach enables us to evaluate the\nuniversality of the non-perturbative physics which is the key to predictive\npower in a strongly coupled medium.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
