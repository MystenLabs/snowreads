While an ASP encoding had been previously suggested,\nseveral practical issues had been neglected, most notably, the question of how\nto efficiently compute the (externally defined) similarity facts that are used\nin rule bodies. This leads us to propose new variants of the encodings\n(including Datalog approximations) and show how to employ different\nfunctionalities of ASP solvers to compute (maximal) solutions, and\n(approximations of) the sets of possible and certain merges. A comprehensive\nexperimental evaluation of ASPEN on real-world datasets shows that the approach\nis promising, achieving high accuracy in real-life ER scenarios. Our\nexperiments also yield useful insights into the relative merits of different\ntypes of (approximate) ER solutions, the impact of recursion, and factors\ninfluencing performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
