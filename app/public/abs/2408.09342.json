A discussion\nis given that provides a thorough review of the concepts of holoraumy,\npermutahedra, and gadgets. One consequence of these concepts, the additional\nconcept of hopper operators, is discussed. These play a particularly important\nrole that ignites the processes needed for the study of adinkras related to\nminimal 4D, $\\cal N$ = 1 supermultiplets (chiral, vector, tensor and complex\nlinear supermultiplets) through the prism of very simple cellular automata\nfollowing Wolfram's `New Kind of Science' paradigm.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
