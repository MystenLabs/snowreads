As\ndetections of interstellar complex organic molecules, or COMs, in starless\ncores has increased, abundance comparisons suggest that some COMs might be\nseeded early in the star formation process and inherited to later stages (i.e.,\nprotostellar disks and eventually comets). To date observations of COMs in\nstarless cores have been limited, with most detections reported solely in the\nTaurus Molecular Cloud. It is therefore still a question whether different\nenvironments affect abundances. We have surveyed 35 starless and prestellar\ncores in the Perseus Molecular Cloud with the Arizona Radio Observatory (ARO)\n12m telescope detecting both methanol, CH$_3$OH, and acetaldehyde, CH$_3$CHO,\nin 100% and 49% of the sample, respectively. In the sub-sample of 15 cores\nwhere CH$_3$CHO was detected at $>3\\sigma$ ($\\sim$18 mK) with the ARO 12m,\nfollow-up observations with the Yebes 40m telescope were carried out.\nDetections of formic acid, $t$-HCOOH, ketene, H$_2$CCO, methyl cyanide,\nCH$_3$CN, vinyl cyanide, CH$_2$CHCN, methyl formate, HCOOCH$_3$, and dimethyl\nether, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, are seen in at least $20\\%$ of the cores. We discuss\ndetection statistics, calculate column densities, and compare abundances across\nvarious stages of low-mass star formation. Our findings have more than doubled\nCOM detection statistics in cold cores and show COMs are prevalent in the gas\nbefore star and planet formation in the Perseus Molecular Cloud.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
