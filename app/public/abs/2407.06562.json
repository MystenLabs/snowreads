We found, however, they\npossess different ISCOs and photon spheres, and hence affect their shadow\nimages. In this work, we investigate the optical appearances, illuminated by an\noptically and geometrically thin disk, are investigated, of such black hole.\nOne finds that doppelg\\\"ange black holes have different optical appearances.\nEven the horizon radii are the same, the size of shadows are not equal.\nFurthermore, we found that the large magnetic charge $Q_m$ black holes give\nrise to novel shadow images that the usual bright rings inside shadow are not\nclear, The optical appearances illuminated by spherically accretions are also\nexamined, and it can also identify two doppelg\\\"ange black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
