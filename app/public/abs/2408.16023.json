TL\nasserts that the variance is directly proportional to a power of the mean,\nexactly for population moments and, whether or not population moments exist,\napproximately for sample moments. In many papers, linear regression of log\nvariance as a function of log mean is used to estimate TL's parameters. We\nprovide some statistical guarantees with large-sample asymptotics for this kind\nof inference under general conditions, and we derive confidence intervals for\nthe parameters. In many ecological applications, the means and variances are\nestimated over time or across space from arrays of abundance data collected at\ndifferent locations and time points. When the ratio between the time-series\nlength and the number of spatial points converges to a constant as both become\nlarge, the usual normalized statistics are asymptotically biased. We provide a\nbias correction to get correct confidence intervals. TL, widely studied in\nmultiple sciences, is a source of challenging new statistical problems in a\nnonstationary spatiotemporal framework. We illustrate our results with both\nsimulated and real data sets.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
