Under mild\ngenericity assumptions on the parabolic weights, we prove that the conformal\nlimit always exists and that it defines holomorphic sections of the space of\nparabolic lambda-connections which preserve a natural stratification and\nfoliate the moduli space. Along the way, we give a careful gauge theoretic\nconstruction of the moduli space of parabolic Higgs bundles with full flags\nwhich allows the eigenvalues of the residues of the Higgs field to vary. A\nnumber of new phenomena arise in the parabolic setting. In particular, in the\ngenerality we consider, unlike the nonparabolic case, the nonabelian Hodge\ncorrespondence does not define sections of the space of logarithmic\nlambda-connections, and the conformal limit does not define a one-parameter\nfamily in any given moduli space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZlV37gSwmgKAWeV2vSVu_P5z_9ai1gOZCzFqCcxnFq4","pdfSize":"636327"}
