Our main model\nis motivated by Grothendieck polynomials with parameter $\\beta=1$ arising in\nK-theory of the flag variety. The probability weight of a permutation is\nproportional to the principal specialization (setting all variables to 1) of\nthe corresponding Grothendieck polynomial. By mapping this random permutation\nto a version of TASEP (Totally Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process), we\ndescribe the limiting permuton and fluctuations around it as the order $n$ of\nthe permutation grows to infinity. The fluctuations are of order $n^{\\frac13}$\nand have the Tracy-Widom GUE distribution, which places this algebraic\n(K-theoretic) model into the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class.\n  We also investigate non-reduced pipe dreams and make progress on a recent\nopen problem on the asymptotic number of inversions of the resulting\npermutation. Inspired by Stanley's question for the maximal value of principal\nspecializations of Schubert polynomials, we resolve the analogous question for\n$\\beta=1$ Grothendieck polynomials, and provide bounds for general $\\beta$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
