The multiple probabilities are set in terms\nof recurrent integrations allowing several matrix computation a feasible task.\nAn application of the emerging probabilities is placed into a dynamic molecular\ndocking in the SARS-CoV-2 main protease. Finally, integration over multimatrix\nWishart distribution provides a simplification of a complex kernel integral in\nelliptical models under real normed division algebras and the solution was\napplied in elliptical affine shape theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
