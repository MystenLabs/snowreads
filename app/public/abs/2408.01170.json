The scattering cross-section, which characterizes a target's radar\nvisibility, is a key element in detection schemes and thus becomes a primary\nobjective in civilian applications. Here, we introduce a concept of genetically\ndesigned metamaterials, specifically engineered to enhance scattering for\nend-fire incidence scenarios. Multi-layer stacks of arrays, encompassing\nstrongly coupled electric and magnetic resonators, demonstrated above 1 m^2\nbroadband scattering at 10 GHz, despite having an end-fire physical\ncross-section smaller than one squared wavelength. Those performances, crucial\nfor effective civil radar air traffic monitoring, facilitate exploring highly\nscattering structures as labels for small airborne targets. This objective has\nbeen demonstrated with a set of outdoor experiments with the DJI Mini 2 drone.\nLightweight, conformal add-ons with significantly high scattering\ncross-sections can serve as auxiliary tools to empower passive monitoring\nsystems, thereby providing an additional layer of security in urban airspace.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
