The protocol is based on adiabatically transferring the atoms in the array\nto an antiferromagnetic-like state of Rydberg excitations using chirped laser\npulses. Upon exciting and de-exciting the atoms in the array under the blockage\nof nearest neighbors, depending on the state of the two qubits, the system\nacquires a conditional geometric $\\pi$-phase, while the dynamical phase cancels\nexactly, even when the atomic positions are disordered but nearly frozen in\ntime, which requires sufficiently low temperatures. For van der Waals\ninteracting atoms, under the optimal parameters of the pulses minimizing the\nRydberg-state decay and non-adiabatic errors, the gate infidelity scales with\nthe distance $L$ and the number of atoms $N$ between the qubits as $\\sim\nL^6/N^3$. Hence, increasing the number of atoms in the quantum bus connecting\nthe qubits at a given spatial separation will lead to higher gate fidelity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
