First, we classify all possible\nsupersymmetric gauge theories with a simple gauge group that have a nontrivial\none-form symmetry and flows to a superconformal field theory. Upon identifying\nunbroken discrete zero-form symmetries from the ABJ anomaly, we find that many\nof these theories have mixed zero-form/one-form 't Hooft anomalies. Then we\nclassify the relevant deformations of these SCFTs that preserve the anomaly.\nFrom this mixed anomaly together with the anomalies of the discrete zero-form\nsymmetries, we find obstructions for the relevant deformations of these SCFTs\nto flow to a trivially gapped phase. We also study non-Lagrangian SCFTs formed\nby gauging copies of Argyres-Douglas theories and constrain their deformations.\nIn particular, we explore a new duality between the diagonal gauging of two\n$\\mathcal{D}_3(SU(N))$ theories and $SU(N)$ gauge theory with two adjoints. We\nalso repeat our analysis for a host of non-supersymmetric gauge theories having\nnontrivial one-form symmetry including examples that appear to flow to\nBank-Zaks type CFTs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
