This can be incredibly useful when trying to develop an\nintrinsic definition of a holographic CFT. Recent work has established that in\nthe case of celestial CFTs, those dual to asymptotically flat spacetimes,\nmarginal operators can be constructed as shadow transforms of soft scalars. In\nthis work, rather than starting from a bulk theory of scalars, we start with\nYang-Mills and construct marginal operators from soft gluons via light\ntransforms and a new set of transformations called half-shadow transforms. We\nobtain the local metric and connections for the associated conformal manifold\nby studying the two- and three-point functions of these marginal operators. We\nthen discuss the implications of this for broadening our understanding of\noperator product expansions of soft operators in celestial CFTs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
