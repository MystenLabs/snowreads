We explore the similarities and differences between the descriptive\npower of low degree polynomial and unitary invariant tensors and provide\nevidence that in many cases of interest they have similar descriptive power. In\nparticular we prove that for the regular representation of a finite group,\npolynomial invariants of degree at most three separate generic orbits answering\na question posed in \\cite{bandeira2017estimation}. This complements a\npreviously known result for unitary invariants~\\cite{smach2008generalized}. We\nalso investigate these questions for subregular representations of finite\ngroups and prove that for the defining representation of the dihedral group,\npolynomial invariants of degree at most three separate generic orbits. This\nanswers a question posed in~\\cite{bendory2022dihedral} and it implies that the\nsample complexity of the corresponding MRA problem is $\\sim \\sigma^6$. On the\nother hand we also show that for the groups $D_n$ and $A_4$ generic orbits in\nthe {\\em complete multiplicity-free} representation cannot be separated by\ninvariants of degree at most three.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
