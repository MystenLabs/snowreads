One powerful tool in the arsenal of cybersecurity\nprofessionals is the attack graph, a representation of all potential attack\npaths within a system that an adversary might exploit to achieve a certain\nobjective. Traditional methods of generating attack graphs involve expert\nknowledge, manual curation, and computational algorithms that might not cover\nthe entire threat landscape due to the ever-evolving nature of vulnerabilities\nand exploits. This paper explores the approach of leveraging large language\nmodels (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, to automate the generation of attack graphs by\nintelligently chaining Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) based on\ntheir preconditions and effects. It also shows how to utilize LLMs to create\nattack graphs from threat reports.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GR0m5jFslbs-ESt6eqtd6tjCf9mzrajcimWmh4o5cYs","pdfSize":"1375528"}
