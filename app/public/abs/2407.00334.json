However, a closer look at this work\nreveals that further research is needed to examine some types of game-based\nlearning approaches such as virtual reality serious games and LEGO Serious\nPlay. This article examines and compares the effectiveness for learning Scrum\nand related agile practices of a serious game based on virtual reality and a\nlearning activity based on the LEGO Serious Play methodology. The presented\nstudy used a quasi-experimental design with two groups, pre- and post-tests,\nand a perceptions questionnaire. The sample was composed of 59 software\nengineering students, 22 of which belonged to group A, while the other 37 were\npart of group B. The students in group A played the virtual reality serious\ngame, whereas the students in group B conducted the LEGO Serious Play activity.\nThe results show that both game-based learning approaches were effective for\nlearning Scrum and related agile practices in terms of learning performance and\nmotivation, but they also show that the students who played the virtual reality\nserious game outperformed their peers from the other group in terms of learning\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MeGOz9BXJcAIYLAMWQp8-9Dfa47xH64VyWgpPZ8-haI","pdfSize":"2059778"}
