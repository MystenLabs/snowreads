This work\nprovides the necessary checks and synchronization protocols needed in the\nbroadcast-only GNSS context. We provide proof of security for each of our\nalgorithms under a delay-capable adversary. The algorithms included herein\nenable a GNSS receiver to use its onboard, GNSS-independent clock to determine\nwhether a message arrived at the correct time, to determine whether its\nonboard, GNSS-independent clock is safe to use and when the clock will no\nlonger be safe in the future due to predicted clock drift, and to resynchronize\nits onboard, GNSS-independent clock. Each algorithm is safe to use even when an\nadversary induces delays within the protocol. Moreover, we discuss the\nimplications of GNSS authentication schemes that use two simultaneous TESLA\ninstances of different authentication cadences. To a receiver implementer or\nstandards author, this work provides the necessary implementation algorithms to\nassert security and provides a comprehensive guide on why these methods are\nrequired.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TGUdsDAvOjDyZ8fSjf9QXI0-YowrHjdrgDWVMID5x6E","pdfSize":"1122003"}
