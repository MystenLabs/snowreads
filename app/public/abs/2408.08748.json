The number of boundary conditions to be\nprescribed at the boundary $x = 0$, depend on the number of characteristics\nentering the domain. Since our system is nonlinear the characteristic speeds\ndepends on the unknown and the direction of the characteristics curves are\nknown apriori. As it is well known, the boundary condition has to be understood\nin a generalised way. One of the standard way is using vanishing viscosity\nmethod. We use this method to construct solution for a particular class of\ninitial and boundary data, namely the initial and boundary datas that lie on\nthe level sets of one of the Riemann invariants.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
