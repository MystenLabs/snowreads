Initially this system appeared in description of the\nlarge scale structure formation. Recently it is derived as a second order\nqueueing model. We construct weakly asymptotic solutions of the initial\nboundary value problem for the system and interaction of waves in the quarter\nplane $\\{(x,t): x>0,t>0\\}$ with boundary Riemann solution centered at $(0,0)$\nand Riemann solution centered at a point $(x_0,0), x_0>0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
