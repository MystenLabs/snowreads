In this work, we use\nunrestricted Hartree-Fock to study the nature of this phase. We find a close\ncompetition between two incommensurate inter-valley coherent (IVC) phases: an\nIVC crystal where the ordering occurs at multiple wavevectors, and an IVC\nspiral with a single ordering wavevector. Focusing on one of the regimes where\nsuperconductivity is observed experimentally, we find a continuous (or very\nweakly first order) transition between a half metallic phase to an IVC crystal,\nfollowed by a first-order transition into an IVC spiral. Using time-dependent\nHartree-Fock, we study the collective mode spectrum in the half-metalic phase.\nWe find a soft inter-valley mode that can mediate superconductivity in a narrow\nsliver of density near the continuous transition, with a Tc that can reach a\nfew hundreds of mK and a sign-changing s-wave order parameter. The spin\nstiffness in the half metal phase is found to be surprisingly low, of the order\nof a few degrees Kelvin.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FpgVEuj9GzGwNHwIhgwyASkjvHJZ8mKjKcr3gMQsKks","pdfSize":"4188954"}
