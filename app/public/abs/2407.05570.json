In this study, we investigate the impact\nof initial-state fluctuations on the extraction of the speed of sound in a\nquark-gluon plasma in the ultra-central collisions. By employing the TRENTo\nmodel for simulating initial conditions, we demonstrate that these fluctuations\nlead to sizable volume effect, which in turn corrects the measured values of\nthe sound velocity. With respect to realistic conditions of high-energy\nheavy-ion experiments, we provide quantitative estimate of these corrections.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
