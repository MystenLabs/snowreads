ContactSDF first establishes an SDF using\nthe supporting plane representation of an object for collision detection, and\nthen use the generated contact dual cones to build a second SDF for time\nstepping prediction of the next state. Those two SDFs create a differentiable\nand closed-form multi-contact dynamic model for state prediction, enabling\nefficient model learning and optimization for contact-rich manipulation. We\nperform extensive simulation experiments to show the effectiveness of\nContactSDF for model learning and real-time control of dexterous manipulation.\nWe further evaluate the ContactSDF on a hardware Allegro hand for on-palm\nreorientation tasks. Results show with around 2 minutes of learning on\nhardware, the ContactSDF achieves high-quality dexterous manipulation at a\nfrequency of 30-60Hz.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
