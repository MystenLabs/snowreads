Studies have shown that having access\nto one's air quality context reinforces the user's urge to take necessary\nactions to improve the air over time. Thus, user's activities significantly\ninfluence the indoor air quality. Such correlation can be exploited to get hold\nof sensitive indoor activities from the side-channel air quality fluctuations.\nThis study explores the odds of identifying eight indoor activities (i.e.,\nenter, exit, fan on, fan off, AC on, AC off, gathering, eating) in a research\nlab with an in-house low-cost air quality monitoring platform named DALTON. Our\nextensive data collection and analysis over three months shows 97.7%\nclassification accuracy in our dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
