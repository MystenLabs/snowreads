Simplex codes are one-weight Griesmer $[\\frac{q^k-1}{q-1},k\n,q^{k-1}]_q$-linear codes and they meet all Griesmer bounds of the generalized\nHamming weights of linear codes. All the subcodes with dimension $r$ of a\n$[\\frac{q^k-1}{q-1},k ,q^{k-1}]_q$-simplex code have the same subcode support\nweight $\\frac{q^{k-r}(q^r-1)}{q-1}$ for $1\\leq r\\leq k$. In this paper, we\nconstruct linear codes meeting the Griesmer bound of the $r$-generalized\nHamming weight, such codes do not meet the Griesmer bound of the\n$j$-generalized Hamming weight for $1\\leq j<r$. Moreover these codes have only\nfew subcode support weights. The weight distribution and the subcode support\nweight distributions of these distance-optimal codes are determined. Linear\ncodes constructed in this paper are natural generalizations of distance-optimal\nfew-weight codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"5MyEgrQ4BMbR78jO6BS6iZWWsnYzEmO20Snqs_P7XEY","pdfSize":"315833"}
