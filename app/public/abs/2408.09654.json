It is shown to be a\ncombinatorial invariant, and it can be computed by inductive formulas. We also\nconjecture that the generalization to arbitrary matroid is non-negative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
