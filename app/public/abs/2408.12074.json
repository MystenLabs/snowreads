Although infinite families\nof finite $s$-arc transitive digraphs of arbitrary valency were constructed by\nthe third author in 1989, existence of a vertex-primitive $2$-arc-transitive\ndigraph was not known until an infinite family was constructed by the second\nauthor with Li and Xia in 2017. This led to a conjecture by the second author\nand Xia in 2018 that, for a finite vertex-primitive $s$-arc-transitive digraph,\n$s$ is at most $2$, together with their proof that it is sufficient to prove\nthe conjecture for digraphs with an almost simple group of automorphisms. This\npaper confirms the conjecture for finite symplectic groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
