Modeling an individual tooth can be challenging and intricate to\naccomplish, especially when fillings and other restorations introduce\nartifacts. This paper proposes a method for automatically detecting,\nidentifying, and extracting teeth from CBCT images. Our approach involves\ndividing the three-dimensional images into axial slices for image detection.\nTeeth are pinpointed and labeled using a single-stage object detector.\nSubsequently, bounding boxes are delineated and identified to create\nthree-dimensional representations of each tooth. The proposed solution has been\nsuccessfully integrated into the dental analysis tool Dentomo.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
