Here, we extend this\ntechnique to chip-integrated Fabry-P\\'erot microresonators, which offer\nhigh-quality factors and large mode volumes in a compact footprint, reducing\nfundamental thermo-refractive noise. The resonators consist of a silicon\nnitride waveguide terminated by two photonic crystal reflectors fabricated via\nscalable ultraviolet lithography. Evanescent side-coupling allows precise\ntuning of the SIL feedback mechanism. We present a theoretical model and\nexperimentally demonstrate SIL, resulting in a fundamental\nthermorefractive-noise-limited laser. We achieve excellent agreement between\nthe experimental results and theoretical model. These results complement\ncurrent SIL techniques and are relevant to chip-scale low-noise laser systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
