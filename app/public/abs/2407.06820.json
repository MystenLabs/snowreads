Despite\nthe acknowledged influence of close contacts on how we perceive the world, the\nrole of the broader social environment remains opaque. Here, we leverage a\nunique combination of population-scale social network and survey data on\nperceptions of immigration. We find that both direct contacts and a wider\nsocial network exposure to migrants matter. Notably, for natives, network\nexposure shows a shift from positive to negative association with perceptions\nof immigration beyond a certain exposure threshold. The multi-layer nature of\nour data highlights this tipping point for next-door neighbors, with private\nsocial contexts exhibiting a positive relationship between exposure and\nimmigration perceptions. Furthermore, it shows that contacts spanning multiple\ncontexts also strengthen this relationship. The provided insights on the\ninterplay between network composition and attitudes toward immigration\nhighlight generic patterns shaping public opinion on pressing societal issues.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
