We\nshow that the total probability of velocities strictly outside the support of\nthe asymptotic measure goes to zero exponentially with $t$, and we provide a\nsimple method to estimate the exponential rate uniformly in the initial state.\nNear the boundary of the allowed region the rate function goes to zero like the\npower 3/2 of the distance to the boundary. The method is illustrated in several\nexamples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
