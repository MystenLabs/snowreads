Because plasma equilibria often involve\nplasma flows, for instance in astrophysics or in magnetic confinement nuclear\nfusion devices, understanding the effect of motion on plasma waves is\nimportant. Meanwhile, the presence of a background magnetic field in a plasma\nmakes it anisotropic. To address this problem, we derive here ray tracing\nequations for the trajectory of rays propagating in a moving anisotropic\nmedium. The proposed approach is to use an effective dispersion relation for\nthe moving medium as seen from the laboratory, obtained by performing a Lorentz\ntransformation of the dispersion relation known for the medium at rest. This\nformalism is illustrated by considering the standard ordinary and extraordinary\nmodes in a magnetized plasma at rest. Although we work here at lowest order in\nthe geometrical optics approximation, this method is a first step towards\nhigher order expansions, as required for instance to capture polarization\neffects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
