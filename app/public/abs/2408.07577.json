In this work, we theoretically\ninvestigate the generation of squeezed states of light through HHG processes in\natomic systems that had been initially driven to their first excited state. Our\nstudy reveals significant single-mode squeezing in both the driving field and\nlow-order harmonic modes. Additionally, we characterize two-mode squeezing\nfeatures in the generated states, both between fundamental and harmonic modes,\nand among the harmonic modes themselves. Using these correlations, we\ndemonstrate the generation of optical Schr\\\"odinger kitten states through\nheralding measurements, specifically via photon subtraction in one of the modes\ninfluenced by two-mode squeezing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
