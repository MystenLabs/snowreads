We conducted a systematic\nliterature review of research into AI-based assistive technology for persons\nwith visual impairments. Our study shows that most proposed technologies with a\ntestable prototype have not been evaluated in a human study with members of the\nsight-loss community. Furthermore, many studies did not consider or report\nfailure cases or possible risks. These findings highlight the importance of\ninclusive system evaluations and the necessity of standardizing methods for\npresenting and analyzing failure cases and threats when developing AI-based\nassistive technologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
