This prompts an investigation into the stability\nof the magnetic order in NiI$_2$ and similar materials under external stimuli.\nIn this work, we report the effect of biaxial and uniaxial strain on the\nmagnetic ground state, the critical temperature, and the magnonic properties of\nthe NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br, Cl) monolayers. For all three materials, we reveal\nintricate strain-dependent phase diagrams, including ferromagnetic,\nhelimagnetic, and skyrmionic phases. Moreover, we discuss the necessity of\nconsidering the biquadratic exchange interaction in the latter analysis. We\nreveal that the biquadratic exchange significantly alters both the magnetic\nground state and the critical temperature of the magnetic order, and we\ndemonstrate that its importance becomes even more explicit when monolayer\nNi-dihalides are strained. Finally, we calculate the magnonic dispersion for\nthe predicted magnetic states, showing that the skyrmionic phase functions as a\nmagnonic crystal, and demonstrate the presence of strain-tunable soft magnon\nmodes at finite wavevectors in the helimagnetic phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
