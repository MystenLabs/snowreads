In this paper we uncover a wide\nset of new wco space-time tradeoffs: we (1) introduce new compact indices that\nhandle multijoins in wco time, and (2) combine them with new query resolution\nstrategies that offer better times in practice. As a result, we improve the\naverage query times of current compact representations by a factor of up to 13\nto produce the first 1000 results, and using twice their space, reduce their\ntotal average query time by a factor of 2. Our experiments suggest that there\nis more room for improvement in terms of generating better query plans for\nmultijoins.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m-m_SZqOExvUm08wwgGf3xya5RghqQckqkNAfr9Z24g","pdfSize":"972779","txDigest":"6MmbjBGvsh9gXwAZj61sTHwk26tpN8429Ps4dc3itwDy","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
