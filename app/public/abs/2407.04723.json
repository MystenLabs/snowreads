The significant wave height is expected to\nmonotonically increase with opposing streams and to decrease with following\nstreams. To some extent, observations on data sets containing a few thousand of\nwaves or over a continuous series of about a day confirm this prediction. Here,\nbased on a multi-year dataset, we show that in very broad-banded seas with high\ndirectional spread, the asymptotic behavior of sea variables is highly\nnon-trivial and does not follow the theoretical predictions, especially at high\nvalues of the ratio between tidal stream and group speed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
