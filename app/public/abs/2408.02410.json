Nonetheless, real-life scenarios often entail community interactions\namong numerous individuals. To address this, we introduce an extended version\nof the Ultimatum Game, called the Multi-Proposer-Multi-Responder Ultimatum\nGame. In this model, multiple responders and proposers simultaneously interact\nin a one-shot game, introducing competition both within proposers and within\nresponders. We derive subgame-perfect Nash equilibria for all scenarios and\nexplore how these non-trivial values might provide insight into proposal and\nrejection behavior experimentally observed in the context of one vs. one\nUltimatum Game scenarios. Additionally, by considering the asymptotic numbers\nof players, we propose two potential estimates for a \"fair\" threshold: either\n31.8% or 36.8% of the pie (share) for the responder.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
