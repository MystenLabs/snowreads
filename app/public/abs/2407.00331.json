The problem is NP-hard. In\nthis paper, we consider a line-constrained version in which all disks have\ntheir centers on a line. We present an $O(m\\log^2n+(n+m)\\log(n+m))$ time\nalgorithm for the problem. This improves the previously best result of\n$O(m^2\\log m+(n+m)\\log(n+m))$ time for the weighted case of the problem where\nevery point of $P$ has a weight and the objective is to minimize the total\nweight of the hitting set. Our algorithm actually solves a more general\nline-separable problem with a single intersection property: The points of $P$\nand the disk centers are separated by a line $\\ell$ and the boundary of every\ntwo disks intersect at most once on the side of $\\ell$ containing $P$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
