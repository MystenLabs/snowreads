This paper presents a novel shared-token,\nmulti-class, semi-open queueing network model to account for multi-line orders\nwith general distribution forms in MTSR systems. The numerical results obtained\nfrom solving the SOQN model are validated against discrete-event simulation,\nwith most key performance metrics demonstrating high accuracy. In our\nexperimental setting, results indicate a 12.5% reduction in the minimum number\nof robots needed to satisfy a specific order arrival rate using the closest\nretrieval sequence policy compared with the random policy. Increasing the\nnumber of tote buffer positions on a robot can greatly reduce the number of\nrobots required in the warehouse.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
