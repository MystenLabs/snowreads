Here, we introduce\nSOLAX, a Python library designed to compute and analyze fermionic quantum\nsystems using the formalism of second quantization. SOLAX provides a modular\nframework for constructing and manipulating basis sets, quantum states, and\noperators, facilitating the simulation of electronic structures and determining\nmany-body quantum states in finite-size Hilbert spaces. The library integrates\nmachine learning capabilities to mitigate the exponential growth of Hilbert\nspace dimensions in large quantum clusters. The core low-level functionalities\nare implemented using the recently developed Python library JAX. Demonstrated\nthrough its application to the Single Impurity Anderson Model, SOLAX offers a\nflexible and powerful tool for researchers addressing the challenges of\nmany-body quantum systems across a broad spectrum of fields, including atomic\nphysics, quantum chemistry, and condensed matter physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Mn_IEJLu0RlahbPD4WhggsppMMCyFwwT5wwpH6tRBzY","pdfSize":"532006"}
