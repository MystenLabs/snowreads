To\ndescribe steady states of such systems one has to study an eigenproblem of the\nform $A\\otimes_{\\omega} x=\\lambda+x$ where $\\otimes_{\\omega}$ is the\nmaxmin-$\\omega$ matrix-vector multiplication. This eigenproblem can be viewed\nin more general framework of nonlinear Perron-Frobenius theory. However,\ninstead of studying such eigenspaces directly we develop a different approach:\nover-approximation by zones. These are traditionally convex sets of special\nkind which proved to be highly useful in computer science and also relevant in\ntropical convexity. We first construct a sequence of zones over-approximating a\nmaxmin-$\\omega$ eigenspace. Next, the limit of this sequence is refined in a\nheuristic procedure, which yields a refined zone and also the eigenvalue\n$\\lambda$ with a high success rate. Based on the numerical experiments, in\nsuccessful cases there is a column of the difference bound matrix (DBM)\nrepresentation of the refined zone which yields an eigenvector.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
