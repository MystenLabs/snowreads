However, extracting detailed,\nframe-by-frame information on player actions from these videos remains a\nchallenge. Utilizing state-of-the-art computer vision technologies, our system\ncan detect key objects such as soccer balls, players and referees. It also\ntracks the movements of players and the ball, recognizes player numbers,\nclassifies scenes, and identifies highlights such as goal kicks. By analyzing\nlive TV streams of soccer matches, our system can generate highlight GIFs,\ntactical illustrations, and diverse summary graphs of ongoing games. Through\nthese visual recognition techniques, we deliver a comprehensive understanding\nof soccer game videos, enriching the viewer's experience with detailed and\ninsightful analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
