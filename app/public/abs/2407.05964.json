While laboratory-based high-harmonic generation\n(HHG) light sources provide the required photon energies, their limited photon\nflux is distributed over a wide spectral range, rendering typical monochromatic\ndiffraction schemes challenging. Here, we present a scheme for\nenergy-dispersive soft-x-ray diffraction with femtosecond temporal resolution\nand photon energies across the water window from 200 to 600 eV. The experiment\nutilizes the broadband nature of the HHG emission to efficiently probe large\nslices in reciprocal space. As a proof-of-concept, we study the laser-induced\nstructural dynamics of a Mo/Si superlattice in an ultrafast, non-resonant\nsoft-x-ray diffraction experiment. We extract the underlying strain dynamics\nfrom the measured shift of its first order superlattice Bragg peak in\nreciprocal space at photon energies around 500 eV via soft-x-ray scattering\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"e-90GcTM9lRKCqgrSKZaOBa-TDI-yxbjlXmVaWhEEgQ","pdfSize":"2064778"}
