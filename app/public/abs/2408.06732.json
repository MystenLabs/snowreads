The effect of utterance length, where speech rate is faster and less\nvariable for longer utterances, has also been shown to reduce the role of\nsocial factors once it has been accounted for, leaving unclear the relationship\nbetween social factors and speech production in conditioning speech rate.\nThrough modelling of speech rate across 13 English speech corpora, it is found\nthat utterance length has the largest effect on speech rate, though this effect\nitself varies little across corpora and speakers. While age and gender also\nmodulate speech rate, their effects are much smaller in magnitude. These\nfindings suggest utterance length effects may be conditioned by articulatory\nand perceptual constraints, and that social influences on speech rate should be\ninterpreted in the broader context of how speech rate variation is structured.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_KR6g1uQZLaMuYT6p1KZCCYw8fM9nNZcPnCUJMhJyno","pdfSize":"303770"}
