This letter addresses a more general and dynamic task:\nsimultaneously tracking time-varying contact force in the surface normal\ndirection and motion trajectories on tangential surfaces. We propose a pipeline\nthat includes a contact-aware trajectory planner to generate dynamically\nfeasible trajectories, and a hybrid motion-force controller to track such\ntrajectories. We demonstrate the approach in an aerial calligraphy task using a\nnovel sponge pen design as the end-effector, whose stroke width is proportional\nto the contact force. Additionally, we develop a touchscreen interface for\nflexible user input. Experiments show our method can effectively draw diverse\nletters, achieving an IoU of 0.59 and an end-effector position (force) tracking\nRMSE of 2.9 cm (0.7 N).
