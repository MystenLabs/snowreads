Our results reveal the presence of a\ncharacteristic rate $r_c \\sim L^{-z}$, where $L$ represents the system size and\n$z$ denotes the dynamical exponent. Below $r_c$, both the equilibrium and\ndynamical properties remain unchanged. At the same time, for $r > r_c$, the\nresetting process induces a transition in the probability distribution of the\nmagnetization from a double-peak distribution to a three-peak distribution,\nultimately culminating in a single-peak exponential decay. Besides, we also\nfind that at the critical points, as $r$ increases, the diffusion of the\nmagnetization changes from anomalous to normal, and the correlation time shifts\nfrom being dependent on $L$ to being $r$-dependent only.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
