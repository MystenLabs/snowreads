Our final system achieved an\nF-measure score of 56.4%, securing the 2nd rank in the few-shot bioacoustic\nevent detection category of the Detection and Classification of Acoustic Scenes\nand Events Challenge 2024.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
