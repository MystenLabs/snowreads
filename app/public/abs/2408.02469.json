Three different types of superlattice active regions and waveguide\nlayer compositions were grown. Using a superlattice allows to downshift the\nenergy position of the miniband, as compared to thin InGaAs quantum wells,\nhaving the same composition, being beneficial for high-temperature operation.\nVery low internal loss (~6$cm^{-1}$), low transparency current density of ~500$\nA/cm^2$, together with 46$ cm^{-1}$ modal gain and 53 % internal efficiency\nwere observed for broad-area lasers with an active region based on a highly\nstrained $In_{0.74}Ga_{0.26}As/In_{0.53}Al_{0.25}Ga_{0.22}As$ superlattice.\nCharacteristic temperatures $T_0$ and $T_1$ were improved up to 76 K and 100 K,\nrespectively. These data suggest that such superlattices have also the\npotential to much improve VCSEL properties at this wavelength.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XgALiBSkfvtyrA1gaOnUOlke_wP5vSipNSIV--yzBxE","pdfSize":"721736","txDigest":"8KvJqVTNhTh2iFKBkmzSZ8K9pNzyaLcobEcdTAfjBCxf","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
