The challenge here is that optimal\ntransport along a null hypersurface is completely degenerate, as the cost takes\nonly the two values $0$ and $+\\infty$.\n  The tools developed in the manuscript enable to give an optimal transport\ncharacterization of the null energy condition (namely, non-negative Ricci\ncurvature in the null directions) for Lorentzian manifolds in terms of\nconvexity properties of the Boltzmann--Shannon entropy along null-geodesics of\nprobability measures.\n  We obtain as applications: a stability result under convergence of\nspacetimes, a comparison result for null-cones, and the Hawking area theorem\n(both in sharp form, for possibly weighted measures, and with apparently new\nrigidity statements).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
