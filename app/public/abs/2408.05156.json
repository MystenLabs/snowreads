Neuromorphic devices effectively address this energy challenge.\nHowever, the general neuromorphic KWS pipeline, from microphone to Spiking\nNeural Network (SNN), entails multiple processing stages. Leveraging the\npopularity of Pulse Density Modulation (PDM) microphones in modern devices and\ntheir similarity to spiking neurons, we propose a direct microphone-to-SNN\nconnection. This approach eliminates intermediate stages, notably reducing\ncomputational costs. The system achieved an accuracy of 91.54\\% on the Google\nSpeech Command (GSC) dataset, surpassing the state-of-the-art for the Spiking\nSpeech Command (SSC) dataset which is a bio-inspired encoded GSC. Furthermore,\nthe observed sparsity in network activity and connectivity indicates potential\nfor remarkably low energy consumption in a neuromorphic device implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
