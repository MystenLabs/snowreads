It\nassumes a set of FLRW patches that evolve independently, but in doing so, all\nthe gradient terms are discarded, which are not negligibly small in models\nbeyond slow-roll. In this paper, we extend the formalism to capture these\ngradient corrections by encoding them in a homogeneous-spatial-curvature\ncontribution assigned to each FLRW patch. For a concrete example, we apply this\nformalism to the ultra-slow-roll inflation, and find that it can correctly\ndescribe the large-scale evolution of the comoving curvature perturbation from\nthe horizon exit. We also briefly discuss non-Gaussianities in this context.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
