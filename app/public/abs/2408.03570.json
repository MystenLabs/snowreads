Employing a\nmeticulous dimensionless analysis, we derive several novel hydrodynamic models\nvia the moments' method. For a certain class of scaled Boltzmann equations\ngoverning gas mixtures of two species, we rigorously establish the two-fluid\nincompressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system as the hydrodynamic limit. This\nvalidation is achieved through the Hilbert expansion around the global\nMaxwellian and refined energy estimates based on the Macro-Micro decomposition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
