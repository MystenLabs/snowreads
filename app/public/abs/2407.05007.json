During crises, organisations such as the World\nFood Programme use remotely sensed imagery, typically obtained through drones,\nfor rapid situational analysis to plan life-saving actions. Computer Vision\ntools are needed to support task force experts on-site in the evaluation of the\nimagery to improve their efficiency and to allocate resources strategically. We\nintroduce the BlessemFlood21 dataset to stimulate research on efficient flood\ndetection tools. The imagery was acquired during the 2021 Erftstadt-Blessem\nflooding event and consists of high-resolution and georeferenced RGB-NIR\nimages. In the resulting RGB dataset, the images are supplemented with detailed\nwater masks, obtained via a semi-supervised human-in-the-loop technique, where\nin particular the NIR information is leveraged to classify pixels as either\nwater or non-water. We evaluate our dataset by training and testing established\nDeep Learning models for semantic segmentation. With BlessemFlood21 we provide\nlabeled high-resolution RGB data and a baseline for further development of\nalgorithmic solutions tailored to flood detection in RGB imagery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
