In gapped two-dimensional lattice models with well-defined\ntight-binding Hamiltonians, we show that the entanglement entropy is intimately\nrelated to the quantum metric of electronic states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TkrpA-S6H9JJAcR4VYMIGiV9tBNO8_Axm_6rieMyT0o","pdfSize":"1002827"}
