To fully\nleverage KAN's interpretability, a general framework is proposed considering\ncomplex uncertainties. The stochastic optimal power flow problem in hybrid\nAC/DC systems is chosen as a particularly tough case study for demonstrating\nthe effectiveness of this framework.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
