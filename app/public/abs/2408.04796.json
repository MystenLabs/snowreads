In this study,\nwe develop an ensemble estimator of density ratios with a novel loss function\nbased on super learning. We show that this novel loss function is qualified for\nbuilding super learners. Two simulations corresponding to mediation analysis\nand longitudinal modified treatment policy in causal inference, where density\nratios are nuisance parameters, are conducted to show our density ratio super\nlearner's performance empirically.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
