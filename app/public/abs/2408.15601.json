This work calls attention to the deficiency\nof current particle-based diffusion models, which represent atoms as a point\ncloud, in generating even the simplest ordered crystalline structures. The\nproblem is attributed to particles being trapped in local minima during the\nscore-driven simulated annealing of the diffusion process, similar to the\nphysical process of force-driven simulated annealing. We develop a solution,\nthe grand canonical diffusion model, which adopts an alternative voxel-based\nrepresentation with continuous rather than fixed number of particles. The\nmethod is applied towards generation of several common crystalline phases as\nwell as the technologically important and challenging problem of grain boundary\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
