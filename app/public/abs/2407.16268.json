We present an approach that integrates\nKolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) classification heads and Fuzzy Pooling into\nconvolutional neural networks (CNNs). By utilizing the interpretability of KAN\nand the uncertainty handling capabilities of fuzzy logic, the integration shows\npotential for improved performance in image classification tasks. Our\ncomparative analysis demonstrates that the modified CNN architecture with KAN\nand Fuzzy Pooling achieves comparable or higher accuracy than traditional\nmodels. The findings highlight the effectiveness of combining fuzzy logic and\nKAN to develop more interpretable and efficient deep learning models. Future\nwork will aim to expand this approach across larger datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
