However, a tree fails\nto capture ancestral reticulate processes, such as the formation of hybrid\nspecies or lateral gene transfer events between lineages, and so the history of\nlife is more accurately described by a rooted phylogenetic network.\nNevertheless, phylogenetic networks may be complex and difficult to interpret,\nso biologists sometimes prefer a tree that summarises the central tree-like\ntrend of evolution. In this paper, we formally investigate methods for\ntransforming an arbitrary phylogenetic network into a tree (on the same set of\nleaves) and ask which ones (if any) satisfy a simple consistency condition.\nThis consistency condition states that if we add additional species into a\nphylogenetic network (without otherwise changing this original network) then\ntransforming this enlarged network into a rooted phylogenetic tree induces the\nsame tree on the original set of species as transforming the original network.\nWe show that the LSA (lowest stable ancestor) tree method satisfies this\nconsistency property, whereas several other commonly used methods (and a new\none we introduce) do not. We also briefly consider transformations that convert\narbitrary phylogenetic networks to another simpler class, namely normal\nnetworks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
