However, existing methods often\nsuffer from client drift, leading to inconsistent performance and delayed\ntraining. We propose a new framework, Personalized Federated Learning via\nFeature Enhancement (pFLFE), designed to mitigate these challenges. pFLFE\nconsists of two main stages: feature enhancement and supervised learning. The\nfirst stage improves differentiation between foreground and background\nfeatures, and the second uses these enhanced features for learning from\nsegmentation masks. We also design an alternative training approach that\nrequires fewer communication rounds without compromising segmentation quality,\neven with limited communication resources. Through experiments on three medical\nsegmentation tasks, we demonstrate that pFLFE outperforms the state-of-the-art\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KMfsdCIDlqHssQjQG_xm1ZQbNWfoqCvmHcN7pz_FtJw","pdfSize":"5264283"}
