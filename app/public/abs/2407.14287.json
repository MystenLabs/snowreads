Due to the large amount of experimental data\naccumulated by Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), the total electron\ncontent (TEC) response to the impulsive phase of a solar flare has been studied\nquite well. However, recent studies have shown that large fraction of X-class\nflares have second strong peak of warm coronal emission (which is called 'EUV\nlate phase'), whose influence on the ionization of ionospheric layers is not\nyet clear. A combined analysis of successive solar emissions and the caused TEC\nchanges made it possible to numerically estimate the ionospheric response to\nthe impulsive, gradual, and late phases of the X2.9 solar flare occurred on\n2011 November 3 and demonstrate the high geoeffectiveness of the rather weak Fe\nXV 28.4 nm solar emission during the EUV late phase. It was found that the\nionospheric response to the relatively weak emissions of the EUV late phase of\nthe X2.9 solar flare amounted to almost a third of the TEC increase during the\nimpulsive phase.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lr3mbMkuxMgtdGMEAYROsx6bow8e9s201HFkLNDMgqM","pdfSize":"3125268"}
