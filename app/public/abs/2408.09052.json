Using Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations, this\nconfiguration is revisited within a more accurate modelling approach to analyze\nand optimize the mechanism responsible for electron acceleration. In\nparticular, an analytical model for a linearly polarized tightly-focused\nultrashort laser field is derived and coupled to a PIC code, allowing us to\nmodel the interaction of laser beams reflected by high-numerical aperture\nmirrors with laser-induced plasmas. A set of 3D PIC simulations is performed\nwhere the laser wavelength is varied from 800 nm to 7.0 $\\mu$m while the\nnormalized amplitude of the electric field is varied from $a_{0} = 3.6$ to\n$a_{0} = 7.0$. The preferential forward acceleration of electrons, as well as\nthe analysis of the laser intensity evolution in the plasma and data on\nelectron number density, confirm that the relativistic ponderomotive force is\nresponsible for the acceleration. We also demonstrate that the electron kinetic\nenergy reaches a maximum of $\\approx1.6$ MeV when the central wavelength is of\n2.5 $\\mu$m.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
