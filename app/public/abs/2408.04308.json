A\n$t$-interval (or $t$-track interval) is a set that can be written as the union\nof $t$ closed intervals, each on a different line. It is known that pairwise\nintersecting $2$-intervals can be pierced by two points, one from each line.\nHowever, it is not true that every set of pairwise intersecting $3$-intervals\ncan be pierced by three points, one from each line. For $k\\ge 3$, Kaiser and\nRabinovich asked whether $k$-wise intersecting $t$-intervals can be pierced by\n$t$ points, one from each line. Our main result provides an asymptotic answer:\nin any set $S_1,\\dots,S_n$ of $k$-wise intersecting $t$-intervals, at least\n$\\frac{k-1}{k+1}n$ can be pierced by $t$ points, one from each line. We prove\nthis in a more general form, replacing intervals by subtrees of a tree. This\nleads to questions and results on covering vertices of edge-colored complete\ngraphs by vertices of monochromatic cliques having distinct colors, where the\ncolorings are chordal, or more generally induced $C_4$-free graphs. For\ninstance, we show that if the edges of a complete graph $K_n$ are colored with\nred or blue so that both color classes are induced $C_4$-free, then at least\n${4n\\over 5}$ vertices can be covered by a red and a blue clique, and this is\nbest possible. We conclude by pointing to new Ramsey-type problems emerging\nfrom these restricted colorings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
