Traditional anomaly detection methods analyze\nreconstructed images to identify pathological structures. However, these\nmethods may produce suboptimal results, overlooking subtle differences among\nvarious tissue types. To address this challenge, here we employ generative\ndiffusion prior to inpaint the liver as the reference facilitating anomaly\ndetection. Specifically, we use an adaptive threshold to extract a mask of\nabnormal regions, which are then inpainted using a diffusion prior to\ncalculating an anomaly score based on the discrepancy between the original CT\nimage and the inpainted counterpart. Our methodology has been tested on two\nliver CT datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement in detection\naccuracy, with a 7.9% boost in the area under the curve (AUC) compared to the\nstate-of-the-art. This performance gain underscores the potential of our\napproach to refine the radiological assessment of liver diseases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
