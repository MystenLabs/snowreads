The study conducts a thorough and multifaceted analysis,\nfocusing on the execution speed, prediction accuracy, and scalability of both\nsequential and parallel implementations. A significant emphasis is placed on\nefficiently managing large datasets. The findings demonstrate notable\nimprovements in computational efficiency and data processing capabilities\nthrough the parallel approach, all while maintaining the accuracy and integrity\nof predictions. This new method provides a versatile and reliable solution for\nreal-time predictive analysis and enhances energy resource management, which is\nparticularly crucial for developing areas. In addition to highlighting the\ntechnical advantages of parallel computing in this field, the study explores\nits practical impacts on energy planning and sustainable development in regions\nlike Puno.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
