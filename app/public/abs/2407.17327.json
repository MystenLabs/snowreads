We include a fugacity parameter that\nallows quarks to be out of chemical equilibrium and we account for the\ndifferent collision rates of quarks and gluons, which are related by Casimir\nscaling. Based on these assumptions, we numerically determine the evolution of\na large set of moments of the quark and gluon distribution functions and\nreconstruct their entire distribution functions. We find that both late and\nearly-time attractors exist for all moments of the distribution functions\ncontaining more than one power of the squared longitudinal momentum. These\nattractors emerge long before the system reaches the regime where hydrodynamic\napproximations apply. In addition, we discuss how the shear viscous corrections\nand entropy density of the fluid mixture evolve and consider the properties of\ntheir respective attractors. Finally, the entropy production is also\ninvestigated for different initial values of momentum anisotropy and quark\nabundance.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
