In\nparticular, we characterize the measures $\\mu$ for which the operator\n$\\Gamma_\\mu$ is bounded and we provide estimates of its operator norm. Finally,\nwe also describe when $\\Gamma_\\mu$ is compact by computing its essential norm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
