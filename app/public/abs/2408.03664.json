However, the injection of fluids into the\nEarth's crust, essential for these activities, can induce or trigger\nearthquakes. In this paper, we highlight a new approach based on Reinforcement\nLearning for the control of human-induced seismicity in the highly complex\nenvironment of an underground reservoir. This complex system poses significant\nchallenges in the control design due to parameter uncertainties and unmodeled\ndynamics. We show that the reinforcement learning algorithm can interact\nefficiently with a robust controller, by choosing the controller parameters in\nreal-time, reducing human-induced seismicity and allowing the consideration of\nfurther production objectives, \\textit{e.g.}, minimal control power.\nSimulations are presented for a simplified underground reservoir under various\nenergy demand scenarios, demonstrating the reliability and effectiveness of the\nproposed control-reinforcement learning approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pXW37qDOqofpJ5YkSVStjYoLZ7DTgpaS82JIGycx6WY","pdfSize":"1108327"}
