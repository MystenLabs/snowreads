However, current methods for skill-assessment from video only\nprovide scores or compare demonstrations, leaving the burden of knowing what to\ndo differently on the user. We introduce a novel method to generate actionable\nfeedback from video of a person doing a physical activity, such as basketball\nor soccer. Our method takes a video demonstration and its accompanying 3D body\npose and generates (1) free-form expert commentary describing what the person\nis doing well and what they could improve, and (2) a visual expert\ndemonstration that incorporates the required corrections. We show how to\nleverage Ego-Exo4D's videos of skilled activity and expert commentary together\nwith a strong language model to create a weakly-supervised training dataset for\nthis task, and we devise a multimodal video-language model to infer coaching\nfeedback. Our method is able to reason across multi-modal input combinations to\noutput full-spectrum, actionable coaching -- expert commentary, expert video\nretrieval, and the first-of-its-kind expert pose generation -- outperforming\nstrong vision-language models on both established metrics and human preference\nstudies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
