Using the example of ethylene excited to its $1s\\pi^{*}$\nmanifold, we demonstrate that ultrafast, few-femtosecond core-level charge\ntransfer may occur following core-excitation, driven by the formation of\nelectronic coherences by non-adiabatic dynamics. Here, transfer of\ncore-electron density from one side of the molecule to the other is driven by a\nbreakdown of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, and results in core-hole\nlocalisation occuring within 5 fs, followed by core-hole delocalisation, all\nwithin the Auger decay window. These results serve to demonstrate that\nultra-fast core-level charge transfer driven by nuclear dynamics may occur on\nthe same timescale as purely electronic, i.e., charge migration, dynamics\nfollowing core-excitation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
