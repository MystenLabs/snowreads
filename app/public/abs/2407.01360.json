Experimental results show relying on the first\ntoken of the word for technique prediction produces the best performance. In\naddition, incorporating genre information as a feature further enhances the\nmodel's performance. Our system achieved a score of 25.41, placing us 4$^{th}$\non the leaderboard. Subsequent post-submission improvements further raised our\nscore to 26.68.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
