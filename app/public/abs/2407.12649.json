The task is generally hard, requiring\nexponentially many measurements if no prior assumptions are made on the\nprocess. However, an interesting feature of the classically-simulable Clifford\ngroup is that unknown Clifford operations may be efficiently determined from a\nblack-box implementation. We extend this result to the important class of\nfermionic Gaussian operations. These operations have received much attention\ndue to their close links to fermionic linear optics. We then introduce an\ninfinite family of unitary gates, called the Matchgate Hierarchy, with a\nsimilar structure to the Clifford Hierarchy. We show that the Clifford\nHierarchy is contained within the Matchgate Hierarchy and how operations at any\nlevel of the hierarchy can be efficiently learned.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UkpVJZghe6Z6LM7k17ceDj8-XeWa0pzDLXPbiaIf9FI","pdfSize":"323350"}
