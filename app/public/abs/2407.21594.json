Basic proofs and examples\nillustrate that the stable rank does not satisfy any of the fundamental rank\nproperties, while the intrinsic dimension satisfies a few. In particular, the\nstable rank and intrinsic dimension of a submatrix can exceed those of the\noriginal matrix; adding a Hermitian positive semi-definite matrix can lower the\nintrinsic dimension of the sum; and multiplication by a nonsingular matrix can\ndrastically change the stable rank and the intrinsic dimension. We generalize\nthe concept of stable rank to the p-stable in a Schatten p-norm, thereby\nunifying the concepts of stable rank and intrinsic dimension: The stable rank\nis the 2-stable rank, while the intrinsic dimension is the 1-stable rank of a\nHermitian positive semi-definite matrix. We derive sum and product inequalities\nfor the pth root of the p-stable rank, and show that it is well-conditioned in\nthe norm-wise absolute sense. The conditioning improves if the matrix and the\nperturbation are Hermitian positive semi-definite.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
