Metalorganic\nmagnets, involving the coordination of metal atoms with specific organic\nligands, are a focus of intense research. These magnets offer customizable\nproperties through synthetic adjustments to ligands or coordination chemistry.\nHere the synthesis, structural characterization, and magnetic properties of the\n2D cyanocarbon magnet NiTCNE is reported. 2D-crystalline domains of this\nsingle-layered metalorganic network reach sizes exceeding 30 nanometers through\nco-deposition of the ligand TCNE (tetracyanoethylene) and Ni atoms on an\nAu(111) surface under ultrahigh vacuum conditions. Non-contact atomic force\nmicroscopy visualizes the structure with atomic resolution. X-ray magnetic\ncircular dichroism establishes the 2D NiTCNE as a ferromagnet, with a very high\nmagnetic remanence, a coercive field of around 1 tesla and a Curie temperature\nbetween 10 and 20 kelvin. As metalorganic chemistry opens a large variety of\nroutes of synthesis, we anticipate that this materials research paves the way\nto new magnetic nanomaterials for spintronics applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
