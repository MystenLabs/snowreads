The analysis is done in the time-domain\navoiding the need to use Fourier transformation. This allows considering\ngeneral incident waves avoiding band limited ones as usually used in the\nliterature. Most importantly, the outcome is as follows: 1. As the bubbles are\nresonating, with the unique subwavelength Minnaert resonance, the derived\neffective wave model is dispersive. Precisely, the effective acoustic model is\nan integro-differential one with a time-convolution term highlighting the\nresonance effect. 2. The periodicity in distributing the cluster of bubbles is\nnot needed, contrary to the case of using traditional two-scale homogenization\nprocedures. Precisely, given any $C^1$-smooth function $K$, we can distribute\nthe bubbles so that locally the number of such bubbles is dictated by $K$. In\naddition to its dispersive character, the effective model is affected by the\nfunction $K$. Such freedom and generality is appreciable in different applied\nsciences including materials sciences and mathematical imaging.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"LZXeWyiQmlMew64MDwb9S2vnXJsbq6XYa9YIt1vSgHw","pdfSize":"927134"}
