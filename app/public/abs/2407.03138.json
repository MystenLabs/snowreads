To achieve this, we establish a one-to-one\ncorrespondence between arbitrary continuous variable states in a multimode\nHilbert space and single photons occupying each a single mode, which are used\nto define a bosonic quantum computer. Starting from a classical state in a\nrepresentation that explicitly respects particle number super-selection rules,\nwe apply universal gates to create arbitrary superposition of states with the\nsame total particle number. The non-classicality of these states can then be\ndirectly related to the computational power they induce in the quantum\ncomputer. We also provide a correspondence between the adopted representation\nand the more conventional one in quantum optics, where superpositions of Fock\nstates describe quantum optical states, and we identify how mode entanglement\ncan lead to quantum advantage. In addition, our work contributes to establish a\nseamless transition from continuous to discrete properties of quantum optics\nwhile laying the grounds for a description of non-classicality and quantum\ncomputational advantage that is applicable to spin systems as well.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aURkoKsBqfSOHJH5GVPxo1_V5HMBReH5cI3gUAeYQbg","pdfSize":"277337"}
