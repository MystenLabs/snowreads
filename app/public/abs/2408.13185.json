The model is inspired from the observation that the structures of\nthe active and reactive power equations of lossy synchronous machine models are\nalmost symmetrical in terms of armature resistance and transient reactance. The\nproposed device is able to compensate grid power unbalance without requiring a\nfrequency signal. In fact, the active power control is based on the rate of\nchange of the voltage magnitude. On the other hand, synchronization and\nfrequency control is obtained through the reactive power support. The letter\nshows that the proposed dual-GFM control is robust and capable of recovering a\nnormal operating condition following large contingencies, such as load outages\nand three-phase faults.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ptmwyuU1V4-eSR2Kte-d48WZ-FUbMPbtjcScRI6-c8E","pdfSize":"677641"}
