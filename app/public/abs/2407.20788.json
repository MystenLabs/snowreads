We obtain analytical results when there are two colliding bunches of\n7-branes with a locally constant axiodilaton profile. In particular, in 8D\nF-theory setups when the 7-branes collide into a codimension-one $(4,6,12)$\nsingularity, we found an infinite light tower of BPS string junctions, which\nshould match the light KK tower in the dual heterotic description. To exactly\nmatch with the results in the distance conjecture, we propose that the\ndefinition of 8D Planck mass should receive a large correction. We have also\ncomputed parts of KK modes in 8D F-theory in a simplified setup, as well as the\nBPS string junction spectrum in specific setups of 6D and 4D F-theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
