We establish the asymptotic\nnormality of the proposed estimator. Simulation study is carried out to assess\nthe performance of the estimator. We illustrate our method using a dataset.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"jn0PaNYb1jdnPVpNXhwFJxUsNjZ1SvvtjXG4eVSLCg8","pdfSize":"373256"}
