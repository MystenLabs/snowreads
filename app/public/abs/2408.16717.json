Many of\nthese approaches are based on graph neural networks (GNNs) or related\ntransformers, operating on the Euclidean coordinates representing the routing\nproblems. However, GNNs are inherently not well suited to operate on dense\ngraphs, such as in routing problems. Furthermore, models operating on Euclidean\ncoordinates cannot be applied to non-Euclidean versions of routing problems\nthat are often found in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we\npropose a novel GNN-related edge-based neural model called Graph Edge Attention\nNetwork (GREAT). We evaluate the performance of GREAT in the\nedge-classification task to predict optimal edges in the Traveling Salesman\nProblem (TSP). We can use such a trained GREAT model to produce sparse TSP\ngraph instances, keeping only the edges GREAT finds promising. Compared to\nother, non-learning-based methods to sparsify TSP graphs, GREAT can produce\nvery sparse graphs while keeping most of the optimal edges. Furthermore, we\nbuild a reinforcement learning-based GREAT framework which we apply to\nEuclidean and non-Euclidean asymmetric TSP. This framework achieves\nstate-of-the-art results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
