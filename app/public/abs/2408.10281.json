As the scale and complexity of\nHPC applications continue to grow, the need for scalable systems and software\narchitectures becomes paramount. This paper provides a comprehensive overview\nof architecture for HPC on premise focusing on both hardware and software\naspects and details the associated challenges in building the HPC cluster on\npremise. It explores design principles, challenges, and emerging trends in\nbuilding scalable HPC systems and software, addressing issues such as\nparallelism, memory hierarchy, communication overhead, and fault tolerance on\nvarious cloud platforms. By synthesizing research findings and technological\nadvancements, this paper aims to provide insights into scalable solutions for\nmeeting the evolving demands of HPC applications on cloud.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mWaHAO441quPW0VJ6rH_lTGoy1IPgmxpFAmd-bpoj5g","pdfSize":"963285"}
