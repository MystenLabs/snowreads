The propagation model is devised in terms\nof three new variables to mainly avoid the orbital frequency oscillation of\nCartesian coordinates. Examples are provided to quantify robustness,\nefficiency, and accuracy on Earth and Sun centered orbits with various shapes\nand orientations. Differential corrections and a robust Lambert solver are used\nto validate the proposed approach in various scenarios and to compare it in\nterms of speed and robustness. Perturbations due to Earth's oblateness,\nthird-body, and Solar radiation pressure are introduced, showing the\nalgorithm's flexibility. Multi-revolution solutions are obtained. Finally, a\npolynomial analysis is conducted to show the dependence of convergence time on\npolynomial type and degree.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
