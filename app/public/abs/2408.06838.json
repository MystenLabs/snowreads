However, existing levitation techniques harnessing\noptical and electrical fields suffer from noise induced by elevated internal\ntemperatures and charge noise, respectively. Meissner-based magnetic levitation\ncircumvents both sources of decoherence but requires cryogenic environments.\nHere we characterize a sub-mg ferromagnetic cube levitated in an\nalternating-current planar magnetic Paul trap at room temperature. We show\nbehavior in line with the Mathieu equations and quality factors of up to 2500\nfor the librational modes. Besides technological sensing applications, this\ntechnique sets out a path for MHz librational modes in the micron-sized\nparticle limit, allowing for magnetic coupling to superconducting circuits and\nspin-based quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T8F0u4ApB17sRyMzX3BIwlMNorw8COO5XidEeMxTurQ","pdfSize":"1234112"}
