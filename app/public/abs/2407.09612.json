We show\nthat the interplay between these three ingredients produces an intricate phase\ndiagram comprising a multitude of symmetry-broken metallic states tunable via\ndoping and applied displacement field. In particular, we find intervalley\ncoherent and spin-canted ground states that may hold the key to understanding\nspin-orbit-enabled superconductivity observed in this platform. We also\ninvestigate various phase transitions where a continuous $\\mathrm{U}(1)$\nsymmetry is broken to ascertain the possible role of critical fluctuations on\npairing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
