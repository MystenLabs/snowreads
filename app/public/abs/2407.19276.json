In this\npaper, we characterize linear maps on $F^n=R^n$ or $C^n$, equipped with the\n$\\ell_p$-norm for $p \\in [1, \\infty]$, preserving parallel pairs or preserving\nTEA pairs. Indeed, any linear map will preserve parallel pairs and TEA pairs\nwhen $1< p <\\infty$. For the $\\ell_1$-norm, TEA preservers form a semigroup of\nmatrices in which each row has at most one nonzero entries; adding rank one\nmatrices to this semigroup will be the semigroup of parallel preserves. For the\n$\\ell_\\infty$-norm, a nonzero TEA preserver, or a parallel preserver of rank\ngreater than one, is always a multiple of an $\\ell_\\infty$-norm isometry,\nexcept when $F^n = R^2$. We also have a characterization for the exceptional\ncase. The results are extended to linear maps of the infinite dimensional\nspaces $\\ell_1(\\Lambda)$, $c_0(\\Lambda)$ and $\\ell_\\infty(\\Lambda)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
