We analyze the\ncorrelations between Schwinger pairs for the vacuum and maximally entangled\nstates of two fermionic fields. The correlations are quantified using\nentanglement entropy and Bell's inequality violation for the vacuum state,\nwhile Bell's inequality violation and mutual information are used for the\nmaximally entangled state. One can observe the variation of the entanglement\nproduced for fermionic modes with respect to different parameters.\nAdditionally, we discuss the key differences from the behaviour of scalar\nfields in this context. This study offers deeper insights into quantum field\ntheory and the dynamics of entanglement in the fermionic Schwinger effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
