Let $X$ be a projective $G$-variety of\ncomplexity 1. We classify $G$-equivariant normal test configurations of $X$\nwith integral central fibre via the combinatorial data. We also give a formula\nof anti-canonical divisors on $X$. Based on this formula, when $X$ is $\\mathbb\nQ$-Fano, we give an expression of the Futaki invariant, and derive a criterion\nof uniform K-stability in terms of the combinatorial data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
