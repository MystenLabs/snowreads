We developed a multidimensional model that\ncombines traditional clinical data with patient-reported outcomes, social\ndeterminants of health, and multi-omic data to create comprehensive digital\npatient representations. Our framework employs a multi-agent artificial\nintelligence approach, utilizing various machine learning techniques including\nlarge language models, to analyze complex, longitudinal datasets. The model\naims to optimize multiple patient outcomes simultaneously while addressing\nbiases and ensuring generalizability. We demonstrate how this framework can be\nimplemented to create a learning healthcare system that continuously refines\nstrategies for optimal patient care. This approach has the potential to\nsignificantly improve the translation of digital health innovations into\nreal-world clinical benefits, addressing current limitations in AI-driven\nhealthcare models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
