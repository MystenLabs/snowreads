Despite the demonstrated\nability of remote sensing instruments to detect methane plumes, no system has\nbeen available to routinely monitor and act on these events. We present\nMARS-S2L, an automated AI-driven methane emitter monitoring system for\nSentinel-2 and Landsat satellite imagery deployed operationally at the United\nNations Environment Programme's International Methane Emissions Observatory. We\ncompile a global dataset of thousands of super-emission events for training and\nevaluation, demonstrating that MARS-S2L can skillfully monitor emissions in a\ndiverse range of regions globally, providing a 216% improvement in mean average\nprecision over a current state-of-the-art detection method. Running this system\noperationally for six months has yielded 457 near-real-time detections in 22\ndifferent countries of which 62 have already been used to provide formal\nnotifications to governments and stakeholders.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"x-2-1XQWwhpo7QDDGNHaokdyEnJYXveSvrCQ7Ys_OcI","pdfSize":"42519734"}
