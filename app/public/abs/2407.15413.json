Specifically, we consider two\nclasses of typical local observables, i.e. the local orthonormal observables\n(LOO) and symmetric informationally complete positive operator-valued measures\n(SIC-POVM). Result shows that the SIC-POVM is superior to LOO in entanglement\ndetection, which in some sense hints the yet unconfirmed generally superiority\nof SIC-POVM in quantum information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
