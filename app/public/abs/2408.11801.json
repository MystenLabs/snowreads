While Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance visual\nstorytelling, current approaches often limit themselves to 2D visuals or\noversimplify stories through motion synthesis and behavioral simulation,\nfailing to create comprehensive, multi-dimensional narratives. To this end, we\npresent Story3D-Agent, a pioneering approach that leverages the capabilities of\nLLMs to transform provided narratives into 3D-rendered visualizations. By\nintegrating procedural modeling, our approach enables precise control over\nmulti-character actions and motions, as well as diverse decorative elements,\nensuring the long-range and dynamic 3D representation. Furthermore, our method\nsupports narrative extension through logical reasoning, ensuring that generated\ncontent remains consistent with existing conditions. We have thoroughly\nevaluated our Story3D-Agent to validate its effectiveness, offering a basic\nframework to advance 3D story representation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
