In\nthis article, we study the non-parametric estimator of this generator that was\nintroduced by Liebscher (2005). This estimator depends on two tuning\nparameters: a bandwidth $h$ -- as usual in kernel smoothing -- and an\nadditional parameter $a$ that control the behavior near the center of the\ndistribution. We give an explicit expression for the asymptotic MSE at a point\n$x$, and derive explicit expressions for the optimal tuning parameters $h$ and\n$a$. Estimation of the derivatives of the generator is also discussed. A\nsimulation study shows the performance of the new methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
