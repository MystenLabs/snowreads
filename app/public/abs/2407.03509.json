Its holographic dual is obtained via a combination of orbifold and\norientifold projections from Type II B string theory on $\\mathrm{AdS}_5 \\times\nS^5$ and possesses a sector of open strings attached to D7 branes with U(4)\nChan-Paton factors. The AdS Veneziano amplitude of the U(4) gluons is dual to\nfour-point correlators of moment-map operators of the U(4) flavor symmetry in\nthe D theory. An integrated version of these correlators is captured by a\ndeformation of the D theory in which the fundamental hypermultiplets acquire a\nmass. The partition function of this massive theory can be evaluated with\nmatrix-model techniques using localization. In this paper we analyze the matrix\nmodel of the mass-deformed D theory arising from localization using the\nso-called ``full Lie algebra'' approach in a $1/N$ expansion. In particular, we\nstudy the partition function and its mass derivatives up to $O(1/N^2)$\ncorrections obtaining exact expressions that are valid for all values of the 't\nHooft coupling. We also analyze their behavior at strong coupling where our\nresults produce useful constraints on the dual open string scattering\namplitudes in AdS.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
