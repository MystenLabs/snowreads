Conformal Prediction is a promising framework for uncertainty\nquantification, providing calibrated predictive intervals associated with\nautomatic volume measurements. However, this methodology is based on the\nhypothesis that calibration and test samples are exchangeable, an assumption\nthat is in practice often violated in medical image applications. A weighted\nformulation of Conformal Prediction can be framed to mitigate this issue, but\nits empirical investigation in the medical domain is still lacking. A potential\nreason is that it relies on the estimation of the density ratio between the\ncalibration and test distributions, which is likely to be intractable in\nscenarios involving high-dimensional data. To circumvent this, we propose an\nefficient approach for density ratio estimation relying on the compressed\nlatent representations generated by the segmentation model. Our experiments\ndemonstrate the efficiency of our approach to reduce the coverage error in the\npresence of covariate shifts, in both synthetic and real-world settings.
