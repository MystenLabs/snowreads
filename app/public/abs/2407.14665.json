When applicable, the new condition is\ncomputationally cheaper than fully periodic boundary conditions, reconnects\nmore flux than systems with conducting boundaries, and does not require\nassumptions about regions external to the simulation as is necessary for open\nboundaries. The new condition reproduces the expected features of reconnection,\nbut cannot be straightforwardly applied in systems with asymmetric upstream\nplasmas.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"egNE488h_fZk2d_gRGFyfZePQHw7i3H0Vh1IKFluDfQ","pdfSize":"10045000"}
