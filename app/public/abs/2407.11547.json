Our main focus is to explore the possibility of achieving a stable\nbalanced configuration within the theoretically reliable weak field limit. To\nthis end, we consider different types of Casimir forces, including those\ngenerated by massless scalar fields, massive scalar fields, electromagnetic\nfields, and temperature-dependent fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gtB5uP5e4jhuaiohZYv3FW1P_W8ZnzYojzxWLPzU78k","pdfSize":"932086","objectId":"0x98d6ab053c55d04b13128486893d90a7b36d6ee8e847b56e22a21fa616b9306e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
