This effect is universal, since it relies\non the fact that Cooper pairs, regardless of the pairing mechanism, are simply\ncharges that can be affected by external charges / fields induced in an\nengineered dielectric environment. In our earlier work, we proposed a composite\nsystem containing a superconductor and a topological insulator that satisfies\nthe stringent conditions for the anti-shielding. Here, we propose a\nsuperlattice system containing a metal-organic framework medium that also\nsatisfies these conditions, but with the effect even stronger and more\ncontrollable. Our estimates show that ambient temperature and pressure\noperation could be achievable in this configuration with e.g. MgB2, or even\nwith cuprate superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
