This paper\nfirst clarifies the preliminaries of self-play, including the multi-agent\nreinforcement learning framework and basic game theory concepts. Then it\nprovides a unified framework and classifies existing self-play algorithms\nwithin this framework. Moreover, the paper bridges the gap between the\nalgorithms and their practical implications by illustrating the role of\nself-play in different scenarios. Finally, the survey highlights open\nchallenges and future research directions in self-play. This paper is an\nessential guide map for understanding the multifaceted landscape of self-play\nin RL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
