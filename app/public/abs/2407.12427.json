Semantic anomalies are novelties that differ in meaning from the\ntraining set, like unseen objects in self-driving cars. In contrast, industrial\nanomalies are subtle defects that preserve semantic meaning, such as cracks in\nairplane components. In this paper, we present GeneralAD, an anomaly detection\nframework designed to operate in semantic, near-distribution, and industrial\nsettings with minimal per-task adjustments. In our approach, we capitalize on\nthe inherent design of Vision Transformers, which are trained on image patches,\nthereby ensuring that the last hidden states retain a patch-based structure. We\npropose a novel self-supervised anomaly generation module that employs\nstraightforward operations like noise addition and shuffling to patch features\nto construct pseudo-abnormal samples. These features are fed to an\nattention-based discriminator, which is trained to score every patch in the\nimage. With this, our method can both accurately identify anomalies at the\nimage level and also generate interpretable anomaly maps. We extensively\nevaluated our approach on ten datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in\nsix and on-par performance in the remaining for both localization and detection\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
