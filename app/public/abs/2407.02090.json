Such plans are specified as a\ndeterministic sequence of actions that are blindly applied without any sensor\nfeedback. Thus, they can be considered as pure exploration in a reinforcement\nlearning context, and we show that with basic memory requirements, they even\nyield optimal plans. Building upon results in number theory and theory of\nautomata, we provide universal plans both for discrete and continuous (motion)\nplanning and prove their (semi)completeness. The concepts are applied and\nillustrated through simulation studies, and several directions for future\nresearch are sketched.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
