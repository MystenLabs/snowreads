Key moments naturally exist as the first appearance of a specific\nproduct, presentation of its distinctive features, the presence of a buying\nlink, etc. Adding proper sound effects (SFX) to these key moments, or video\ndecoration with SFX (VDSFX), is crucial for enhancing the user engaging\nexperience. Previous studies about adding SFX to videos perform video to SFX\nmatching at a holistic level, lacking the ability of adding SFX to a specific\nmoment. Meanwhile, previous studies on video highlight detection or video\nmoment retrieval consider only moment localization, leaving moment to SFX\nmatching untouched. By contrast, we propose in this paper D&M, a unified method\nthat accomplishes key moment detection and moment to SFX matching\nsimultaneously. Moreover, for the new VDSFX task we build a large-scale dataset\nSFX-Moment from an E-commerce platform. For a fair comparison, we build\ncompetitive baselines by extending a number of current video moment detection\nmethods to the new task. Extensive experiments on SFX-Moment show the superior\nperformance of the proposed method over the baselines. Code and data will be\nreleased.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
