We\ncalibrate our model to observations of the misalignment angle using\ncross-correlations of Planck and HI 21-cm line data, producing a fiducial model\nthat predicts a $\\mathcal{D}_{\\ell}^{EB}\\sim$few $\\mu$K$^2$ dust signal at 353\nGHz and where $\\sim 56$% of filaments have a positive misalignment angle. The\nmain purpose of this model is to be used as dust with non-zero parity-violating\nemission in forecasting a measurement of cosmic birefringence by upcoming\nexperiments. Here, we also use our fiducial model to assess the impact of dust\nin measurements of the isotropic cosmic birefringence angle $\\beta$ with Planck\ndata by measuring the misalignment angle as a function of scale, as well as\ndirectly using our model's $\\mathcal{D}_{\\ell}^{EB}$ prediction as a template.\nIn both cases, we measure $\\beta$ to be consistent within $0.83\\sigma$ of the\nequivalent measurements with Planck data and its derivatives.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
