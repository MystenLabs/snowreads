For Physics-Informed\nNeural Networks (PINNs), loss terms on initial/boundary conditions and physics\nequations are particularly interesting as they are well-established as highly\ndifficult tasks. To improve learning the challenging multi-objective task posed\nby PINNs, we propose the ConFIG method, which provides conflict-free updates by\nensuring a positive dot product between the final update and each loss-specific\ngradient. It also maintains consistent optimization rates for all loss terms\nand dynamically adjusts gradient magnitudes based on conflict levels. We\nadditionally leverage momentum to accelerate optimizations by alternating the\nback-propagation of different loss terms. The proposed method is evaluated\nacross a range of challenging PINN scenarios, consistently showing superior\nperformance and runtime compared to baseline methods. We also test the proposed\nmethod in a classic multi-task benchmark, where the ConFIG method likewise\nexhibits a highly promising performance.
