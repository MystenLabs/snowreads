Fully elliptic operators are shown to be Fredholm in an associated\nscale of Sobolev spaces, and to have parametrices in the calculus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
