For this purpose a\nGaussian number density {\\it Ansatz} is applied, together with low-dimensional\nproposals for the energy density, coherent with the equipartition theorem. The\nresulting ordinary differential equations are shown to admit a variational\nformulation. The underlying symmetries are connected to constants of motion,\nthrough Noether's theorem. The two-dimensional case is special, corresponding\nto a Lagrangian Ermakov system without external forcing. There is a comparison\nwith the fully three-dimensional fireballs, and its reduction to effective\ntwo-dimensional dynamical system for elliptic trajectories. The exact\nanalytical solutions are worked out.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JVEB0mAAcSApgkXSd_sBQCbjxVRYV6awZhRM36w-Mrc","pdfSize":"166921"}
