Originally, the UGKWP method was\ndeveloped as a direct modeling approach at discrete level. In this work, we\nrevisit the time evolution of each part of the involved simulation particles\nand wave molecules in UGKWP, and present the corresponding kinetic equations.\nThe resultant kinetic system can be viewed as a collision decomposition of the\noriginal kinetic equation, which can serve as a basis for developing other\nkinetic methods for flows in all flow regimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
