The\nframework trains the model to approximate a chaotic system, then performs\ndesign space exploration yielding potential hardware architectures for its\nimplementation. The framework then generates the corresponding synthesizable\nHigh-Level Synthesis code and a validation testbench from a selected solution.\nThe hardware design primarily targets FPGAs. The proposed framework offers a\nrapid hardware design process of candidate architectures superior to manually\ndesigned works in terms of hardware cost and throughput. The source code is\navailable on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JKU-kHLCL-iZs4hzpputn6cNTM-1Gy9wRw4yE4h18Y4","pdfSize":"1064050","objectId":"0x374d14e77edf83494a77b9b948ce5c75b4fc675004dff1b95285d919fe50f373","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
