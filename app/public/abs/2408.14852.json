In this article, we develop an in situ method for\nreconstructing the fully vectorial information of tightly focused fields in\nthree-dimensional (3D) space, while simultaneously retrieving the pupil\nfunctions. Our approach encodes these fields using phase-modulated focusing and\npolarization-split detection, followed by decoding through an algorithm based\non least-sampling matrix-based Fourier transform and analytically derived\ngradient. We further employ a focus scanning strategy. When combined with our\ndecoding algorithm, this strategy mitigates the imperfections in the detection\npath. This approach requires only 10 frames of 2D measurements to realize\napproximate 90% accuracy in tomography and pupil function retrieval within 10s.\nThus, it serves as a robust and convenient tool for the precise\ncharacterization and optimization of light at the nanoscale. We apply this\ntechnique to fully vectorial field manipulation, adaptive-optics-assisted\nnanoscopy, and addressing mixed-state problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0f-_20nyt0afIjTs_Hdw0bV_kSTcTlthfPkkrqL9erU","pdfSize":"28673519"}
