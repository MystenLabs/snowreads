Presently, the\nLIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration tests general relativity (GR) assuming\nthat the binary eccentricity has decayed well before it enters the detector's\nfrequency band. Previous works have shown that binary eccentricity can bias GR\ntests if unaccounted for. Here we develop two methods to extend parametrized\ntests of GR to eccentric binaries. The first method extends the standard null\nparametrized test for quasicircular binaries by adding fractional deviations at\neach post-Newtonian (PN) order in the eccentric part of the GW phasing\n(assuming the small-eccentricity limit). Simultaneous measurement of the\ncircular and eccentric deviation parameters ($\\delta\\hat{\\varphi},\n\\delta\\hat{\\varphi}^e$) allows us to constrain deviations from GR for eccentric\nbinaries. While strong constraints on the deviation parameters are not\nachievable with LIGO's projected sensitivity, the multibanding of LISA and CE\nobservations can constrain these deviations to $|\\delta\\hat{\\varphi}_2|\n\\lesssim 3 \\times 10^{-3}$ and $|\\delta\\hat{\\varphi}^e_2|\\lesssim 2\\times\n10^{-2}$. The second method looks for GR deviations in the rate of periastron\nadvance ($\\Delta\\alpha$). The parameter $\\Delta\\alpha$ ($\\Delta\\alpha^{\\rm GR}\n\\to 0$) can be constrained with LIGO to $|\\Delta\\alpha|\\lesssim 4 \\times\n10^{-2}$ (with $1 \\sigma$ confidence). Multiband sources observed by LISA and\nCE provide an improved constraint of $|\\Delta\\alpha|\\lesssim 3\\times 10^{-5}$.\nThe space-based detector DECIGO provides the best constraint on $\\Delta\\alpha$\nwith $|\\Delta\\alpha|\\lesssim 8 \\times 10^{-6}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
