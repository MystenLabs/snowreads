Let $N$ be a spin three-manifold. We can define a\n$(2+1)$-dimensional topological order $\\mathrm{TO}_N$ as follows: its anyons\nare the torsion elements in $H_1(N)$, the braiding of anyons is given by the\nlinking form, and their topological spins are given by the quadratic refinement\nof the linking form obtained from the spin structure. Under this\ncorrespondence, a surgery presentation of $N$ gives rise to a classical\nChern--Simons description of the associated topological order $\\mathrm{TO}_N$.\nWe then extend the correspondence to spin bordisms between three-manifolds, and\ndomain walls between topological orders. In particular, we construct a domain\nwall $\\mathcal{D}_M$ between $\\mathrm{TO}_N$ and $\\mathrm{TO}_{N'}$, where $M$\nis a spin bordism from $N$ to $N'$. This domain wall unfolds to a composition\nof a gapped boundary, obtained from anyon condensation, and a gapless Narain\nboundary CFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eNq1aMiFqldOYj8Vr78VzhkpClf3V1wldaf7sRd4QhI","pdfSize":"376669","objectId":"0xe790cf13ace678b0551c240b70d949c295c83446691c578838b375740300e9a5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
