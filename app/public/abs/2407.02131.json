Building on a\ngalaxy-based HI mock catalog, we meticulously consider various factors,\nincluding the emission line profiles of HI discs and some observational\nsettings, and explore their impacts on the HI power spectrum. While it is\nrelatively insensitive to the profile shape of HI emission line at these\nscales, we identify a strong correlation with the profile width, that is, the\nFull Width at Half Maxima (FWHM, also known as $W_{\\rm 50}$ in observations) in\nthis work. By modeling the width function of $W_{50}$ as a function of $v_{\\rm\nmax}$, we assign each HI source a emission line profile and find that the\nresulting HI power spectrum is comparatively close to results from particles in\nthe IllustrisTNG hydrodynamical simulation. After implementing $k$-space cuts\nmatching the MeerKAT data, our prediction replicates the trend of the\nmeasurements obtained by MeerKAT at $z\\approx 0.44$, though with a\nsignificantly lower amplitude. Utilizing a Monte Carlo Markov Chain sampling\nmethod, we constrain the parameter $A_{W_{\\rm 50}}$ in the $W_{\\rm 50}$ models\nand $\\Omega_{\\rm HI}$ with the MeerKAT measurements and find that a strong\ndegeneracy exists between these two parameters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
