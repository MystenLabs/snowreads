However,\nprevious peer support CAs either are user-initiated or follow predefined rules\nto initiate the conversations, which may discourage users to engage and build\nrelationships with the CAs for long-term benefits. In this paper, we develop\nComPeer, a generative CA that can proactively offer adaptive peer support to\nusers. ComPeer leverages large language models to detect and reflect\nsignificant events in the dialogue, enabling it to strategically plan the\ntiming and content of proactive care. In addition, ComPeer incorporates peer\nsupport strategies, conversation history, and its persona into the generative\nmessages. Our one-week between-subjects study (N=24) demonstrates ComPeer's\nstrength in providing peer support over time and boosting users' engagement\ncompared to a baseline user-initiated CA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
