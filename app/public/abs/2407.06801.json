In the $\\#IndSub(\\Phi)$ problem, given a graph $G$\nand an integer $k$, the task is to count the number of $k$-vertex induced\nsubgraphs $G'$ with $\\Phi(G')=1$. $\\#IndSub(\\Phi)$ can be naturally generalized\nto graph parameters, that is, to functions $\\Phi$ on graphs that do not\nnecessarily map to {0, 1}: now the task is to compute the sum $\\sum_{G'}\n\\Phi(G')$ taken over all $k$-vertex induced subgraphs $G'$. This problem\nsetting can express a wider range of counting problems (for instance, counting\n$k$-cycles or $k$-matchings) and can model problems involving expected values\n(for instance, the expected number of components in a subgraph induced by $k$\nrandom vertices). Our main results are lower bounds on $\\#IndSub(\\Phi)$ in this\nsetting, which simplify, generalize, and tighten the recent lower bounds of\nD\\\"oring, Marx, and Wellnitz [STOC'24] in various ways.\n  (1) We show a lower bound for every nontrivial edge-monotone graph parameter\n$\\Phi$ with finite codomain (not only for parameters that take value in {0,\n1}).\n  (2) The lower bound is tight: we show that, assuming ETH, there is no\n$f(k)n^{o(k)}$ time algorithm.\n  (3) The lower bound applies also to the modular counting versions of the\nproblem.\n  (4) The lower bound applies also to the multicolored version of the problem.\n  We can extend the #W[1]-hardness result to the case when the codomain of\n$\\Phi$ is not finite, but has size at most $(1 - \\varepsilon)\\sqrt{k}$ on\n$k$-vertex graphs. However, if there is no bound on the size of the codomain,\nthe situation changes significantly: for example, there is a nontrivial\nedge-monotone function $\\Phi$ where the size of the codomain is $k$ on\n$k$-vertex graphs and $\\#IndSub(\\Phi)$ is FPT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
