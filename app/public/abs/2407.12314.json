The dependence of the maximum impact parameter for\ncapture on the particle's energy is investigated numerically for different\nvalues of the electromagnetic coupling strength between the particle and the\nblack hole. The capture cross-section is then calculated. We show that the\ncapture cross-section is independent of the electromagnetic coupling for\nultra-relativistic particles. The astrophysical implications of our results are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gF9XlZnenhOW7DhesbrIdl4-T4rOJs1FZYSKUcovsEo","pdfSize":"1137049"}
