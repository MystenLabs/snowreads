The main aim of this paper is to\nreuse human annotation guidelines along with some annotated data to design\nautomatic prompts for LLMs, focusing on the semantic proximity annotation task.\nAutomatic prompts are compared to customized prompts. We further implement the\nprompting strategies into an open-source text annotation tool, enabling easy\nonline use via the OpenAI API. Our study reveals the crucial role of accurate\nprompt design and suggests that prompting GPT-4 with human-like instructions is\nnot straightforwardly possible for the semantic proximity task. We show that\nsmall modifications to the human guidelines already improve the performance,\nsuggesting possible ways for future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
