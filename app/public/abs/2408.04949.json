For instance, a classifier\ntrained on chest X-ray (CXR) images from one hospital may not generalize to\nimages from another hospital due to variations in scanner settings or patient\ncharacteristics. In this paper, we introduce our CROCODILE framework, showing\nhow tools from causality can foster a model's robustness to domain shift via\nfeature disentanglement, contrastive learning losses, and the injection of\nprior knowledge. This way, the model relies less on spurious correlations,\nlearns the mechanism bringing from images to prediction better, and outperforms\nbaselines on out-of-distribution (OOD) data. We apply our method to multi-label\nlung disease classification from CXRs, utilizing over 750000 images from four\ndatasets. Our bias-mitigation method improves domain generalization and\nfairness, broadening the applicability and reliability of deep learning models\nfor a safer medical image analysis.
