Spatial domain identification\nand gene denoising are key objectives in SRT data analysis. We propose a\nContrastively Augmented Masked Graph Autoencoder (STMGAC) to learn\nlow-dimensional latent representations for domain identification. In the latent\nspace, persistent signals for representations are obtained through\nself-distillation to guide self-supervised matching. At the same time, positive\nand negative anchor pairs are constructed using triplet learning to augment the\ndiscriminative ability. We evaluated the performance of STMGAC on five\ndatasets, achieving results superior to those of existing baseline methods.
