Initial conditions correspond to a\nmarginally unstable disc according to commonly used disc stability criteria,\nand are evolved for the equivalent of about 150 disc dynamical times (10Gyr).\nAn extensive convergence study ensures accurate modelling of the bar formation\nprocess. Live haloes lead to the formation of a strong bar, but the same disc\nremains unbarred when evolved in a static halo. Neither seeded disc\ninstabilities, nor longer (60Gyr) simulations result in the formation of a bar\nwhen the halo is static. When the live halo is replaced with a static analogue\nat later times the previously robust bar slowly dissipates, suggesting: (1) the\nco-evolution of the disc and halo is critical for the assembly and long-term\nsurvival of bars in marginally unstable discs; and (2) global disc stability\ncriteria must be modified for discs in the presence of live haloes. In our live\nhalo runs, a \"dark bar\" grows synchronously with the stellar bar. Processes\nthat inhibit the transfer of angular momentum between the halo and disc may\nstabilise a galaxy against bar formation, and can lead to the dissolution of\nthe bar itself. This raises further questions about the puzzling stability of\nobserved discs that are marginally unstable, but unbarred.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
