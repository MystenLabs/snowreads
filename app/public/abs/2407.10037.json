As such, an SKT\nmetric can be regarded as a natural generalization of a K\\\"{a}hler metric. In\nthis paper, the exceptional Lie group $G_2$ is equipped with a left-invariant\nintegrable almost complex structure $\\mathcal{J}$ via the Samelson construction\nand a 7-parameter family of $\\mathcal{J}$-Hermitian metrics is constructed.\nFrom this 7-parameter family, the members which are SKT are calculated. The\nresult is a 3-parameter family of left-invariant SKT metrics on $G_2$. As a\nspecial case, the aforementioned family of SKT metrics contains all\nbi-invariant metrics on $G_2$. In addition, this 3-parameter family of\nleft-invariant SKT metrics are also invariant under the right action of a\ncertain maximal torus $T$ of $G_2$. Conversely, it is shown that if $g$ is a\nleft-invariant $\\mathcal{J}$-Hermitian metric on $G_2$ such that $g$ is\ninvariant under the right action of $T$ and for which $(g,\\mathcal{J})$ is SKT,\nthen $g$ must belong to this 3-parameter family of left-invariant SKT metrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
