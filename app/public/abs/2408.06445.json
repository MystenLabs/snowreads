However, the problem is challenging due to spatio-temporal\ncorrelations and complex dynamic patterns in continuous-time stream data.\nNeural Differential Equations (NDEs) are among the state-of-the-art methods for\nlearning continuous-time traffic dynamics. However, the traditional NDE models\nface issues in long-term traffic forecasting due to failures in capturing\ndelayed traffic patterns, dynamic edge (location-to-location correlation)\npatterns, and abrupt trend patterns. To fill this gap, we propose a new NDE\narchitecture called Multi-View Neural Differential Equations. Our model\ncaptures current states, delayed states, and trends in different state\nvariables (views) by learning latent multiple representations within Neural\nDifferential Equations. Extensive experiments conducted on several real-world\ntraffic datasets demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art and achieves superior prediction accuracy for long-term\nforecasting and robustness with noisy or missing inputs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
