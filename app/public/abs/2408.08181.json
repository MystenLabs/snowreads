Quantization allows to present it in\nmuch simpler terms, what could make these techniques available to a broader\naudience. To avoid overloading of the presentation, only the case of the\ncolored Jones polynomial for the trefoil knot is considered, though various\ngeneralizations are straightforward. Restriction to solely Jones polynomials\n(rather than full HOMFLY-PT) is related to a serious simplification, provided\nby the use of Kauffman calculus. Going beyond looks realistic, however it\nremains a problem, both challenging and promising.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
