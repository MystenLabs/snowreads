The process is defined as the superposition of the symmetric exclusion\nprocess with a Glauber dynamics. When the process starts from a product measure\nwith a constant density, which is a non-equilibrium measure for the process, we\nprove that the re-scaled density fluctuation field satisfies the moderate\ndeviation principle. Our proof relies on the so-called main lemma developed by\nJara and Menezes in [arXiv:1810.09526, 2018].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xF_YPLpk6eWPmxKE6xfHtAGhd8tv4fSBq8GcZtGcc_U","pdfSize":"292705"}
