It has been argued recently by Costello\nthat for a particular fermion representation (8 fundamentals plus one\nantisymmetric-tensor representation in $SU(N)$) the one-loop amplitudes vanish\nidentically. We show that this vanishing leads to previously-observed\nidentities among one-loop color-ordered partial amplitudes. We then turn to two\nloops, where Costello has computed the all-plus amplitudes for this theory, as\nrational functions of the kinematics for any number of gluons using the\ncelestial chiral algebra (CCA) bootstrap. We show that in dimensional\nregularization, these two-loop amplitudes are not rational, and they are not\neven finite as $\\epsilon\\to0$. However, the finite remainder for four gluons\nagrees with the formula by Costello. In addition, we provide a mass regulator\nfor the infrared-divergent loop integrals; with this regulator, the CCA\nbootstrap formula is recovered exactly. Finally, we use the CCA bootstrap to\ncompute the double-trace terms in the theory at two loops for an arbitrary\nnumber of gluons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
