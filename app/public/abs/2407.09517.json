This paper investigates this key question\nusing the nine qualitative measurements of the Building Blocks theory. GPT-4's\ndesign, architecture and implementation are compared to each of the building\nblocks of consciousness to determine whether it has achieved the requisite\nmilestones to be classified as conscious or, if not, how close to consciousness\nGPT-4 is. Our assessment is that, while GPT-4 in its native configuration is\nnot currently conscious, current technological research and development is\nsufficient to modify GPT-4 to have all the building blocks of consciousness.\nConsequently, we argue that the emergence of a conscious AI model is plausible\nin the near term. The paper concludes with a comprehensive discussion of the\nethical implications and societal ramifications of engineering conscious AI\nentities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ssWpoobEMRrvte-LHqhbm_ljHfPicx_xdVBg2R5wIFQ","pdfSize":"321665"}
