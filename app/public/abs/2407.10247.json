{"id":"2407.10247","title":"Strategic Integration of Artificial Intelligence in the C-Suite: The\n  Role of the Chief AI Officer","authors":"Marc Schmitt","authorsParsed":[["Schmitt","Marc",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 30 Apr 2024 19:07:18 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-16","timestamp":1714504038000,"abstract":"  The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into corporate strategy has\nbecome a pivotal focus for organizations aiming to maintain a competitive\nadvantage in the digital age. As AI reshapes business operations and drives\ninnovation, the need for specialized leadership to effectively manage these\nchanges becomes increasingly apparent. In this paper, I explore the role of the\nChief AI Officer (CAIO) within the C-suite, emphasizing the necessity of this\nposition for successful AI strategy, integration, and governance. I analyze\nfuture scenarios based on current trends in three key areas: the AI Economy, AI\nOrganization, and Competition in the Age of AI. These explorations lay the\nfoundation for identifying the antecedents (environmental, structural, and\nstrategic factors) that justify the inclusion of a CAIO in top management\nteams. This sets the stage for a comprehensive examination of the CAIO's role\nand the broader implications of AI leadership. This paper advances the\ndiscussion on AI leadership by providing a rationale for the strategic\nintegration of AI at the executive level and examining the role of the Chief AI\nOfficer within organizations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
