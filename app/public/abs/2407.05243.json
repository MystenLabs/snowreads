In literature, the vorticity manifests itself\nincompletely as the magnetic field. This paper demonstrates this substitution\ncan be understood as a truncation in the relevant expansion scheme, together\nwith field redefinitions. Those discarded components are critical to restoring\nthe Berry phase term in the effective theory, and the restoration incapsulates\nthese two systems in the same master Lagrangian. In addition to clarifying the\nstructure of the Berry phase, this formalism permits solving the bosonic system\non the lowest Landau level (LLL) based on the method of analogue. In\nparticular, we show that in the linear regime, the Maxwell equations governing\nthese systems are identical by reformulating the vortex crystal with an\nauxiliary electromagnetic field. This approach offers a unified view for these\nsystems and yields solutions that are rotationally covariant, gauge invariants,\nand physically interpretable.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
