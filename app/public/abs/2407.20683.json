In this paper we relax this setup by allowing\ninitially accepted hypotheses to be rejected due to information gathered at\nlater steps. We propose online e-BH, an online ARC (online with\nacceptance-to-rejection changes) version of the e-BH procedure. Online e-BH is\nthe first nontrivial online procedure which provably controls the FDR at\ndata-adaptive stopping times and under arbitrary dependence between the test\nstatistics. Online e-BH uniformly improves e-LOND, the existing method for\ne-value based online FDR control. In addition, we introduce new boosting\ntechniques for online e-BH to increase the power in case of locally dependent\ne-values. Furthermore, based on the same proof technique as used for online\ne-BH, we show that all existing online procedures with valid FDR control under\narbitrary dependence also control the FDR at data-adaptive stopping times.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
