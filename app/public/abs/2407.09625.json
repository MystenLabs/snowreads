A\nhybrid path planning algorithm based on the A* strategy has been developed,\nenabling seamless transition between air-to-ground navigation modes, thereby\nenhancing robot's mobility in complex environments. Moreover, precise path\nfollowing is achieved during ground locomotion with a Model Predictive Control\n(MPC) architecture for its novel walking behaviour. Experimental validation was\nconducted in the Unity simulation environment utilizing Python scripts to\ncompute control values. The algorithm's performance is validated by the Root\nMean Squared Error (RMSE) of 0.91 cm and a maximum error of 1.85 cm, as\ndemonstrated by the results. These developments highlight the adaptability of\nMorphoGear in navigation through cluttered environments, establishing it as a\nusable tool in autonomous exploration, both aerial and ground-based.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
