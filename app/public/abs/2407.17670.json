At the same\nenergy range where the structure appears, a transition from hadrons to quarks\nis expected, the deconfinement transition. In this paper, the role of quark\ndeconfinement in establishing fluctuaitions in the early stages of the\ncollision is considered. Two models are compared: one with stopping occurring\non a baryon-by-baryon basis, and a second where stopping proceeds through quark\ndegrees of freedom. In the latter model, the fluctuation of baryon number is\nsignificantly reduced and this signal is found to survive recombination into\nhadrons and the subsequent diffusion. The transformation from baryon to quark\nstopping thus produces a dip in the fourth-to-second-order cumulant ratio when\nplotted vs. beam energy, consistent with observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9ubLjJf1rfQBSb3yBZHcQjof4wGQjkJ-o_hMaDM-_hU","pdfSize":"418175"}
