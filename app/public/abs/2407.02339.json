To accommodate customer availability, many online retailers offer\ndifferent delivery time slots. Providing these time slots is convenient for\ncustomers but also results in a higher level of uncertainty for the retailer.\nIn this paper, we introduce a choice-based slot assortment and price\ndiscounting problem in which customers' decisions regarding delivery slots and\ntheir corresponding impact on routing costs are explicitly considered. We\nformulate a mixed-integer linear programming model for this problem. We use a\nlogic-based Benders decomposition to obtain benchmark solutions for larger\ninstances of this problem. Numerical experiments are conducted to show the\neffectiveness of this approach. Results indicate the importance of accounting\nfor the uncertain behavior of customers when deciding about the assortment and\nprice discount rates of time slots.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"cE8sR_-pf4amtXZKIO4rn86aARR-RSkdM6XZXiWFwf8","pdfSize":"352438"}
