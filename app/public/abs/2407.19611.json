Remarkably, we show that the collective\noptical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron\nstates. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons\ndoped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons.\nMoreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry\ncurvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding\nelectronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research\non the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving\nmoir\\'e excitons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
