Traditional\nmethods often rely on intrusive visual and physiological data collection,\nposing privacy concerns and scalability issues. This paper proposes a novel\nmethod leveraging large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering to\nanalyze textual data from students. Our approach utilizes tailored prompts to\nguide LLMs in detecting emotional and engagement states, providing a\nnon-intrusive and scalable solution. We conducted experiments using Qwen,\nChatGPT, Claude2, and GPT-4, comparing our method against baseline models and\nchain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Results demonstrate that our method\nsignificantly outperforms the baselines in both accuracy and contextual\nunderstanding. This study highlights the potential of LLMs combined with prompt\nengineering to offer practical and effective tools for educational emotion and\nbehavior analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
