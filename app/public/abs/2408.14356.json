Despite extensive research in the past few decades,\ntopology-preserving Hodge decomposition of scalar and vector fields on\nmanifolds with boundaries in the Eulerian representation remains a challenge\ndue to the implicit incorporation of appropriate topology-preserving boundary\nconditions. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive 5-component\ntopology-preserving Hodge decomposition that unifies normal and tangential\ncomponents in the Cartesian representation. Implicit representations of planar\nand volumetric regions defined by level-set functions have been developed.\nNumerical experiments on various objects, including single-cell RNA velocity,\nvalidate the effectiveness of our approach, confirming the expected rigorous\n$L^2$-orthogonality and the accurate cohomology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
