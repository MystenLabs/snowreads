This generalizes so called\n`puck billiards' proposed by M.Bialy, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the\nmotion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary.\nWe prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for\npensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a\ntwist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the\nappearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding\nhydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic\nproperties of pensive outer billiards.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
