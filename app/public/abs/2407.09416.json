These schemes are designed to preserve\nmass, positivity and to be uniquely solvable. In addition, they also ensure\nenergy dissipation in many typical scenarios. Through extensive numerical\nexperiments, we demonstrate the schemes' robustness, accuracy and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"o4vziB94pvdYnTzIQJQGpLfU7pJ3xtF09XCiCqQtpow","pdfSize":"1534006"}
