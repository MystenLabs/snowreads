The balancing strategy aimed\nat reducing covariate disparities between different treatment groups serves as\na universal solution. However, when it comes to the time series data, the\neffectiveness of balancing strategies remains an open question, with a thorough\nanalysis of the robustness and applicability of balancing strategies still\nlacking. This paper revisits counterfactual estimation in the temporal setting\nand provides a brief overview of recent advancements in balancing strategies.\nMore importantly, we conduct a critical empirical examination for the\neffectiveness of the balancing strategies within the realm of temporal\ncounterfactual estimation in various settings on multiple datasets. Our\nfindings could be of significant interest to researchers and practitioners and\ncall for a reexamination of the balancing strategy in time series settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
