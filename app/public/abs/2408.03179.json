In this paper,\nthe concept of excess for the fusion frame setting is studied. Initially, a\nlocal approach is presented to determine exactly which part of each subspace\nshould be considered as redundancy. Then, several explicit methods are provided\nto compute the excess of fusion frames and their $Q$-duals. In particular, some\nupper bounds for the excess of $Q$-dual fusion frames are established. It turns\nout that each fusion frame and its $Q$-dual may not necessarily have the same\nexcess. Along the way, unlike ordinary frames, it follows that for every $n \\in\n\\Bbb{N}$, we can provide a fusion frame together an its $Q$-dual such that the\ndifference of their excess is $n$. Furthermore, the connection between the\nexcess of fusion frames and their orthogonal complement fusion frames are\ncompletely characterized. Finally, several examples are exhibited to confirm\nthe obtained results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JmPOuNV4OfCKOA3vkzPJeqqbhkmEolWEN9lMkoWoQc4","pdfSize":"267780"}
