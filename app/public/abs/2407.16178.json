By leveraging the latest machine learning force\nfield to model aqueous $\\text{AlCl}_{3}$, we discover that upon dissolution of\n$\\text{Al}^{3+}$, water molecules beyond the second hydration shell involve in\nthe hydration process. A combination of scissoring of coordinating water is\nfollowed by synchronized secondary motion of water in the second solvation\nshell due to hydrogen bonding. Consequently, the water beyond the second\nsolvation penetrates through the second solvation shell and coordinates to the\n$\\text{Al}^{3+}$. Our study reveals a novel microscopic understanding of\nsolvation dynamics for trivalent ion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
