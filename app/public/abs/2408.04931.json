However, using customers' data in\nthese systems raises significant privacy and security concerns. Traditional\nfederated learning addresses some privacy issues by enabling model training\nwithout direct data exchange but often struggles with accuracy due to varying\ndata distributions across different regions or service providers. In this\npaper, we propose CC-Net: a novel approach using collaborative learning\nenhanced with contrastive learning for taxi-demand prediction. Our method\nensures high performance by enabling multiple parties to collaboratively train\na demand-prediction model through hierarchical federated learning. In this\napproach, similar parties are clustered together, and federated learning is\napplied within each cluster. The similarity is defined without data exchange,\nensuring privacy and security. We evaluated our approach using real-world data\nfrom five taxi service providers in Japan over fourteen months. The results\ndemonstrate that CC-Net maintains the privacy of customers' data while\nimproving prediction accuracy by at least 2.2% compared to existing techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wkUfLDN2zVH7oBeiXE8y-g7cozaBatlFUV3YEVrG3U0","pdfSize":"3970052"}
