Despite the prevalence of\nevanescent coupling in physics, little attention has been paid to wavefunction\nprofiles, with reciprocity often assumed for practical reasons. Our work\nchallenges this assumption by demonstrating the origin of non-reciprocity in a\nphotonic platform. We experimentally validate non-reciprocal dynamics on\ndirectional couplers fabricated via femtosecond laser writing, and corroborate\nour findings through continuous simulations. Extending these insights, we\nobserve the topological Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in a Rice-Mele lattice model.\nOur findings open new avenues of research using simple and scalable\nconfigurations, and potentially guiding future developments in Physics and\nbeyond.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
