The crisis is compounded by the prevalent confusion over\nvalidation terminology. Responding to this challenge, we introduce a validation\nframework that clarifies the roles and definitions of key validation efforts:\nrepeatability, dependent and independent reproducibility, and direct and\nconceptual replicability. This structured framework aims to provide AI/ML\nresearchers with the necessary clarity on these essential concepts,\nfacilitating the appropriate design, conduct, and interpretation of validation\nstudies. By articulating the nuances and specific roles of each type of\nvalidation study, we hope to contribute to a more informed and methodical\napproach to addressing the challenges of reproducibility, thereby supporting\nthe community's efforts to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of its\nresearch findings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wKAD96aNwOXB0GQudKx_sy1UoOeP4UN-YMNOZ6ksxwY","pdfSize":"332744"}
