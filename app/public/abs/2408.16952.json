We\naddress the latter by examining fault-tolerance in semantic segmentation\nmodels. Using established hardware fault models, we evaluate existing hardening\ntechniques both in terms of accuracy and uncertainty and introduce ReLUMax, a\nnovel simple activation function designed to enhance resilience against\ntransient faults. ReLUMax integrates seamlessly into existing architectures\nwithout time overhead. Our experiments demonstrate that ReLUMax effectively\nimproves robustness, preserving performance and boosting prediction confidence,\nthus contributing to the development of reliable autonomous driving systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
