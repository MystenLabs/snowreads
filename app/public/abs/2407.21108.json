Consideration is given to spacetime points located exterior to the black\nhole horizon, but within the cosmological horizon. Previously it was found in\ntwo dimensions for spatially separated points that the Hadamard function\nexhibits unbounded linear growth at late times, with a rate of growth\nproportional to the sum of the black hole and cosmological surface gravities.\nHere it is shown numerically that this behavior persists in four dimensions,\nwhere scattering effects associated with the scalar field modes lead to a\nmodification of the two-dimensional result. An analytic approximation is\nderived for the growth rate in four dimensions and, in the limit that the black\nhole vanishes, the leading order contribution is equivalent to the rate of\ngrowth for the Hadamard function found previously for de Sitter space in\ncosmological coordinates.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
