The results of two experiments are reported.\nIn the first one, carried out in LNS Catania, the absolute branching ratio for\n$\\beta$-delayed $\\alpha$ emission was measured by counting incoming $^{11}$Be\nions stopped in the detector and the observed decays with the emission of\n$\\alpha$ particle. The result of 3.27(46)\\% is in good agreement with the\nliterature value. In the second experiment, performed at the HIE-ISOLDE\nfacility at CERN, bunches containing several hundreds of $^{11}$Be ions were\nimplanted into the OTPC detector followed by the detection of decays with the\nemission of charged particles. The energy spectrum of $\\beta$-delayed $\\alpha$\nparticles was determined in the full energy range. It was analysed in the\nR-matrix framework and was found to be consistent with the literature. The best\ndescription of the spectrum was obtained assuming that the two $3/2^+$ and one\n$1/2^+$ states in $^{11}$B are involved in the transition. The search for\n$\\beta$-delayed emission of protons was undertaken. Only the upper limit for\nthe branching ratio for this process of $(2.2 \\pm 0.6_{\\rm stat} \\pm 0.6_{\\rm\nsys}) \\times 10^{-6}$ could be determined. This value is in conflict with the\nresult published in [Ayyad et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 082501 (2019)] but does\nagree with the limit reported in [Riisager et al., Eur. Phys. J.
