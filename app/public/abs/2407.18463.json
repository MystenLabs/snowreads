Therefore, the\ncertification of entanglement is crucial for quantum information processing\ntasks. While entanglement witnesses are the most frequently used method for\nentanglement certification in experiments, recent research shows that even tiny\nerrors in measurements may significantly undermine the effectiveness of a\nwitness. In this work, we propose a randomized-measurement-based method to\nsolve this problem. Through this method, the errors in measurement results can\nbe substantially suppressed, thereby restoring the certification capability of\nentanglement witnesses. Our method is not only applicable to general types of\nwitnesses, including multi-party entanglement and high-dimensional entanglement\nwitnesses, but also experimentally friendly in the sense that only slight\nmodifications are needed to the original measurement settings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
