The\nangular sizes are resolved on scales of ~0.7 mas and the inferred ring radii\nrange from 0.028 to 1.33 pc, comparable to those reported previously and a\nfactor 10-20 smaller than the mid-infrared sizes in the literature. Combining\nour new data with previously published values, we compile a sample of 25 AGN\nwith bolometric luminosity ranging from $10^{42}$ to $10^{47} \\rm erg~s^{-1}$,\nwith which we study the radius-luminosity (R-L) relation for the hot dust\nstructure. Our interferometric measurements of radius are offset by a factor 2\nfrom the equivalent relation derived through reverberation mapping. Using a\nsimple model to explore the dust structure's geometry, we conclude that this\noffset can be explained if the 2 um emitting surface has a concave shape. Our\ndata show that the slope of the relation is in line with the canonical $R\n\\propto L^{0.5}$ when using an appropriately non-linear correction for\nbolometric luminosity. In contrast, using optical luminosity or applying a\nconstant bolometric correction to it results in a significant deviation in the\nslope, suggesting a potential luminosity dependence on the spectral energy\ndistribution. Over four orders of magnitude in luminosity, the intrinsic\nscatter around the R-L relation is 0.2 dex, suggesting a tight correlation\nbetween innermost hot dust structure size and the AGN luminosity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
