The agents need to resist the temptation of individual\nrewards through foraging and choose the collective long-term goal of\nsustainability. We investigate methods of online learning in Neuro-Evolution\nand Deep Recurrent Q-Networks to enable agents to attempt the problem one-shot\nas is often required by wicked social problems. We further explore if learning\ntemporal dependencies with Long Short-Term Memory may be able to aid the agents\nin developing sustainable foraging strategies in the long term. It was found\nthat the integration of Long Short-Term Memory assisted agents in developing\nsustainable strategies for a single agent, however failed to assist agents in\nmanaging the social dilemma that arises in the multi-agent scenario.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
