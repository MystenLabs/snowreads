However, in mimicking social\ncontagion processes, models that simultaneously incorporate these two\nmechanisms have been largely overlooked. Here, we study a general model that\nintegrates hybrid interaction forms by assuming that a part of nodes in a\nnetwork are driven by the threshold mechanism, while the remaining nodes\nexhibit imitation behavior governed by their rationality (under the\ngame-theoretic framework). Our results reveal that the spreading dynamics are\ndetermined by the payoff of adoption. For positive payoffs, increasing the\ndensity of highly rational nodes can promote the adoption process, accompanied\nby a hybrid phase transition. The degree of rationality can regulate the\nspreading speed, with less rational imitators slowing down the spread. We\nfurther find that the results are opposite for negative payoffs of adoption.\nThis model may provide valuable insights into understanding the complex\ndynamics of social contagion phenomena in real-world social networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
