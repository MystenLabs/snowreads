In this connection, computation of periods\nof the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to\nconstructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities\nis used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic,\ncubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and\ntetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the\nRiemann surface gives full control over computation of the Abel image of any\npoint on a curve. Therefore, computation of $\\wp$-functions on given divisors\ncan be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi\ninversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves\nare considered in detail, and illustrated by examples. A method of finding the\nunique characteristic corresponding to the vector of Riemann constants is\nsuggested for non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
