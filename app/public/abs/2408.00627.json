We establish various necessary and sufficient\nconditions for developing matrices into the sum of tensor products of prime\nmatrices. For example, if the diagonal of a matrix blocked evenly are pairwise\ncommutative, it yields such a decomposition. The computational complexity of\nmultiplication of these algorithms is shown to be $O(n^{5/2})$. In the section\n5, a decomposition is proved to hold if and only if every even natural number\ngreater than 2 is the sum of two prime numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pcUODvA_1FPAyNt936UJc0i_0HLtMyjCObD75VOiOyo","pdfSize":"180459","txDigest":"GMsRZBn1pKydbN8GnNMxTDFgDbNT2324dSt9FG2iMZG3","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
