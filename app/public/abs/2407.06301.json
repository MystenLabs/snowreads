The galaxy bispectrum is a prime source of information\nas it allows us to probe primordial non-Gaussianity (PNG), a key factor in\ndifferentiating various models of inflation. On the scales where local PNG is\nstrongest, Doppler and other relativistic effects become important and need to\nbe included. We investigate the detectability of relativistic and local PNG\ncontributions in the galaxy bispectrum. We compute the signal-to-noise ratio\nfor the detection of the bispectrum including such effects. Furthermore, we\nperform information matrix forecasts on the local PNG parameter $f_{\\rm NL}$\nand on the parametrised amplitudes of the relativistic corrections. Finally, we\nquantify the bias on the measurement of $f_{\\rm NL}$ that arises from\nneglecting relativistic effects. Our results show that detections of both\nfirst- and second-order relativistic effects are promising with forthcoming\nspectroscopic survey specifications -- and are largely unaffected by the\nuncertainty in $f_{\\rm NL}$. Conversely, we show for the first time that\nneglecting relativistic corrections in the galaxy bispectrum can lead to\n$>\\!1.5\\sigma(f_{\\rm NL})$ shift on the detected value of $f_{\\rm NL}$,\nhighlighting the importance of including relativistic effects in our modelling.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
