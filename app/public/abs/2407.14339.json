In\nthis paper, we prove the conjecture for the Borel subgroup $B$ by constructing\na linear basis for $mathcal{Q}_m(n)^B$. The construction is based on an\noperator $\\delta$ which produces new invariants from old invariants of lower\nranks. We also upgrade the conjecture of Lewis, Reiner and Stanton by proposing\nan explicit basis for the space of invariants for each parabolic subgroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
