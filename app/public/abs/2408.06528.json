It is shown that stable slowly oscillating periodic solutions with\nthe period of the feedback coefficient, and also with the double period of the\nfeedback coefficient exist. The periodic solutions are built explicitly in the\ncase of piecewise constant feedback function and the periodic coefficient. The\nperiodic dynamics are shown to persist under small perturbations of the\nequation which make it smooth. The results are confirmed and illustrated by\nnumerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
