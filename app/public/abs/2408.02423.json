In contrast to the\ncase of a smooth kernel, in general the solution experiences finite-time\nblow-up. We provide an explicit example showing that solutions corresponding to\ndifferent smooth approximations of the convolution kernel in general converge\nto different measures after the blow-up time. This rules out a fairly natural\nstrategy for extending the notion of solution of the nonlocal conservation law\nafter the blow-up time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5qvJyyOgxtIg0bHQVVIgoE_pV2fOaF7eOt02P9NY1_Q","pdfSize":"292123"}
