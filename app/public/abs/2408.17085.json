The\nproper physical understanding of the measurement results, however, requires\nproper models for liposomes and their interaction with the surrounding water\nmolecules. Here, we present an MD-based approach for the theoretical prediction\nof R1=1/T1, the dependence of R1 on water concentration and the magnetization\nexchange between lipids and interacting water layer in lipids and lipid\nmixtures. Moreover, a new parameter is introduced which quantitatively measures\nthe amount of hydration water (hydration water fraction, f_HW) based on\nconventional spoiled gradient echo MR acquisitions. Both f_HW and the\nmagnetisation exchange rate between lipids and hydration water were determined\nquantitatively from spoiled gradient echo data. We observed that liposome\nsystems behaved similarly, apart from PLPC which showed both lower hydration\nwater fraction and lower exchange rate. The extracted parameters accurately\npredicted the measured water fraction-dependent R1 rates and allowed for a\ntheoretical understanding of MR parameters in liposomes of different\ncomposition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"EAUGbGA5i51Z46-_vlVUOmBiouoxFS5krRxRQqucLNQ","pdfSize":"1006410"}
