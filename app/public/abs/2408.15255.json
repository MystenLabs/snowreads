The network incorporates a graph\nhierarchy constructed from bottom-up at various abstraction levels, offering\nthe dual advantages of enhanced task-relevant deep feature extraction and a\nlightweight design. The model's effectiveness is further amplified when used in\nconjunction with a proposed unique label smoothing method. Comprehensive\nbenchmark experiments reveal that this combined approach yields high, balanced\nperformance in terms of both quantitative and qualitative predictions. HiSTN,\nwhich has approximately 1,000 parameters, achieves mean F1 scores of 96.82%\n(valence) and 95.62% (arousal) in subject-dependent tests on the\nrarely-utilized 5-classification task problem from the DREAMER dataset. In the\nsubject-independent settings, the same model yields mean F1 scores of 78.34%\nfor valence and 81.59% for arousal. The adoption of the Sequential Top-2 Hit\nRate (Seq2HR) metric highlights the significant enhancements in terms of the\nbalance between model's quantitative and qualitative for predictions achieved\nthrough our approach when compared to training with regular one-hot labels.\nThese improvements surpass 50% in subject-dependent tasks and 30% in\nsubject-independent tasks. The study also includes relevant ablation studies\nand case explorations to further elucidate the workings of the proposed model\nand enhance its interpretability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
