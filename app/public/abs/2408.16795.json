We lift to the maximal\ncompact subgroup the previously known attaching maps for the maximal flag\nmanifold and use it to characterize algebraically the incidence order between\nSchubert cells. We also present algebraic formulas to compute the boundary maps\nwhich extend to the maximal compact subgroups similar formulas obtained in the\ncase of the maximal flag manifolds. Finally, we apply our results to calculate\nthe cellular homology of $\\mbox{SO}(3)$ as the maximal compact subgroup of\n$\\mbox{SL}(3, \\mathbb{R})$ and the cellular homology of $\\mbox{SO}(4)$ as the\nmaximal compact subgroup of the split real form $G_2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
