In this paper we study a larger family of\nGolomb Costas permutations and prove a weaker bound on its maximal\ncross-correlation. Considering the whole family of Golomb Costas permutations\nwe show that large cross-correlations are very rare. Finally, we collect\nseveral conditions for a small cross-correlation of two Costas permutations.\nOur main tools are the Weil bound and the Szemer\\'edi-Trotter theorem for\nfinite fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
