We use a recently developed approach based on\nLagrange multipliers for infinite-dimensional functional estimation to derive\nclosed-form solutions for constrained optimization based on mean squared error\nand cross-entropy risk criteria. The theoretical forms of the solutions are\nanalyzed in detail and described as nuanced adjustments to the unconstrained\nminimizer. This analysis highlights important trade-offs between risk\nminimization and achieving fairnes. The theoretical solutions are also used as\nthe basis for construction of flexible semiparametric estimation strategies for\nthese nuisance components. We describe the robustness properties of our\nestimators in terms of achieving the optimal constrained risk, as well as in\nterms of controlling the value of the constraint. We study via simulation the\nimpact of using robust estimators of pathway-specific effects to validate our\ntheory. This work advances the discourse on algorithmic fairness by integrating\ncomplex causal considerations into model training, thus providing strategies\nfor implementing fair models in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4k79HpYJGC4KRGRUQW2Y38Ssrndczp0rkfBZ0IW97Mw","pdfSize":"1631325","txDigest":"CKq16zKadg7xQxapTC1xQAyVJWZt3rBpzp59cKdabBk6","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
