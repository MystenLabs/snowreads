In this letter, we apply Langer's theory of thermal activation to single\nmagnetic domain fcc Co nanoparticles, whose experimental microstructures are\ncharacterized by planar defects, and derive an analytic expression for the\nrelaxation time. The obtained Arrhenius exponential and its prefactor, which is\noften assumed to be a constant, are here found to both depend exponentially on\nsystem size and the number of defects. Together they provide a quantitative\nprediction of the experimental findings, and more generally highlight the\nimportance of structural defects when considering magnetic stability.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
