All the theorems\nhave formalizations in Lean 4 and Isabelle; a substantial subset also has Coq\nformalizations. Proving the theorems requires significant problem-solving\nability and proficiency in a broad range of topics taught in undergraduate\nmathematics courses. We use PutnamBench to evaluate several established neural\nand symbolic theorem-provers. These approaches can only solve a handful of the\nPutnamBench problems, establishing the benchmark as a difficult open challenge\nfor research on neural theorem-proving.
