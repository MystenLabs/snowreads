This construction is known in the literature as {\\em\nstable compactification} (\\cite{BezHar2}). We show that the frame of round\nideals naturally carries with it two proximities of interest from which two\ncomonads are induced.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
