In this work, we extend our previous studies of materials\ndiscovery using classical active learning (AL), which showed remarkable economy\nof data, to explore the use of quantum algorithms within the AL framework (QAL)\nas implemented in the MLChem4D and QMLMaterials codes. The proposed QAL uses\nquantum support vector regressor (QSVR) or a quantum Gaussian process regressor\n(QGPR) with various quantum kernels and different feature maps. Data sets\ninclude perovskite properties (piezoelectric coefficient, band gap, energy\nstorage) and the structure optimization of a doped nanoparticle (3Al@Si11)\nchosen to compare with classical AL results. Our results revealed that the QAL\nmethod improved the searches in most cases, but not all, seemingly correlated\nwith the roughness of the data. QAL has the potential of finding optimum\nsolutions, within chemical space, in materials science and elsewhere in\nchemistry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qb_mgLCI1T6b4_f7yS0R9bgdXXyUqCvoS9-5l1Y0IEI","pdfSize":"10187238"}
