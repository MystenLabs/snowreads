In this work, we model the neonatal development of the infant brain\nin this age range. As a basis, we use MR images of preterm- and term-birth\nneonates from the developing human connectome project (dHCP). We propose a\nneural network, specifically an implicit neural representation (INR), to\npredict 2D- and 3D images of varying time points. In order to model a\nsubject-specific development process, it is necessary to disentangle the age\nfrom the subjects' identity in the latent space of the INR. We propose two\nmethods, Subject Specific Latent Vectors (SSL) and Stochastic Global Latent\nAugmentation (SGLA), enabling this disentanglement. We perform an analysis of\nthe results and compare our proposed model to an age-conditioned denoising\ndiffusion model as a baseline. We also show that our method can be applied in a\nmemory-efficient way, which is especially important for 3D data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
