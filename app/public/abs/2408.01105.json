Although advances have been made in quantum software development,\nstandard software quality evaluation methods do not fully address the specifics\nof quantum components, resulting in a gap in the ability to ensure and maintain\nthe quality of hybrid software products. In this registered report proposal, we\nintend to validate a quality model focused on the analysability of hybrid\nsoftware through an international collab orative approach involving academic\ninstitutions from Italy and Spain through a controlled experiment. This\napproach allows for a more detailed analysis and validation methodology and\nestablishes a framework for future research and developments in software\nquality assessment in quantum computing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
