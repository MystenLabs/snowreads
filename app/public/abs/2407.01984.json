As a consequence, the unique measure\nof maximal entropy is the Monge-Amp\\`ere of a H\\\"older continuous\nplurisubharmonic function and has strictly positive Hausdorff dimension. Under\nthe same assumptions, we also prove that the Green currents are woven. When\nthey are of bidegree $(1,1)$, they are laminar. In particular, our results\ngeneralize results known until now only in algebraic settings, or in dimension\n2.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
