The launch of IXPE allowed us to check this prediction. IXPE\nobserved a dozen X-ray pulsars, discovering pulse-phase dependent variation of\nthe polarization degree (PD) and polarization angle (PA). Although the PD\nshowed rather erratic profiles resembling flux pulse dependence, the PA in most\ncases showed smooth variations consistent with the rotating vector model (RVM),\nwhich can be interpreted as a combined effect of vacuum birefringence and\ndipole magnetic field structure at a polarization-limiting (adiabatic) radius.\nApplication of the RVM allowed us to determine XRP geometry and to confirm the\nfree precession of the NS in Her X-1. Deviations from RVM in two bright\ntransients led to the discovery of an unpulsed polarized emission likely\nproduced by scattering off the accretion disk wind.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
