In general, we see that these defects\nintroduce non-local terms into the entanglement Hamiltonian with the largest\nbeing couplings across the defect that decay with distance. It is also shown\nthat the entanglement Hamiltonian does know of the defect even if the defect is\noutside of the subsystem. We also discuss what happens when defects are on the\nboundaries of the subsystem, and in particular, we investigate the behavior as\nthe bond leading into the subsystem is cut. Finally, we examine the non-local\nbehavior of the antiperiodic defect and duality defect, both of which introduce\nzero modes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SZclvktAIH0oQh-ZSDM6zWLV6MFP3qifSuBH0c-paz8","pdfSize":"2025154"}
