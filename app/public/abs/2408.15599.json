Then we obtain a criterion for precompactness in the matrix-weighted\nLebesgue space with variable exponent by average operator. Next, we give a\ncriterion for precompactness in the matrix-weighted Lebesgue space with\nvariable exponent by approximate identity. Finally, precompactness in the\nmatrix-weighted Sobolev space with variable exponent is also considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
