Our results agree with quantum electrodynamics predictions to\n$\\sim 0.005\\,\\%$ precision, and further allow us to calculate absorption and\nemission rates for axions, hidden photons, light scalars or other dark matter\ncandidates for hydrogen and hydrogenic ions. These results can be used to\ninform searches for light new physics as well as in calculations relevant to\nsearches for fifth forces or varying fundamental constants, with applications\nfrom astrophysics to laboratory spectroscopy experiments. We also provide a\ndedicated tool for the construction of hydrogenic transition amplitudes:\n\"Computation of hydrogen radial INtegrals and COefficients\" ($\\texttt{CINCO}$).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
