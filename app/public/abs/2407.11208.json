In this work, we investigate\nthe stabilization of these immiscible pairs through the integration of Cerium\n(Ce), an abundant rare-earth and cost-effective element. By employing a machine\nlearning (ML)-guided framework, particularly crystal graph convolutional neural\nnetworks (CGCNN), combined with first-principles calculations, we efficiently\nexplore the composition/structure space and predict 9 stable and 37 metastable\nCe-Fe-X (X=Bi, Pb, In and Ag) ternary compounds. Our findings include the\nidentification of multiple new stable and metastable phases, which are\nevaluated for their structural and energetic properties. These discoveries not\nonly contribute to the advancement of quantum materials but also offer viable\nalternatives to critical rare earth elements, underscoring the importance of\nCe-based intermetallic compounds in technological applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XMfXURilUjTMszPzKBtyMjWLDGoFuMsgm30zN8oGq1A","pdfSize":"1221875"}
