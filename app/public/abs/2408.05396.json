However, the Bohmian particle does not affect its guiding wave, so the\nwave field must instead be prescribed by the system geometry. While this\nproperty is widely assumed necessary to ensure agreement with quantum\nmechanics, much work has recently been dedicated to understanding classical\npilot-wave systems, which feature a two-way coupling between particle and wave.\nThese systems, including the \"walking droplet\" system of Couder and Fort (2006)\nand its various abstractions, allow us to investigate the limits of classical\nsystems and offer a touchstone between quantum and classical dynamics. In this\nwork, we present a general result that bridges Bohmian mechanics with this\nclassical pilot-wave theory. Namely, Darrow and Bush (2024) recently introduced\na Lagrangian pilot-wave framework to study quantum-like behaviours in classical\nsystems; with a particular choice of particle-wave coupling, they recover key\ndynamics hypothesised in de Broglie's early \"double-solution\" theory. We here\nshow that, with a different choice of coupling, their de Broglie-like system\nreduces exactly to single-particle Bohmian mechanics in the non-relativistic\nlimit. Finally, we present an application of the present work in developing an\nanalogue for position measurement in a de Broglie-like setting.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
