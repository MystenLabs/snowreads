Using this\ncalculated field and Monte Carlo methods, the atomic translational dynamics are\nsimulated to produce the well-known quantized end-pattern with matching\ndimensions. The finite-element method used provides the most accurate\ndescription of the Stern$\\unicode{x2013}$Gerlach magnetic field and end-pattern\nin the literature, matching the historically reported values and figures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
