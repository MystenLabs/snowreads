Our\nproposed framework, SLAM2REF, introduces a novel approach for automatic\nalignment and map extension utilizing reference 3D maps. The methodology is\nsupported by a sophisticated multi-session anchoring technique, which\nintegrates novel descriptors and registration methodologies. Real-world\nexperiments reveal the framework's remarkable robustness and accuracy,\nsurpassing current state-of-the-art methods. Our open-source framework's\nsignificance lies in its contribution to resilient map data management,\nenhancing processes across diverse sectors such as construction site\nmonitoring, emergency response, disaster management, and others, where\nfast-updated digital 3D maps contribute to better decision-making and\nproductivity. Moreover, it offers advancements in localization and mapping\nresearch.
