The argument applies a new kind of arithmetic holonomy bound\nto a well-known construction of Zagier. In fact our work also establishes the\n$\\mathbf{Q}$-linear independence of $1$, $\\zeta(2)$, and $L(2,\\chi_{-3})$. We\nalso give a number of other applications of our method to other problems in\nirrationality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9pKrjQpRIv7Fd05SOpCgofPVNXLgMkuC3HbWhmzls9E","pdfSize":"4513083"}
