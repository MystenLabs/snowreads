Therefore, classifying PolSAR\nimages with limited labels is a challenging task in remote sensing domain. In\nrecent years, self-supervised learning approaches have proven effective in\nPolSAR image classification with sparse labels. However, we observe a lack of\nresearch on generative selfsupervised learning in the studied task. Motivated\nby this, we propose a dual-branch classification model based on generative\nself-supervised learning in this paper. The first branch is a\nsuperpixel-branch, which learns superpixel-level polarimetric representations\nusing a generative self-supervised graph masked autoencoder. To acquire finer\nclassification results, a convolutional neural networks-based pixel-branch is\nfurther incorporated to learn pixel-level features. Classification with fused\ndual-branch features is finally performed to obtain the predictions.\nExperimental results on the benchmark Flevoland dataset demonstrate that our\napproach yields promising classification results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
