Via appropriate Fourier transform, the latter describe how charge,\nenergy, linear and angular momentum, but also pressure are distributed inside\nthese systems. Electromagnetic form factors of the nucleon have been measured\nfor a long time, but it is only recently that some gravitational form factors\nhave been extracted from experimental data, creating a great deal of enthusiasm\nin the hadronic community. Here we summarize some of the recent developments on\nthe interpretation of these form factors, and provide a quick overview of what\nwe can learn about the nucleon mass, spin and internal pressure.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2kRsSW3K-zl6kEovRg4oXn3zCx_-AR3VzT1WKRi6FtI","pdfSize":"574448"}
