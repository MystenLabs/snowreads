Several empirical\ninvestigations show that market efficiency drops when it undergoes extreme\nevents. Many models for multivariate extremes focus on positive dependence,\nmaking them unsuitable for studying extremal dependence in financial markets\nwhere data often exhibit both positive and negative extremal dependence. To\nthis end, we construct regular variation models on the entirety of\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ and develop a bivariate measure for asymmetry in the strength of\nextremal dependence between adjacent orthants. Our directional tail dependence\n(DTD) measure allows us to define the Efficient Tail Hypothesis (ETH) -- an\nanalogue of the Efficient Market Hypothesis -- for the extremal behaviour of\nthe market. Asymptotic results for estimators of DTD are described, and we\ndiscuss testing of the ETH via permutation-based methods and present novel\ntools for visualization. Empirical study of China's futures market leads to a\nrejection of the ETH and we identify potential profitable investment\nopportunities. To promote the research of microstructure in China's derivatives\nmarket, we open-source our high-frequency data, which are being collected\ncontinuously from multiple derivative exchanges.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"xBY0tL4zquQsaIIDHYJ9hUrLxfIFp0d12z4azeZHjtk","pdfSize":"4468166"}
