For incompressible viscous flow\ninteracting with a stationary wall, the full expressions of the boundary fluxes\nof the orbital rotation and the spin are derived, for the first time, to\nelucidate their boundary creation mechanisms, respectively. Then, these new\nfindings are successfully extended to the study of the boundary enstrophy\ndynamics, as well as the Lyman vorticity dynamics as an alternative\ninterpretation to the boundary vorticity dynamics. Interestingly, it is found\nthat the boundary coupling of the longitudinal and transverse processes is only\nembodied in the boundary spin flux, which is definitely not responsible for the\ngeneration of the boundary orbital-rotation flux. In addition, the boundary\nfluxes of enstrophy are directly associated with the boundary source of the\nsecond principal invariant of the velocity gradient tensor, and the two\nquadratic forms representing the spin-geometry interaction. The present\nexposition provides a new perspective to the vorticity dynamics on boundaries,\nwhich could be valuable in clarifying the formation mechanisms of near-wall\ncoherent structures and flow noise at the fundamental level.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
