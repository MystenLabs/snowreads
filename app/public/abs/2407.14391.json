A related chiral flux phase that breaks\nthe time-reversal symmetry has been further theoretically predicted in these\nmaterials. The flux phase is associated with loop currents that produce ordered\norbital magnetic moments, which would occur at the momentum points, $\\bf M$,\ncharacterizing the charge-density wave state. Polarized neutron-diffraction\nexperiments have been performed on an assembly of single crystals of ${\\rm\nCsV_3Sb_5}$ to search for such orbital magnetic moments. No evidence for the\nexistence of a three-dimensionally ordered moment is found at any temperature\nat the first ${\\bf M_1}$=(1/2,0,0) point in the Brillouin zone within an\nexcellent experimental uncertainty, ${\\it i.e.}$ ${\\bf m}=0 \\pm 0.01\\mu_B$ per\nvanadium atom. However, a hint to a magnetic orbital moment is found in the\nsecond Brillouin zone at {\\bf M$_2$}=(1/2,1/2,0) at the detection limit of the\nexperiment. Some loop currents patterns flowing ${\\it only}$ on vanadium\ntriangles are able to account for this finding suggesting an ordered orbital\nmagnetic moment of, at most, $\\sim 0.02 \\pm 0.01\\mu_B$ per vanadium triangle.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"l1NLBb-e-_OjW62ygiO3Z42qxyi6fDi0NSTgYXT8gSk","pdfSize":"5217394"}
