We\nprovide closure properties, prove that their co-word problems are context-free,\nstudy the torsion elements, and realize them as subgroups of the asynchronous\nrational group. Furthermore, we use a generalized version of the free product\nof graphs and prove that such a product is context-free inverse closed. We also\nexhibit an example of a group in our class that is not residually finite and\none that is not poly-context-free. These properties make them interesting\ncandidates to disprove both the Lehnert conjecture (which characterizes\nco-context-free groups as all subgroups of Thompson's group V) and the Brough\nconjecture (which characterizes finitely generated poly-context-free groups as\nvirtual finitely generated subgroups of direct products of free groups).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
