The trivial greedy algorithm is $(2-o(1))$-competitive,\nwhich is optimal for graphs of low maximum degree, $\\Delta=O(\\log n)$ [BNMN\nIPL'92]. Numerous online edge-coloring algorithms outperforming the greedy\nalgorithm in various settings were designed over the years (e.g., AGKM FOCS'03,\nBMM SODA'10, CPW FOCS'19, BGW SODA'21, KLSST STOC'22, BSVW STOC'24), all\ncrucially relying on randomization. A commonly-held belief, first stated by\n[BNMN IPL'92], is that randomization is necessary to outperform greedy.\n  Surprisingly, we refute this belief, by presenting a deterministic algorithm\nthat beats greedy for sufficiently large $\\Delta=\\Omega(\\log n)$, and in\nparticular has competitive ratio $\\frac{e}{e-1}+o(1)$ for all\n$\\Delta=\\omega(\\log n)$. We obtain our result via a new and surprisingly simple\nrandomized algorithm that works against adaptive adversaries (as opposed to\noblivious adversaries assumed by prior work), which implies the existence of a\nsimilarly-competitive deterministic algorithm [BDBKTW STOC'90].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
