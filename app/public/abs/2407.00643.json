Results show that optical bypass\nis still the most power-efficient solution, reducing consumption by up to 30%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
