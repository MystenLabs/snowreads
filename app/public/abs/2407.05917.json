With the input of experimentally\nrelevant coupling strengths, our exact diagonalization (ED) study probes the\nground state properties beyond previous linear spin-wave approach. An\nintermediate range of $x \\in [0.08, 0.55]$ is identified for a nonmagnetic\nphase without the long-range N\\'eel or stripe order. The absence of both\nvalence-bond-glass order and spin-glass non-ergodic dynamics renders its nature\nintriguing. Deep inside this phase around $x = 0.3$, we observe signatures\npotentially linked to randomness-induced short-range spin-liquid-like (SLL)\nstates, including close to zero spin-freezing parameter, vanishing spin-spin\ncorrelation beyond nearest neighbors, almost uniform static spin structure\nfactor, as well as a broad tail in the dynamical spin structure factor. The\nnonmagnetic phase also features multipartite entanglement in the ground state\nwitnessed by quantum Fisher information (QFI), which exhibits universal scaling\nbehaviors at quantum critical points.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
