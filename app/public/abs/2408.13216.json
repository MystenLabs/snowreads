The\nzero-divisor graph of R with respect to I, denoted by $\\Gamma_I(R)$, is the\ngraph whose vertices are the set $\\{x \\in R \\setminus I | xy \\in I$ for some $y\n\\in R \\setminus I\\}$, where distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only\nif $xy \\in I$. The cozero-divisor graph with respect to I, denoted by\n$\\Gamma''_I(R)$, is the graph of $R$ with vertices $\\{x \\in R \\setminus I | xR\n+ I \\neq R\\}$, and two distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if $x\n\\notin yR + I$ and $y \\notin xR + I$. In this paper, we introduce and\ninvestigate an undirected graph $Q\\Gamma''_I(R)$ of R with vertices $\\{x \\in R\n\\setminus \\sqrt{I} | xR + I \\neq R$ and $xR + \\sqrt{I} = xR + I\\}$ and two\ndistinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if $x \\notin yR + I$ and $y\n\\notin xR + I$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
