The light-front wave functions have been successful in\nexplaining various physical properties of meson states in the past, especially\nfor the $1S$ and $2S$ states. However, studies regarding the radially excited\nstate $3S$ and orbitally excited state $1P$ have hardly been pursued before. In\nthis study, we take up these two excited states and investigate the\nelectromagnetic form factors (EMFFs), charge radii, decay constants, parton\ndistribution functions (PDFs) and the distribution amplitudes (DAs) for the\nquarkonia system. For the sake of completeness, we have also included the study\nof the ground and the first excited states of quarkonia mesons. We have also\nillustrated the 3D wave functions for the radially excited states in order to\nstudy their nodal structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
