This phenomenon has been verified in some\nsmall physical models, yet some fundamental issues about this process have not\nbeen clarified. In this paper, we revisit this problem of ESP and pinpoint a\npair of non-adiabatic points in the band levels, at which the adiabatic\ncondition breaks down. We determine the two points using the criteria of\nnon-adiabaticity. As a result, the oscillation of ESP as evolution time varies\ncan be resolved in terms of Landau-Zener-St\\\"{u}ckelberg (LZS) interference.\nFurthermore, in the presence of disorder, we show that the ESP may break down\nfor the anticrossing between the edge and the bulk levels, where the\nnon-adiabaticity diverges. Thus in a relatively long chain with weak disorder,\nwe demonstrate the failure of the ESP. This new type of ESP unveiled in this\nwork is readily accessible in experiment, and shall therefore lead to a\ndown-to-earth platform for the intriguing LZS dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
