{"id":"2408.13610","title":"The Boltzmann equation in the homogeneous critical regularity framework","authors":"Jing Liu, Ling-Yun Shou, and Jiang Xu","authorsParsed":[["Liu","Jing",""],["Shou","Ling-Yun",""],["Xu","Jiang",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2024 15:45:51 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-27","timestamp":1724514351000,"abstract":"  We construct a unique global solution to the Cauchy problem of the 3D\nBoltzmann equation for initial data around the Maxwellian in the spatially\ncritical homogeneous Besov space\n$\\widetilde{L}^2_{\\xi}(\\dot{B}_{2,1}^{1/2}\\cap\\dot{B}_{2,1}^{3/2})$. In\naddition, under the condition that the low-frequency part of initial\nperturbation is bounded in\n$\\widetilde{L}^2_{\\xi}(\\dot{B}_{2,\\infty}^{\\sigma_{0}})$ with\n$-3/2\\leq\\sigma_{0}<1/2$, it is shown that the solution converges to its\nequilibrium in large times with the optimal rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(t^{-(\\sigma-\\sigma_{0})/2})$ in\n$\\widetilde{L}^2_{\\xi}(\\dot{B}_{2,1}^{\\sigma})$ with some $\\sigma>\\sigma_0$,\nand the microscopic part decays at an enhanced rate of\n$\\mathcal{O}(t^{-(\\sigma-\\sigma_{0})/2-1/2})$. In contrast to [19], the usual\n$L^2$ estimates are not necessary in our approach, which provides a new\nunderstanding of hypocoercivity theory for the Boltzmann equation allowing to\nconstruct the Lyapunov functional with different dissipation rates at low and\nhigh frequencies. Furthermore, a time-weighted Lyapunov energy argument can be\ndeveloped to deduce the optimal time-decay estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
