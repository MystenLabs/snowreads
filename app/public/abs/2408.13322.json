The spectral density, the distribution of the\nlocal density of states, the singularity spectrum and the multifractal\nexponents of this model exhibit a rich behaviour as a function of the first two\nmoments of the coupling strengths and the variance of the rescaled degrees. In\nthe case of random coupling strengths, the spectral density diverges within the\nbulk of the spectrum when degree fluctuations are strong enough. The emergence\nof this singular behaviour marks a transition from non-ergodic delocalized\nstates to localized eigenvectors that exhibit pronounced multifractal scaling.\nFor constant coupling strengths, the bulk of the spectrum is characterized by a\nregular spectral density. In this case, the corresponding eigenvectors display\nlocalization properties reminiscent of the critical point of the Anderson\nlocalization transition on random graphs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
