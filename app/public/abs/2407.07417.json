We calculate the $\\gamma$-ray deposition histories\nand the $^{56}$Ni mass synthesized in the explosion, $M_\\mathrm{Ni56}$, for\neight 2003fg-like SNe. Our findings reveal that the $\\gamma$-ray escape time,\n$t_0$, for these objects is $ t_0\\approx45\\text{-}60 \\,$ days, significantly\nhigher than that of normal SNe Ia. 2003fg-like SNe are distinct from normal SNe\nIa in the $ t_0 $-$ M_\\mathrm{Ni56} $ plane, with a noticeable gap between the\ntwo populations. The observed position of 2003fg-like SNe in this plane poses a\nsignificant challenge for theoretical explosion models. We demonstrate that the\nmerger of two white dwarfs (WDs) and a single star exceeding the Chandrasekhar\nlimit fail to reproduce the observed $ t_0 $-$ M_\\mathrm{Ni56} $ distribution.\nHowever, preliminary calculations of head-on collisions of massive WDs show\nagreement with the observed $ t_0 $-$ M_\\mathrm{Ni56} $ distribution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
