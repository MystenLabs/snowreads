We extend this construction and express the Khovanov-Rozansky\nhomology of an oriented link in terms of a combinatorially defined category\nwhose morphisms are equivalence classes of formal complexes of (formal direct\nsums of shifted) oriented trivalent plane graphs. By working combinatorially,\none avoids many of the computational difficulties involved in the matrix\nfactorization computations of the original Khovanov-Rozansky formulation: one\nsystematically uses combinatorial relations satisfied by these matrix\nfactorizations to simplify the computation at a level that is easily handled.\nBy using this technique, we are able to provide a computation of the level $n$\nKhovanov-Rozansky invariant of the 2-strand braid link with $k$ crossings, for\narbitrary $n$ and $k$, confirming and extending previous results and\nconjectural predictions by Anokhina-Morozov, Beliakova-Putyra-Wehrli,\nCarqueville-Murfet, Dolotin-Morozov, Gukov-Iqbal-Kozcaz-Vafa,\nNizami-Munir-Sohail-Usman, and Rasmussen.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
