For\nstatic tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit\nvanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is\nsensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the\ntidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing\nthat the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified\ngravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers.\nFurthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with\nnext-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein\nTelescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with\nhigh precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around\ncoalescing binary systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
