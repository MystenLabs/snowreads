A novel approach to resilience based on rare event\ntechniques is presented which leads to a measure capturing `resistance to\nchange` and `ability to return' aspects in a probabilistic way. The application\nof this measure to a conceptual model demonstrates its suitability for\nassessing AMOC resilience but also shows its potential use in many other\nnon-autonomous dynamical systems. This framework is then extended to compute\nthe probability that the AMOC undergoes a transition conditioned on an external\nforcing. Such conditional probability can be estimated by exploiting the\ninformation available when computing the resilience of this system. This allows\nus to provide a probabilistic view on safe operating spaces by defining a\nconditional safe operating space as a subset of the parameter space of the\n(possibly transient) imposed forcing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
