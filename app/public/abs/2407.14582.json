Once they turn non-relativistic, this\nresults in a significant amplification of the anisotropies in the cosmic\nneutrino background (C$\\nu$B). Past studies have reconstructed the phase-space\ndistribution of relic neutrinos from the local distribution of matter\n(accounting for the Milky Way halo and the surrounding large-scale structures),\nbut have neglected the C$\\nu$B anisotropies in the initial conditions of\nneutrino trajectories. Using our previously developed N-1-body simulation\nframework, we show that including these primordial fluctuations in the initial\nconditions can be important, as it produces similar effects on the abundance\nand anisotropies of the C$\\nu$B as the inclusion of large-scale structures\nbeyond the Milky Way halo. Interpretability of data from future C$\\nu$B\nobservatories like PTOLEMY therefore depends on correctly modelling these\neffects.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
