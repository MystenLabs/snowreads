Our polarized neutron\nimaging data and the additional supporting measurements using neutron spin echo\nspectroscopy and SQUID magnetometry are all consistent with a vanishing\ninternal magnetization at $T_{comp}$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
