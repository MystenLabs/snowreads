The starting point of this construction is the observation\nthat the Euclidean versions of these metrics should have two different\ncommuting complex structures, as well as two commuting Killing vector fields.\nAfter some linear algebra, this leads to an ansatz for the metrics, which is\nhalf-way to their complete determination. Kerr metric is a special 2-parameter\nsubfamily in this class, which makes these considerations directly relevant to\nKerr as well. This results in a derivation of the Kerr metric that is\nself-contained and elementary.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
