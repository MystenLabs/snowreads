When combined with geometric\npatterns, these inputs influence and induce interesting psychophysical\nphenomena, such as the MacKay and the Billock-Tsou effects, where the subjects\nperceive specific afterimages typically modulated by the flickering frequency.\nDue to the symmetry-breaking structure of the inputs, classical bifurcation\ntheory and multi-scale analysis techniques are not very effective in our\ncontext. We thus take an approach based on the input-output framework of\ncontrol theory for Amari-type neural fields. This allows us to prove that, when\ndriven by periodic inputs, the dynamics converge to a periodic state. Moreover,\nwe study under which assumptions these nonlinear dynamics can be effectively\nlinearised, and in this case we present a precise approximation of the integral\nkernel for short-range excitatory and long-range inhibitory neuronal\ninteractions. Finally, for inputs concentrated at the center of the visual\nfield with a flickering background, we directly relate the width of the\nillusory contours appearing in the afterimage with both the flickering\nfrequency and the strength of the inhibition.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
