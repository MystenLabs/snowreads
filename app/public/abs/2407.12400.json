In this paper, we study two operations on PL spheres, known as\nthe stellar subdivision and the wedge, that preserve the maximality of\nBuchstaber numbers and polytopality. We construct a new polytopal toric\ncolorable seed from these two operations. As a corollary, we prove that the\ntoric colorable seed inequality established by Choi and Park is tight.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8XI3vcUrylQfJwsmtS1FGy3gTh1YwyzZJwoGSIkVWhw","pdfSize":"137818","objectId":"0x1a481abe4cd78be1a7018a8be3f3690883051d54c151cf335ce1bf93481b3120","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
