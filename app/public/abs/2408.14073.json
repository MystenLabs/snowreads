The\ncore of the procedure is a version of the fixed share forecaster for the case\nof infinite number of experts and quadratic loss functions. The algorithm shows\na promising performance in numerical experiments on artificial and real-world\ndata sets. We also derive new upper bounds on the dynamic regret of the fixed\nshare forecaster with varying parameter, which are of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
