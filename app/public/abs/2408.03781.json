We then\nanalyze both the late-time and early-time attractors for the decay rate of spin\ndensity. Additionally, we report the focusing behavior in spin hydrodynamics,\nwhich has not been found in conventional relativistic hydrodynamics in Bjorken\nexpansion. Our findings suggest that spin density can be treated as a\nconventional hydrodynamic variable at late times under certain conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
