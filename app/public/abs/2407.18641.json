By leveraging\nduality, we characterize tracking controllability through a non-standard\nobservability inequality for the adjoint system. This characterization\nfacilitates the development of a systematic approach for constructing controls\nwith minimal norm. However, achieving such an observability property is\nchallenging. To address this, we utilize the classical Brunovsk\\'y canonical\nform for control systems, specifically focusing on the case of scalar controls.\nOur findings reveal that tracking control inherently involves a loss of\nregularity in the controls. This phenomenon is highly sensitive to the system's\nstructure and the interaction between the projection to be tracked and the\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
