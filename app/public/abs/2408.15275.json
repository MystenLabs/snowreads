Its structure and facilities are described. The tool allows\ncompressing images by different coders according to a chosen metric from an\navailable set of quality metrics with providing a preset metric value. Examples\nof the tool application to several practical situations are represented.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
