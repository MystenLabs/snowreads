Excellent agreement is found with earlier determinations\nobtained from $p_T$-balance based in situ methods ($Z/\\gamma$+jets). The\ncombination of these two independent methods results in the most precise jet\nenergy measurement achieved so far with the ATLAS detector with a relative\nuncertainty of 0.3% at $p_T = 300$ GeV and 0.6% at $4$ TeV.\n  The jet energy calibration is also derived with the single-particle\ncalorimeter response measurements separately for quark- and gluon-induced jets\nand furthermore for jets with $R$ varying from 0.2 to 1.0 retaining the\ncorrelations between these measurements. Differences between inclusive jets and\njets from boosted top-quark decays, with and without grooming the soft jet\nconstituents, are also studied.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
