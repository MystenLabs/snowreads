While the performance of high-priority traffic\nhas been extensively studied in recent years, the performance of low-priority\ntraffic varies significantly between different TSN forwarding algorithms. This\npaper provides an overview of existing TSN forwarding algorithms and discusses\ntheir impact on best-effort traffic. The effects are quantified through\nsimulations of synthetic and realistic networks. The considered forwarding\nmechanisms are Strict Priority (SP), Asynchronous Traffic Shaper (ATS),\nCredit-Based Shaper (CBS), Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS), and\nTime-Aware Shaper (TAS).\n  The findings indicate that ATS, CBS, and ETS can significantly reduce queuing\ndelays and queue lengths for best-effort traffic when compared to SP and TAS.\nThis effect is enhanced when the reserved bandwidth for high priority queues -\nusing CBS, ATS, or ETS - is reduced to the lowest possible value, within the\nreserved rate and latency requirements. Specifically, the simulations\ndemonstrate that the choice of forwarding algorithm can improve the performance\nof low-priority traffic by up to twenty times compared to the least effective\nalgorithm. This study not only provides a comprehensive understanding of the\nvarious TSN forwarding algorithms but can also serve as guidance at networks'\ndesign time to improve the performance for all types of traffic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
