By now, the most popular realistic assumption\nfor curves is $c$-packedness. Existing algorithms for computing the Fr\\'echet\ndistance between $c$-packed curves require both curves to be $c$-packed. In\nthis paper, we only require one of the two curves to be $c$-packed. Our result\nis a nearly-linear time algorithm that $(1+\\varepsilon)$-approximates the\nFr\\'echet distance between a $c$-packed curve and a general curve in $\\mathbb\nR^d$, for constant values of $\\varepsilon$, $d$ and $c$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
