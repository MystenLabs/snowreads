When these\nphenomena represent interactions and are captured at a fine-grained temporal\nresolution, they are modeled as link streams. Community detection is an\nessential network analysis task. Although many methods exist for static\nnetworks, and some methods have been developed for temporal networks\nrepresented as sequences of snapshots, few works can handle link streams. This\narticle introduces the first adaptation of the well-known Modularity quality\nfunction to link streams. Unlike existing methods, it is independent of the\ntime scale of analysis. After introducing the quality function, and its\nrelation to existing static and dynamic definitions of Modularity, we show\nexperimentally its relevance for dynamic community evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
