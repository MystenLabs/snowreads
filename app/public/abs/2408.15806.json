We study a\nbroad class of models whose probability distribution has a product form, which\nincludes the popular Indian buffet process. This class plays a prominent role\namong existing priors, and it shares structural characteristics with Gibbs-type\npriors in the species sampling framework. We develop a general theory for the\nentire class, obtaining closed form expressions for the predictive structure\nand the posterior law of the underlying stochastic process. Additionally, we\ndescribe the distribution for the number of features and the number of hitherto\nunseen features in a future sample, leading to the $\\alpha$-diversity for\nfeature models. We also examine notable novel examples, such as mixtures of\nIndian buffet processes and beta Bernoulli models, where the latter entails a\nfinite random number of features. This methodology finds significant\napplications in ecology, allowing the estimation of species richness for\nincidence data, as we demonstrate by analyzing plant diversity in Danish\nforests and trees in Barro Colorado Island.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2fAOamH1SNzSXpjhVe9kYCB72Pk5UfePju1rObkAnjo","pdfSize":"2812195"}
