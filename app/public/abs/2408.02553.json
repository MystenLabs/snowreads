In this short work, we consider the direct\ngravitational perturbations of charge carriers via their minimal coupling to\ngravity in a collisionless plasma. We find that for isotropic plasmas, no\nsecondary plasma perturbations are generated. However, when an anisotropy is\nintroduced in the form of a background plasma current, we find that\ngravitational waves can induce a secondary current. For a constant DC\nbackground current, the secondary current inherits the AC frequency of the\ngravitational waves. It will certainly be interesting to investigate this\neffect in astrophysical plasmas in future work as well as its wider\nphenomenological consequences.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ulaVtrdBMWC6p7zCqeyfLSag6Wr6dSHBO9q6EYR2oKI","pdfSize":"415010"}
