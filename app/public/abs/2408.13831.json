With the recent introduction of neural metrics, the field has\nwitnessed notable advancements. Nevertheless, the inherent opacity of these\nmetrics has posed substantial challenges to the meta-evaluation process. This\nwork highlights two issues with the meta-evaluation framework currently\nemployed in WMT, and assesses their impact on the metrics rankings. To do this,\nwe introduce the concept of sentinel metrics, which are designed explicitly to\nscrutinize the meta-evaluation process's accuracy, robustness, and fairness. By\nemploying sentinel metrics, we aim to validate our findings, and shed light on\nand monitor the potential biases or inconsistencies in the rankings. We\ndiscover that the present meta-evaluation framework favors two categories of\nmetrics: i) those explicitly trained to mimic human quality assessments, and\nii) continuous metrics. Finally, we raise concerns regarding the evaluation\ncapabilities of state-of-the-art metrics, emphasizing that they might be basing\ntheir assessments on spurious correlations found in their training data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
