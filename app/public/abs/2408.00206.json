In a variety tasks of uncertainty quantification, generating\nrandom sample paths of GPs is of interest. As GP sampling requires generating\nhigh-dimensional Gaussian random vectors, it is computationally challenging if\na direct method, such as the Cholesky decomposition, is used. In this paper, we\npropose a scalable algorithm for sampling random realizations of the prior and\nposterior of GP models. The proposed algorithm leverages inducing points\napproximation with sparse grids, as well as additive Schwarz preconditioners,\nwhich reduce computational complexity, and ensure fast convergence. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy and accuracy of the proposed method through a series\nof experiments and comparisons with other recent works.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
