Traditional modeling approaches require\nextensive domain knowledge, often leading to a shift towards data-driven\nmethods using machine learning. However, existing research provides\ninconclusive results on which machine learning methods are best suited for\npredicting chaotic systems. In this paper, we compare different lightweight and\nheavyweight machine learning architectures using extensive existing databases,\nas well as a newly introduced one that allows for uncertainty quantification in\nthe benchmark results. We perform hyperparameter tuning based on computational\ncost and introduce a novel error metric, the cumulative maximum error, which\ncombines several desirable properties of traditional metrics, tailored for\nchaotic systems. Our results show that well-tuned simple methods, as well as\nuntuned baseline methods, often outperform state-of-the-art deep learning\nmodels, but their performance can vary significantly with different\nexperimental setups. These findings underscore the importance of matching\nprediction methods to data characteristics and available computational\nresources.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
