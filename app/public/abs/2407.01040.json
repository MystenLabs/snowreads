Based on the asymptotic\nexpansion of the marginal quasi-log likelihood, we propose two types of\nquasi-Bayesian information criteria of the SEM. It is shown that the\ninformation criteria have model selection consistency. Furthermore, we examine\nthe finite-sample performance of the proposed information criteria by numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
