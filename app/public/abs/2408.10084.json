However, they often\nrely too heavily on \\emph{local} structures and neglect \\emph{global}\ncharacteristics, which can lead to significant errors in peak selection and\ndependency establishment. Although introducing more hyperparameters that revise\ndependencies can help mitigate this issue, tuning them is challenging and even\nimpossible on real-world datasets. In this paper, we propose a new algorithm\n(TANGO) to establish local dependencies by exploiting a global-view\n\\emph{typicality} of points, which is obtained by mining further the density\ndistributions and initial dependencies. TANGO then obtains sub-clusters with\nthe help of the adjusted dependencies, and characterizes the similarity between\nsub-clusters by incorporating path-based connectivity. It achieves final\nclustering by employing graph-cut on sub-clusters, thus avoiding the\nchallenging selection of cluster centers. Moreover, this paper provides\ntheoretical analysis and an efficient method for the calculation of typicality.\nExperimental results on several synthetic and $16$ real-world datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of TANGO.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
