In the latter context, on-chip\nFETs with low power consumption are a crucial requirement. This, in turn,\nrequires operating voltages in the millivolt range, which are only achievable\nin devices with ultra-steep subthreshold slopes. However, in conventional\ncryogenic metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS)FETs based on bulk material, the\nexperimentally achieved inverse subthreshold slopes saturate around a few\nmV/dec due to disorder and charged defects at the MOS interface. FETs based on\ntwo-dimensional materials offer a promising alternative. Here, we show that\nFETs based on Bernal stacked bilayer graphene encapsulated in hexagonal boron\nnitride and graphite gates exhibit inverse subthreshold slopes of down to 250\n${\\mu}$V/dec at 0.1 K, approaching the Boltzmann limit. This result indicates\nan effective suppression of band tailing in van-der-Waals heterostructures\nwithout bulk interfaces, leading to superior device performance at cryogenic\ntemperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
