This answers a challenging question raised by\nTucker, based on some work for special cases by May and Zimmerman and himself.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AM46UPq9FE_AeA_Sb8tZQfDg70F_ZGxvODPpkoMl9GA","pdfSize":"181673"}
