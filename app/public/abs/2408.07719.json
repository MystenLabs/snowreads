Many methods have achieved some\nsuccess, however they treat variables and symbols merely as characters of\nnatural language without considering their mathematical essence. This paper\nintroduces the operator feature neural network (OF-Net) which employs operator\nrepresentation for expressions and proposes an implicit feature encoding method\nfor the intrinsic mathematical operational logic of operators. By substituting\noperator features for numeric loss, we can predict the combination of operators\nof target expressions. We evaluate the model on public datasets, and the\nresults demonstrate that the model achieves superior recovery rates and high\n$R^2$ scores. With the discussion of the results, we analyze the merit and\ndemerit of OF-Net and propose optimizing schemes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
