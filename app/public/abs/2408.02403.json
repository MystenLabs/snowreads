We propose the unconstrained PACE (Pacing According to Current\nEstimated utility) algorithm, a parameter-free allocation dynamic that requires\nno prior knowledge of the input while using only integral allocations. PACE\nattains near-optimal convergence or approximation guarantees under stationary,\nstochastic-but-nonstationary, and adversarial input types, thereby achieving\nthe first best-of-many-worlds guarantee in online fair allocation. Beyond\ntheoretical bounds, PACE is highly simple, efficient, and decentralized, and is\nthus likely to perform well on a broad range of real-world inputs. Numerical\nresults support the conclusion that PACE works well under a variety of input\nmodels. We find that PACE performs very well on two real-world datasets even\nunder the true temporal arrivals in the data, which are highly nonstationary.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
