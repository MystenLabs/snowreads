For our analysis, we use three different templates: point\nsource, radial disk and radial Gaussian. We do not detect a signal with\nsignificance $>3\\sigma$ for any of these templates at any location with\n$R_{200}$ of the cluster center. We obtain 95\\% c.l. upper limit on the energy\nflux between $\\sim 10^{-6}$ and $10^{-4} \\rm{MeV~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$ depending on\nthe energy range. These upper limits are consistent with the a non-zero flux\ndetected by Fermi-LAT (at $6\\sigma$ significance) for this cluster. This work\nrepresents the first proof of principle search for gamma-ray emission from a\nsingle galaxy cluster using DAMPE data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gsL1EaZW4z8K4Ysy_UTqi9Qg2B9NgTT12Kcp6WuIqpU","pdfSize":"439516"}
