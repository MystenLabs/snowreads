Traditional methods rely on\nlabor-intensive and error-prone manual segmentation. This study proposes a\nnovel approach using machine learning (ML) algorithms and morphing techniques\nfor precise 3D reconstruction of implanted knee models.\n  The methodology begins with acquiring preoperative imaging data, such as\nfluoroscopy or X-ray images of the patient's knee joint. A convolutional neural\nnetwork (CNN) is then trained to automatically segment the femur contour of the\nimplanted components, significantly reducing manual effort and ensuring high\naccuracy.\n  Following segmentation, a morphing algorithm generates a personalized 3D\nmodel of the implanted knee joint, using the segmented data and biomechanical\nprinciples. This algorithm considers implant position, size, and orientation to\nsimulate the knee joint's shape. By integrating morphological data with\nimplant-specific parameters, the reconstructed models accurately reflect the\npatient's implant anatomy and configuration.\n  The approach's effectiveness is demonstrated through quantitative\nevaluations, including comparisons with ground truth data and existing\ntechniques. In 19 test cases involving various implant types, the ML-based\nsegmentation method showed superior accuracy and consistency compared to manual\nsegmentation, with an average RMS error of 0.58 +/- 0.14 mm.\n  This research advances orthopedic surgery by providing a robust framework for\nthe automated reconstruction of implanted knee models. Leveraging ML and\nmorphing algorithms, clinicians and researchers gain valuable insights into\npatient-specific knee anatomy, implant biomechanics, and surgical planning,\nleading to improved patient outcomes and enhanced quality of care.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
