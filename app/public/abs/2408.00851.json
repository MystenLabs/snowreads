However, to become a definitive powerful tool, it must be\nwidely comprehended.\n  In this paper, we investigate the MD-Homology of definable surface germs for\nthe inner and outer metrics. We completely determine the MD-Homology of\nsurfaces for the inner metric and we present a great variety of interesting\nMD-Homology of surfaces for the outer metric, for instance, we determine the\nMD-Homology of some bubbles, snake surfaces, and horns. Furthermore, we\nexplicit the diversity of MD-Homology of surfaces for the outer metric in\ngeneral, showing how hard it is to completely solve the outer classification\nproblem. On the other hand, we show that, under specific conditions, the weakly\nouter Lipschitz equivalence determines completely the MD-Homology of surfaces\nfor the outer metric, showing that these two subjects are quite related.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
