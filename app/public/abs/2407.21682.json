The core concept of transfer\nlearning involves leveraging insights and information from auxiliary datasets\nto enhance the analysis of the primary dataset of interest. In this paper, our\nfocus is on datasets originating from distinct yet interconnected\ndistributions. We assume that the training data conforms to a standard\ngeneralized linear model, while the testing data exhibit a connection to the\ntraining data based on a prior probability shift assumption. Ultimately, we\ndiscover that the two-sample conditional means are interrelated through an\nunknown, nondecreasing function. We integrate the power of generalized\nestimating equations with the shape-restricted score function, creating a\nrobust framework for improved inference regarding the underlying parameters. We\ntheoretically establish the asymptotic properties of our estimator and\ndemonstrate, through simulation studies, that our method yields more accurate\nparameter estimates compared to those based solely on the testing or training\ndata. Finally, we apply our method to a real-world example.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
