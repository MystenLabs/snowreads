Efficient resource allocation is paramount to\nensuring optimal viewer experience, considering dynamic factors such as server\nload, network bandwidth, and viewer demand. This review paper investigates the\napplication of fuzzy logic to enhance resource allocation in adaptive video\nstreaming. Fuzzy logic, known for its adaptability in uncertain environments,\noffers a promising approach to address the complexities of resource\noptimization. We delve into the integration of fuzzy logic in resource\nallocation models, considering key parameters like server load, network\nbandwidth, and viewer demand. The paper provides a comprehensive examination of\nthe benefits, challenges, and limitations associated with fuzzy logic-based\nresource allocation, supported by case studies illustrating successful\nimplementations. Evaluation metrics are discussed to gauge the performance of\nthis approach in comparison to traditional methods. The review concludes with\ninsights into future directions, offering a roadmap for further advancements in\nthe field of adaptive video streaming. \"Optimizing Adaptive Video Streaming: A\nFuzzy Logic Approach to Resource Allocation\" aims to contribute to the ongoing\ndiscourse on intelligent resource management for enhanced video streaming\nquality and user satisfaction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
