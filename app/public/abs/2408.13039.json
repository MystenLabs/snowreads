In\nthis study, we propose \"superimposed Hi-C\" which features paired EcoP15I sites\nin a linker to facilitate sticky-end ligation with target DNAs. Superimposed\nHi-C overcomes Hi-C's technical limitations, enabling the identification of\nsingle cell's chromosomal interactions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4MH3cw0VVqjlqpMrMDOMGq9tWeJE19zWC0gsNuweYNY","pdfSize":"345185"}
