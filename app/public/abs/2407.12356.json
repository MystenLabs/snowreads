While several similarity measures have been proposed in\nprior research, there has been a lack of comprehensive discussion about their\nbehaviors. Our research uncovers that the majority of these measures are unable\nto handle various layout differences, primarily due to their dependencies on\nstrict element matching, that is one-by-one matching of elements within the\nsame category. To overcome this limitation, we propose a new similarity measure\nbased on optimal transport, which facilitates a more flexible matching of\nelements. This approach allows us to quantify the similarity between any two\nlayouts even those sharing no element categories, making our measure highly\napplicable to a wide range of layout generation tasks. For tasks such as\nunconditional layout generation, where FID is commonly used, we also extend our\nmeasure to deal with collection-level similarities between groups of layouts.\nThe empirical result suggests that our collection-level measure offers more\nreliable comparisons than existing ones like FID and Max.IoU.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
