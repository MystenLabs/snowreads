As an\napplication, we prove that the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group of symmetries of an\nasymptotically flat spacetime is not locally exponential.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
