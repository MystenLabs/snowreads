This method employs the\nmass-conserving mixed stress (MCS) method for discretizing the Navier-Stokes\nequations. The MCS method's low dissipation characteristics, combined with the\nintroduced operator-splitting solution technique, result in a high-order solver\noptimized for efficient and parallel computation of under-resolved turbulent\nflows. We further enhance the inherent capabilities of the ILES model by\nincorporating high-order upwind fluxes and are examining its approximation\nbehaviour in transitional aerodynamic flow problems. In this study, we use\nflows over the Eppler 387 airfoil at Reynolds numbers up to $3 \\cdot 10^5$ as\nbenchmarks for our simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
