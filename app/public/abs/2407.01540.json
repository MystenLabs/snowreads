We propose a\ndigital twin (DT) scheme for a multiuser scenario, allowing collaborative\npartial task offloading from user equipment (UE) to COIN-aided nodes or MEC.\nSpecifically, we formulate the problem as joint task offloading decision, ratio\nand resource allocation. We employ game theory to create a low-complexity\ndistributed offloading scheme in which the task offloading decision problem is\nmodelled as an exact potential game. Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) is utilized\nwithin the game to proactively predict optimal offloading ratio and resource\nallocation. This approach optimizes resource allocation across the whole system\nand enhances the robustness of the computing framework, ensuring efficient\nexecution of computation-intensive services. Additionally, it addresses\ncentralized approaches and UE resource contention issues, thus ensuring faster\nand more reliable communication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
