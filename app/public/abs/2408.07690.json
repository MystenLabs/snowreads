The\nhigh-symmetry phase of this material, without the tilting of oxygen octahedra,\nis not stable at ambient conditions but becomes stable under high pressure,\nwhere a small hole pocket $\\gamma_0$, composed of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ states in\nthe trilayer sublattice, appears. This pocket was identified in our previous\nwork for trilayer La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ as important to develop\nsuperconductivity. Moreover, using random-phase approximation calculations, we\nfind a leading $s^\\pm$ pairing state for the high-symmetry phase under pressure\nwith similar pairing strength as that obtained previously for the bilayer\nLa$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ compound, suggesting a similar or higher superconducting\ntransition temperature $T_c$. In addition, we find that the dominant magnetic\nfluctuations in the system driving this pairing state have antiferromagnetic\nstructure both in-plane and between the planes of the top and bottom trilayer\nand bilayer sublattices, while the middle trilayer is magnetically decoupled.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
