Approximating the\nexchange-correlation (XC) functional is the key to the Kohn-Sham DFT approach,\nthe basis of most DFT calculations. The choice of this density functional\napproximation (DFA) depends crucially on the particular system under study,\nwhich has resulted in the development of hundreds of DFAs. Though the exact\ndensity functional is not known, researchers have discovered analytical\nproperties of this exact functional. Furthermore, these exact conditions are\nused when designing DFAs. We present XCVerifier, the first approach for\nverifying whether a DFA implementation satisfies the DFT exact conditions.\nXCVerifier was evaluated on five DFAs from the popular Libxc library and seven\nexact conditions from recent work. XCVerifier was able to verify or find\nviolations for a majority of the DFA/condition pairs, demonstrating the\nfeasibility of using formal methods to verify DFA implementations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
