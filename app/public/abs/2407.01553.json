To solve\nsuch problems, the knowledge graph supporting research survey is gradually\nbeing developed. Existing keyword-based knowledge graphs make it difficult for\nresearchers to deeply understand abstract concepts. Meanwhile, novice\nresearchers may find it difficult to use ChatGPT effectively for research\nsurveys due to their limited understanding of the research field. Without the\nability to ask proficient questions that align with key concepts, obtaining\ndesired and accurate answers from this large language model (LLM) could be\ninefficient. This study aims to help novice researchers by providing a\nfish-bone diagram that includes causal relationships, offering an overview of\nthe research topic. The diagram is constructed using the issue ontology from\nacademic papers, and it offers a broad, highly generalized perspective of the\nresearch field, based on relevance and logical factors. Furthermore, we\nevaluate the strengths and improvable points of the fish-bone diagram derived\nfrom this study's development pattern, emphasizing its potential as a viable\ntool for supporting research survey.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
