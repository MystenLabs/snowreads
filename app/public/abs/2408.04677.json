However, they mostly rely on proprietary robot and weld control\nsoftware that limits process tuning and customization, incorporation of\nthird-party sensors, implementation on robots and weld controllers from\nmultiple vendors, and customizable user programming. This paper presents a\ngeneral open-source software architecture for WAAM that addresses these\nlimitations. The foundation of this architecture is Robot Raconteur, an\nopen-source control and communication framework that serves as the middleware\nfor integrating robots and sensors from different vendors. Based on this\narchitecture, we developed an end-to-end robotic WAAM implementation that takes\na CAD file to a printed WAAM part and evaluates the accuracy of the result. The\nmajor components in the architecture include part slicing, robot motion\nplanning, part metrology, in-process sensing, and process tuning. The current\nimplementation is based on Motoman robots and Fronius weld controller, but the\napproach is applicable to other industrial robots and weld controllers. The\ncapability of the WAAM tested is demonstrated through the printing of parts of\nvarious geometries and acquisition of in-process sensor data for motion\nadjustment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
