A successful\napproach must consider not only the multivariate dependencies of the desired\nsignal but also the multivariate dependencies of the interfering noise. In our\nprevious research, we introduced a method using machine learning to extract the\nmaximum portion of ``predictable information\" from univariate signal. We extend\nthis approach to multivariate signals, with the key idea being to properly\nincorporate the interdependencies of the noise back into the interdependent\nreconstruction of the signal. The method works successfully for various\nmultivariate signals, including chaotic signals and highly oscillating\nsinusoidal signals which are corrupted by spatially correlated intensive noise.\nIt consistently outperforms other existing multivariate denoising methods\nacross a wide range of scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
