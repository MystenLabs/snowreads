However, efficient sources of spin\ncurrents such as 5d metals are also efficient spin sinks, resulting in a large\nincrease of magnetic damping. Here we show that a partially-oxidized 3d metal\ncan generate a strong orbital torque without a significant increase in damping.\nMeasurements of the torque efficiency {\\xi} and Gilbert damping {\\alpha} in\nCoFe/CuOx and CoFe/Pt indicate that {\\xi} is comparable. The increase in\ndamping relative to a single CoFe layer is {\\Delta}{\\alpha}<0.002 in CoFe/CuOx\nand {\\Delta}{\\alpha} ~ 0.005 - 0.02 in CoFe/Pt, depending on CoFe thickness. We\nascribe the nonreciprocal relationship between {\\Delta}{\\alpha} and {\\xi} in\nCoFe/CuOx to the small orbital-to-spin current ratio generated by magnetic\nresonance in CoFe and the lack of an efficient spin sink in CuOx. Our findings\nprovide new perspectives on the efficient excitation of magnetization dynamics\nvia the orbital torque.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eW0pWqTdsEgO5Y6HJW9mtqHyoOG8sKKbUZneGfNdlx4","pdfSize":"855408"}
