Time series data, which has become increasingly prevalent\nin recent years, especially univariate time series are naturally suited for\nvalidating KAN. Therefore, we conducted a fair comparison among KAN, MLP, and\nmixed structures. The results indicate that KAN can achieve performance\ncomparable to, or even slightly better than, MLP across 128 time series\ndatasets. We also performed an ablation study on KAN, revealing that the output\nis primarily determined by the base component instead of b-spline function.\nFurthermore, we assessed the robustness of these models and found that KAN and\nthe hybrid structure MLP\\_KAN exhibit significant robustness advantages,\nattributed to their lower Lipschitz constants. This suggests that KAN and KAN\nlayers hold strong potential to be robust models or to improve the adversarial\nrobustness of other models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lzdavKmv4fL5NLui6IhTIuXErG2Vyww5UJWditlP7io","pdfSize":"1918545"}
