Due to the wide range of usage, robots executing such tasks must be\nhighly reliable and possess enough functions to satisfy multiple scenarios.\nThis article describes a mobile, artificial intelligence-driven, robotic\nplatform Rico. Its prior usage in similar scenarios, the number of its\ncapabilities, and the experiments it presented should qualify it as a proper\narm-less platform for social and assistive circumstances.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D2V1RCtU9GYPjS_iC0RNGgZaMcQj7OPT67F824U02iU","pdfSize":"7206788"}
