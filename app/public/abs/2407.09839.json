This bound is\nnecessarily tighter than the bound in terms of the arithmetic mean, i.e., the\nactivity, known as the kinetic uncertainty relation. What is more, it can\nalways be saturated. In turn, an exact limit for the uncertainty of\nfirst-passage times as well as the optimal long-time performance of stochastic\nclocks are established. The results generalise to semi-Markov processes,\nincluding quantum reset processes, where it can be determined when clock\nperformance improves thanks to coherent driving.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
