Fields\nsuch as radiology and pathology rely heavily on accurate image interpretation,\nwith radiologists examining X-rays, CT scans, and MRIs to diagnose conditions\nfrom fractures to cancer, while pathologists use microscopy and digital images\nto detect cellular abnormalities for diagnosing cancers and infections. The\ntechnological advancements have exponentially increased the volume and\ncomplexity of medical images, necessitating efficient tools for management and\nretrieval. Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) systems address this need by\nsearching and retrieving images based on visual content, enhancing diagnostic\naccuracy by allowing clinicians to find similar cases and compare pathological\npatterns. Comprehensive validation of image search engines in medical\napplications involves evaluating performance metrics like accuracy, indexing,\nand search times, and storage overhead, ensuring reliable and efficient\nretrieval of accurate results, as demonstrated by recent validations in\nhistopathology.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
