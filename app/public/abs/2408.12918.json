Consequently, reducing the complexity of\nmeasurement is a significant challenge. This paper presents a methodology for\nevaluating the QFI of high-dimensional systems by transferring information to\nan auxiliary system and measuring its sub-QFI, while also offering conditions\nto diminish the dimension of auxiliary system to be measured without affecting\nthe amount of information obtained by it.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
