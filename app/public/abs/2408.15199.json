A mid-air selection\ntechnique is essential to enable such navigation. In this paper, we consider\nfour variations of intersection-based bimanual mid-air selection techniques\nwith visual aids and supporting features: Simple-Ray, Simple-Stripe,\nPrecision-Stripe, and Cursor-Sync. We evaluate their performance and user\nexperience compared to an unimanual mid-air selection technique using two tasks\nthat require selecting a mid-air position with or without a reference object.\nOur findings indicate that the bimanual techniques generally demonstrate faster\nselection times compared to the unimanual technique. With a supporting feature,\nthe bimanual techniques can provide a more accurate selection than the\nunimanual technique. Based on our results, we discuss the effect of selection\ntechnique's visual aids and supporting features on performance and user\nexperience for mid-air selection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
