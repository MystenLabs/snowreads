Here, we investigate\nthe possible formation of a naked singularity in the JNW spacetime, using the\nthin-shell approximation to describe the gravitational collapse. By introducing\ndifferent matter contents to construct thin-shells, we demonstrate the\nimpossibility of naked singularity formation during the gravitational collapse\nunless the causality or null energy condition of the thin-shell is violated.\nTherefore, the weak cosmic censorship is satisfied even with the naked\nsingularity of the JNW spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tKt83Vu1lDr6-V9wrt70nUdhz16HT7Em1JZf2sSoG5k","pdfSize":"973406"}
