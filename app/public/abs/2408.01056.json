This paper introduces the NING Humanoid, an agile and robust\nplatform aimed at achieving human-like athletic capabilities. The NING humanoid\nfeatures high-torque actuators, a resilient mechanical co-design based on the\nCentroidal dynamics, and a whole-body model predictive control (WB-MPC)\nframework. It stands at 1.1 meters tall and weighs 20 kg with 18 degrees of\nfreedom (DOFs). It demonstrates impressive abilities such as walking, push\nrecovery, and stair climbing at a high control bandwidth. Our presentation will\nencompass a hardware co-design, the control framework, as well as simulation\nand real-time experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
