We\npresent three new fast algorithms and implementations for computing the\nsymplectic distance of the associated classical code. Our new algorithms are\nbased on the Brouwer-Zimmermann algorithm. Our experimental study shows that\nthese new implementations are much faster than current state-of-the-art\nlicensed implementations on single-core processors, multicore processors, and\nshared-memory multiprocessors. In the most computationally-demanding cases, the\nperformance gain in the computational time can be larger than one order of\nmagnitude. The experimental study also shows a good scalability on\nshared-memory parallel architectures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
