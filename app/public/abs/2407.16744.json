While\nobtaining a host-galaxy spectroscopic redshift for most SNe is feasible for\nsmall-area transient surveys, it will be too resource intensive for upcoming\nlarge-area surveys such as the Vera Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space\nand Time, which will observe on the order of millions of SNe. Here we use data\nfrom the Dark Energy Survey (DES) to address this problem with photometric\nredshifts (photo-z) inferred directly from the SN light-curve in combination\nwith Gaussian and full p(z) priors from host-galaxy photo-z estimates. Using\nthe DES 5-year photometrically-classified SN sample, we consider several\nphoto-z algorithms as host-galaxy photo-z priors, including the Self-Organizing\nMap redshifts (SOMPZ), Bayesian Photometric Redshifts (BPZ), and\nDirectional-Neighbourhood Fitting (DNF) redshift estimates employed in the DES\n3x2 point analyses. With detailed catalog-level simulations of the DES 5-year\nsample, we find that the simulated w can be recovered within $\\pm$0.02 when\nusing SN+SOMPZ or DNF prior photo-z, smaller than the average statistical\nuncertainty for these samples of 0.03. With data, we obtain biases in w\nconsistent with simulations within ~1$\\sigma$ for three of the five photo-z\nvariants. We further evaluate how photo-z systematics interplay with\nphotometric classification and find classification introduces a subdominant\nsystematic component. This work lays the foundation for next-generation fully\nphotometric SNe Ia cosmological analyses.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
