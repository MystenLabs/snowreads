Our construction (which also applies in\nparameter-dependent settings, with phase space weights and variable\ndifferential and decay orders) recovers most of the ps.d.o. algebras which have\nbeen introduced in recent years as tools for the microlocal analysis of\nnon-elliptic partial differential equations. This includes those used for\nproving resolvent bounds (b- and scattering algebras and resolved or\nsemiclassical versions thereof), studying waves on asymptotically flat\nspacetimes (3b-, edge-b-, and desc-algebras), inverting geodesic X-ray\ntransforms (semiclassical foliation and 1-cusp algebras), and many others.\n  Our main result rests on the novel notion of manifolds with scaled bounded\ngeometry. A scaling encodes, in each distinguished chart of a manifold with\nbounded geometry, the amounts in $(0,1]$ by which the components of a uniformly\nbounded vector field are scaled. This decouples the regularity of the\ncoefficients of elements of the resulting Lie algebra $\\mathcal{V}$ of vector\nfields from the pointwise size of their coefficients. When the scaling tends to\n$0$ at infinity, the approximate constancy of coefficients of elements of\n$\\mathcal{V}$ on increasingly large cubes, as measured using $\\mathcal{V}$,\ngives rise to a principal symbol which captures $\\mathcal{V}$-operators modulo\noperators of lower differential order and more decay.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
