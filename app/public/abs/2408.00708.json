We obtain analytic\ncharacterizations of the said orthogonality relations in terms of support\nfunctionals in the dual space. We also characterize the related notions of\nlocal smoothness and establish its connection with the corresponding\northogonality set, which is analogous to the well-known relation between the\nBirkhoff-James orthogonality and the classical notion of smoothness. The\nsimilarities and the differences between the various notions of smoothness are\nillustrated by considering some particular examples, including $\n\\mathbb{K}(\\mathbb{H}), $ the Banach space of all compact operators on a\nHilbert space $ \\mathbb{H}. $\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"R13rQuYm4vXlzmr-646ElOd5EQ8Nxk7hYlSzFmo2_PM","pdfSize":"163900"}
