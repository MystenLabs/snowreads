Their Proposition 1 suggests that\ntransitivity and continuity of a regret-based preference implies an equivalence\ncondition: if random variables $X$ and $Y$ have the same distribution, then\n$X\\sim Y$. We give counterexamples to Proposition 1.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
