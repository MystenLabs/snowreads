It consists of a\nhighly-granular Si+W electromagnetic calorimeter combined with a conventional\nmetal-scintillator hadronic calorimeter, covering a pseudorapidity interval of\n$3.2<\\eta<5.8$. The FoCal is optimised to measure various physics quantities in\nthe forward region, allowing exploration of the gluon density in hadronic\nmatter down to $x\\sim10^{-6}$, thus providing insights into non-linear QCD\nevolution at the LHC. These proceedings introduce the FoCal physics program and\nits corresponding performance. Additionally, the performance of the FoCal\nprototype will be presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
