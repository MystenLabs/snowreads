Like the gapless Kitaev spin liquid with its two nodes at K\nand K$^\\prime$, these multinode QSLs are characterized by an emergent Z$_2$\ngauge structure and a discrete number of symmetry-protected Majorana cones in\ntheir low-energy excitation spectrum. Because the cones are gapped by weak\nmagnetic fields, nonzero Chern numbers are obtained and the ground state\nbecomes one of many possible Abelian or non-Abelian chiral spin liquids. Here\nwe focus on the projective symmetry group (PSG)-guided VMC approach to the\nKitaev model with various symmetry-allowed extended interactions. Based on the\nVMC phase diagrams of these models, we propose a framework for the\nclassification of nodal QSLs that includes the PSG, the chiralities of the\ncones, and the way in which the cones are symmetry-related. At present, the\nknown candidate Kitaev materials seem to lie outside the parameter regimes of\nthe multinode QSL phases. However, with more than 100 Z$_2$ PSGs for\nspin-orbit-coupled states on the honeycomb lattice, we anticipate that more\nthan one multinode QSL will be realized experimentally in future work.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
