For\nsustainable space utilization, the continuous removal of space debris is the\nmost severe problem for humanity. To maximize the reliability of the debris\ncapture mission in orbit, accurate motion estimation of the target is\nessential. Space debris has lost its attitude and orbit control capabilities,\nand its shape is unknown due to the break. This paper proposes the Structure\nfrom Motion-based algorithm to perform unknown shaped space debris motion\nestimation with limited resources, where only 2D images are required as input.\nThe method then outputs the reconstructed shape of the unknown object and the\nrelative pose trajectory between the target and the camera simultaneously,\nwhich are exploited to estimate the target's motion. The method is\nquantitatively validated with the realistic image dataset generated by the\nmicrogravity experiment in a 2D air-floating testbed and 3D kinematic\nsimulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
