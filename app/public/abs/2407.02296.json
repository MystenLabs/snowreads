We prove various quantitative versions of this\nresult, allowing to study the Sard property also for the case $V=H$. By\nconstructing suitable examples, we prove the sharpness of our $n$-width\nassumptions.\n  We apply these results to sub-Riemannian geometry, proving that on Carnot\ngroups the Sard property holds true for the restriction of the Endpoint map on\nthe set of real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence. This\nis a more functional-analytic approach to the Sard conjecture that, unlike\nprevious ones, does not resort to reduction to finite-dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
