The system is described by\nan extended imbalanced Dicke model, in which the co- and counterrotating\ncoupling terms are allowed to have different coupling strengths. Some novel\npolarized phases characterized by the phase differences between the cavity\nfield or the atomic spin excitation and the Raman laser are found analytically.\nMeanwhile, the full phase diagram and quantum phase transitions are also\nrevealed. Finally, the breaking or restoration of the intrinsic symmetry in\nthis system is addressed. It is found that besides the continuous $U(1)$ and\ndiscrete $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetries, the system also exhibits two reflection\nsymmetries $\\sigma_v$s, a central symmetry $C_2$ in the abstract\nposition-momentum representation, and a discrete reflection parity-time\n($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetry, a parameter exchange symmetry\n$\\mathcal{T}_\\mathrm{ex}$ in the parameters space. These additional symmetries\nare governed by two Coxeter groups.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
