We show that for any prescribed finite\nenergy divergence-free initial data there exist infinitely many global in time\nweak solutions with smooth energy profiles to both the 3D deterministic and\nstochastic incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. In the stochastic case the\nconstructed solutions are probabilistically strong.\n  Our proof introduces a new backward convex integration scheme with delicate\nselections of initial relaxed solutions, backward time intervals, and energy\nprofiles. Our initial relaxed solutions satisfy a new time-dependent frequency\ntruncated NSE, different from the usual approximations as it decreases the\nlarge Reynolds error near the initial time, which plays a key role in the\nconstruction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
