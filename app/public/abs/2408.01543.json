This paper explores one\nsuch input known as interaction force. Interaction force is potentially a\nprimary component in communication that occurs during co-manipulation. There\nare, however, many different perspectives and definitions of interaction force\nin the literature. Therefore, a decomposition of interaction force is proposed\nthat provides a consistent way of ascertaining the state of an agent relative\nto the group for multi-agent co-manipulation. This proposed method extends a\ncurrent definition from one to four degrees of freedom, does not rely on a\npredefined object path, and is independent of the number of agents acting on\nthe system and their locations and input wrenches (forces and torques). In\naddition, all of the necessary measures can be obtained by a self-contained\nrobotic system, allowing for a more flexible and adaptive approach for future\nco-manipulation robot controllers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9veyWXi9t_Yq-hqrlChM1_wNBmfGSHwt638u1yHiP0A","pdfSize":"15376929"}
