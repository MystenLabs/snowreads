However, achieving strong coupling with molecular ensembles\ntypically requires high molecular densities and substantial electromagnetic\nfield confinement. These conditions usually involve a significant degree of\nmolecular disorder and a highly structured photonic density of states. It\nremains unclear to what extent these additional complexities modify the usual\nphysical picture of strong coupling developed for atoms and inorganic\nsemiconductors. Using a microscopic quantum description of molecular ensembles\nin realistic multimode optical resonators, we show that the emergence of a\nvacuum Rabi splitting in linear spectroscopy is a necessary but not sufficient\nmetric of coherent admixing between light and matter. In low finesse multi-mode\nsituations we find that molecular dipoles can be partially hybridised with\nphotonic dissipation channels associated with off-resonant cavity modes. These\nvacuum-induced dissipative processes ultimately limit the extent of\nlight-matter coherence that the system can sustain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
