More specifically, we prove the followings\nresults: For discrete Heisenberg groups, we classify the orbits of Busemann\npoints. As a byproduct, we observe that the set of orbits is finite and the set\nof Busemann points is countable. Furthermore, using the approximation with Lie\ngroups, we observe that the entire horoboundary is uncountable. For the\ndiscrete Cartan group, we exhibit an continuum of Busemann points, disproving a\nconjecture of Tointon and Yadin. As a byproduct, we prove that the group acts\nnon-trivially on its reduced horoboundary, disproving a conjecture of Bader and\nFinkelshtein.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
