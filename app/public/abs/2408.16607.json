It consists\nof a set of directives that allow for the automatic generation of code\nnecessary for AT by placing annotations in the source program. This approach\nsignificantly reduces the effort required by numerical library developers. This\ntechnical report details the implementation of the AT software and its extended\nfunctions, and provides an explanation of the internal specifications of\nppOpen-AT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qArD-LXk4K3atbJKAIVVt5cAtzlbx969WSgKw5t-5TU","pdfSize":"192883"}
