This condition is usually\naddressed by placing resonant structures along the waveguide or by periodic\nmodulations of its parameters, creating gaps in the waveguide's dispersion.\nHere, we propose to employ the Josephson junctions, which constitute the\ncenterline of the amplifier, as resonant elements for phase matching. By\nnumerical simulations in JoSIM (and WRspice) software, we show that Josephson\nplasma oscillations can be utilized to create wavevector mismatch sufficient\nfor phase matching as well as to prevent the conversion of the pump energy to\nhigher harmonics. The proposed TWPA design has a gain of 15 dB and a 3.5 GHz\nbandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TWPAs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aI7lLcY-ixVS7qFuTuzoh9MG7_DyIJN0E7Ia31argYU","pdfSize":"641713"}
