Managing logistics,\ntransportation, and distribution requires a delicate balance to ensure seamless\noperations within this network. Hub network promotes cost-effective routing\nthrough inter-hub flows. Failure of such hubs may impact the total network with\nhuge costs. In this paper, we study bilevel $q$-allocation hub interdiction\nproblem. In previous literature hub interdiction problem was studied with\nsingle and multiple allocation protocols.This problem focus on $q$ allocation\nwhich solves single and multiple allocation problem as special case. We also\nshow improvements on the branch and cut approach by using cutting planes.Our\nexperiments based on large instances present the efficiency of the approach to\nsolve some previously unsolved instances.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
