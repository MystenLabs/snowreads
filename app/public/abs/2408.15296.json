In that context, beyond humans, there is an\ninterest in analyzing vocalizations of other social animals such as, meerkats,\nmarmosets, apes. While existing approaches address vocalizations of certain\nspecies, a reliable method tailored for meerkat calls is lacking. To that\nextent, this paper investigates feature representations for automatic meerkat\nvocalization analysis. Both traditional signal processing-based representations\nand data-driven representations facilitated by advances in deep learning are\nexplored. Call type classification studies conducted on two data sets reveal\nthat feature extraction methods developed for human speech processing can be\neffectively employed for automatic meerkat call analysis.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I9pirFIP19DleNQT1EeppYWCBBKQm_6bVTVaVa1Q_Yw","pdfSize":"864688"}
