Given resource constraints and their contentious\nuse in IoT networks, current strategies strive to optimise which data\nprocessing tasks should be selected to run on fog devices. In this paper, we\nadvance a more effective data processing architecture for optimisation\npurposes. Specifically, we consider the distinct functions of sensor data\nstreaming, multi-stream data aggregation and event handling, required by IoT\napplications for identifying actionable events. We retrofit this event\nprocessing pipeline into a logical architecture, structured as a service\nfunction tree (SFT), comprising service function chains. We present a novel\nalgorithm for mapping the SFT into a fog network topology in which nodes\nselected to process SFT functions (microservices) have the requisite resource\ncapacity and network speed to meet their event processing deadlines. We used\nsimulations to validate the algorithm's effectiveness in finding a successful\nSFT mapping to a physical network. Overall, our approach overcomes the\nbottlenecks of single service placement strategies for fog computing through\ncomposite service placements of SFTs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
