The diagnostic process, however, is often complicated by\nthe low contrast between stones and surrounding tissues, as well as the\nvariability in stone locations across different patients. To address this\nissue, we propose a novel location embedding based pairwise distance learning\nnetwork (LEPD-Net) that leverages low-dose abdominal X-ray imaging combined\nwith location information for the fine-grained diagnosis of urinary stones.\nLEPD-Net enhances the representation of stone-related features through\ncontext-aware region enhancement, incorporates critical location knowledge via\nstone location embedding, and achieves recognition of fine-grained objects with\nour innovative fine-grained pairwise distance learning. Additionally, we have\nestablished an in-house dataset on urinary tract stones to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our proposed approach. Comprehensive experiments conducted on\nthis dataset reveal that our framework significantly surpasses existing\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
