By variational methods, the exact\nrelationship between various parameters (dimension, nonlinearity, nonlocal\nparameter $\\alpha$) that defines positive excitation thresholds is\ncharacterized. At the anti-continuum regime, there exists a family of unique\nground states that determines excitation thresholds. We not only characterize\nthe sharp spatial decay of ground states, which varies continuously in\n$\\alpha$, but also identify the time decay of dispersive waves, which undergoes\na discontinuous transition in $\\alpha$.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
