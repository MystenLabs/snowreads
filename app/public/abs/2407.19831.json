However, it remains\nuncertain which and how many students do not see an improvement in their DA\nplacement under EADA. We show that, despite its advantages, EADA does not\nbenefit students assigned to their worst-ranked schools or those who remain\nunmatched under DA. Additionally, it limits the placement improvement of\nmarginalized students, thereby maintaining school segregation. The placement of\nworst-off students under EADA can be exceptionally poor, even though\nsignificantly more egalitarian allocations are possible. Lastly, we provide a\nbound on the expected number of unimproved students using a random market\napproach valid for small markets. Our findings shed light on why EADA fails to\nmitigate the inequality produced by DA in empirical evaluations.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
