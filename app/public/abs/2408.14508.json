These almost all result from training\nflexible algorithms to solve difficult optimization problems specified in\nadvance by teams of domain scientists and engineers with access to large\namounts of data. Although extremely useful, this kind of problem solving only\ncorresponds to one part of science - the \"easy problem.\" The other part of\nscientific research is coming up with the problem itself - the \"hard problem.\"\nSolving the hard problem is beyond the capacities of current algorithms for\nscientific discovery because it requires continual conceptual revision based on\npoorly defined constraints. We can make progress on understanding how humans\nsolve the hard problem by studying the cognitive science of scientists, and\nthen use the results to design new computational agents that automatically\ninfer and update their scientific paradigms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
