Using\nevolutionary game theory, the interactions between governmental subsidies and\ntechnology adoption by power companies are modeled. A key innovation of this\nresearch is the introduction of sensitivity analyses concerning time delays and\ninitial subsidy amounts, which significantly influence the strategic decisions\nof both government and corporate entities. The findings indicate that these\nfactors are critical in determining the rate of technology adoption and the\nefficiency of the market as a whole. Due to existing data limitations, the\nstudy offers a broad overview of likely trends and recommends the inclusion of\nreal-world data for more precise modeling once the material demonstrates\nroom-temperature superconducting characteristics. The research contributes\nfoundational insights valuable for future policy design and has significant\nimplications for advancing the understanding of technology adoption and market\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
