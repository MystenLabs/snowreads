We study how many\nqueries are needed to reconstruct the edge set of $G$ when $G$ is sampled\naccording to the $G(n,p)$ Erd\\H{o}s-Renyi-Gilbert distribution. Our approach\napplies to a large spectrum of values for $p$ starting slightly above the\nconnectivity threshold: $p \\geq \\frac{2000 \\log n}{n}$. We show that there\nexists an algorithm that reconstructs $G \\sim G(n,p)$ using $O( \\Delta^2 n \\log\nn )$ queries in expectation, where $\\Delta$ is the expected average degree of\n$G$. In particular, for $p \\in [\\frac{2000 \\log n}{n}, \\frac{\\log^2 n}{n}]$ the\nalgorithm uses $O(n \\log^5 n)$ queries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
