Already in a small kagome material\nsubclass such as vanadium-based compounds $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=$ K, Rb, Cs), the\nfirst wave of experimental exploration has brought about manifold evidence for\nhitherto largely elusive phenomena such as high-temperature charge ordering\nwith orbital currents, nematic order, cascades of charge ordering transitions\nwith hierarchies of ordering vectors, and unconventional superconductivity. We\nargue that kagome metals promise to be a prototypical ground for the\nnon-equilibrium analysis of quantum order through time-dependent parameter\ncontrol and manipulation. In particular, we propose to investigate the nematic\ncharacter of kagome quantum order through light and strain pulses, as well as\nthe nature of time-reversal symmetry breaking and chirality through properly\npolarized laser pulses.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
