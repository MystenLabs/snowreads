QGJ was a\nseries of game development events, science game jams, organized five times\n2014-2019. In these events game makers and quantum physicists created games\nabout quantum mechanics, games for quantum research and games utilizing quantum\ncomputers. QGJ has worked as a platform for multidisciplinary and collaborative\nexploration and learning: through creating 68 game prototypes throughout the\nyears the participants have networked and learned from each other. In addition\nto this, at least three prototypes have been taken into further development. In\nthis paper we evaluate how the format of QGJ performed. We discuss both the\norganizing of the events as well as the utility of the game prototypes. In\naddition to our observations on the jams, we have evaluated the game\nsubmissions of all events (2014-2019) and gathered survey data from the\nparticipants of the fifth event (2019).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"H5mCiDMegnWOE4n2on_nZ_N1YkFh_gjDM8WIA4CIlbE","pdfSize":"3302041"}
