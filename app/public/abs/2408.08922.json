It generalizes the SOP\nby grouping nodes into mutually exclusive sets (clusters) with associated\nprofits. Profit can be earned if any node within the set is visited. Multiple\ntravelers, denoted by $t$ $(> 1)$, are employed, with each traveler linked to a\nspecific depot. The primary objective of the problem is to maximize profit\ncollection from the sets within a predefined budget. A novel formulation is\nintroduced for the mDmSOP. The paper utilizes the Variable Neighborhood Search\n(VNS) meta-heuristic to solve the mDmSOP on small, medium, and large instances\nfrom the Generalized Traveling Salesman Problem (GTSP) benchmark. The results\ndemonstrate the VNS's superiority in robustness and solution quality, as it\nrequires less computational time than solving the mathematical formulation with\nGAMS 37.1.0 and CPLEX. Additionally, increasing the number of travelers leads\nto significant improvements in profits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
