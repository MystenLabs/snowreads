Conventional\npooling methods overlook the preservation of motion information and treat each\nframe equally. However, in an action sequence, only a few segments of frames\ncarry discriminative information related to the action. This paper presents a\nnovel Joint Motion Adaptive Temporal Pooling (JMAP) method for improving\nskeleton-based action recognition. Two variants of JMAP, frame-wise pooling and\njoint-wise pooling, are introduced. The efficacy of JMAP has been validated\nthrough experiments on the popular NTU RGB+D 120 and PKU-MMD datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vZ4P6gNyy5_bJ_cmw6FyyNziouIZ1uND86nPIfANF9I","pdfSize":"2673975"}
