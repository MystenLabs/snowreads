The\nunique properties of RRAM, such as binary switching, multi-state switching, and\ndevice variations, can be leveraged to design novel techniques and algorithms.\nThis thesis proposes a technique for utilizing RRAM devices in three major\ndirections: i) digital logic implementation, ii) multi-valued computing, and\niii) hardware security primitive design. We proposed new algorithms and\narchitectures and conducted \\textit{experimental studies} on each\nimplementation. Moreover, we developed the electronic design automation\nframework and hardware platforms to facilitate these experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AjwsLazp1T2j929V-B3p6XP9k8pd9th52m-no7HYRdg","pdfSize":"6057163"}
