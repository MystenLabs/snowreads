In this\nletter, we delve into the foundational aspects of environment-induced SSQC,\nshedding light on its emergence within the framework of system-bath\ninteractions. Starting from a microscopic system-bath coupled model, we\ninvestigate the dependence of SSQC on environmental memory effects, bath\ntemperature, system-bath coupling strength, and squeezing parameters. Our\nfindings reveal that the environment not only acts as a generator but also as a\ndisruptor of SSQC. A peak will exist for a non-Markovian bath, which is a\nresult of competition between these two mechanisms. Interestingly, the peak\ndisappears in Markovian case. Additionally, we observe that the generated SSQC\ncan be further amplified through environment squeezing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
