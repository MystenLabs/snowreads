As applications, we compute the zeta-determinants of the Laplacians\ndefined on a Klein bottle ${\\mathbb K}$ and some compact co-K\\\"ahler manifold\n${\\mathbb T}_{\\varphi}$. We also show that a metric mapping torus and a\nRiemannian product manifold with a round circle have the same heat trace\nasymptotic expansions. We finally compute the analytic torsion of a metric\nmapping torus for the Witten deformed Laplacian and recover the result of J.\nMarcsik in \\cite{Ma}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
