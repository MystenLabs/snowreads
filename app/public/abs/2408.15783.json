We prove\nquantitative bounds on the distribution of the eigenvlaues in terms of the\n$L^q$ norm of $V$. A consequence of our bounds is that, if the eigenvlaues\n$(z_j)$ accumulates to a point in $(0,\\infty)$, then $(\\im z_j)$ is summable.\nThe key technical tools are resolvent estimates in Schatten spaces. We show\nthat these resolvent estimates follow from spectral measure estimates by an\nepsilon removal argument.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EZc56sJEvqmv6c0ZRKnsT4KdAehDND_DoaPFo48I69Q","pdfSize":"220191"}
