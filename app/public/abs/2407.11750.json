In this\npaper, we propose a novel cycle contrastive generative adversarial network for\nunsupervised SID, called CCLGAN. This framework combines cycle contrastive\nlearning (CCL) and location contrastive learning (LCL). CCL improves image\nreconstruction and rain-layer removal by bringing similar features closer and\npushing dissimilar features apart in both semantic and discriminative spaces.\nAt the same time, LCL preserves content information by constraining mutual\ninformation at the same location across different exemplars. CCLGAN shows\nsuperior performance, as extensive experiments demonstrate the benefits of\nCCLGAN and the effectiveness of its components.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
