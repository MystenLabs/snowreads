This\nstudy presents a comprehensive evaluation of one of these detectors, operated\n1,100 meters underground at the Boulby Underground Laboratory, which provides\nsignificant shielding from cosmic radiation and maintains a low ambient radon\nactivity of 2.30 $\\pm$ 0.03 Bq/m$^3$. Our evaluation focuses on energy\nreconstruction accuracy, background radiation rates, and operational stability.\nThe XIA UltraLo-1800 detector demonstrates remarkable stability in energy\nreconstruction, with less than 0.1 MeV variation over four years. Moreover, the\nimplementation of a graphite-filled PTFE liner in the sample tray resulted in a\nsignificant reduction in background radiation levels compared to measurements\nwith the original stainless steel tray, achieving an average activity of 0.15\n$\\pm$ 0.01 $\\alpha$/cm$^2$/khr. Copper sample assays, performed before and\nafter radon exposure, demonstrated the detector's ability to accurately\nidentify and quantify $^{210}$Po contamination. By implementing the robust\ncleanliness procedures and protocols described in this article, we observed a\nreduction in $^{210}$Po activity from 0.504 $\\pm$ 0.022 mBq to 0.336 $\\pm$\n0.013 mBq, highlighting the crucial role of refined cleaning methods in\nminimizing background for sensitive experiments. Additionally, observations of\nelevated background activity levels post-high-activity sample measurements\nillustrate the need for careful management of assay conditions and environment\nto maintain low background levels. These results highlight the potential of the\nXIA UltraLo-1800 in enhancing the precision of material assays essential for\nreducing background interference in rare event experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
