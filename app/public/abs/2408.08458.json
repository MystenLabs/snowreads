While diamond has been found to\nhave potential for these applications, c-BN has not been considered owing to a\nlack of knowledge of the relevant charge transport properties. Here, we report\na study of the high-field transport and noise properties of c-BN using\nfirst-principles calculations. We find that c-BN exhibits an abrupt region of\nnegative differential resistance (NDR) below 140 K, despite the lack of\nmulti-valley band structure typically associated with NDR. This feature is\nfound to arise from a strong energy dependence of the scattering rates\nassociated with optical phonon emission. The high optical phonon energy also\nleads to an intervalley scattering time rivaling that of diamond. The negative\ndifferential resistance and long intervalley scattering time indicate the\npotential of c-BN for transferred-electron and valleytronic devices,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
