This category is not semi-simple and exhibits interesting\nfeatures.\n  We first construct the simple representations, recovering the classification\ngiven by Wiltshire-Gordon. The construction given here also yields explicit\ndescriptions of the indecomposable projectives.\n  These results are used to give a convenient set of projective generators of\nthe category of representations of $\\mathbf{FA}$ and hence a Morita equivalence\nresult. This is used to explain how to calculate the multiplicities of the\ncomposition factors of an arbitrary object, based only on its underlying\n$\\mathbf{FB}$-representation, where $\\mathbf{FB}$ is the category of finite\nsets and bijections.\n  This is applied to show how to calculate the morphism spaces between\nprojectives in our chosen set of generators, as well as for a closely related\nfamily of objects (the significance of which can be shown by relative\nnonhomogeneous Koszul duality theory).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
