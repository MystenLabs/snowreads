However, this method completely changes the\nexisting feedback strategies, making it impractical to deploy in recent years.\nTo address this issue, this paper proposes a channel modeling aided data\naugmentation method based on a limited number of field channel data.\nSpecifically, the user equipment (UE) extracts the primary stochastic\nparameters of the field channel data and transmits them to the base station\n(BS). The BS then updates the typical TR 38.901 model parameters with the\nextracted parameters. In this way, the updated channel model is used to\ngenerate the dataset. This strategy comprehensively considers the dataset\ncollection, model generalization, model monitoring, and so on. Simulations\nverify that our proposed strategy can significantly improve performance\ncompared to the benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"s0t-1olg959oQNLzLa9D7SKFfP3y3EpafCBBA5QVJq4","pdfSize":"1166669"}
