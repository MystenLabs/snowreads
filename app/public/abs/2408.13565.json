We also\nprove the isoperimetric inequality for $M_{\\kappa}^2$. We give an elementary\ngeometric proof which is uniform for all three simply connected space forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"n2lZNV-oC_BcabvIcY8Pkm1KDIG5ztNVOf_5ukkWYWw","pdfSize":"362445"}
