By operating on the H13C14N P12 absorption line\nat 1551.3 nm, the laser frequency can be precisely stabilized. The laser\ndemonstrates remarkable stability, achieving a best stability value of 9*10^-9.\nFurthermore, the short-term stability, evaluated over continuous time intervals\nof 35 seconds, showcases exceptional performance. Additionally, the residual\ndrift remains well below 30 MHz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
