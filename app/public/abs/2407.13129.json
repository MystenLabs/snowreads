However, the laboratory-scale infrastructure\nfor such optical-atomic quantum apparatuses rarely translates into commercial\napplications. A promising solution is miniaturizing the optical layouts onto a\nchip-scale device integrated with cold atoms inside a compact ultra-high vacuum\n(UHV) chamber. For prototyping purposes, however, rapidly loading or exchanging\ntest photonic devices into a UHV chamber is limited by the evacuation time from\natmospheric pressures to the optimal pressures for ultracold atoms of\n$1\\times10^{-11}$ Torr, a process typically taking weeks or months without\ncryogenics. Here, we present a loadlock apparatus and loading procedure capable\nof venting, exchanging, and evacuating back to $<1\\times10^{-11}$ Torr in under\n24 hours. Our system allows for rapid testing and benchmarking of various\nphotonic devices with ultracold atoms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
