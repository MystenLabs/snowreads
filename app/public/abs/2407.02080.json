The size of the avalanche, essentially the tendency\nof clogging, exhibits non-monotonic dependence on the spherical particle volume\nfraction. For small enough content of spherical particles, the clogging\ntendency intensifies, whereas it reduces rapidly for high enough spherical\nparticle fractions, with a minimum in between. The non-monotonic behavior is\nobserved to persist over for different spherical particle sizes. The overall\nbehavior is shown to arise due to competing effects between the localized total\nparticle fraction influencing avalanche strength and mean size of the particles\nexiting the silo, influencing the probability of arch formation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
