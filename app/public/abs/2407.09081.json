Because non-thermionic emittance at such a low-energy region\nis easily deteriorated by nonlinear electromagnetic fields, it is important to\ndetermine the properties of a solenoid lens on electron beam emittance in the\ndesign of XFEL injectors. We derived an approximate solution to emittance\ngrowth due to lens aberration by a paraxial approximation. It was found that\nthe derivative of the longitudinal magnetic field strongly affects beam\nemittance, and its growth is proportional to the fourth power of the beam\nradius. Various properties of the beam can be analyzed as long as the\nlongitudinal magnetic field distribution is prepared using a simulation or\nmeasurement. In this study, a theoretical procedure to obtain the emittance\ngrowth in the solenoid lens is introduced and the design considerations of the\nsolenoid lens of the SACLA injector are described.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8uBUdEAgiUFqVBzOz-RIOus6UnT0C3bQu-V5dv_qFCs","pdfSize":"629756"}
