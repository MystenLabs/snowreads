These theories postulate new vectorlike confining dark color\ndynamics and give an accidentally stable baryonic dark matter candidate. In\nrealistic theories, dark fermion $SU(5)$ irreps split into light dark quarks,\nwhose bound states include the dark matter, and their much heavier GUT\npartners. A simple analysis shows that such a mass hierarchy requires a fine\ntuning of parameters and thus implies a naturalness problem. We select theories\nrequiring that all dangerous metastable states decay before the onset of\nnucleosynthesis through higher-dimensional operators generated at the GUT scale\nor at the mass scale of dark quark GUT partners. Demanding Standard Model gauge\ncoupling unification puts severe constraints on the landscape of viable\ntheories. Under the assumption of an approximately degenerate spectrum of dark\nquark GUT partners, we find that only one model gives precision unification.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
