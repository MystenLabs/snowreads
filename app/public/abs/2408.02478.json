We focus on the regime close to the optomechanical\nresonance, where the atoms' refractive index shifts the cavity into resonance,\nassuming fast cavity relaxation. We derive an effective model for the atomic\nmotion, where the cavity degrees of freedom are eliminated using perturbation\ntheory in the atom-cavity coupling and benchmark its predictions using\nnumerical simulations based on the full model. Away from the optomechanical\nresonance, perturbation theory in the lowest order (adiabatic elimination)\nreliably describes the dynamics and predicts chaotic phases with unstable\noscillations. Interestingly, the dynamics close to the optomechanical resonance\nare qualitatively captured only by including the corrections to next order\n(non-adiabatic corrections). In this regime we find limit cycle phases that\ndescribe stable oscillations of the density with a well defined frequency. We\nfurther show that such limit cycle solutions are metastable configurations of\nthe adiabatic model. Our work sheds light on the mechanisms that are required\nto observe dynamical phases and predict their existence in atom-cavity systems\nwhere a substantial timescale separation is present.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
