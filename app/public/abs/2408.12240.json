Moreover, he showed that\nthe undecidability holds even for subclasses such as event-recording automata.\nIn this article, we consider the same definition of opacity for several other\nsubclasses of TAs: with restrictions on the number of clocks, of actions, on\nthe nature of time, or on a new subclass called observable event-recording\nautomata. We show that opacity can mostly be retrieved, except for one-action\nTAs and for one-clock TAs with $\\epsilon$-transitions, for which undecidability\nremains. We then exhibit a new decidable subclass in which the number of\nobservations made by the attacker is limited.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
