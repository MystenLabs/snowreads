However, MOND presents difficulties in\nexplaining the Radial Acceleration Relation (RAR) observed in galaxy clusters,\nand moreover, it does not completely eliminate the need for dark matter, since\nit requires using sterile neutrinos to explain the observed hydrostatic\nequilibrium of the hot gas. Hyperconical Modified Gravity (HMG) offers a\nrelativistic framework that recovers the success of MOND in galaxy rotation\ncurves as a natural particular case, and it could potentially reconcile the\nabove discrepancies without invoking any type of dark matter. This Letter\nanalyses the performance of the HMG model for hydrostatic equilibrium in four\nrepresentative systems: groups of NGC 533 and NGC 5044 galaxies, and clusters\nof Abell 2717 and Abell 2029. Specifically, we used high-resolution X-ray data\nwith which gas density, temperature, and mass profiles were previously derived\nto constrain modified gravity models. Our results show that the hydrostatic\nequilibrium in the four systems is naturally adjusted to the HMG model without\nthe need for fitting parameters or adding sterile neutrinos, which are required\nfor MOND theories.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
