Although our understanding of forest-climate\ninteractions has improved, significant knowledge gaps remain, preventing\ndefinitive assessments of afforestation's net climate benefits. In this review,\nfocusing on the Canadian boreal, we identify these gaps and synthesize existing\nknowledge. The review highlights regional realities, Earth's climatic history,\nuncertainties in biogeochemical (BGC) and biogeophysical (BGP) changes\nfollowing afforestation, and limitations in current assessment methodologies,\nemphasizing the need to reconcile these uncertainties before drawing firm\nconclusions about the climate benefits of afforestation. We hope that the\nidentified gaps will drive the development of a more informed decision-making\nframework for Canadian afforestation policy, one that considers regional and\nfuture climatic contexts. Although we use the Canadian boreal as an example,\nmost arguments in this review are applicable across the globe, particularly for\nthe circumpolar nations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
