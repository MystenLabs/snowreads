Its performance (detected flux,\nlevel of the speckle signal, signal-to-noise ratio, and limiting magnitude) is\nstudied here using both the actual data and realistic simulations, including\nthe detector noise. In the calculation of the speckle power spectrum, signal\nclipping is essential to reduce the noise impact and maximize the sensitivity.\nIncreasing exposure time of individual frames beyond 30 ms does not improve the\nlimiting magnitude, which ranges from 11.5 to 14 mag under a seeing from 1.6\"\nto 0.6\" in the wide-band I filter. A gain of at least one magnitude is expected\nif the current electron multiplication CCD is replaced by a high-end CMOS\ndetector with a sub-electron readout noise. This study will help in planning,\nexecuting, and automating future speckle observations with HRCam and other\nspeckle imagers.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
