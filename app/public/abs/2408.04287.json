In this article, we show that\n$\\mathsf{ZF}+\\mathsf{DC}_\\kappa$, where $\\kappa$ is a fixed aleph, cannot prove\nthat surjective cardinals form a cardinal algebra, which gives a negative\nsolution to a question proposed by Truss [J. Truss, Ann. Pure Appl. Logic 27,\n165--207 (1984)]. Nevertheless, we show that surjective cardinals form a\n``surjective cardinal algebra'', whose postulates are almost the same as those\nof a cardinal algebra, except that the refinement postulate is replaced by the\nfinite refinement postulate. This yields a smoother proof of the cancellation\nlaw for surjective cardinals, which states that $m\\cdot\\mathfrak{a}=^\\ast\nm\\cdot\\mathfrak{b}$ implies $\\mathfrak{a}=^\\ast\\mathfrak{b}$ for all cardinals\n$\\mathfrak{a},\\mathfrak{b}$ and all nonzero natural numbers $m$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
