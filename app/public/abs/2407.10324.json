In the present work, we revisit this topic extending\nconsiderations well-past the near-integrable regime of nearly equal scattering\nlengths. Instead, we focus on stationary states and spectral stability of such\nstructures for large values of the inter-component interaction coefficient. We\nfind that the state can manifest dynamical instabilities for suitable parameter\nvalues. We also explore a phenomenological, yet quantitatively accurate upon\nsuitable tuning, particle model which, in line also with earlier works, offers\nthe potential of accurately following the associated stability and dynamical\nfeatures. Finally, we probe the dynamics of the unstable vortex-bright\nstructure, observing an unprecedented, to our knowledge, instability scenario\nin which the oscillatory instability leads to a patch of vorticity that harbors\nand eventually ejects multiple vortex-bright structures.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
