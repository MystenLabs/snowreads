Recent research indicates that deep local descriptors have better\nrepresentational capabilities. These studies recognize the impact of background\nnoise on classification performance. They typically filter query descriptors\nusing all local descriptors in the support classes or engage in bidirectional\nselection between local descriptors in support and query sets. However, they\nignore the fact that background features may be useful for the classification\nperformance of specific tasks. This paper proposes a novel task-aware\ncontrastive local descriptor selection network (TCDSNet). First, we calculate\nthe contrastive discriminative score for each local descriptor in the support\nclass, and select discriminative local descriptors to form a support descriptor\nsubset. Finally, we leverage support descriptor subsets to adaptively select\ndiscriminative query descriptors for specific tasks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both\ngeneral and fine-grained datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"y_ThD4_K_T6Mx4eJPmYpAw5X2jkSWeYH1VVGTr58MPU","pdfSize":"1089008"}
