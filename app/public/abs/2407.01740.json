The 8CB slab is kept at a temperature below the phase transition value\nbetween the nematic and the smectic A phases. The smectic A molecules are\nhorizontally aligned with an applied magnetic field, with their centers of mass\narranged on equally spaced layers perpendicular to the field. The contact with\nthe active nematic prompts flow in the smectic slab, along the direction\nparallel to the layers. This flow direction is transferred back to the active\nnematic. We set up a model of such contact flow and make predictions on the\nexperimentally observed pattern, from the point of view of asymptotic, linear\nand nonlinear analyses. We examine such results within the scope of the\nprinciple of minimum energy dissipation of the flow. For analytic convenience,\nwe consider the active nematic confined between two symmetric 8CB slabs, and\nshow that the conclusions still hold when replacing the bottom smectic A\nsubstrate with water, as in the experimental setting.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
