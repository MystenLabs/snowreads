Here, we investigate the\nphysical principles underlying the occurrence of PBP for a single-mode light\nbeam propagating in a single-mode optical fiber with no significant\nstress-induced birefringence wound into a circular helix configuration. We\ndiscuss the effects of curvature and torsion of the helical fiber on the\nrotation of the polarization vector and the associated PBP. We find the\nanalytic solution for the polarization vector and Stokes parameters of the\nlight for any initial polarization state of the light entering the helical\nfiber, the analytic expression for the PBP of the light for periodic transport\nof the light, the intensity of a superposition of the initial and final beams\nwhich depends on the PBP, and we discuss the effects of fluctuations of the\nparameters specifying the geometry and the material characteristics of the\nhelical fiber on the PBP. We also discuss the relationship between the PBP and\nthe solid angle subtended by the tangent vector of the helix plotted on the\nunit sphere.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"17eL8jAU86hvlKky29OKRMFbcYLCf8cfKtIvV42cjSg","pdfSize":"866848"}
