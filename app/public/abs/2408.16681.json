The\ntriples amplitudes and residuals are processed in the\nsingular-value-decomposition (SVD) basis. Truncation of the SVD basis according\nto the values of the singular values together with the density fitting (or\nCholeski) factorization of the electron repulsion integrals reduces the scaling\nof the method to $N^6$, and the DC approximation removes the most expensive\nterms of the SVD triples residuals and at the same time improves the accuracy\nof the method. The SVD-basis vectors for the triples are obtained from the CC3\ntriples density matrices constructed using doubles amplitudes, which are also\nSVD-decomposed. This allows us to avoid steps that scale higher than $N^6$\naltogether. Tests against DC-CCSDT and CCSDT(Q) on a benchmark set of chemical\nreactions with closed-shell molecules demonstrate that the SVD-error is very\nsmall already with moderate truncation thresholds, especially so when using a\nCCSD(T) energy correction. Tests on alkane chains demonstrated that the SVD\nerror grows linearly with system size confirming the size extensivity of\nSVD-DC-CCSDT within a chosen truncation threshold.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
