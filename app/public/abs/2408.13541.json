The problem of getting end-point estimates is not new and some\nresults are available in literature. However, these results were obtained\nindependently without much focus on the similarities between underlying\ngeometries. We give a unified proof for the end-point estimates on spaces of\nconstant curvature by making use of geometric ideas common to the spaces of\nconstant curvature, and obtaining a unified formula for the $k$-plane transform\nof radial functions. We also give some inequalities for certain special\nfunctions as an application to one of our lemmata.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
