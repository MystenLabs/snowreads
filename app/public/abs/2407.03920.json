However, traditional centralized approaches often\nencounter challenges related to data privacy. In this context, Federated\nLearning emerges as a promising solution. This work introduces two innovative\nalgorithms--Ensemble SVDD and Support Vector Election--that leverage Support\nVector Machines for anomaly detection in a federated setting. In comparison\nwith the Neural Networks typically used in within Federated Learning, these new\nalgorithms emerge as potential alternatives, as they can operate effectively\nwith small datasets and incur lower computational costs. The novel algorithms\nare tested in various distributed system configurations, yielding promising\ninitial results that pave the way for further investigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
