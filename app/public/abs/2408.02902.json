Secondly, we\ndefine the fractional divergence and give another form of $(-\\Delta)^s$. The\nthird point, and the foremost, is the introduction of the fractional Sobolev\nspace $W^{s,2}(V)$, which is necessary when we study problems involving\n$(-\\Delta)^{s}$. Finally, using the mountain-pass theorem and the Nehari\nmanifold, we obtain multiplicity solutions to a discrete fractional\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger equation on $G$. We caution the readers that though these\nexistence results are well known in the continuous case, the discrete case is\nquite different.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"R_DPUUNtb1NUftGPvKWYXeI1XMaIIHnRABm5JmMTWuk","pdfSize":"282041"}
