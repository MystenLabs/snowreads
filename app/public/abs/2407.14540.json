Despite the existing knowledge about\nuncertainty in risk analysis, no previous work has estimated the uncertainty of\nAI-augmented systems given the propagation of errors in the pipeline. We\nprovide the formal underpinnings for capturing uncertainty propagation, develop\na simulator to quantify uncertainty, and evaluate the simulation of propagating\nerrors with two case studies. We discuss the generalizability of our approach\nand present policy implications and recommendations for aviation. Future work\nincludes extending the approach and investigating the required metrics for\nvalidation in the aviation domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
