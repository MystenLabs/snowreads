The global cybersecurity workforce is only\n25% female. Much research exists on the effect of gender bias on the hiring of\nwomen into the technical workforce, but little on how the gender of the\nrecruiter (gender difference) affects recruitment decisions. This research\nreveals differences between the non-technical skills sought by female vs\nnon-female cybersecurity recruiters. The former look for recruits with\npeople-focused skills while the latter look for task-focused skills,\nhighlighting the need for gender diversity in recruitment panels.\n  Recruiters are increasingly seeking non-technical (soft) skills in technical\ngraduate recruits. This requires STEM curriculum in Universities to adapt to\nmatch. Designing an industry-ready cybersecurity curriculum requires knowledge\nof these non-technical skills. An online survey of cybersecurity professionals\nwas used to determine the most sought after non-technical skills in the field.\nAnalysis of the data reveals distinct gender differences in the non-technical\nskills most valued in a recruit, based on the gender of the recruiter (not the\nrecruited). The gender differences discovered do not correspond to the higher\nproportion of women employed in non-technical cybersecurity roles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
