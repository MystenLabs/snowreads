Building on prior observations, we propose an exact\nduality between string theory on a spacetime which is not asymptotically AdS\nand a non-conformal field theory. The bulk theory is constructed as a marginal\ndeformation of the $k=1$ AdS$_3$ string while the spacetime dual is a single\ntrace $T\\overline{T}$-deformed symmetric orbifold theory. As evidence for the\nduality, we match the one-loop bulk and boundary torus partition functions.\nThis correspondence provides a framework to both learn about quantum gravity\nbeyond AdS and understand how to define physical observables in\n$T\\overline{T}$-deformed field theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7PlL2UDDoA2S0nCPjsI33dW2AHuDwGGmEuvkTTSsd8w","pdfSize":"574832"}
