We\ndescribe the $^{12}$CO ($J$=2--1), $^{13}$CO ($J$=2--1), C$^{18}$O ($J$=2--1),\nH$_2$CO ($J=3_{2,1}$--$2_{2,0}$), and SiO ($J$=5--4) molecular lines along with\nthe 1.3 mm continuum at high spatial resolution ($\\sim$0.08\" or $\\sim$5 au).\nDust continuum emission is detected toward BHR 71 IRS1 and IRS2, with a central\ncompact component and extended continuum emission. The compact components are\nsmooth and show no sign of substructures such as spirals, rings or gaps.\nHowever, there is a brightness asymmetry along the minor axis of the presumed\ndisk in IRS1, possibly indicative of an inclined geometrically and optically\nthick disk-like component. Using a position-velocity diagram analysis of the\nC$^{18}$O line, clear Keplerian motions were not detected toward either source.\nIf Keplerian rotationally-supported disks are present, they are likely deeply\nembedded in their envelope. However, we can set upper limits of the central\nprotostellar mass of 0.46 M$_\\odot$ and 0.26 M$_\\odot$ for BHR 71 IRS1 and BHR\n71 IRS2, respectively. Outflows traced by $^{12}$CO and SiO are detected in\nboth sources. The outflows can be divided into two components, a wide-angle\noutflow and a jet. In IRS1, the jet exhibits a double helical structure,\nreflecting the removal of angular momentum from the system. In IRS2, the jet is\nvery collimated and shows a chain of knots, suggesting episodic accretion\nevents.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
