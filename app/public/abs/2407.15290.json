In\nparticular, we employ an MLFF model based on the kernel method and Bayesian\nlinear regression to compute the electronic free energy, atomic forces, and\npressure; in conjunction with a linear regression model between the electronic\ninternal and free energies to compute the internal energy, with all training\ndata generated from Kohn-Sham density functional theory (DFT). We verify the\naccuracy of the formalism by comparing the Hugoniot for carbon with recent\nKohn-Sham DFT results in the literature. In so doing, we demonstrate that\nKohn-Sham calculations for the Hugoniot can be accelerated by up to two orders\nof magnitude, while retaining ab initio accuracy. We apply this framework to\ncalculate the Hugoniots of 14 materials in the FPEOS database, comprising 9\nsingle elements and 5 compounds, between temperatures of 10 kK and 2 MK. We\nfind good agreement with first principles results in the literature while\nproviding tighter error bars. In addition, we confirm that the inter-element\ninteraction in compounds decreases with temperature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
