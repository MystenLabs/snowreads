A promising approach to\nquantum microwave-optics transduction uses an intermediary mechanical mode\nalong with piezo-optomechanical interactions. So far, such transducers have\nbeen released from their underlying substrate to confine mechanical fields --\npreventing proper thermal anchoring and creating a noise-efficiency trade-off\nresulting from optical absorption. Here, we introduce a release-free, i.e.\nnon-suspended, piezo-optomechanical transducer intended to circumvent this\nnoise-efficiency trade-off. We propose and design a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS)\nrelease-free transducer with appealing piezo- and optomechanical performance.\nOur proposal integrates release-free lithium niobate electromechanical crystals\nwith silicon optomechanical crystals on a sapphire substrate meant to improve\nthermal anchoring along with microwave and mechanical coherence. It leverages\nhigh-wavevector mechanical modes firmly guided on the chip surface. Beyond\nquantum science and engineering, the proposed platform and design principles\nare attractive for low-power acousto-optic systems in integrated photonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
