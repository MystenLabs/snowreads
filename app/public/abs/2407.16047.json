In this project, we address the GeoLingIt\nchallenge of geolocalizing tweets written in Italian by leveraging large\nlanguage models (LLMs). GeoLingIt requires the prediction of both the region\nand the precise coordinates of the tweet. Our approach involves fine-tuning\npre-trained LLMs to simultaneously predict these geolocalization aspects. By\nintegrating innovative methodologies, we enhance the models' ability to\nunderstand the nuances of Italian social media text to improve the\nstate-of-the-art in this domain. This work is conducted as part of the Large\nLanguage Models course at the Bertinoro International Spring School 2024.
