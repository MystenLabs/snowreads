Current semantic communications over\nMIMO channels mainly focus on channel adaptive encoding and decoding, which\nlacks exploration of signal distribution. To leverage the potential of signal\ndistribution in signal space denoising, we develop a diffusion model over MIMO\nchannels (DM-MIMO), a plugin module at the receiver side in conjunction with\nsingular value decomposition (SVD) based precoding and equalization.\nSpecifically, due to the significant variations in effective noise power over\ndistinct sub-channels, we determine the effective sampling steps accordingly\nand devise a joint sampling algorithm. Utilizing a three-stage training\nalgorithm, DM-MIMO learns the distribution of the encoded signal, which enables\nnoise elimination over all sub-channels. Experimental results demonstrate that\nthe DM-MIMO effectively reduces the mean square errors (MSE) of the equalized\nsignal and the DM-MIMO semantic communication system (DM-MIMO-JSCC) outperforms\nthe JSCC-based semantic communication system in image reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
