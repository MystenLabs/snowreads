When the set on which\none wishes to $\\phi$-project is convex, we show that the required assumptions\nare implied by easily verifiable conditions. In particular, for input\nprobability vectors and a rather large class of \\phidivergences, we obtain that\n$\\phi$-projections are continuously differentiable when projecting on a set\ndefined by linear equalities. The obtained results are applied to the\nderivation of the asymptotics of $\\phi$-projection estimators (that is, minimum\n\\phidivergence\\, estimators) when projecting on parametric sets of probability\nvectors, on sets of probability vectors generated from distributions with\ncertain moments fixed and on Fr\\'echet classes of bivariate probability arrays.\nThe resulting asymptotics hold whether the element to be $\\phi$-projected\nbelongs to the set on which one wishes to $\\phi$-project or not.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
