Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision is the first single model that can\nsimultaneously push the performance boundaries of open LMMs in three important\ncomputer vision scenarios: single-image, multi-image, and video scenarios.\nImportantly, the design of LLaVA-OneVision allows strong transfer learning\nacross different modalities/scenarios, yielding new emerging capabilities. In\nparticular, strong video understanding and cross-scenario capabilities are\ndemonstrated through task transfer from images to videos.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
