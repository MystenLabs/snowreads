We derive the formula of the momentum\ndistribution of two bodies coalescing into dibaryon states and that of three\nbodies coalescing into tribaryon states. We explain the available data of the\ncoalescence factors $B_2$ and $B_3$, the transverse momentum spectra, the\naveraged transverse momenta, the yield rapidity densities, yield ratios of the\ndeuteron, antihelium-3, antitriton, hypertriton measured by the ALICE\ncollaboration, and give predictions of different $\\Omega$-hypernuclei, e.g.,\n$H(p\\Omega^-)$, $H(n\\Omega^-)$ and $H(pn\\Omega^-)$. We find two groups of\ninteresting observables, the averaged transverse momentum ratios of light\n(hyper-)nuclei to protons (hyperons) and the centrality-dependent yield ratios\nof theirs. The former group exhibits a reverse-hierarchy of the nucleus size,\nand the latter is helpful for the judgements of the nucleus production\nmechanism as well as the nucleus own size.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b3qfz7M_VZFd3qMYiyP-7SJurzLcQGqqSc2E6L3EyKg","pdfSize":"436007"}
