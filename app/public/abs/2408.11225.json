In this paper, we\npresent a new approximation algorithm for $MPC^{5+}_v$ which achieves a ratio\nof $2.511$ and runs in $O(|V|^{2.5} |E|^2)$ time. Unlike the previous\nalgorithm, the new algorithm is based on maximum matching, maximum path-cycle\ncover, and recursion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8UuxJrsUBkxcvG_-sskVAq5QeNNEx1BzbXIOkL1aJ_c","pdfSize":"469875"}
