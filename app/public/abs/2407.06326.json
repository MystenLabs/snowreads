Our approach uses frequency-domain coefficients\nvia the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) to compress and pre-compute the raw\ninput data for convolutional neural networks. We also investigate nearest\nneighborhood models via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) for prediction and to\naid in the self-supervised contrastive learning of embeddings through tile2vec.\nOur best competition model utilized geolocation features with a leaderboard\nscore of 0.152 and a best post-competition score of 0.161.
