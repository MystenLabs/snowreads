Still, a significant gap remains in the\navailability of comprehensive datasets that focus on the dynamics of proteins,\nwhich are crucial for understanding protein function, folding, and\ninteractions. To address this critical gap, we introduce mdCATH, a dataset\ngenerated through an extensive set of all-atom molecular dynamics simulations\nof a diverse and representative collection of protein domains. This dataset\ncomprises all-atom systems for 5,398 domains, modeled with a state-of-the-art\nclassical force field, and simulated in five replicates each at five\ntemperatures from 320 K to 413 K. The mdCATH dataset records coordinates and\nforces every 1 ns, for over 62 ms of accumulated simulation time, effectively\ncapturing the dynamics of the various classes of domains and providing a unique\nresource for proteome-wide statistical analyses of protein unfolding\nthermodynamics and kinetics. We outline the dataset structure and showcase its\npotential through four easily reproducible case studies, highlighting its\ncapabilities in advancing protein science.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
