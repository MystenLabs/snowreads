A slope\ncoefficient of a regression model may change as covariates are added or removed\nfrom the model. In the context of high-dimensional data, there are too many\nmodel extensions to check. However, as we show here, it is possible to\nefficiently search, with a branch and bound algorithm, for maximum and minimum\nvalues of that adjusted slope coefficient over a discrete space of regularized\nregression models. Here we introduce our algorithm, along with supporting\nmathematical results, an example application, and a link to our computer code,\nto help researchers summarize high-dimensional data and assess the stability of\nregression coefficients in uncertain models.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
