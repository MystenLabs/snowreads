This represents a generalization of previous results\nby Dyckerhoff, Efimov, Polishchuk, and Positselski concerning the Hochschild\nhomology of matrix factorizations. A key ingredient in the proof is a theorem\ndue to B. Briggs, which represents a \"curved version\" of a celebrated theorem\nof Hopkins and Neeman. The proof of Briggs' Theorem is included in an appendix\nto this paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
