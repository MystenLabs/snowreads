The RWI can facilitate disk accretion, set the\nshape of planetary gaps and produce large vortices. It arises from density\nand/or temperature features, such as radial gaps, bumps or steps. A general,\nsufficient condition to trigger the RWI is lacking, which we address by\nstudying the linear RWI in a suite of simplified models, including\nincompressible and compressible shearing sheets and global, cylindrical disks.\nWe focus on enthalpy amplitude and width as the fundamental properties of disk\nfeatures with various shapes. We find analytic results for the RWI boundary and\ngrowth rates across a wide parameter space, in some cases with exact\nderivations and in others as a description of numerical results. Features wider\nthan a scale-height generally become unstable about halfway to Rayleigh\ninstability, i.e.\\ when the squared epicyclic frequency is about half the\nKeplerian value, reinforcing our previous finding. RWI growth rates\napproximately scale as enthalpy amplitude to the 1/3 power, with a weak\ndependence on width, across much of parameter space. Global disk curvature\naffects wide planetary gaps, making the outer gap edge more susceptible to the\nRWI. Our simplified models are barotropic and height-integrated, but the main\nresults should carry over to more complex and realistic scenarios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
