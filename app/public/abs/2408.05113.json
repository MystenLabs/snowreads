QPL is an annual conference that\nbrings together academic and industry researchers working on the mathematical\nfoundations of quantum computation, quantum physics, and related areas. The\nmain focus is on the use of algebraic and categorical structures, formal\nlanguages, semantic methods, as well as other mathematical and computer\nscientific techniques applicable to the study of physical systems, physical\nprocesses, and their composition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
