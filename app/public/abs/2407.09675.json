Existing\ntechnologies, such as liquid crystal on silicon spatial light modulators\n(LCoS-SLMs) and digital micromirror devices (DMDs), suffer from limited refresh\nrates, low damage thresholds, and high insertion loss. Acousto-optic modulators\n(AOMs) can resolve the above issues, as they typically handle higher laser\npower and offer lower insertion loss. By effectively mapping the temporal\nradio-frequency (RF) waveforms onto the spatial diffraction patterns of the\noptical field, individual AOMs have been shown to generate one-dimensional (1D)\nspatial modes at a pixel refresh rate of nearly 20 MHz. We extend this concept\nto enable fast modulation in a two-dimensional (2D) space using a double-AOM\nscheme. We demonstrate the generation of 2D Hermite-Gaussian (HG_nm) modes with\nan average fidelity of 81%, while the highest-order mode generated, HG_53,\nretains a fidelity of 56%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
