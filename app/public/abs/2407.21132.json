The starting point of the\nanalysis is an interpretation of shapes in ontic structural realist terms,\nwhich gives rise to the notion of self-subsisting structure. The relational\nversion of a Newtonian-particle toy model is introduced and discussed as a\nconcrete example.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
