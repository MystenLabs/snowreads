We investigate the notion of distance between\nembedded graphs and present a metric to measure the distance between two\ngeometric graphs via merge trees. In order to preserve as much useful\ninformation as possible from the original data, we introduce a way of rotating\nthe sublevel set to obtain the merge trees via the idea of the directional\ntransform. We represent the merge trees using a surjective multi-labeling\nscheme and then compute the distance between two representative matrices. We\nshow some theoretically desirable qualities and present two methods of\ncomputation: approximation via sampling and exact distance using a kinetic data\nstructure, both in polynomial time. We illustrate its utility by implementing\nit on two data sets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
