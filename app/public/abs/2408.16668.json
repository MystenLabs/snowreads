In this work, we uncover the\nassociated tensor structures of intersection numbers and integrate them with\nthe fibration method to develop a novel and efficient evaluation scheme.\nCompanion matrices allow us to cast the computation of the intersection numbers\nin terms of a matrix operator calculus within the ambient tensor space. Our\nalgorithm has been successfully applied to the decomposition of two-loop\nfive-point massless functions, representing a significant advancement for the\ndirect projection of Feynman integrals to master integrals via intersection\nnumbers.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
