{"id":"2408.01675","title":"Streaming Torque in Dust-Gas Coupled Protoplanetary Disks","authors":"Qiang Hou, Cong Yu","authorsParsed":[["Hou","Qiang",""],["Yu","Cong",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 3 Aug 2024 06:23:23 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-06","timestamp":1722666203000,"abstract":"  We investigate the migration of low-mass protoplanets embedded in dust-gas\ncoupled protoplanetary disks. Linear calculations are performed with respect to\nthe NSH (Nakagawa-Sekiya-Hayashi 1986) equilibrium within a shearing sheet. We\nfind that the dusty quasi-drift mode dominates the dynamical behaviors in close\nproximity to the protoplanet. This mode exhibits an extremely short radial\nwavelength, characterized by a dispersion relation of $ \\tilde{\\omega} = \\left(\n1 + \\mu \\right) \\boldsymbol{W}_s \\cdot \\boldsymbol{k}$. The emergence of this\nmode leads to a wake with a short radial length-scale ahead of protoplanets,\ncontributing to a positive torque, termed as ``Streaming Torque (ST)''.\nFurthermore, both Lindblad torque and corotation torque are affected by the NSH\nvelocity. The total torque and planetary migration are contingent upon the\ncoupling strength between dust and gas. In most scenarios, ST predominates,\ninducing outward migration for planets, thereby addressing the issue of rapid\ninward migration in their formation paradigm.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
