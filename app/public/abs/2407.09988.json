As a consequence, we show that the Hodge conjecture for the\nprojective hypersurface is equivalent to a dg-categorical analogue of the Hodge\nconjecture for the singularity category.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
