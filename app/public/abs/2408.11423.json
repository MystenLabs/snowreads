We find that the default\nMSHT20 parameterisation can reproduce the features of the input set in such a\nclosure test to well within the textbook uncertainties. This provides strong\nevidence that parameterisation inflexibility in the MSHT20 fit is not a\nsignificant issue in the data region. We also present the first completely\nlike-for-like comparison between two global PDF fits, namely MSHT and NNPDF,\nwhere the only difference is guaranteed to be due to the fitting methodology.\nTo achieve this, we present a fit to the NNPDF4.0 data and theory inputs with\nthe MSHT parameterisation. We find that this gives a moderately, but\nnoticeably, better fit quality than the central NNPDF4.0 fits and that this\ndifference persists at the level of the PDFs and benchmark cross sections. The\nNNPDF4.0 uncertainties are found to be broadly in line with the MSHT results if\na textbook $T^2=1$ tolerance is applied, but to be significantly smaller if a\ntolerance typical of the MSHT20 fit is applied.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
