Our analysis\nextends to the observation of a doubling bifurcation of a closed invariant\ncurve, leading to a subsequent transition into a state of hyperchaos. The\nabsorption of various saddle periodic orbits into the hyperchaotic attractor is\ndemonstrated through distance computation, and we explore the dimensionality of\nboth stable and unstable manifolds. Various routes to cyclic and disjoint\nquasiperiodic structures are presented. Specifically we showcase the transition\nfrom a saddle-node connection to a saddle-focus connection, leading to the\nformation of quasiperiodic closed cyclic disjoint curves, as revealed by the\ncomputation of one-dimensional unstable manifold. Additionally, we show an\nunusual transition from a period-two orbit to a period-six orbit and uncover\nthe mechanism related to two subsequent bifurcations: a) subcritical\nNeimark-Sacker bifurcation, and (b) saddle-node bifurcation. Our approach\ninvolves the use of computational methods for constructing one-dimensional\nmanifolds, extending saddle periodic orbits through a one-parameter\ncontinuation, and employing a multi-dimensional Newton-Raphson approach for\npinpointing the saddle periodic orbits in the three-dimensional map.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
