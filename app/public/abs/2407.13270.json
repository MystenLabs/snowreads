Our wave function is constructed based on\nthe occupation numbers and natural orbitals of the one-body density matrix. We\ndemonstrate that the newly found wave function describes the ground state of\nthe fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas under any external potential. By expressing\nthe proposed wave function in the framework of second quantization, we show\nthat the ground state of the fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas is a\nnumber-conserving Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state. We provide explicit\nexpressions for the corresponding coefficients that describe the fermionic\nTonks-Girardeau gas as a number-conserving BCS state. Additionally, the\nsuitable form of the proposed wave function in second quantization allows us to\nderive the necessary expectation values to experimentally detect pairing in the\nfermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas. With this, we prove and show how to detect that\nthe fermionic Tonks-Girardeau gas not only exhibits non-trivial quantum\ncorrelations but is also a paired state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
