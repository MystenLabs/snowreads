We assume that the\nsystemic risk measure is defined using a general aggregation function with some\ncontinuity properties and value-at-risk applied as a monetary risk measure. We\nfocus on the theoretical convergence of its SAA under Wijsman and Hausdorff\ntopologies for closed sets. After building the general theory, we provide an\nin-depth study of an important special case where the aggregation function is\ndefined based on the Eisenberg-Noe network model. In this case, we provide\nmixed-integer programming formulations for calculating the SAA sets via their\nweighted-sum and norm-minimizing scalarizations. To demonstrate the\napplicability of our findings, we conduct a comprehensive sensitivity analysis\nby generating a financial network based on the preferential attachment model\nand modeling the economic disruptions via a Pareto distribution.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
