These properties are encoded in the quantum metric and Berry\ncurvature. While Berry curvature-mediated transport effects such as the\nanomalous and nonlinear Hall effects have been identified in several magnetic\nand nonmagnetic systems, quantum metric-induced transport phenomena remain\nlimited to topological antiferromagnets. Here we show that spin-momentum\nlocking -- a general characteristic of the electronic states at surfaces and\ninterfaces of spin-orbit coupled materials -- leads to a nontrivial quantum\nmetric. This metric activates a nonlinear in-plane magnetoresistance that we\nmeasure and electrically control in 111-oriented LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$\ninterfaces. These findings demonstrate the existence of quantum metric effects\nin a vast class of materials and provide new strategies to design\nfunctionalities based on the quantum geometry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
