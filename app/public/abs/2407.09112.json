The idea is\nto use linear substitutions to transform these relations to an explicitly\nrecursive form. The possibility of such a transformation is demonstrated for\nseveral families of massless (with one massive line) vacuum integrals up to the\n7-loop level.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
