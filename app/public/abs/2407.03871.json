This paper is devoted to the\nclassification of interior transit orbits and their application on low-energy\ntransfer in the Sun-Earth/Moon planar bicircular restricted four-body problem\n(PBCR4BP). First, the Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) are introduced to\ngenerate the interior transit orbits. The number of periapses about the Moon is\nselected as the classification parameter and mapped into the LCSs, achieving\nclear classification boundaries. Then, the evolution laws of the\nclassifications with respect to energy and solar gravity perturbation are\ndiscussed and summarized. Construction strategies for low-energy transfer are\nproposed based on the classifications and their evolution laws. Numerical\nsimulation of the transfer trajectories verifies the effectiveness of the\nproposed strategies. The dynamical behaviors and transfer characteristics of\ntransit orbits and their families are revealed, and a direct link between\ntransit orbit families and low-energy transfers is finally established.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
