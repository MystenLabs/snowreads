Our aim is to classify all possible ways\nof embedding a $U(1)$ symmetry in a three-Higgs-doublet model. The different\npossibilities are presented and compared. All these models contain\nmass-degenerate pairs of Dark Matter candidates due to a $U(1)$ symmetry\nunbroken (conserved) by the vacuum. Most of these models preserve CP. In the\nCP-conserving case the pairs can be seen as one being even and the other being\nodd under CP or as having opposite charges under $U(1)$. Not all symmetries\npresented here were identified before in the literature, which points to the\nfact that there are still many open questions in three-Higgs-doublet models. We\nalso perform a numerical exploration of the $U(1) \\otimes U(1)$-symmetric 3HDM,\nthis is the most general phase-invariant (real) three-Higgs-doublet model. The\nmodel contains a multi-component Dark Matter sector, with two independent mass\nscales. After imposing relevant experimental constraints we find that there are\npossible solutions throughout a broad Dark Matter mass range, 45-2000 GeV, the\nlatter being a scan cutoff.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oj8Oino2C4wQkVXLAnG-N470iM6ARaovd8alXMOW4mo","pdfSize":"1509273"}
