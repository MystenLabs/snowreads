However, their potential\napplications are significantly limited by fatigue and imprint phenomena, which\naffect device lifetime and memory capabilities. Here, to accurately describe\nthe dynamics and field effects of HfO2, we adopt our newly developed\nDREAM-Allegro network scheme and develop a comprehensive machine-learning model\nfor HfO2. Such model can not only predict the interatomic potential, but also\npredict Born effective charges. Applying such model, we explore the role of\ndomain dynamics in HfO2 and find that the fatigue and imprint phenomena are\nclosely related to the so-called E-path and T-path switching pathways. Based on\nthe different atomic motions in the two paths, we propose that an inclined\nelectric field can sufficiently suppress fatigue and enhancing the performance\nof HfO2-based ferroelectric devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
