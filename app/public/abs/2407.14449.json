We\ncompare results from both its local and nonlocal versions. In both cases, we\nfind that the inverse magnetic catalysis (IMC) near the crossover is eliminated\nwith increasing pion mass, while the decreasing trend of crossover temperature\nwith increasing magnetic field persists for pion mass values at least up to\n$440$ MeV. Thus, the models are capable of capturing qualitatively the results\nfound by lattice QCD (LQCD) for heavy (unphysical) pions. The key feature in\nthe models is the incorporation of the effect of a reduction in the coupling\nconstant with increasing energy. Along with reproducing the IMC effect, it\nenables models to describe the effects of heavier current quark masses without\nintroducing additional parameters. For the local NJL model, this agreement\ndepends on how the parameters of the model are fit at the physical point. In\nthis respect, the nonlocal version, which, due to its formulation,\nautomatically exhibits the IMC effect around the crossover region, captures the\nphysics more naturally.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
