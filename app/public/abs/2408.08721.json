Our\nmethod expands upon the recent study of split extensions and semidirect\nproducts of unitary magmas conducted by Gran, Janelidze, and Sobral. Building\non their research, we explore split extensions in which the middle object does\nnot necessarily maintain a bijective correspondence with the Cartesian product\nof its end objects. Although this phenomenon is not observed in groups or any\nassociative semiabelian variety of universal algebra, it shares similarities\nwith instances found in monoids through weakly Schreier extensions and certain\nexotic non-associative algebras, such as semi-left-loops. Our work seeks to\ncontribute to the comprehension of split extensions in unitary magmas and may\noffer valuable insights for potential abstractions of categorical properties in\nmore general contexts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eY4eAdV6D6lwVJQVfD3iQrs5fIv96reMVGv4xcFV0UM","pdfSize":"222084"}
