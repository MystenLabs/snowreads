In order to do so we perform\na systematic analysis of the Migdal bounds in the $m_\\chi-\\delta$ parameter\nspace comparing them to those from nuclear recoil searches. The Migdal effect\nallows to significantly extend to low WIMP masses the nuclear recoil bounds for\n$\\delta<0$. In this case the bounds are driven by XENON1T, except when $\\delta$\nis vanishing or very small, when, depending on the WIMP-nucleus interaction, in\nthe lower end of the $m_\\chi$ range either DS50 or SuperCDMS are more\nconstraining. On the other hand, when $\\delta>0$ and the WIMP particle\nupscatters to a heavier state nuclear recoil bounds are stronger than those\nfrom the Migdal effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
