The\nanalysis uses 140 fb$^{-1}$ of 13 TeV proton$-$proton collision data collected\nwith the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The final states with one\nor two electrons or muons are employed. An excess of events over the expected\nbackground is found with an observed (expected) significance of 4.6 (5.4)\nstandard deviations. The $t\\bar{t}H$ cross-section is $\\sigma_{t\\bar{t}H} =\n411^{+101}_{-92}$ fb $= 411 \\pm 54( \\text{stat.}) ^{+85}_{-75}( \\text{syst.})$\nfb for a Higgs boson mass of 125.09 GeV, consistent with the prediction of the\nStandard Model of $507^{+35}_{-50}$ fb. The cross-section is also measured\ndifferentially in bins of the Higgs boson transverse momentum within the\nsimplified template cross-section framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aMmLrz1lNBjk7TmFYvgPGTTM2PR_767Aa7ylFh2-F-I","pdfSize":"2495923"}
