To tackle this\nissue, this paper presents a two-stage training strategy, called\n\\textbf{ToCoAD}. In the first stage, a discriminative network is trained by\nusing synthetic anomalies in a self-supervised learning manner. This network is\nthen utilized in the second stage to provide a negative feature guide, aiding\nin the training of the feature extractor through bootstrap contrastive\nlearning. This approach enables the model to progressively learn the\ndistribution of anomalies specific to industrial datasets, effectively\nenhancing its generalizability to various types of anomalies. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\ntwo-stage training strategy, and our model produces competitive performance,\nachieving pixel-level AUROC scores of 98.21\\%, 98.43\\% and 97.70\\% on MVTec AD,\nVisA and BTAD respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
