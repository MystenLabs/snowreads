We present efficient algorithms for several fundamental\ncomputational problems on the semistability of quiver representations: deciding\nsemistability and $\\sigma$-semistability, finding maximizers of King's\ncriterion, and finding the Harder-Narasimhan filtration. We also investigate a\nclass of polyhedral cones defined by the linear system in King's criterion,\nwhich we call King cones. We demonstrate that the King cones for rank-one\nrepresentations can be encoded by submodular flow polytopes, allowing us to\ndecide the $\\sigma$-semistability of rank-one representations in strongly\npolynomial time. Our argument employs submodularity in quiver representations,\nwhich may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
