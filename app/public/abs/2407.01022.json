This condition,\nwhich writes $\\ell^T\\left(\\omega\\right) > 0$, signifies that the smallest time\nspent by a geodesic in the subset $\\omega\\subset \\mathbb{T}^d$ during time $T$\nis non-zero. In other words, the subset $\\omega$ detects any geodesic\npropagating on the d-dimensional torus during time $T$. Here, the subset\n$\\omega$ is randomly defined by drawing a grid of $n^d$, $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$,\nsmall cubes of equal size and by adding them to $\\omega$ with probability\n$\\varepsilon > 0$. In this article, we establish a probabilistic property of\nthe functional $\\ell^T$: the random law\n$\\ell^T\\left(\\omega_\\varepsilon^n\\right)$ converges in probability to\n$\\varepsilon$ as $n \\to + \\infty$.Considering random subsets\n$\\omega_\\varepsilon^n$ allows us to construct subsets $\\omega$ such that\n$\\ell^T\\left(\\omega\\right) = |\\omega|$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
