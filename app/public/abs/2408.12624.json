However, its perceivable advantages have been impeded by\nthe long-standing lack of a robust open-source graphical user interface (GUI)\nthat integrates parameter settings with the visualization of molecular and\ngeometric constraints. To address this limitation, we have developed\nPACKMOL-GUI, a VMD plugin that leverages the dynamic extensibility of Tcl/Tk\ntoolkit. This GUI enables the configuration of all PACKMOL parameters through\nan intuitive user panel, while also facilitating the visualization of molecular\nstructures and geometric constraints, including cubes, boxes and spheres, among\nothers via the VMD software. The seamless interaction between VMD and PACKMOL\nprovides an intuitive and efficient all-in-one platform for the packing of\ncomplex molecular systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
