Each of these noncommutative lightcones\nmaintains covariance under the action of the respective quantum deformation of\nthe SO(2,1) conformal group. We discuss the role played by SO(2,1)\nautomorphisms in the classification of inequivalent Poisson homogeneous\nlightcones, as well as the geometric aspects of this construction. The\nlocalization properties of the novel quantum lightcones are analyzed and shown\nto be deeply connected with the geometric features of the Poisson homogeneous\nspaces.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
