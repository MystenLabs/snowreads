It uses existing\ngenerators for abstract graphs and combines them with an efficient embedding\nand isomorphism rejection routine. The generation rate of the program\nimplementing the algorithm depends a lot on the class of maps to be generated,\nbut is quite high -- more than a million non-isomorphic structures per second\n-- for some relevant classes of maps. The same program can also be used to\nembed specific graphs on a given orientable surface in all non-isomorphic ways.\nIt can serve as a tool in many applications where classes of maps on orientable\nsurfaces are studied and provides a very general independent test for\nspecialized generation programs. We also give enumeration results for\n3-regular, 4-regular, and 5-regular maps as well as all maps and some maps with\njust one face.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
