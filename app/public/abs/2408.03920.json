Targets are\nselected using JWST/NIRCam photometry from UNCOVER and other programs, and\ncover a wide range of categories and redshifts to ensure the legacy value of\nthe survey. These categories include the first galaxies at $z\\gtrsim10$, faint\ngalaxies during the Epoch of Reionization ($z\\sim6-8$), high redshift AGN\n($z\\gtrsim6$), Population III star candidates, distant quiescent and dusty\ngalaxies ($1\\lesssim z \\lesssim 6$), and filler galaxies sampling\nredshift--color--magnitude space from $z\\sim 0.1-13$. Seven NIRSpec MSA masks\nacross the extended Abell 2744 cluster were observed, along with NIRCam\nparallel imaging in 8 filters (F090W, F115W, F150W, F200W, F277W, F356W, F410M,\nF444W, F480M) over a total area of ~26 arcmin$^2$, overlapping existing HST\ncoverage from programs including the Hubble Frontier Fields and BUFFALO. We\nsuccessfully observed 553 objects down to\n$m_{\\mathrm{F444W}}\\sim30\\mathrm{AB}$, and by leveraging mask overlaps, we\nreach total on-target exposure times ranging from 2.4-16.7h. We demonstrate the\nsuccess rate and distribution of confirmed redshifts, and also highlight the\nrich information revealed by these ultradeep spectra for a subset of our\ntargets. An updated lens model of Abell 2744 is also presented, including 14\nadditional spectroscopic redshifts and finding a total cluster mass of\n$M_{\\mathrm{SL}}=(2.1\\pm0.3)\\times10^{15}\\,\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$. We publicly\nrelease reduced 1D and 2D spectra for all objects observed in Summer 2023 along\nwith a spectroscopic redshift catalog and the updated lens model of the cluster\n(https://jwst-uncover.github.io/DR4.html).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
