Here, we propose and demonstrate\na dynamic compensation method to mitigate the effect of PIFS during the\nKerr-cat qubit initialization. Utilizing a novel nonlinearity-engineered\ntriple-loop SQUID device, we realize a stabilized Kerr-cat qubit and validate\nthe advantages of the dynamic compensation method by improving the\ninitialization fidelity from 57% to 78%, with a projected fidelity of 91% after\nexcluding state preparation and measurement errors. Our results not only\nadvance the practical implementation of Kerr-cat qubits, but also provide\nvaluable insights into the fundamental adiabatic dynamics of these systems.\nThis work paves the way for scalable quantum processors that leverage the\nbias-preserving properties of Kerr-cat qubits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
