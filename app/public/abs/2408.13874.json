In the present work, we\nshow how this approach can be extended to all irreducible complex reflection\ngroups G. The Stirling numbers of the first and second kind are defined via the\nWhitney numbers of the first and second kind, respectively, of the intersection\nlattice of G. For the groups G(m,p,n), these numbers and polynomials can be\ngiven combinatorial interpretations in terms of various statistics. The ordered\nversion of ths q-Stirling numbers of the second kind also show up in\nconjectured Hilbert series for certain super coinvariant algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
