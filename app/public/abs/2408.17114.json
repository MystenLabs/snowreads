A clear\nsignature of this conversion is the positron produced from antimuonium decay.\nThis paper presents a near-$4\\pi$-coverage calorimeter designed for MACE, which\nprovides an energy resolution of 9% at 511 keV and 7.5% at 1.022 MeV. The\nsignal efficiency for double $\\gamma$ events is 67.5%. Detailed Monte-Carlo\nsimulations using MACE offline software based on Geant4 are performed for\ngeometry optimization, coincidence system design, background estimation, and\nbenchmark detector validation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
