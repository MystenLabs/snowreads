The rapid increase in EV adoption poses significant challenges to the\nexisting grid infrastructure, particularly in managing the increasing\nelectricity demand and mitigating the risk of grid overloads. Centralized EV\ncharging strategies are investigated due to their potential to optimize grid\nstability and efficiency, compared to decentralized approaches that may\nexacerbate grid stress. Utilizing a multi-agent based simulation model, the\nstudy provides a realistic representation of the electric vehicle home charging\necosystem in a case study of Strib, Denmark. The findings show that the\nEarliest-deadline-first and Round Robin perform best with 100% EV adoption in\nterms of EV user satisfaction. The simulation considers a realistic adoption\ncurve, EV charging strategies, EV models, and driving patterns to capture the\nfull ecosystem dynamics over a long-term period with high resolution (hourly).\nAdditionally, the study offers detailed load profiles for future distribution\ngrids, demonstrating how centralized charging strategies can efficiently manage\ngrid loads and prevent overloads.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
