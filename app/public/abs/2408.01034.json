From deformation theory we get that the\ncomputation results in a formal algebra which is the prorepresenting hull of\nthe noncommutative deformation functor, and this hull is unique up to\nisomorphism.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
