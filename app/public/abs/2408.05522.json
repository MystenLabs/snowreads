The dual\n4-dimensional gauge theory is not conformal and exhibits a FG flow between two\ndifferent fixed points. There are three parameters including energy scale\n$\\Lambda$, model parameter $\\phi_M$ and temperature $T$ which control the\nbehavior of the model. Interestingly, we have found that $E_p$ can be used as a\nmeasure to probe the non-conformal behavior of the theory at both zero and\nfinite temperature. Furthermore, we have found that if one considers two\ndifferent mixed states characterized by distinct values of $\\frac{\\Lambda}{T}$,\nthen the correlation between the subsystems of these states can be the same\nindependent of $\\frac{\\Lambda}{T}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
