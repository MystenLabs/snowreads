In recent years, there has been growing interest in leveraging\nneural networks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of quantum state\ntomography. Still, many of them did not include mixed quantum state, since pure\nstates are arguably less common in practical situations. In this research\npaper, we present two neural networks based approach for both pure and mixed\nquantum state tomography: Restricted Feature Based Neural Network and Mixed\nStates Conditional Generative Adversarial Network, evaluate its effectiveness\nin comparison to existing neural based methods. We demonstrate that our\nproposed methods can achieve state-of-the-art results in reconstructing mixed\nquantum states from experimental data. Our work highlights the potential of\nneural networks in revolutionizing quantum state tomography and facilitating\nthe development of quantum technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7azh6htqQ4X5hVbNbDkpgj0rgSBlvI8Owr_vWv4-W80","pdfSize":"802041"}
