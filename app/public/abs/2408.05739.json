However, achieving all these objectives simultaneously remains\na significant challenge for miniaturized systems. Here, we demonstrate\ndual-comb ranging (DCR) that encompasses all these capabilities by using\ncounter-propagating (CP) solitons generated in an integrated Si$_3$N$_4$\nmicroresonator. We derive equations linking the DCR precision with comb line\npowers, revealing the advantage of microcomb's large line spacing in precise\nranging. Leveraging the advantage, our system reaches 1-nm-precision and\nmeasures nm-scale vibration at frequencies up to 0.9 MHz. We also show that\nprecise DCR is possible even in the presence of strong intensity noise and\nloss, using a mean received photon number as low as 5.5$\\times$10$^{-4}$ per\npulse. Our work establishes an optimization principle for dual-comb systems and\nbridges high performance ranging with foundry-manufactured photonic chips.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gZ24aCTvGABtAAo-rKpL8Lufmw03hC37azhD4yfPpa8","pdfSize":"3780290"}
