The\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard (SSSHH) model is a prototypical model which\nincludes both non-trivial topology and interactions. Due to its simplicity,\nthere are several artificial quantum systems which can realize such a model to\na good approximation. Here we focus on the quarter-filled case, where\ninteractions and dimerization open a charge gap. In particular, we study the\nsingle-particle spectral function for the extended SSHH model with magnetic\nfield and explore several parameter limits where effective model descriptions\narise. In the strongly-dimerized limit, we show that the low-energy excitations\nof the spectral function resemble a half-filled Hubbard model with effective\ndimer sites and renormalized couplings. For strong magnetic field and\ninteractions, we find physics akin to the spinless Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model\nat half filling, featuring a non-interacting topological phase transition.\nMoreover, in light of the recent realization of this model in quantum dot\nsimulation, we provide evidence for the stability of the topological phase\ntowards moderate non-local interactions in the experimentally expected\nparameter range.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
