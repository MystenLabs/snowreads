The efficacy of UAL critically\ndepends on the model capacity as well as the adopted uncertainty-based\nacquisition function. Within the context of this study, our analytical focus is\ndirected toward comprehending how the capacity of the machine learning model\nmay affect UAL efficacy. Through theoretical analysis, comprehensive\nsimulations, and empirical studies, we conclusively demonstrate that UAL can\nlead to worse performance in comparison with random sampling when the machine\nlearning model class has low capacity and is unable to cover the underlying\nground truth. In such situations, adopting acquisition functions that directly\ntarget estimating the prediction performance may be beneficial for improving\nthe performance of UAL.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Gl3hJSgiz0uk79vOcfR4WAqDuCjBCRDmMdz7jr5WYwQ","pdfSize":"3064541"}
