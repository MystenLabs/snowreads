A much studied example of this\nphenomenon is the BMPV black hole uplifted to 6D with flat base space versus\nTaub-NUT base space. These black holes have identical near horizon AdS_3 x S^3\ngeometry. In this paper, we study modes in AdS_3 x S^3 and identify those that\ncorrespond to supersymmetric hair modes in the full black hole spacetimes. We\nshow that these modes satisfy non-normalisable boundary conditions in AdS_3.\nThe non-normalisable boundary conditions are different for different hair\nmodes. We also discuss how the supersymmetric hair modes on BMPV black holes\nfit into the classification of supersymmetric solutions of 6D supergravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
