Despite these modest assumptions, we prove that GRC algorithms\ncan solve many important distributed tasks efficiently, i.e., in\npolylogarithmic time. On the negative side, we establish various runtime lower\nbounds, proving that for other tasks, GRC algorithms (if they exist) are doomed\nto be slow.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
