Here, we provide a criterion for detecting such quantum states\nexhibiting negative Wigner function. Our method relies on evaluating moments of\nthe Wigner function which involves computing simple functionals and can be\nimplemented in a real experiment without the need for full state tomography or\nWigner function reconstruction. We then provide explicit examples to support\nour detection scheme. Further, we propose an experimental method utilizing the\ncontinuous variable SWAP operator to realize these moments in a real\nexperiment.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
