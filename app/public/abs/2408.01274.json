Due to the transfer of the angular momenta between the light\nand the bilayer, optical beams with zero SAM and OAM acquire SAM upon\ntransmission and OAM upon reflection. Our numerical calculations and the\ndeveloped analytical theory show that the values of the emergent SAM and OAM\ndepend differently on the interlayer distance and can be controlled by tuning\nthe twist angle. The predicted phenomena do not require light absorption and\nare caused by the helicity-dependent light diffraction on the moir\\'e pattern,\nwhich inevitably occurs in the twisted structure, and SAM-OAM conversion. We\nalso reveal strong SAM and OAM in the moir\\'e-diffracted beams.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lvsRXrJ9IU2x02Xd5khbAvsTNJZQ9loQSG8LXJ_IxqM","pdfSize":"11160712"}
