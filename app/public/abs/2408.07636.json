One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug\npharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each\nother, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data\nsparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer\nresearch questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and\nhigh-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel\nSMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array\nof PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that\nImagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and\nbivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks. Imagand\nis a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and allows researchers to\nefficiently generate ligand PK data for drug discovery research.
