MOSCITO groups\nthose timesteps of a molecular dynamics trajectory together into clusters in\nwhich the molecule has similar conformations. In contrast to state-of-the-art\nmethods, MOSCITO takes advantage of sequential relationships found in time\nseries data. Unlike existing work, MOSCITO does not need a two-step procedure\nwith tedious post-processing, but directly models essential properties of the\ndata. Interpreting clusters as Markov states allows us to evaluate the\nclustering performance based on the resulting Markov state models. In\nexperiments on 60 trajectories and 4 different proteins, we show that the\nperformance of MOSCITO achieves state-of-the-art performance in a novel\nsingle-step method. Moreover, by modeling temporal aspects, MOSCITO obtains\nbetter segmentation of trajectories, especially for small numbers of clusters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H542Uqk7tT8-XXeE0rwqV0y4dm9Kq41yld_vOfVkXmU","pdfSize":"6359703","txDigest":"FBBLKDpEYtMFzgepcPyJ8MgF1dnemuSAXt5b8snpkTTv","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
