However, these\noutputs can be compromised by system faults and malicious attacks, distorting\ncritical system information needed for secure and reliable operation. In this\npaper, we introduce a novel regret-optimal control framework for designing\ncontrollers that make a linear system robust against stealthy attacks,\nincluding both sensor and actuator attacks. Specifically, we present (a) a\nconvex optimization-based system metric to quantify the regret under the\nworst-case stealthy attack (the difference between actual performance and\noptimal performance with hindsight of the attack), which adapts and improves\nupon the $\\mathcal{H}_2$ and $\\mathcal{H}_{\\infty}$ norms in the presence of\nstealthy adversaries, (b) an optimization problem for minimizing the regret of\n(a) in system-level parameterization, enabling localized and distributed\nimplementation in large-scale systems, and (c) a rank-constrained optimization\nproblem equivalent to the optimization of (b), which can be solved using convex\nrank minimization methods. We also present numerical simulations that\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
