Here we analyze $L$ from four Antarctic NMs during 2015 March\nto 2023 September. We have calibrated $L$ from the South Pole NM with respect\nto a daily spectral index determined from published data of GCR proton fluxes\nduring 2015--2019 from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) aboard the\nInternational Space Station. Our results demonstrate a robust correlation\nbetween the leader fraction and the spectral index fit over the rigidity range\n2.97--16.6 GV for AMS-02 data, with uncertainty 0.018 in the daily spectral\nindex as inferred from $L$. In addition to the 11-year solar activity cycle, a\nwavelet analysis confirms a 27-day periodicity in the GCR flux and spectral\nindex corresponding to solar rotation, especially near sunspot minimum, while\nthe flux occasionally exhibited a strong harmonic at 13.5 days, and that the\nmagnetic field component along a nominal Parker spiral (i.e., the magnetic\nsector structure) is a strong determinant of such spectral and flux variations,\nwith the solar wind speed exerting an additional, nearly rigidity-independent\ninfluence on flux variations. Our investigation affirms the capability of\nground-based NM stations to accurately and continuously monitor cosmic ray\nspectral variations in the long-term future.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
