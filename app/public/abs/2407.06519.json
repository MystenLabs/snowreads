Due to the scarcity of defective samples, unsupervised\nanomaly detection that only leverages normal samples during training to detect\nvarious defects is popular. Existing feature-based methods, utilizing deep\nfeatures from pretrained neural networks, show their impressive performance in\nanomaly localization and the low demand for the sample size for training.\nHowever, the detected anomalous regions of these methods always exhibit\ninaccurate boundaries, which impedes the downstream tasks. This deficiency is\ncaused: (i) The decreased resolution of high-level features compared with the\noriginal image, and (ii) The mixture of adjacent normal and anomalous pixels\nduring feature extraction. To address them, we propose a novel unified\noptimization framework (F2PAD) that leverages the Feature-level information to\nguide the optimization process for Pixel-level Anomaly Detection in the\ninference stage. The proposed framework is universal and plug-and-play, which\ncan enhance various feature-based methods with limited assumptions. Case\nstudies are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of our strategy,\nparticularly when applied to three popular backbone methods: PaDiM, CFLOW-AD,\nand PatchCore.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
