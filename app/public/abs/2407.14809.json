In this paper, we\ncomplete the study of (Leibniz) central extensions, derivations and\nautomorphisms of the Lie algebras formed from the semi-direct sum of the Witt\nalgebra and its indecomposable intermediate series modules (that is, graded\nmodules with one-dimensional graded components). Our techniques exploit the\ninternal grading of the Witt algebra, which can be applied to a wider class of\ngraded Lie algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mD5aUuqWOyRvndGq23xblylBbpplqmj6C3k67VnJm6A","pdfSize":"510209"}
