As input, the algorithm accepts a word (in any given finite generating\nset for the mapping class group) representing a pseudo-Anosov mapping class,\nand the length of the word is our measure of complexity for the input. The\noutput is a train track and an integer matrix where the stretch factor is the\nlargest real eigenvalue and the unstable foliation is given by the\ncorresponding eigenvector. This is the first algorithm to compute stretch\nfactors and measured foliations that is known to terminate in sub-exponential\ntime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
