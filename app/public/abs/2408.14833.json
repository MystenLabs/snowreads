In the waveguide we suppose there is a bounded, penetrable\nand possibly absorbing scatterer. The classical TDG is not applicable to this\nimportant case. Novel features of our modified TDG method are that it is\napplicable when the scatterer is absorbing, and it uses a stable treatment of\nthe asymptotic radiation condition for the scattered field. For the modified\nTDG, we prove $h$ and $p$-convergence in the $L^2$ norm. The theoretical\nresults are verified numerically for a discretization based on plane waves\n(that may be evanescent in the scatterer).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
