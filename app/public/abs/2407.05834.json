This work\nreports a method utilizing a feedforward neural network (FNN) model to\ndecompose the reconstructed measured prompt energy spectrum observed by a\nshort-baseline reactor neutrino experiment and extract the antineutrino spectra\nproduced by the fission of major isotopes such as $^{235}$U, $^{238}$U,\n$^{239}$Pu, and $^{241}$Pu in a nuclear reactor. We present two training\nstrategies for this model and compare them with the traditional $\\chi^2$\nminimization method, analyzing the same set of pseudo-data for a total exposure\nof $(2.9\\times 5\\times 1800)~\\rm{GW_{th}\\cdot tons\\cdot days}$. The results\nshow that the FNN model not only converges faster and better during the fitting\nprocess but also achieves relative errors in the extracted spectra within 1\\%\nin the $2-8$ MeV range, outperforming the $\\chi^2$ minimization method. The\nfeasibility and superiority of this method have been validated in this study.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
