Despite its\nconsiderable success, it overlooks graphical layer information and suffers from\nprohibitively slow training convergence. To tackle this issue, we introduce\nSymPoint-V2, a robust and efficient solution featuring novel, streamlined\ndesigns that overcome these limitations. In particular, we first propose a\nLayer Feature-Enhanced module (LFE) to encode the graphical layer information\ninto the primitive feature, which significantly boosts the performance. We also\ndesign a Position-Guided Training (PGT) method to make it easier to learn,\nwhich accelerates the convergence of the model in the early stages and further\npromotes performance. Extensive experiments show that our model achieves better\nperformance and faster convergence than its predecessor SymPoint on the public\nbenchmark.
