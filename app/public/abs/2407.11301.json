By\npresenting a novel methodology, we detail the original method and show how to\ndefine all properties without having prior knowledge regarding the eigenstates.\nTo this end, we exploit Pennylane and Qiskit platforms resources to analyze\nscenarios where the Hamiltonians are described by the Zeeman model for one and\ntwo spins. We also introduce strategies and techniques to improve the\nalgorithm's performance by adjusting its intrinsic parameters and reducing the\nfluctuations inherent to data distribution. First, we explore the dynamics of a\nsingle qubit on Xanadu simulators to set the parameters that optimize the\nmethod performance and select the best strategies to execute the algorithm. On\nthe sequence, we extend the methodology for bipartite systems to discuss how\nthe algorithm works when degeneracy and entanglement are taken into account.\nFinally, we compare the predictions with the results obtained on a real\nsuperconducting device provided by the IBM Q Experience program, establishing\nthe conditions to increase the protocol efficiency for multi-qubit systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tFEiYEEWqz37momWg1pQWKYAwAgRrxhAv49k3bfN7AE","pdfSize":"1611814"}
