Utilizing the theory of asymptotic expansion of Skorohod integrals\nintroduced by Nualart and Yoshida [NY19], we derive an asymptotic expansion\nformula of the distribution of the estimator. As an corollary, we also obtain a\nmixed central limit theorem for the statistic, indicating that the rate of\nconvergence is $n^{-\\frac12}$, which improves the results in the previous\nliterature. To handle second-order quadratic variations appearing in the\nestimator, a theory of exponent has been developed based on weighted graphs to\nestimate asymptotic orders of norms of functionals involved.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
