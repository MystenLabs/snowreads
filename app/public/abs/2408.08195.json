In\n\\cite{chebolu2022fuchs}, we investigated the following variant of Fuchs'\nproblem, for abelian groups: which groups $G$ are realized by a ring $R$ where\nevery group endomorphism of $G$ is induced by a ring endomorphism of $R$? Such\ngroups are called fully realizable. In this paper, we answer the aforementioned\nquestion for several families of nonabelian groups: symmetric, dihedral,\nquaternion, alternating, and simple groups; almost cyclic $p$-groups; and\ngroups whose Sylow $2$-subgroup is either cyclic or normal and abelian. We\nconstruct three infinite families of fully realizable nonabelian groups using\niterated semidirect products.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
