We propose a method to\ncharacterize papers by embedding them into two distinct \"co-factor\" spaces: one\ndescribing how papers send citations, and the other describing how papers\nreceive citations. This approach presents several challenges. First, older\ndocuments cannot cite newer documents, and thus it is not clear that co-factors\nare even identifiable. We resolve this challenge by developing a co-factor\nmodel for asymmetric adjacency matrices with missing lower triangles and\nshowing that identification is possible. We then frame estimation as a matrix\ncompletion problem and develop a specialized implementation of matrix\ncompletion because prior implementations are memory bound in our setting.\nSimulations show that our estimator has promising finite sample properties, and\nthat naive approaches fail to recover latent co-factor structure. We leverage\nour estimator to investigate 237,794 papers published in statistics journals\nfrom 1898 to 2022, resulting in the most comprehensive topic model of the\nstatistics literature to date. We find interpretable co-factors corresponding\nto many statistical subfields, including time series, variable selection,\nspatial methods, graphical models, GLM(M)s, causal inference, multiple testing,\nquantile regression, resampling, semi-parametrics, dimension reduction, and\nseveral more.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jlmTwgC8Pxmwjfq_KcMgBWKJtN2uNg4VhjHwZzMYsMY","pdfSize":"653362"}
