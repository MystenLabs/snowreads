The resulting equation, $\\SFR = \\eff\\ \\Mcollapsing/\\tauff$,\nalthough it has been presented elsewhere, is interpreted in terms of clouds\nundergoing collapse { rather than being turbulence-supported, an idea that\ndifferent groups have pursued this century}. Under such assumption, one can\nexplain the constancy of $\\eff$, the different intra-cloud correlations\nobserved in Milky Way's molecular clouds, as well as the resolved and\nunresolved extragalactic relationships between SFR and a measurement of the\nmass in CO, HCN, and CO+HI. We also explain why the slope of the correlation\nchanges when the orbital time $\\tauorb$ is considered instead of the free-fall\ntime, and why estimations of the free-fall time from extragalactic observations\nskew the correlation, providing a false sublinear correlation. We furthermore\nshow that the apparent nearly linear correlation between the star formation\nrate and the dynamical equilibrium pressure in the midplane of the galaxies,\n$\\PDE$, is just a consequence of $\\PDE$ values being dominated by the variation\nof the column density of molecular gas. All in all, we argue that the star\nformation law is driven by the collapse of cold, dense gas, which happens to be\nprimarily molecular in the present Universe, and that the role of stellar\nfeedback is just to shut down the star formation process, not to shape the star\nformation law.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
