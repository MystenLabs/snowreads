Inspired by the concept\nof Maxwell's demon, we analyze the heat exchange between a quantum system and a\nthermal environment assisted by a quantum memory. By exploring the fundamental\nlimitations of heat transfer in this scenario, we find that quantum states can\nreveal their non-classical signatures via energy exchange with a thermal\nenvironment. This approach offers a promising alternative to complex,\nsystem-specific measurements, as it relies solely on fixed energy measurements.\nTo demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, we apply it to the detection of\nentanglement in isotropic states and coherence in a two-spin system interacting\nwith a single-mode electromagnetic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XK6lL4ijvcjgi06rcKWwC-sNmJRcjiXQtDgNWZAnrMs","pdfSize":"2024411"}
