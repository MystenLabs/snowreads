We attribute the\ncenter of mass of Wannier functions, called Wannier centers, to each chemical\nbond and create neural network models that predict the Wannier centers for each\nchemical bond. Application to liquid methanol and ethanol shows that our neural\nnetwork models successfully predict the dipole moment of various liquid\nconfigurations in close agreement with DFT calculations. We show that the\ndipole moment and dielectric constant in the liquids are greatly enhanced by\nthe polarization of Wannier centers due to local intermolecular interactions.\nThe calculated dielectric spectra agree well with experiments quantitatively\nover terahertz (THz) to infrared regions. Furthermore, we investigate the\nphysical origin of THz absorption spectra of methanol, confirming the\nimportance of translational and librational motions. Our method is applicable\nto other molecular liquids and can be widely used to study their dielectric\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
