It is\nassumed that the diffusion coefficient is a constant in each layer. The goal is\nto find approximate parameter-to-solution maps that have a small number of\nterms. It is shown that in the case of two layers one can find a solution\nformula consisting of three terms with explicit dependencies on the diffusion\ncoefficient. The formula is based on decomposing the solution into orthogonal\nparts related to both of the layers and the interface between them. This\nformula is then expanded to an approximate one for the multi-layer case. We\ngive an analytical formula for square layers and use the finite element\nformulation for more general layers. The results are illustrated with numerical\nexamples and have applications for reduced basis methods by analyzing the\nKolmogorov n-width.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-AUglxgAKCI-gchXdvWX_xcsR6ojuM21WcGJKKA_p4c","pdfSize":"952698"}
