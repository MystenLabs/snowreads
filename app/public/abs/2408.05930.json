The components of the band structure, missing in previous reports,\nare revealed. Earlier observations, shown to be temperature independent and\ntherefore not correlated with the phase transition, are explained in terms of\nthe increased complexity of the band structure close to the Fermi level. Only\nthe overall size of the Fermi surface is found to be positively correlated with\nthe phase transition at 110 K. These observations, quite distant from the\ncharge density wave scenario commonly considered for 1T-VSe$_2$, bring fresh\nperspectives toward the correct description of structural transitions in\ndichalcogenides materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
