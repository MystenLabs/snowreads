It is well-known that K\\\"ahler-Einstein metrics on $X$ with conic\nsingularities along $D$ may exist only if the angle $2\\pi\\beta$ is bigger than\nsome positive limit value $2\\pi\\beta_*$. Under the hypothesis that the\nautomorphisms of $D$ are induced by the automorphisms of the pair $(X,D)$, we\nprove that for $\\beta>\\beta_*$ close enough to $\\beta_*$, such\nK\\\"ahler-Einstein metrics do exist. We identify the limits at various scales\nwhen $\\beta\\rightarrow\\beta_*$ and, in particular, we exhibit the appearance of\nthe Tian-Yau metric of $X\\setminus D$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
