We prove that the set of parameters\n$t\\in\\Lambda(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}})$, such that $X_t$ is periodic, has bounded\nheight. This generalizes a result of Patrick Ingram. Moreover, if $X$ is\nnon-periodic, then under some mild conditions -- such as when the family is\ndissipative -- we show that there are, in fact, only finitely many periodic\nparameters. This extends a result of Charles Favre and Romain Dujardin.\n  Second, let $X$ be a family of curves. Assuming $X$ is non-degenerate, we\nestablish a uniform bound on the number of periodic points in each curve $X_t$,\n$t\\in \\Lambda(\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}})$ and show that the set of these periodic\npoints have bounded height in $\\Lambda\\times \\mathbb{A}^2$ as well. We then\nexamine in more detail the non-degeneracy property in the case of dissipative\nfamilies of quadratic H\\'enon maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
