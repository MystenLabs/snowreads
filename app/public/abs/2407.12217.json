The performance\namong the lightweight models reaches the state-of-the-art level on ImageNet-1K\nclassification, and improves downstream tasks on object detection and\nsegmentation consistently as well. Our approach also serves as a new tool to\ncompress vision transformers (ViTs).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
