Because they purposively recruit participants, these\nstudies are uniquely able to address a lack of historical representation, an\nissue that has affected many biomedical datasets. In this work, we define\nrepresentativeness as the similarity to a target population distribution of a\nset of attributes and our goal is to mirror the U.S. population across\ndistributions of age, gender, race, and ethnicity. Many participatory studies\nrecruit at several institutions, so we introduce a computational approach to\nadaptively allocate recruitment resources among sites to improve\nrepresentativeness. In simulated recruitment of 10,000-participant cohorts from\nmedical centers in the STAR Clinical Research Network, we show that our\napproach yields a more representative cohort than existing baselines. Thus, we\nhighlight the value of computational modeling in guiding recruitment efforts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
