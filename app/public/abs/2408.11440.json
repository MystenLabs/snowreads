To\nenable a robust evaluation of Hindi ASR systems on multiple accents, we create\na benchmark, LAHAJA, which contains read and extempore speech on a diverse set\nof topics and use cases, with a total of 12.5 hours of Hindi audio, sourced\nfrom 132 speakers spanning 83 districts of India. We evaluate existing\nopen-source and commercial models on LAHAJA and find their performance to be\npoor. We then train models using different datasets and find that our model\ntrained on multilingual data with good speaker diversity outperforms existing\nmodels by a significant margin. We also present a fine-grained analysis which\nshows that the performance declines for speakers from North-East and South\nIndia, especially with content heavy in named entities and specialized\nterminology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
