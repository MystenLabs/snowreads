Recently, we adapted the DP\nframework to the probabilistic setting to prove almost-sure termination (AST)\nvia annotated DPs (ADPs). However, this adaption only handled AST w.r.t. the\ninnermost evaluation strategy. In this paper, we improve the ADP framework to\nprove AST for full rewriting. Moreover, we refine the framework for rewrite\nsequences that start with basic terms containing a single defined function\nsymbol. We implemented and evaluated the new framework in our tool AProVE.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
