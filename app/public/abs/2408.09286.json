Although the fraction of\nCCSNe that harbour such jets is unknown, it remains as an interesting\npossibility that can give rise to the production of high-energy neutrinos. In\nthis work, we focus on the particular case of the recent type II supernova, SN\n2023ixf, the closest of its class in the last decade. We describe the particle\ndistributions of protons, pions, and muons in a putative jet applying a simple\nmodel to account for the relevant interactions, which are synchrotron cooling\nand interactions with the soft photon field in the ambient. After evaluating\nthe produced fluence for different values of the viewing angle $i_{\\rm j}$ with\nrespect to the jet axis, and comparing with the upper bound by IceCube, we\nconclude that the generation of a choked jet in SN 2023ixf can not be ruled\nout. Specifically, for typical jet Lorentz factors of the jet $\\Gamma=100$, the\njet could have been produced with an half-opening angle $\\theta_{\\rm\nop}=0.2\\,{\\rm rad}$ but for a viewing angle $i_{\\rm j}\\gtrsim \\theta_{\\rm op}$,\nno significant Doppler boosting would take place along this direction.\nTherefore, the choked jet scenario in SN 2023ixf still remains compatible with\nobservations provided our line of sight corresponds to an off-axis view of the\njet.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
