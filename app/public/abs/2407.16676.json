Recently, there has been\ngrowing interest in how coupling the self-propulsion of active particles to\nchemical degrees of freedom affects MIPS. Previous studies have shown that\nincorporating chemotaxis and the production or consumption of chemicals by\nactive particles results in various pattern formations, such as arrested phase\nseparation and traveling waves. In this study, we demonstrate that similar\nphenomena can be induced when active particles consume chemicals and exhibit\nchemokinesis, where higher chemical concentrations enhance self-propulsion\nwithout causing alignment with the chemical gradient. We discover that MIPS is\nintensified if chemical consumption is proportional to particle density but is\nsuppressed if chemical consumption is closely tied to particle motion. This\nleads to a wider range of collective behaviors, including arrested phase\nseparation and oscillating patterns. Our findings are based on a hydrodynamic\ntheory derived from a particle-based model via standard methods.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WLIpX_PkKqcJuWI_YuVbEj6WuwlgGKEA7Wt185VZKiw","pdfSize":"18676263","objectId":"0xbc166274adab1d9e3461aae6aa4b1920a5d64f1df25c5ce44fc7a57372e0595b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
