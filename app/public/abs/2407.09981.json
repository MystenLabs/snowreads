A standard theorem says that a left D_X-module M, which is\ncoherent as an O_X-module, is locally free. This theorem has a generalization\nto the adically complete algebraic setting, in a paper by Ogus from 1973.\n  In the present paper we take a new look at the work of Ogus. We provide a\ndetailed proof of the theorem on D-modules, and extend it to the non-noetherian\nsetting. We also give another proof of an interesting result of Ogus about\nadically complete modules (slightly extended).\n  In the Appendix we discuss a related error in a book by Bjork.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
