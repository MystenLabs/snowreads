The acquisition of high-speed data that can resolve the\ncharacteristic high-frequency oscillations of these thruster enables additional\nlevels of classification in these thrusters. Notably, these signals may serve\nas unique indicators for the full state of the system that can aid digital\nrepresentations of thrusters and predictions of thruster dynamics. In this\nwork, a Reservoir Computing framework is explored to build surrogate models\nfrom experimental time-series measurements of a Hall-effect thruster. Such a\nframework has shown immense promise for predicting the behavior of\nlow-dimensional yet chaotic dynamical systems. In particular, the surrogates\ncreated by the Reservoir Computing framework are capable of both predicting the\nobserved behavior of the thruster and estimating the values of certain\nmeasurements from others, known as inference.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4zvMatSPDqRL-_Y_ZM1xDPYK5nZJKTZHNYfnrcxWVJE","pdfSize":"1858679"}
