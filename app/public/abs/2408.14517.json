Additionally, a fundamental\nflaw in the Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) measurement has been\ncorrected. Thus, the determination of the 5f occupation (n) in elemental Pu has\nbeen re-evaluated with the result that n = 5.0 +/- 0.1 for alphaPu and n = 4.9\n+/- 0.2 for deltaPu. These values are significantly lower than the value of\n~5.5 that was propagated earlier.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
