A laser-generated bubble in a water basin undergoes growth,\ncollapse, second growth, and final collapse. Shock waves and liquid jets from\nnon-spherical collapses are influenced by the stand-off ratio ${\\gamma}$,\ndefined as the bubble centroid distance from the wall divided by the bubble\nradius. We detail shock mechanisms, such as tip or torus collapse, for various\n${\\gamma}$ values. High-speed and Schlieren imaging visualize the microjet and\nshock waves. The microjet's evolution is tracked for large ${\\gamma}$, while\nshock waves are captured in composite images showing multiple shock positions.\nQuantitative analyses of the microjet interface, shock wave velocities, and\nimpact times are reported. Wall-mounted sensors and a needle hydrophone measure\npressure and compare with high-speed observations to assess the dominant\ncontributions to pressure changes with ${\\gamma}$, revealing implications for\ncavitation erosion mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YbItU1IeQaFXO_i7wKjDSZOcFmzcrp4XBSRhdxGJmLo","pdfSize":"12222425"}
