The language agent continuously attempts to\nsolve the same task by self-correcting each time the task fails. Our selected\nlanguage agent demonstrates the ability to solve tasks in a text-based game\nenvironment. Our results show that the gemma-2-9b-it language model, using our\nproposed method, can successfully complete two of six tasks that failed in the\nfirst attempt. This highlights the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing\nthe problem-solving capabilities of a single language model through\nself-correction, paving the way for more advanced autonomous agents.
