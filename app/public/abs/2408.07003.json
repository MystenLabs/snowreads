This paper proposes\nto assess the reliability of three LLMs, namely flan, GPT-4o, and GPT-4 mini\nfor topic labelling. Drawing on previous research leveraging BERTopic, we\ngenerate topics from a dataset of all the scientific articles (n=34,797)\nauthored by all biology professors in Switzerland (n=465) between 2008 and\n2020, as recorded in the Web of Science database. We assess the output of the\nthree models both quantitatively and qualitatively and find that, first, both\nGPT models are capable of accurately and precisely label topics from the\nmodels' output keywords. Second, 3-word labels are preferable to grasp the\ncomplexity of research topics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Me0aVvwFLWpf0k0baRfVPUE-9kbr9ncVCWZ_6kP1p54","pdfSize":"380627"}
