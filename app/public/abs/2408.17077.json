The photometric\nobservations were made using standard multiband BVRI filters at an observatory\nin Argentina. We presented a new ephemeris for EL Tuc and a linear fit to the\nO-C diagram, utilizing our extracted times of minima and additional literature.\nWe employed the PHysics Of Eclipsing BinariEs (PHOEBE) Python code and the\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approach for the system's light curve analysis.\nThe target system's light curve solution required a cold starspot on the hotter\ncomponent. We conclude that EL Tuc is a total contact binary system with a low\nmass ratio of q=0.172+_0.002, an orbital inclination of i=83.74+_0.40 degree,\nand a fillout factor of f=53.7+_1.6%. We used the P-a relationship and the Gaia\nData Release 3 (DR3) parallax method to determine the absolute parameters of EL\nTuc to compare the precision of our results. This system was classified as\nW-type based on the mass and effective temperature of the companion stars. The\npositions of the systems were depicted on the M-L, M-R, T-M, and q-L_ratio\ndiagrams. The relationship between the spectroscopic and photometric mass\nratios of binaries was discussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"38CRlNzvPYNQ5IHb1dl5vZM00WfZ81XUkWLdfKRlkVU","pdfSize":"5589936"}
