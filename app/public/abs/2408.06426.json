AmpRed\nimplements the methods of integration by parts and differential equations in\nthe Feynman-parameter representation. It allows for the calculations of general\nparametric integrals (which may not have momentum-space correspondences).\nVarious user-friendly tools for multi-loop calculations, such as those to\nconstruct and solve differential equations for Feynman integrals, are provided.\nIt can also deal with tensor algebras in non-relativistic field theories.\nInterfaces to some packages, like QGRAF and FOMR, are also provided.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p0EVkOomdV8dFd_yOCxvRqj5PIs6yXjwY6lQLuxEZrM","pdfSize":"394580"}
