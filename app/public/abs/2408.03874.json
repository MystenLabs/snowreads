This technique is concentrated on the ability to\nmodel implicit physician conversation styles and note preferences. We also\nintroduce a novel technique for the enrollment of new physicians when a limited\nnumber of clinical notes paired with conversations are available for that\nphysician, without the need to re-train a model to support them. We show that\nour technique outperforms the baseline model by improving the ROUGE-2 score of\nthe History of Present Illness section by 13.8%, the Physical Examination\nsection by 88.6%, and the Assessment & Plan section by 50.8%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
