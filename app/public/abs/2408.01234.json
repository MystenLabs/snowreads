However, in addition to network state information, a\nquantum routing protocol must also take into account the requested entanglement\nfidelity, the probabilistic nature of swapping operations, and the short\nlifetime of entangled states. In this work, we formulate a practical\nentanglement routing problem and analyze and categorize the main approaches to\naddress it, drawing comparisons to, and inspiration from, classical network\nrouting strategies where applicable. We classify and discuss the studied\nquantum routing schemes into reactive, proactive, opportunistic, and virtual\nrouting\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3-lfQOwVF6XUyAbYZdJPEijI36_FPU6sMRKYEZBvuvI","pdfSize":"2859735","txDigest":"HHe3WwmryirSrWzMKwEJtPSDW8mpuUUoRAi7z528hJQw","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
