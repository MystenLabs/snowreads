The key\ncharacteristic of our configuration is the coupling of the ground state spin\nmanifold of size $F_g \\gg 1$ to an excited Zeeman spin manifold of size $F_e =\nF_g - 1$ using light. This coupling results in eigenstates of the driven atom\nthat include exactly two dark states in the ground state manifold, which are\ndecoupled from light and immune to spontaneous emission from the excited\nstates. These dark states constitute the `spin-cat', leading to the designation\n`dark spin-cat'. We demonstrate that under strong Rabi drive and for large\n$F_g$, the `dark spin-cat' is autonomously stabilized against common noise\nsources and encodes a qubit with significantly biased noise. Specifically, the\nbit-flip error rate decreases exponentially with $F_g$ relative to the\ndephasing rate. We provide an analysis of dark spin-cats, their robustness to\nnoise, and discuss bias-preserving single qubit and entangling gates,\nexemplified on a Rydberg tweezer platform.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
