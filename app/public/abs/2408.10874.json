These quantities are related by the\nRiemann-Hurwitz formula, and the Hurwitz existence problem asks whether a\ncombinatorial datum that fits this formula actually corresponds to some $f$. In\nthis paper, using results and techniques related to fiber products of\nholomorphic maps between compact Riemann surfaces, we prove a number of results\nthat enable us to uniformly explain the non-realizability of many previously\nknown non-realizable branch data, and to construct a large amount of new such\ndata. We also deduce from our results the theorem of Halphen, proven in 1880,\nconcerning polynomial solutions of the equation $A(z)^a+B(z)^b=C(z)^c$, where\n$a,b,c$ are integers greater than one.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
