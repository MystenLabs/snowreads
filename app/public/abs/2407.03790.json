However, developers now spend more time\nreviewing code than writing it, highlighting the importance of Code Readability\nfor code comprehension. Our previous research found that existing Code\nReadability models were inaccurate in representing developers' notions and\nrevealed a low consensus among developers, highlighting a need for further\ninvestigations in this field.\n  Building on this, we surveyed 10 Java developers with similar coding\nexperience to evaluate their consensus on Code Readability assessments and\nrelated aspects. We found significant agreement among developers on Code\nReadability evaluations and identified specific code aspects strongly\ncorrelated with Code Readability. Overall, our study sheds light on Code\nReadability within LLM contexts, offering insights into how these models can\nalign with developers' perceptions of Code Readability, enhancing software\ndevelopment in the AI era.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
