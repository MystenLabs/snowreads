Bense looks in cybernetics for scientific\nconcepts and instigates the thought of programming in the field of literature.\nHis information aesthetics influences a whole generation of scientists and\nartists - including the Stuttgart Circle, which takes hold of the new\naesthetics to carry out the first programmed artistic images. Is Max Bense a\nvisionary? How is he revolutionizing the world of images? The article discusses\nthe cybernetics that inspired Bense: a science of probability that contrasts\nwith the principles of Newtonian physics. Moreover, in the sixties, Max Bense,\ntogether with Elisabeth Walther, launched the experimental magazine Rot, which\ndevoted its pages to the concrete poetry and the first computer-generated\nimages of Georg Nees. As Frieder Nake defends through his pioneering work and\ntheory, these images oppose the visible and the computable. This dialectic\nopens to a critical thinking on the algorithmic image in art and science.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/General Literature","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
