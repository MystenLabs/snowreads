More precisely, we find necessary\nconditions on an exponent function $\\pp$ for a fractional maximal operator\n$M_\\alpha$ or a non-degenerate fractional singular integral operator\n$T_\\alpha$, $0 \\leq \\alpha < n$, to satisfy weak $(\\pp,\\qq)$ inequalities or\nstrong $(\\pp,\\qq)$ inequalities, with $\\qq$ being defined pointwise almost\neverywhere by\n  %\n  \\[ \\frac{1}{p(x)} - \\frac{1}{q(x)} = \\frac{\\alpha}{n}. \\]\n  %\n  We first prove preliminary results linking fractional averaging operators and\nthe $K_0^\\alpha$ condition, a qualitative condition on $\\pp$ related to the\nnorms of characteristic functions of cubes, and show some useful implications\nof the $K_0^\\alpha$ condition. We then show that if $M_\\alpha$ satisfies weak\n$(\\pp,\\qq)$ inequalities, then $\\pp \\in K_0^\\alpha(\\R^n)$. We use this to prove\nthat if $M_\\alpha$ satisfies strong $(\\pp,\\qq)$ inequalities, then $p_->1$.\nFinally, we prove a powerful pointwise estimate for $T_\\alpha$ that relates\n$T_\\alpha$ to $M_\\alpha$ along a carefully chosen family of cubes. This allows\nus to prove necessary conditions for fractional singular integral operators\nsimilar to those for fractional maximal operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
