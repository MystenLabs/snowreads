Extending the work of\nStadler and collaborators, this paper focuses on the distribution of branch\nlengths in phylogenetic trees arising under a constant-rate birth-death model.\nWe derive branch length distributions of interior branches with and without\nrandom sampling of individuals of the extant population. We establish that\nbranches connected to the tree leaves and interior branches behave very\ndifferently under sampling: pendant branches get longer as the sampling\nprobability reaches zero, whereas the distribution of interior branches quickly\nreaches an asymptotic state.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
