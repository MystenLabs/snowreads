Is it reasonable to anticipate that,\nin these circumstances, cooperation will emerge? This paper addresses this\nquestion by examining the emergence of cooperative behaviour, in the presence\nof \\textit{noise} (or, under \\textit{selection pressure}), in repeated\nPrisoner's Dilemma games, involving strategies such as \\textit{Tit-for-Tat},\n\\textit{Always Defect}, \\textit{GRIM}, \\textit{Win-Stay, Lose-Shift}, and\nothers. To analyze these games, we employ a numerical Agent-Based Model (ABM)\nand compare it with the analytical Nash Equilibrium Mapping (NEM) technique,\nboth based on the \\textit{1D}-Ising chain. We use \\textit{game magnetization}\nas an indicator of cooperative behaviour. A significant finding is that for\nsome repeated games, a discontinuity in the game magnetization indicates a\n\\textit{first}-order \\textit{selection pressure/noise}-driven phase transition.\nThe phase transition is particular to strategies where players do not severely\npunish a single defection. We also observe that in these particular cases, the\nphase transition critically depends on the number of \\textit{rounds} the game\nis played in the thermodynamic limit. For all five games, we find that both ABM\nand NEM, in conjunction with game magnetization, provide crucial inputs on how\ncooperative behaviour can emerge in an infinite-player repeated Prisoner's\ndilemma game.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Economics/Theoretical Economics","Physics/Computational Physics","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
