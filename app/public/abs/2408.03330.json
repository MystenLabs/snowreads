To this end,\nstatistical methods which describe high-dimensional neural time series in terms\nof low-dimensional latent dynamics have played a fundamental role in\ncharacterizing neural systems. Yet, what constitutes a successful method\ninvolves two opposing criteria: (1) methods should be expressive enough to\ncapture complex nonlinear dynamics, and (2) they should maintain a notion of\ninterpretability often only warranted by simpler linear models. In this paper,\nwe develop an approach that balances these two objectives: the Gaussian Process\nSwitching Linear Dynamical System (gpSLDS). Our method builds on previous work\nmodeling the latent state evolution via a stochastic differential equation\nwhose nonlinear dynamics are described by a Gaussian process (GP-SDEs). We\npropose a novel kernel function which enforces smoothly interpolated locally\nlinear dynamics, and therefore expresses flexible -- yet interpretable --\ndynamics akin to those of recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS).\nOur approach resolves key limitations of the rSLDS such as artifactual\noscillations in dynamics near discrete state boundaries, while also providing\nposterior uncertainty estimates of the dynamics. To fit our models, we leverage\na modified learning objective which improves the estimation accuracy of kernel\nhyperparameters compared to previous GP-SDE fitting approaches. We apply our\nmethod to synthetic data and data recorded in two neuroscience experiments and\ndemonstrate favorable performance in comparison to the rSLDS.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
