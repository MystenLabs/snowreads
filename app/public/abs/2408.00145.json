More recently,\nallowing the formation of local structural symmetry breaking motifs in\notherwise ordinary band theory was shown to lower the total energy while\npredicting insulating gaps when they are observed. An important counter example\nwas recently pointed out whereby the flat band formed in Nb3Cl8 by symmetry\nbreaking is by itself partially occupied, thus failing to account for the\nobserved insulating state. It is shown here that a generalized symmetry\nbreaking involving the cooperative structural and magnetic effects produces in\nmean-field-like density functional theory an energy lowering insulating phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
