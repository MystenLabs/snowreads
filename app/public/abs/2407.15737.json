Only after all jobs are assigned to a given number of\nbags, the actual number of machines is revealed. Subsequently, the jobs need to\nbe assigned to the machines without splitting the bags. This is the stochastic\nversion of a related problem introduced by Stein and Zhong [SODA 2018, TALG\n2020] and it is, for example, motivated by bundling jobs that need to be\nscheduled by data centers. We present two PTASs for the stochastic setting,\ncomputing job-to-bag assignments that (i) minimize the expected maximum machine\nload and (ii) maximize the expected minimum machine load (like in the Santa\nClaus problem), respectively. The former result follows by careful enumeration\ncombined with known PTASs. For the latter result, we introduce an intricate\ndynamic program that we apply to a suitably rounded instance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
