For this purpose, we exploit an equivalent\nfour-field formulation of the equations, introducing the so-called total\npressure and total fluid content as independent variables. We establish\nexistence, uniqueness and stability of the solution. Our stability estimate is\ntwo-sided and robust, meaning that the regularity established for the solution\nmatches the regularity requirements for the data and the involved constants are\nindependent of all material parameters. We prove also that additional\nregularity in space of the data implies, in some cases, corresponding\nadditional regularity in space of the solution. These results are instrumental\nto the design and the analysis of discretizations enjoying accurate stability\nand error estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
