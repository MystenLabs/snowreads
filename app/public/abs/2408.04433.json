We show that\nthe sets of these formal bivariate Laurent series form commutative semirings\nunder the operations of addition and multiplication of formal Laurent series.\nThis result is used to establish the unimodality of sequences involving Gauss\npolynomials and certain refined color partitions. In particular, we solve an\nopen problem posed by Andrews on the unimodality of generalized Gauss\npolynomials and establish an unimodal result for a statistic of plane\npartitions. We also establish many unimodal results for rank statistics in\npartition theory, including the rank statistics of concave and convex\ncompositions studied by Andrews, as well as certain unimodal sequences studied\nby Kim-Lim-Lovejoy. Additionally, we establish the unimodality of the Betti\nnumbers and Gromov-Witten invariants of certain Hilbert schemes of points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
