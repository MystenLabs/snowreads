First, we show the global\nwell-posedness of classical solutions being a sharp small perturbation of\nconstant equilibrium in a critical regularity setting, uniformly with respect\nto the relaxation parameter $\\varepsilon>0$. Then, for all times $t>0$, we\nderive quantitative error estimates at the rate $O(\\varepsilon)$ between the\nrescaled Euler-Maxwell system and the limit drift-diffusion model. To the best\nof our knowledge, this work provides the first global-in-time strong\nconvergence for the relaxation procedure in the case of ill-prepared data.\n  In order to prove our results, we develop a new characterization of the\ndissipation structure for the linearized Euler-Maxwell system with respect to\nthe relaxation parameter $\\varepsilon$. This is done by partitioning the\nfrequency space into three distinct regimes: low, medium and high frequencies,\neach associated with a different behaviour of the solution. Then, in each\nregime, the use of efficient unknowns and Lyapunov functionals based on the\nhypocoercivity theory leads to uniform a priori estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
