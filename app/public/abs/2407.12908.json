If the cloud and the binary are nearly counter-rotating, then the\ncloud survives in its original state until it enters the sensitivity band of\nfuture gravitational wave detectors, such as LISA. In all other cases,\nresonances destroy the cloud, while driving the binary to co-rotate with it and\nits eccentricity close to a fixed point. This opens up the possibility of\ninferring the existence of a new boson from the statistical analysis of a\npopulation of black hole binaries.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
