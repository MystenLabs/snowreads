This strengthens several earlier results. We demonstrate the\ncriterion with diverse examples. We also describe the noncommutative Choquet\nboundary and provide additional counterexamples to Arveson's hyperrigidity\nconjecture following the counterexample recently found by the author and Adam\nDor-On.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
