However, existing CNN approaches are\ngenerally repurposed semantic segmentation architectures and suffer from the\npoor delineation of long and curved regions. Lack of overall road topology and\nstructure information further deteriorates their performance on challenging\nremote sensing images. This paper presents a novel multi-task graph neural\nnetwork (GNN) which simultaneously detects both road regions and road borders;\nthe inter-play between these two tasks unlocks superior performance from two\nperspectives: (1) the hierarchically detected road borders enable the network\nto capture and encode holistic road structure to enhance road connectivity (2)\nidentifying the intrinsic correlation of semantic landcover regions mitigates\nthe difficulty in recognizing roads cluttered by regions with similar\nappearance. Experiments on challenging dataset demonstrate that the proposed\narchitecture can improve the road border delineation and road extraction\naccuracy compared with the existing methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
