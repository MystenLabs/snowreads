The SCOPF\nformulation tackles system security operational planning by using short- and\nlong-term post-contingency limits, probability of branch outages, and\npreventive and corrective actions, a probabilistic corrective-SCOPF problem\nformulation. Using two post-contingency states and contingency probabilities,\nthe SCOPF could provide good system security at a lower cost than only\npreventive actions as the typical `N-1'-formulation does. Additional security\nis ensured using a post-contingency load-shedding limit constraint based on\nsystem operator policy. The proposed methodology is applied to a range of test\nsystems containing up to 10,000 buses with a computational time of up to 3375 s\nfor all 12,706 branch contingencies. Calculating contingency power flows takes\n1.3% of the total solution time using the proposed methodology exploiting the\ninverse matrix modification lemma.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
