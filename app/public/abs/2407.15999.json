We propose a novel deep\nlearning framework named EfficientCD, specifically designed for remote sensing\nimage change detection. The framework employs EfficientNet as its backbone\nnetwork for feature extraction. To enhance the information exchange between\nbi-temporal image feature maps, we have designed a new Feature Pyramid Network\nmodule targeted at remote sensing change detection, named ChangeFPN.\nAdditionally, to make full use of the multi-level feature maps in the decoding\nstage, we have developed a layer-by-layer feature upsampling module combined\nwith Euclidean distance to improve feature fusion and reconstruction during the\ndecoding stage. The EfficientCD has been experimentally validated on four\nremote sensing datasets: LEVIR-CD, SYSU-CD, CLCD, and WHUCD. The experimental\nresults demonstrate that EfficientCD exhibits outstanding performance in change\ndetection accuracy. The code and pretrained models will be released at\nhttps://github.com/dyzy41/mmrscd.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
