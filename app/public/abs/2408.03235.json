These transitions, mediated by\nflavour-changing neutral currents, are highly sensitive to small NP effects due\nto their suppression in the SM. While direct searches at colliders have not yet\nled to NP discoveries, indirect probes through semi-leptonic decays have\nrevealed anomalies in observables such as the branching fraction $\\mathcal{B}(B\n\\to K \\mu \\mu)$ and the angular observable $P_5'(B \\to K^* \\mu \\mu)$. In order\nto assess the observed tensions, it is essential to ensure an accurate SM\nprediction. In this review, we examine the theoretical basis of the $B \\to\nK^{(*)} \\ell \\ell$ decays, addressing in particular key uncertainties arising\nfrom local and non-local form factors. We also discuss the impact of QED\ncorrections to the Wilson coefficients, as well as the effect of CKM matrix\nelements on the predictions and the tension with the experimental measurements.\nWe discuss the most recent results, highlighting ongoing efforts to refine\npredictions and to constrain potential signs of NP in these critical decay\nprocesses.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
