In recent times, LLMs have surged in popularity for forecasting due\nto their ability to capture intricate patterns in data and quickly adapt across\nvery different domains. However, their effectiveness in forecasting\nmacroeconomic time series data compared to conventional methods remains an area\nof interest. To address this, we conduct a rigorous evaluation of LLMs against\ntraditional macro forecasting methods, using as common ground the FRED-MD\ndatabase. Our findings provide valuable insights into the strengths and\nlimitations of LLMs in forecasting macroeconomic time series, shedding light on\ntheir applicability in real-world scenarios\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
