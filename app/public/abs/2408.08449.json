However, in practice, MIR cuts are\nseparated heuristically rather than using optimization as the latter is\nprohibitively expensive. We present a hybrid cut generation framework in which\nwe train a Machine Learning (ML) model to inform cut generation for a family of\nsimilar instances. Our framework solves a MIP-based separation problem to\ngenerate high-quality MIR cuts, then learns to identify useful constraints that\nled to these effective cuts. At test time, the predictions of the ML model\nallow us to solve a reduced MIP-based separation problem. We present\ncomputational results for this approach on datasets of randomly perturbed\nMIPLIB2017 instances.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"71pGz89FESB3XNuLRV4WzVQVrvMtXtUyuGngBLuWHvM","pdfSize":"870538"}
