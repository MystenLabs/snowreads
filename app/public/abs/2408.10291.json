If machine\nlearning is meant to serve science ahead of vested business interests, a\nparadigm shift is needed: from more weights and little insight to more insight\nand less weights.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
