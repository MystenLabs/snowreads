Here we show that inclusion of states of finite\nmomentum by the Generator Coordinate Method (GCM) considerably extends the\nrange of energies at which GCM-based Hamiltonians could reproduce the\nSchr\\\"odinger treatment. The transmission probabilities for crossing the\nbarrier are calculated by a discrete version of Kohn's variational method,\nwhich may also be useful for other systems of interacting fermions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Cun_GYpyEK6OTPkBaV0eXXZQH-VypHcAXu_37gghSVw","pdfSize":"544570"}
