However, achieving good\ncompositional control in nanoalloy catalysts remains a formidable challenge. In\nthis work, we demonstrate that heat treatment can be used to tune the\ncomposition of Pt-Zn nanoalloy catalysts, leveraging the volatile nature of\nzinc to enhance their performance in propane dehydrogenation. Through identical\nlocation (scanning) transmission electron microscopy (IL-(S)TEM) using an\nin-situ EM gas cell, as well as other complementary techniques, we observed\nthat the zinc content of the Pt-Zn nanoalloy particles decreased over time of\nthe heat treatment under hydrogen. The rate of change depends on the original\ncomposition of the particles, as well as the heat treatment conditions such as\ntemperature and flow rate. Our experimental results and theoretical\ncalculations suggest that Zn in the intermetallic phase might be more stable,\nproviding an opportunity for precise tuning the nanoparticle compositions. This\napproach presents a viable strategy for developing better Pt-Zn catalysts for\npropane dehydrogenation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wV4UqtmV9Fc5wK1fQBDRfAU7btrUSNiaT-6Q_yV3_2k","pdfSize":"7090898"}
