We\nestablish a package of tools for calculations with these structures, such as\nfunctoriality statements, projective bundle formulae, Gysin sequences and\nTorelli properties. We show that for varieties with trivial A-hat class, the\ncorresponding period maps for families can be written as exponential maps for\nbundles of tori, which we call the \"quantum parameters\". As justification for\nthe terminology, we show that in many interesting examples, the quantum\nparameters of a Poisson variety coincide with the parameters appearing in its\nknown deformation quantizations. In particular, we give a detailed\nimplementation of an argument of Kontsevich, to prove that his canonical\nquantization formula, when applied to Poisson tori, yields noncommutative tori\nwith parameter \"$q = e^\\hbar$\".\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
