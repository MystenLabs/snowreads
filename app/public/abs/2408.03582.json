While conventional flow shops assume that\neach job traverses the shop only once, many industrial environments require\njobs to pass through the shop multiple times before completion. This means that\nafter traversing the shop and completing its processing on the last machine, a\njob must return to the first machine and traverse the shop again until it has\ncompleted all its required loops. Such a setting, referred to as a flow shop\nwith reentry, has numerous applications in industry, e.g., semiconductor\nmanufacturing. The planning problem is to schedule all loops of all jobs while\nminimizing the total (weighted) completion time. In this paper, we consider\nreentrant flow shops with unit processing times. We propose the Least Remaining\nLoops First (LRL) priority rule and show that it minimizes the total completion\ntime. Furthermore, we analyze the complexity of minimizing the total weighted\ncompletion time when the jobs have different weights. We show that this problem\nis NP-hard in the ordinary sense and provide a pseudo-polynomial time\nalgorithm. Additionally, we propose the Weighted Least Remaining Loops First\n(WLRL) priority rule and show that it has a worst-case performance ratio of\nabout 1.2.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
