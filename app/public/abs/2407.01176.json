Empirical data and related work\nimplies that previous airdrops fall short of their stated aim of attracting\nlong-term users, partially due to adversarial farmers who game airdrop\nmechanisms and receive an outsize share of rewards. In this work, we argue that\ngiven the futility of fighting farmers, the airdrop business model should be\nreconsidered: farmers should be harnessed to generate activity that attracts\nreal users, i.e., strengthens network effects. To understand the impact of\nfarmers on airdrops, we analyze their performance in a market inhabited by two\ncompeting platforms and two tiers of users: real users and farmers. We show\nthat counterintuitively, farmers sometimes represent a necessary evil-it can be\nrevenue-optimal for airdrop issuers to give some tokens to farmers, even in the\nhypothetical case where platforms could costlessly detect and banish all\nfarmers. Although we focus on airdrops, our results generally apply to\nactivity-based incentive schemes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QMeXrCRr0uiUCvFv-Vi4a2Ym446sDN7y7fYgEdLzUBE","pdfSize":"995732","objectId":"0x8f4311dc39a724c2d3683dc3eb8dd616e6724e50755a9b7752d9d945d4acdc62","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
