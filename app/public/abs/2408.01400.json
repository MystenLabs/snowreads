To address this, we utilize\nreduced fidelity susceptibility (RFS) vector field to construct phase diagrams\nof various quantum systems and then demonstrate its efficacy in reproducing the\nphase diagrams of established models with known order parameter. To this end,\nwe propose a new method for discovering the necessary order parameters for a\ngiven quantum model and illustrate its capability by identifying a suitable\norder parameter for the Axial Next Nearest Neighbour Interaction (ANNNI) Model.\nOur analysis, which includes decomposing the observable into its\neigen-projectors alongside the finite-size scaling, confirms that our method\nsuccessfully can determine order parameters and thus its capable of\ncharacterizing quantum phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"aQydFHTrDkQUZXGgK49mpcpZxABoGVv8saatDMkZr2I","pdfSize":"2460728","txDigest":"9f6nrJKxQc7zDehS2ESJPwTHgKp9CdxvQdHhMDnoNXpi","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
