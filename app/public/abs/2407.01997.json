We use the Monte-Carlo Glauber model to determine the parameters of\nthe quark-gluon plasma fireball in $pA$ jet events. Our calculations show that\nthe jet quenching effect for $I_{pA}$ turns out to be rather small. We have\nfound that the theoretical $I_{pA}$ as a function of the underlying event\ncharged multiplicity density, within errors, agrees with data from ALICE for\n5.02 TeV $p$+Pb collisions. However, the experimental errors are too large to\ndraw a firm conclusion on the possible presence of jet quenching.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
