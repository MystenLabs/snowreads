We propose a new capability for maritime medical evacuation, which\ninvolves co-opting underway watercraft as overwater ambulance exchange points\nto transfer patients between medical evacuation aircraft. We partner with the\nUnited States Army's 25th Combat Aviation Brigade to demonstrate the use of an\nArmy watercraft as an overwater ambulance exchange point. A manikin is\ntransferred between two HH-60 Medical Evacuation Black Hawk helicopters\nconducting hoist operations over Army Logistics Support Vessel 3, which is\ntraveling south of Honolulu, Hawaii. The demonstration is enabled by a decision\nsupport system for dispatching aircraft, hoist stabilization technology,\ncommercial satellite internet, military geospatial infrastructure applications,\nand digital medical documentation tools, the benefits of which are all\ndiscussed. Three extensions of the overwater ambulance exchange point are\nintroduced and civilian applications are considered.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
