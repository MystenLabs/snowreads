Using set theory and analysis, we\nformulate mathematically rigorous definitions of language models, and introduce\nthe concept of the moduli space of distributions for a language model. We\nformulate a generalized distributional hypothesis using functional analysis and\ntopology. We define the entropy function associated with a language model and\nshow how it allows us to understand many interesting phenomena in languages. We\nargue that the zero points of the entropy function and the points where the\nentropy is close to 0 are the key obstacles for an LLM to approximate an\nintelligent language model, which explains why good LLMs need billions of\nparameters. Using the entropy function, we formulate a conjecture about AGI.\n  Then, we show how thermodynamics gives us an immediate interpretation to\nlanguage models. In particular we will define the concepts of partition\nfunction, internal energy and free energy for a language model, which offer\ninsights into how language models work. Based on these results, we introduce a\ngeneral concept of the geometrization of language models and define what is\ncalled the Boltzmann manifold. While the current LLMs are the special cases of\nthe Boltzmann manifold.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
