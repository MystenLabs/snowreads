Using density functional theory\n(DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF)- based first-principles\ncalculations, we examine the structural, electronic, and quantum transport\nproperties of Au-contacted, metal-doped MoS2. Our results indicate that Cd, Re,\nand Ru dopants significantly improve the structural stability and electronic\nproperties of MoS2. Specifically, formation energy calculations show that Cd\nand Re are stable at hollow sites, while Ru prefers bond sites. Remarkably,\nAu-Ru-MoS2-based device exhibits tunnel resistance (RT ) up to 4.82 ohm-um.\nFurthermore, a dual-gated Au-Ru-MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) demonstrates\nan impressive Ion/Ioff ratio of 10^8 at Vgs of 2 V, highlighting its potential\nfor nano-switching applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cn76V9Lv53hkdkaRMAg6kjU1uLCsYsLEHFILGa5a-0Y","pdfSize":"11378779"}
