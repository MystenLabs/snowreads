Allard","authorsParsed":[["Allard","William K.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2024 19:29:12 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-10","timestamp":1720466952000,"abstract":"  The paper referred to in the title is Allard/Almgren 1981 [AA81]. Several\nmonths ago Francesco Maggi emailed me saying that the inequalities 5.3(4),(5)\nof \\cite{AA81} were wrong. In fact, as he pointed out, their incorrectness is\nimmediately apparent if one takes $Z=0$ there. Maggi and his coauthor wanted to\nuse these inequalities in their paper \\cite{MN}. They were able to obtain a\nversion of these inequalities which suffice for the carrying out the work in\n\\cite{MN}. I started writing this paper in order to provide a version of these\ninequalities as needed in [AA81]. In thinking about this material I began to\nrealize there were other problems with the paper. As a result I ended up {\\em\ncompletely rewriting 5.1-5.4 on pages 243-248 of \\cite{AA81}}; this rewrite is\nthe contents of this paper. In addition to many annoying misprints many of the\nneeded definitions and proofs in 5.1-5.4 are incomplete or absent. For example,\nit is not said where $z$ in 5.1(2) comes from; this omission completely\nsurprised me since I remember doing a lot of work to come up with $z$ when\n\\cite{AA81} was being written. Also, much of the necessary material about the\nreach of a submanifold as in \\cite{FE2} is not provided in \\cite{AA81}. The\ntable of contents can serve as an index. In particular one sees there where the\nconstants $\\epsilon_1$ through $\\epsilon_6$ are introduced. This material is\nextremely technical. One way to navigate this paper would be to start looking\nat Proposition 9.5 and work backwards.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
