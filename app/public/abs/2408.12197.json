Rev. B 17 174111 (2022)] has hypothesized the assembly,\nalong a specific type of one-dimensional defects of diamond, of chains of\nnitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers, potentially enabling the creation of qubit\nregisters via their dipole-coupled electron spins. Here we investigate the\nconnectivity of chains of up to ten coupled spins, mediated by the bi- and\nmultipartite entanglement of their eigenstates. Rather conveniently, for\nregularly spaced spins the vast majority of the eigenstates displays strong\nconnectivity, especially towards the center of the spectrum and for longer\nchains. Furthermore, positional disorder can change, and possibly reduce, the\nconnectivity of the register, but seldom suppresses it.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
