The $B$\nsuper commuting graph on $G$ is a graph whose vertex set is $G$ and two\ndistinct vertices $g$ and $h$ are adjacent if either $[g] = [h]$ or there exist\n$g' \\in [g]$ and $h' \\in [h]$ such that $g'$ commutes with $h'$, where $[g]$ is\nthe $B$-equivalence class of $g \\in G$. Considering $B$ as the equality,\nconjugacy and same order relations on $G$, in this article, we discuss the\ngraph structures of equality/conjugacy/order super commuting graphs of certain\nwell-known families of non-abelian groups viz. dihedral groups, dicyclic\ngroups, semidihedral groups, quasidihedral groups, the groups $U_{6n}, V_{8n},\nM_{2mn}$ etc. Further, we compute the Zagreb indices of these graphs and show\nthat they satisfy Hansen-Vuki{\\v{c}}evi{\\'c} conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
