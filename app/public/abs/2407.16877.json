Herein, we propose a deep\nreinforcement learning based distributed RA scheme, entitled Neural\nNetwork-Based Bandit (NNBB), for the IIoT alarm scenario. In such a scenario,\nthe devices may detect a common critical event, and the goal is to ensure the\nalarm information is delivered successfully from at least one device. The\nproposed NNBB scheme is implemented at each device, where it trains itself\nonline and establishes implicit inter-device coordination to achieve the common\ngoal. Devices can transmit simultaneously on multiple orthogonal channels and\neach possible transmission pattern constitutes a possible action for the NNBB,\nwhich uses a deep neural network to determine the action. Our simulation\nresults show that as the number of devices in the network increases, so does\nthe performance gain of the NNBB compared to the Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) RA\nbenchmark. For instance, NNBB experiences a 7% success rate drop when there are\nfour channels and the number of devices increases from 10 to 60, while MAB\nfaces a 25% drop.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
