However, the scaling $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation well-calibrated with the\nlower-redshift HIIGs is unfitted for the higher-redshift HIIGs. To solve this\nproblem, we explore new relational expression for the $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation\nwhich should be suitable for both lower-redshift and higher-redshift HIIGs.\nAfter reconstructing the Hubble diagram with the Gaussian process (GP) method\nfrom the Pantheon+ supernovae Ia sample, we examine and compare six different\nrevised formulas of $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation. Furthermore, we use the Bayesian\nevidence to compare the revised $L$ - $\\sigma$ relations with the analysis of a\njoint sample of 36 giant extragalactic HII regions (GEHRs) and 145 HIIGs. It\nturns out that the redshift-dependent bilinear correction and the quadratic\n$\\sigma$ based correction are significantly better than the others. Moreover, a\nquadratic $\\sigma$ based correction is the most supported one. It suggests that\nthe appropriate corrections to the $L$ - $\\sigma$ relation should be considered\nwhen the HIIGs are used as a kind of cosmological probes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
