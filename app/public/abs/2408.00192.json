One way to construct these structures is to construct\nbranched DNA molecules that bond to each other at complementary cohesive ends.\nOne practical question is: given a target nanostructure, what is the optimal\nset of DNA molecules that assemble such a structure? We use a flexible-tile\ngraph theoretic model to develop several algorithmic approaches, including a\ninteger programming approach. These approaches take a target undirected graph\nas an input and output an optimal collection of component building blocks to\nconstruct the desired structure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i6V0a0M385ATdh9lnzdtX8983gGVQnrZwTpN0cAXjZs","pdfSize":"2440561","txDigest":"3V3kM6hPy7SKoHFLL15QLHcoFSroNmCh8V1RWjKfnLUc","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
