We give a comprehensive proof of the\nmultiplicative chaos convergence for the characteristic polynomial and\neigenvalue counting function of the circular beta-ensembles throughout the\nsubcritical phase, including negative powers. This generalizes recent results\nin the unitary case, [NSW20,BF22], to any beta>0 and for the eigenvalue\ncounting field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
