We prove that two quotient categories of\nextriangu?lated categories induced by selforthogonal subcategories are\nequivalent to module categories by restriction of two functors E and Hom,\nrespectively. Moreover, if the selforthogonal sub?category is contravariantly\nfinite, then one of the two quotient categories is abelian. This result can be\nregarded as a generalization of Demonet-Liu and Zhou-Zhu.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"4Zi3oqzL-CLl9uAjLCQs9hO26ltFSbHlCYYM1U_uBvE","pdfSize":"196752"}
