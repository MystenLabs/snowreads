Our\ninvestigation yields three key findings. Firstly, we observe a significant\nshift towards smaller Bjorken scale $x$ in the peak position of the valence\nquark distribution for hadrons with an increasing number of valence quarks,\nconsistent with previous results by Kawamura and Kumano. Secondly, assuming\nthat the $Z_c(3900)$ initially consists of four valence quarks, we employ MEM\nto determine its initial valence quark distribution, estimating a radius of\n$r_c=1.276$ fm at an extremely low resolution scale $Q^2$. Furthermore, we\nidentify a notable discrepancy between our computed charge form factor $G_c(q)$\nat leading order and the outcomes of hadron molecular state calculations. We\npropose that this form factor can be extracted from the QCD counting rule\ncross-section, which is grounded in Generalized Distribution Amplitudes (GDA)\nlinked to the multi-quark states.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
