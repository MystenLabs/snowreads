The cavity frequency at 13.053 GHz is in resonance with the\n$67S_{1/2} \\rightarrow 66P_{3/2}$ transition, inducing a ladder multiphoton\nmicrowave Rydberg absorption and emission. The observed spectra are modeled\nwith an extended Jaynes-Cumming formalism that accounts for multiphoton\nabsorption from and emission into the cavity, the loss from the trap due to\nRydberg excitation, and cavity imperfection. We calculate the average photons\nin each spectral feature and find evidence for fractional photon emission into\nthe cavity modes. The microwave cavity Rydberg spectroscopy in this work should\ninform the application and technology development of Rydberg based sensors and\nhybrid Rydberg atom-superconducting resonator quantum gates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
