Existing distortion correction solutions\noften struggle to balance computational complexity and accuracy. In this work,\nwe propose an Adaptive Temporal Interval-based Continuous-Time LiDAR-only\nOdometry, utilizing straightforward and efficient linear interpolation. Our\nmethod flexibly adjusts the temporal intervals between control nodes according\nto the dynamics of motion and environmental characteristics. This adaptability\nenhances performance across various motion states and improves robustness in\nchallenging, feature-sparse environments. We validate the effectiveness of our\nmethod on multiple datasets across different platforms, achieving accuracy\ncomparable to state-of-the-art LiDAR-only odometry methods. Notably, in\nscenarios involving aggressive motion and sparse features, our method\noutperforms existing solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"8gtxeDQaZLXy3ThpCRBPmV_Xa5HCG8QSJKjLQmwVZsQ","pdfSize":"9815527","objectId":"0xe9f89d57e049bfc2fd683fba64b169b4e95e0a295c88b48e5c472d7a9cf85601","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
