This paper proposes\na novel adaptive ensemble learning framework for highly accurate customer churn\nprediction. The framework integrates multiple base models, including XGBoost,\nLightGBM, LSTM, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, and Support\nVector Machine (SVM). These models are strategically combined using a stacking\nensemble method, further enhanced by meta-feature generation from base model\npredictions. A rigorous data preprocessing pipeline, coupled with a\nmulti-faceted feature engineering approach, optimizes model performance. The\nframework is evaluated on three publicly available telecom churn datasets,\ndemonstrating substantial accuracy improvements over state-of-the-art\ntechniques. The research achieves a remarkable 99.28% accuracy, signifying a\nmajor advancement in churn prediction.The implications of this research for\ndeveloping proactive customer retention strategies withinthe telecommunications\nindustry are discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
