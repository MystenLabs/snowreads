In analog to magic angle, here we\ndemonstrate the new concept of magic-strain in graphene systems by judiciously\ntailoring mechanical relaxation (stretch and compression) which is easier to\nimplement in practice. We elucidate the interplay of strain-induced effects and\ndelve into the resulting unconventional superconductivity or\nsemimetal-insulator transition in relaxation-strained graphene, going beyond\nthe traditional twisting approach. Our findings reveal how relaxation strain\ncan trigger superconducting transitions (with an ultra-flat band at the Fermi\nlevel) or the semimetal-insulator transition (with a gap opening at the $K$\npoint of $0.39\\rm{~eV}$) in both monolayer and bilayer graphene. These\ndiscoveries open up a new branch for correlated phenomena and provide deeper\ninsights into the underlying physics of superconductors, which positions\ngraphene as a highly tunable platform for novel electronic applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
