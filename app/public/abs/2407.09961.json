This paper aims to explore the potential influence of the\npinning point's distribution on the memorylessness and stochastic dynamics of\nthe bridge process. We introduce L\\'evy bridges with random length and random\npinning points and analyze their Markov property. Our study demonstrates that\nthe Markov property of L\\'evy bridges depends on the nature of the distribution\nof their pinning points. The law of any random variables can be decomposed into\nsingular continuous, discrete, and absolutely continuous parts with respect to\nthe Lebesgue measure (Lebesgue's decomposition theorem). We show that the\nMarkov property holds when the pinning points' law does not have an absolutely\ncontinuous part. Conversely, the L\\'evy bridge fails to exhibit Markovian\nbehavior when the pinning point has an absolutely continuous part.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
