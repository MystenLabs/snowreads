The oscillating currents\nthen generate an AC component through which the GW can be detected - thus\nforming a resonant mass detector or a Magnetic Weber Bar. We quantify this\nclaim and demonstrate that magnets can have exceptional sensitivity to GWs over\na frequency range demarcated by the mechanical and electromagnetic resonant\nfrequencies of the system; indeed, we outline why a magnetic readout strategy\ncan be considered an optimal Weber bar design. The concept is applicable to a\nbroad class of magnets, but can be particularly well exploited by the powerful\nmagnets being deployed in search of axion dark matter, for example by DMRadio\nand ADMX-EFR. Explicitly, we demonstrate that the MRI magnet that is being\ndeployed for ADMX-EFR can achieve a broadband GW strain sensitivity of\n$\\sim$$10^{-20}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ from a few kHz to about 10 MHz, with a peak\nsensitivity down to $\\sim$$10^{-22}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$ at a kHz exploiting a\nmechanical resonance.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
