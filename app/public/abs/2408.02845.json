Graph-based deep learning\nintegration models, despite their promise, struggle with small patient cohorts\nand high-dimensional features, often applying independent feature selection\nwithout modeling relationships among omics. Furthermore, conventional\ngraph-based omics models focus on homogeneous graphs, lacking multiple types of\nnodes and edges to capture diverse structures. We introduce a Heterogeneous\nGraph ATtention network for omics integration (HeteroGATomics) to improve\ncancer diagnosis. HeteroGATomics performs joint feature selection through a\nmulti-agent system, creating dedicated networks of feature and patient\nsimilarity for each omic modality. These networks are then combined into one\nheterogeneous graph for learning holistic omic-specific representations and\nintegrating predictions across modalities. Experiments on three cancer\nmultiomics datasets demonstrate HeteroGATomics' superior performance in cancer\ndiagnosis. Moreover, HeteroGATomics enhances interpretability by identifying\nimportant biomarkers contributing to the diagnosis outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
