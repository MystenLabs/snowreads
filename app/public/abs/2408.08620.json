Human natural\nmotor action shows stochastic behavior, which has so far not been respected in\nHMI control designs. Using a previously presented novel\nhuman-variability-respecting optimal controller we present a study design which\nallows the investigation of respecting human natural variability and its effect\non human interaction experience. Our approach is tested in simulation based on\nan identified real human subject and presents a promising approach to be used\nfor a larger subject study.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
