We consider simple mass-spring chains whose stiffness is\nperiodically modulated in time. Using the temporal Floquet theory, the system\nis characterized by linear algebraic equations in terms of Fourier\ncoefficients. This allows us to employ a standard linear eigenvalue analysis.\nUnlike non-modulated linear systems, the time modulation makes the coefficient\nmatrix non-Hermitian, which gives rise to, for example, parametric resonance,\nnon-reciprocal wave transmission, and non-Hermitian skin effects. In\nparticular, we study finite-length chains consisting of spatially periodic\nmass-spring units and show that the standard Bloch band theory is not valid for\nestimating their eigenvalue distribution. To remedy this, we propose a\nnon-Bloch band theory based on a generalized Brillouin zone. The proposed\ntheory is verified by some numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
