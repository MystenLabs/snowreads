Using two\nexperimentally determined mass-squared differences (MSDs), $\\Delta_a$ and\n$\\Delta_b$, three neutrino masses are predicted.\n  In the CPVSM, when $\\bf C$ = 0, or equivalently $\\gamma$ = 0, two of the\nthree mass eigenvalues within a fermion type become degenerate. This suggests\nthat the splitting of these masses may have resulted from a symmetry-breaking\nevent in the early universe.\n  The study explores all six possible correspondences between the\nexperimentally observed $\\Delta_a$ and $\\Delta_b$ and three quantities\n$\\Delta_{hl}$, $\\Delta_{ml}$, and $\\Delta_{hm}$. Of these six scenarios, four\nprovide reasonable predictions for the neutrino masses, while two are logically\nexcluded. The model predicts similar values for the heaviest neutrino mass,\n$m_h \\approx 5.0 \\cdot 10^{-2}$ eV, and the lightest mass, $m_l \\approx 6.091\n\\cdot 10^{-3}$ eV. However, it offers two possible values for the middle mass:\n$m_m \\approx 4.973 \\cdot 10^{-2}$ eV or $m_m \\approx 1.055 \\cdot 10^{-2}$ eV.\nAdditionally, CP violation in the lepton sector is predicted to be about 73\norders of magnitude weaker than that in the quark sector.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
