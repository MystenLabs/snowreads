Several previous works have demonstrated that\ngenerative control methods based on diffusion models have significant\nadvantages for solving these problems. However, existing generative control\nmethods face challenges in handling closed-loop control, which is an inherent\nconstraint for effective control of complex physical systems. In this paper, we\npropose a Closed-Loop Diffusion method for Physical systems Control\n(CL-DiffPhyCon). By adopting an asynchronous denoising schedule for different\ntime steps, CL-DiffPhyCon generates control signals conditioned on real-time\nfeedback from the environment. Thus, CL-DiffPhyCon is able to speed up\ndiffusion control methods in a closed-loop framework. We evaluate CL-DiffPhyCon\non the 1D Burgers' equation control and 2D incompressible fluid control tasks.\nThe results demonstrate that CL-DiffPhyCon achieves notable control performance\nwith significant sampling acceleration.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iD7I6jCrYk7TPjUIMkqfdvYlXnMXIVHryS0qRPbFe84","pdfSize":"2012826"}
