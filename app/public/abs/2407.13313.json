In this paper, we show that certain characteristics of datasets, such as\nvarsortability (Reisach et al. 2021) and $R^2$-sortability (Reisach et al.\n2023), also occur in datasets for autocorrelated stationary time series. We\nillustrate this empirically using four types of data: simulated data based on\nSVAR models and Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs, the data used in the 2019\ncausality-for-climate challenge (Runge et al. 2019), real-world river stream\ndatasets, and real-world data generated by the Causal Chamber of (Gamella et\nal. 2024). To do this, we adapt var- and $R^2$-sortability to time series data.\nWe also investigate the extent to which the performance of score-based causal\ndiscovery methods goes hand in hand with high sortability. Arguably, our most\nsurprising finding is that the investigated real-world datasets exhibit high\nvarsortability and low $R^2$-sortability indicating that scales may carry a\nsignificant amount of causal information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
