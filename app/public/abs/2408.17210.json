Meanwhile, theory and simulations have suggested ion clustering to\nbe the possible origin of this behaviour. The popular Restricted Primitive\nModel of electrolyte solutions, in which the solvent is represented by a\nuniform relative dielectric screening factor, $\\varepsilon_r$, is unable to\nresolve the anomalous underscreening observed in experiments. In this work, we\nmodify the Restricted Primitive Model to account for local dielectric\nsaturation within the ion hydration shell. The dielectric screening factor in\nour model locally decreases from the bulk value to a lower saturated value at\nthe ionic surface. The parameters for the model are deduced so that typical\nsalt solubilities are obtained. Our simulations for both bulk and slit\ngeometries show that our model displays strong cluster formation and these give\nrise to long-ranged interactions between charged surfaces at distances similar\nto what has been observed in SFA measurements. An electrolyte model wherein the\ndielectric screening factor remains uniform does not display similar clusters,\neven with unreasonably low values of $\\varepsilon_r$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
