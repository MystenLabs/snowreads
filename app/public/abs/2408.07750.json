One famous example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where the subsystem\nsymmetry is restored faster under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric\ninitial state. The quantum Mpemba effect has been extensively studied in\nintegrable and chaotic systems. In this Letter, we investigate symmetry\nrestoration and quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems with\nvarious initial states. We reveal that the symmetry can still be fully restored\nin many-body localization phases without approaching thermal equilibrium.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect is\nuniversal for any initial tilted product state, contrasting to the cases in the\nchaotic systems where the presence of the quantum Mpemba effect relies on the\nchoice of initial states. We also provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry\nrestoration and quantum Mpemba effects with the help of the effective model for\nmany-body localization. This Letter not only sheds light on extending the\nquantum Mpemba effect to more non-equilibrium settings but also contributes to\na deeper understanding of the many-body localization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
