It\nallows capturing defeasible knowledge, subject to argumentative debate. While,\nin much existing work, ABA frameworks are given up-front, in this paper we\nfocus on the problem of automating their learning from background knowledge and\npositive/negative examples. Unlike prior work, we newly frame the problem in\nterms of brave reasoning under stable extensions for ABA. We present a novel\nalgorithm based on transformation rules (such as Rote Learning, Folding,\nAssumption Introduction and Fact Subsumption) and an implementation thereof\nthat makes use of Answer Set Programming. Finally, we compare our technique to\nstate-of-the-art ILP systems that learn defeasible knowledge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
