However, in practice this assumption is insufficient: the\nprogrammer often needs to provide custom derivatives for composite functions to\nachieve efficiency and numerical stability. In this work, we start from the\nuntyped lambda calculus with a reverse-mode autodiff operator, extend it with\nan operator to attach manual derivatives, and demonstrate its utility via\nseveral examples.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s6g3BS81ZAxAh-BXnZnv22EEok3pllhn10LZYlpXJyo","pdfSize":"160304"}
