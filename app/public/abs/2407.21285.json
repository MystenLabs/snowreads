These spell-checker like systems offer a blend\nof interpretability and customization that is not found in other forms of\nautomated assistance. However, existing linters do not model context and have\nprimarily targeted users who do not need assistance, resulting in obvious --\neven annoying -- advice. We investigate these issues within the domain of color\npalette design, which serves as a microcosm of visualization design concerns.\nWe contribute a GUI-based color palette linter as a design probe that covers\nperception, accessibility, context, and other design criteria, and use it to\nexplore visual explanations, integrated fixes, and user defined linting rules.\nThrough a formative interview study and theory-driven analysis, we find that\nlinters can be meaningfully integrated into graphical contexts thereby\naddressing many of their core issues. We discuss implications for integrating\nlinters into visualization tools, developing improved assertion languages, and\nsupporting end-user tunable advice -- all laying the groundwork for more\neffective visualization linters in any context.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E2Dxoibw59qaMA5JWBC4XCOidRg07UrziNg3shpZENo","pdfSize":"2955471"}
