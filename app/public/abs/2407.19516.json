However, this\nnecessitates lightweight measurement instruments that are fit for the purpose.\nIn this study, we conduct an examination of the test-retest reliability of the\n\\emph{miniPXI} -- a short variant of the \\emph{Player Experience Inventory}\n(\\emph{PXI}), an established measure for measuring player experience. We\nanalyzed test-retest reliability by leveraging four games involving 100\nparticipants, comparing it with four established multi-item measures and\nsingle-item indicators such as the Net Promoter Score (\\emph{NPS}) and overall\nenjoyment. The findings show mixed outcomes; the \\emph{miniPXI} demonstrated\nvarying levels of test-retest reliability. Some constructs showed good to\nmoderate reliability, while others were less consistent. On the other hand,\nmulti-item measures exhibited moderate to good test-retest reliability,\ndemonstrating their effectiveness in measuring player experiences over time.\nAdditionally, the employed single-item indicators (\\emph{NPS} and overall\nenjoyment) demonstrated good reliability. The results of our study highlight\nthe complexity of player experience evaluations over time, utilizing single and\nmultiple items per construct measures. We conclude that single-item measures\nmay not be appropriate for long-term investigations of more complex PX\ndimensions and provide practical considerations for the applicability of such\nmeasures in repeated measurements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
