This letter proposes an efficient\nlow-coherence sequence design algorithm (LOCEDA) that can generate any number\nof sequences of any length that satisfy user-defined PAPR constraints while\nsupporting flexible subcarrier assignments in orthogonal frequency-division\nmultiple access (OFDMA) systems. We first visualize the low-coherence sequence\ndesign problem under PAPR constraints as resolving collisions between\nhyperspheres. By iteratively adjusting the radii and positions of these\nhyperspheres, we effectively generate low-coherence sequences that strictly\nsatisfy the imposed PAPR constraints. Simulation results (i) confirm that\nLOCEDA outperforms existing methods, (ii) demonstrate its flexibility, and\n(iii) highlight its potential for various application scenarios.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
