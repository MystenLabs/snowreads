Our focus is on\ninvestigating the sensitivity to Z boson couplings using the forward-backward\nasymmetry in Drell-Yan production. By utilizing an effective approach and\nsimulated data, we assess the accuracy of these couplings, specifically\nconsidering the full LHC data sample. Furthermore, we compare our results with\npredictions for future colliders, providing insights into their potential\nimpact on understanding Z boson interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
