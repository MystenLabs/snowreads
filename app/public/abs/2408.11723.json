This project\nproposes a workflow for deploying AR and VR platforms, allowing users to\nexplore living spaces from diverse cultures and socio-economic statuses. The\nprocess involves 3D scanning of culturally significant objects, creating\naccurate models of living spaces, and integrating them into immersive systems\nto facilitate engagement with global living designs. Targeted at individuals\ncurious about how people live in different parts of the world, the project aims\nto expand cross-cultural understanding and design perspectives, providing\ninsights into the effectiveness of immersive technologies in cultural\neducation. By detailing its conceptual framework, \"Cultural Windows\" aims to\nenhance comprehension and appreciation of global domestic aesthetics by\ncomparing participants' perceptions with immersive, realistic representations\nof living spaces from different cultures. This can help bridge the gap between\npreconceived notions and the actual appearance and feel of these spaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
