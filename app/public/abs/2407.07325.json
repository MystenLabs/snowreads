The work is divided into two\nmain parts: 1.alignment of video and text modalities; 2.convenient and\nefficient way to interact with users. Our goal is to address the task of video\ncomprehension in the context of billiards. The report includes a discussion of\nthe concepts and the final solution developed during the task's implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
