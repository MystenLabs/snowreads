We extend this technique to construct\nproper classes of maximal $\\theta$-independent families for various uncountable\n$\\theta$. In the first instance, a single $\\theta^+$-strongly compact cardinal\nhas a set-generic extension with a proper class of maximal $\\theta$-independent\nfamilies. In the second, we take a class-generic extension of a model with a\nproper class of measurable cardinals to obtain a proper class of $\\theta$ for\nwhich there is a maximal $\\theta$-independent family.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
