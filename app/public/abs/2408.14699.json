Starting from\na uniformly dispersed state, active flows drive the motion of actin filaments,\ninducing their bundling and formation of bundle-bundle connections that\nultimately generate an elastic network. The emerging network separates from the\nactive fluid to form a thin elastic sheets suspended at the sample midplane. At\nintermediate times, the active fluid drives large in-plane and out-of-plane\ndeformations of the elastic sheet which are driven by low-energy bending modes.\nSelf-organized sheets eventually exhibit centimeter-sized global spontaneous\noscillations and traveling waves, despite being isotropically driven on micron\nlengths by the active fluid. The active assembly generates diverse network\nstructures which are not easily realizable with conventional paradigms of\nequilibrium self-assembly and materials processing. Self-organized mechanical\nsheets pose a challenge for understanding of how a hierarchy of structure,\nmechanics, and dynamics emerges from a largely structureless initial suspension\nof active and passive microscopic components.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
