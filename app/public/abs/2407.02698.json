Cyber-attacks,\nincluding hijacking and spoofing, pose significant threats to these\ntechnological advancements, potentially leading to unauthorized control over\nvehicular networks or creating deceptive identities. Given the difficulty of\ndeploying comprehensive defensive logic across all vehicles, this paper\npresents a novel approach for identifying potential attacks through Radio\nAccess Network (RAN) event monitoring. The major contribution of this paper is\na location anomaly detection module that identifies aberrant devices that\nappear in multiple locations simultaneously - a potential indicator of a\nhijacking attack. We demonstrate how RAN-event based location anomaly detection\nis effective in combating malicious activity targeting connected cars. Using\nRAN data generated by tens of millions of connected cars, we developed a fast\nand efficient method for identifying potential malicious or rogue devices. The\nimplications of this research are far-reaching. By increasing the security of\nconnected cars, we can enhance the safety of users, provide robust defenses for\nthe automotive industry, and improve overall cybersecurity practices for IoT\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
