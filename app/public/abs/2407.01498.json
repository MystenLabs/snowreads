In prior work this set of optimally computable functions is identified\nin terms of a strong self-orthogonality (SSO) condition on the transfer\nfunction of the $N$-sum box. In this work we consider an `inverted' scenario,\nwhere instead of a feasible $N$-sum box transfer function, we are given an\narbitrary $\\mathbb{F}_d$ linear function, i.e., arbitrary matrices\n$V_k\\in\\mathbb{F}_d^{m\\times m_k}$ are specified, and the goal is to\ncharacterize the set of all feasible communication cost tuples\n$(\\Delta_1,\\cdots,\\Delta_K)$, not just based on $N$-sum box protocols, but\nacross all possible quantum coding schemes. As our main result, we fully solve\nthis problem for $K=3$ transmitters ($K\\geq 4$ settings remain open). Coding\nschemes based on the $N$-sum box protocol (along with elementary ideas such as\ntreating qudits as classical dits, time-sharing and batch-processing) are shown\nto be information theoretically optimal in all cases. As an example, in the\nsymmetric case where rk$(V_1)$=rk$(V_2)$=rk$(V_3) \\triangleq r_1$, rk$([V_1,\nV_2])$=rk$([V_2, V_3])$=rk$([V_3, V_1])\\triangleq r_2$, and rk$([V_1, V_2,\nV_3])\\triangleq r_3$ (rk = rank), the minimum total-download cost is $\\max\n\\{1.5r_1 + 0.75(r_3 - r_2), r_3\\}$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
