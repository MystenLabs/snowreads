The $\\phi^{4}$ lattice glass field theory is a conceptual\ngeneralization of spin glasses to continuous degrees of freedom and we discuss\nthe existence of a limit under which it formally reduces to the\nEdwards-Anderson model. By defining four variants of an order parameter which\nare suitable for continuous spin glasses, we verify numerically the emergence\nof an overlap in absence of the magnetization thus confirming the presence of a\nspin glass phase transition for a value of a critical squared mass. We conclude\nby discussing how the $\\phi^{4}$ spin glass can be utilized to address\nassumptions of complete homogeneity in space or time and how, in parallel to\nstatistical physics, provides a suitable framework to investigate the\nnonperturbative dynamics of machine learning algorithms from the perspective of\ndisordered lattice and constructive field theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
