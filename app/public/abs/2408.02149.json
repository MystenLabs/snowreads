More precisely, we give a decay criterion that ensures when $\n\\mathcal{H} $-harmonic functions for a positive Schr\\\"odinger operator $\n\\mathcal{H} $ with potentials bounded from above by $ 1 $ are trivial. We then\nspecifically look at the special cases of $ \\mathbb{Z}^{d} $ and regular trees\nfor which we get explicit decay criterion. Moreover, we consider the fractional\nanalogue of Landis conjecture on $ \\mathbb{Z}^{d} $. Our approach relies on the\ndiscrete version of Liouville comparison principle which is also proved in this\narticle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
