By\nutilizing these fields, along with spinor products and the x factor, we\nconstruct a field-theory action that naturally reproduces the vertices of the\nConstructive Standard Model (CSM). This approach eliminates unphysical\ncomponents, significantly reduces the degrees of freedom compared to\ntraditional field theory, and offers deeper insights into the power of\nconstructive amplitudes. Our action is momentum-conserving, Lorentz-invariant,\nHermitian, and non-local. We also discuss this as a framework for developing\nnew constructive field theories, discussing their essential properties and\npotential applicability in renormalization theory and non-perturbative\ncalculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
