Specifically, we consider the downlink data\ntransmission in the presence of UUI caused by a user that simultaneously\ntransmits in uplink. Our method introduces an overhead for estimation of the\nuser-to-user channels by transmitting pilots from the uplink user to the\ndownlink users. Each downlink user obtains a channel estimate that is used to\ndesign a combining matrix for UUI mitigation. We analytically derive an\nachievable spectral efficiency for the downlink transmission in the presence of\nUUI with our mitigation technique. Through numerical simulations, we show that\nour method can significantly improve the spectral efficiency performance in\ncases of heavy UUI.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
