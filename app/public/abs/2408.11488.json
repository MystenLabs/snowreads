In\nthis setting, the existence and computation of equilibria, under various\nnotions of stability, has attracted a lot of attention. However, the natural\nprocess by which players, starting from any feasible state, strive to reach an\nequilibrium after a series of unilateral improving deviations, has been less\nstudied. We investigate the convergence of dynamics towards individually stable\noutcomes under the following perspective: what are the most general classes of\npreferences and graph topologies guaranteeing convergence? To this aim, on the\none hand, we cover a hierarchy of preferences, ranging from the most general to\na subcase of additively separable preferences, including individually rational\nand monotone cases. On the other hand, given that convergence may fail in\ngraphs admitting a cycle even in our most restrictive preference class, we\nanalyze acyclic graph topologies such as trees, paths, and stars.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
