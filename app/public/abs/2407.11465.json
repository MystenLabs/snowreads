In this framework, a betting score (or more generally an\ne-process), as opposed to a traditional p-value, is used to quantify the\nevidence against a null hypothesis: the higher the betting score, the more\nmoney one has made betting against the null, and thus the larger the evidence\nthat the null is false. A key ingredient assumed throughout past works is that\none cannot bet more money than one currently has. In this paper, we ask what\nhappens if the bettor is allowed to borrow money after going bankrupt, allowing\nfurther financial flexibility in this game of hypothesis testing. We propose\nvarious definitions of (adjusted) evidence relative to the wealth borrowed,\nindebted, and accumulated. We also ask what happens if the bettor can\n\"bargain\", in order to obtain odds bettor than specified by the null\nhypothesis. The adjustment of wealth in order to serve as evidence appeals to\nthe characterization of arbitrage, interest rates, and num\\'eraire-adjusted\npricing in this setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
