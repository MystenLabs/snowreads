The MIS problem is known to be\nNP-hard and is also NP-hard to approximate to within a factor of $n^{1-\\delta}$\nfor any $\\delta>0$. We show that we can break this barrier in the presence of\nan oracle obtained through predictions from a machine learning model that\nanswers vertex membership queries for a fixed MIS with probability\n$1/2+\\varepsilon$. In the first setting we consider, the oracle can be queried\nonce per vertex to know if a vertex belongs to a fixed MIS, and the oracle\nreturns the correct answer with probability $1/2 + \\varepsilon$. Under this\nsetting, we show an algorithm that obtains an\n$\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{\\Delta}/\\varepsilon)$-approximation in $O(m)$ time where\n$\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the graph. In the second setting, we allow\nmultiple queries to the oracle for a vertex, each of which is correct with\nprobability $1/2 + \\varepsilon$. For this setting, we show an\n$O(1)$-approximation algorithm using $O(n/\\varepsilon^2)$ total queries and\n$\\tilde{O}(m)$ runtime.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
