We prove the existence of a positive number\n$L_0>0$ such that if a truncated circular cylinder of radius $\\rho$ in\n$\\mathbb{E}(\\kappa,\\tau)$ has length $L>L_0$ then it is unstable. This number\n$L_0$ depends on $\\kappa$, $\\tau$ and $\\rho$. The value $L_0$ is sharp under\naxially-symmetric variations of the surface. We also extend this result for the\npartitioning problem in $\\mathbb{E}(\\kappa,\\tau)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
