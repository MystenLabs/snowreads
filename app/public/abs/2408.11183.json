We introduce the correspondence\nprinciple between physical reality and mathematical models, and we discuss its\nsignificance in relation to physical models. We consider the status of quantum\ninformation in the standard quantum model, and based on the correspondence\nprinciple, we propose an interpretation of the wave function as a mathematical\nrepresentation of quantum information. In this context, we consider Clauser's\nanalysis of incompatibility formulations of quantum theory in laboratory space\nand configuration space in the context of local realism. Then, we introduce the\nhypothesis of quantum space of directly unobserved relations, which precede\ncorrelations in the ``classical'' Minkowski space-time and are compatible with\nthe Reichenbach common cause principle. Finally, we present the Chyli\\'nski\nmodel as an example of quantum relational space, which predicts potentially\nmeasurable effects for the bound states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
