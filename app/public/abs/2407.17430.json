This review\nexplores various methodologies for achieving realistic facial animations from\naudio inputs, highlighting generative and adaptive models. Addressing\nchallenges like model training costs, dataset availability, and silent moment\ndistributions in audio data, it presents innovative solutions to enhance\nperformance and realism. The research also introduces a new taxonomy to\ncategorize audio-visual synchronization methods based on logistical aspects,\nadvancing the capabilities of virtual assistants, gaming, and interactive\ndigital media.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"o8OWziO4WLcgk3HpU2mmvHMRYos7oo9ehscbdCfUOK4","pdfSize":"234981"}
