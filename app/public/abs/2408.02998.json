This paper implements centralized and decentralized federated\nlearning frameworks for crop yield prediction based on Long Short-Term Memory\nNetwork. For centralized federated learning, multiple clients and one server is\nconsidered, where the clients exchange their model updates with the server that\nworks as the aggregator to build the global model. For the decentralized\nframework, a collaborative network is formed among the devices either using\nring topology or using mesh topology. In this network, each device receives\nmodel updates from the neighbour devices, and performs aggregation to build the\nupgraded model. The performance of the centralized and decentralized federated\nlearning frameworks are evaluated in terms of prediction accuracy, precision,\nrecall, F1-Score, and training time. The experimental results present that\n$\\geq$97% and $>$97.5% prediction accuracy are achieved using the centralized\nand decentralized federated learning-based frameworks respectively. The results\nalso show that the using centralized federated learning the response time can\nbe reduced by $\\sim$75% than the cloud-only framework. Finally, the future\nresearch directions of the use of federated learning in crop yield prediction\nare explored in this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
