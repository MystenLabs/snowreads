It builds on a theoretical framework that\ndistinguishes between the LLM as a substrate and the entities the model\nsimulates. The paper advocates for a strictly non-anthropomorphic approach to\nmodels while cautiously applying methodologies used in studying human\nlinguistic behavior to the simulated entities. While natural language\nprocessing researchers focus on the models themselves, their architecture,\nevaluation, and methods for improving performance, we as quantitative linguists\nshould strive to build a robust theory concerning the characteristics of texts\nproduced by LLMs, how they differ from human-produced texts, and the properties\nof simulated entities. Additionally, we should explore the potential of LLMs as\nan instrument for studying human culture, of which language is an integral\npart.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J9GWv2e0ANjw5LZfFnNI0YNkNbEl7sjHu334gYIPVqs","pdfSize":"203185"}
