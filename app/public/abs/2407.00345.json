In the\ncontext of open-source software, community managers manage the communities that\ncontribute to the development and upkeep of open-source tools. Despite playing\na crucial role in maintaining open-source software, community managers are\noften overlooked. In this paper we look at why this happens and the troubling\nfuture we are heading towards if this trend continues. Namely if community\nmanagers are driven to focus on corporate needs and become conflicted with the\ncommunities they are meant to be managing. We suggest methods to overcome this\nby stressing the need for the specialisation of roles and by advocating for\ntransparent metrics that highlight the real work of the community manager.\nFollowing these guidelines can allow this vital role to be treated with the\ntransparency and respect that it deserves, alongside more traditional roles\nincluding software developers and engineers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f4-WvQGliJFDAt5tSPS3HEIsanvnBMXppjczY9KBlSM","pdfSize":"287494"}
