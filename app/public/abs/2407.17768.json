To establish\nwell-posedness results, we firstly construct a backward Skorokhod problem with\nsublinear expectation, and then apply that in the study of doubly\nmean-reflected $G$-BSDEs involving Lipschitz and quadratic generators under\nbounded and unbounded terminal conditions. Also we utilize fixed-point\nargumentations and $\\theta$-methods while solving these equations. Finally, we\nextend the results to multi-dimensional doubly mean-reflected $G$-BSDEs with\ndiagonal generators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
