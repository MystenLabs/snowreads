In the special cases of\nstationary and narrow wedge initial conditions, a combination of Bethe ansatz\nand numerical conjectures alternatively provide fully explicit exact\nexpressions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
