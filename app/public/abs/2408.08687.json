We investigated the\ncompressibility of elements under ultra-high pressures based on their positions\nin the periodic table. For the elemental materials in this region, pressure\n($P$) can be approximated as an $N$-order function of volume ($V$): $P$\n$\\propto$ $1/V^N$. By determining the $N$ value, we can evaluate the\ncontribution of the volume change to the total energy of the system. The $N$\nvalue is also an indicator the bulk modulus in this pressure range and shows\nperiodicity with increasing atomic number, and shows significant values in the\nrange of 4.5-6, for transition metals with close-packed structures (fcc, hcp).\nThis suggests that the total energy of these elements increases rapidly as\nvolume decreases. Furthermore, the current results provide basic data for\nunderstanding the compressibility of elemental materials under extreme ultra\nhigh-pressure conditions based on the quantum theory of solids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
