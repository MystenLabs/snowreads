First,\nthe author introduces to the contemporary need for and meaning of ethics. He\ndistinguishes it from other registers of normativities and underlines its\ninadequacy to formalization. He then presents a cartography of the landscape of\nethical theories covered by moral philosophy, taking care to distinguish\nmeta-ethics, normative ethics and applied ethics. In drawing up this overview,\nthe author questions the relationship between ethics and artificial\nintelligence. The analysis focuses in particular on the main ethical currents\nthat have imposed themselves in the ways of doing digital ethics and AI in our\nWestern democracies. The author asks whether these practices of ethics, as they\nseem to crystallize today in a precise pattern, constitute a sufficient and\nsufficiently satisfactory response to our needs for ethics in AI. The study\nconcludes with a reflection on the reasons why a human ethics of AI based on a\npragmatic practice of contextual ethics remains necessary and irreducible to\nany formalization or automated treatment of the ethical questions that arise\nfor humans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
