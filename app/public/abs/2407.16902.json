Powered by foundation models that have been pretrained and can generate\ncomplex content, GenAI represents a paradigm shift away from the more\ntraditional focus on task-specific classifiers that have dominated the AI\nlandscape thus far. We posit that the imminent application of GenAI in\nhealthcare will be through well-defined, low risk, high value, and narrow\napplications that automate healthcare workflows at the point of care using\nsmaller foundation models. These models will be finetuned for different\ncapabilities and application specific scenarios and will have the ability to\nprovide medical explanations, reference evidence within a retrieval augmented\nframework and utilizing external tools. We contrast this with a general,\nall-purpose AI model for end-to-end clinical decision making that improves\nclinician performance, including safety-critical diagnostic tasks, which will\nrequire greater research prior to implementation. We consider areas where\n'human in the loop' Generative AI can improve healthcare quality and safety by\nautomating mundane tasks. Using the principles of implementation science will\nbe critical for integrating 'end to end' GenAI systems that will be accepted by\nhealthcare teams.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
