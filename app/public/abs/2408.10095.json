Here, we develop an efficient algorithm to systematically\nmap the solution landscape to find all steady-state solutions. By applying our\nmethod to generic RD models, we find that stable spatial patterns can emerge\nvia saddle-node bifurcations before the onset of Turing instability.\nFurthermore, by using a generalized action in functional space based on large\ndeviation theory, our method is extended to evaluate stability of spatial\npatterns against noise. Applying this general approach in a three-species RD\nmodel, we show that though formation of Turing patterns only requires two\nchemical species, the third species is critical for stabilizing patterns\nagainst strong intrinsic noise in small biochemical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
