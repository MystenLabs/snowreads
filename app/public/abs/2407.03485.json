We prove strong convergence of our main algorithm under less\nrestrictive assumptions on the inertial parameters when compared to previous\nanalysis of inertial PP-type algorithms, which makes our method of interest\neven in finite-dimensional settings. We also performed an iteration-complexity\nanalysis and applied our main algorithm to variational inequalities for\nmonotone operators, obtaining strongly convergent (inertial) variants of\nKorpolevich's extragradient, forward-backward and Tseng's modified\nforward-backward methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
