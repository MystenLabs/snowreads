The system has infinite number of servers, ranked by\n$1,2,3, \\ldots$; a server rank is its ``location.\" Each customer has an\nindependent exponentially distributed service time, with the mean determined by\nits type. Multiple customers (possibly of different types) can be placed for\nservice into one server, subject to ``packing'' constraints. Service times of\ndifferent customers are independent, even if served simultaneously by the same\nserver. The large-scale asymptotic regime is considered, such that the mean\nnumber of customers $r$ goes to infinity.\n  We seek algorithms with the underlying objective of minimizing the location\n(rank) $U$ of the right-most (highest ranked) occupied (non-empty) server.\nTherefore, this objective seeks to minimize the total number $Q$ of occupied\nservers {\\em and} keep the set of occupied servers as far at the ``left'' as\npossible, i.e., keep $U$ close to $Q$. In previous work, versions of {\\em\nGreedy Random} (GRAND) algorithm have been shown to asymptotically minimize\n$Q/r$ as $r\\to\\infty$. In this paper we show that when these algorithms are\ncombined with the First-Fit rule for ``taking'' empty servers, they\nasymptotically minimize $U/r$ as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
