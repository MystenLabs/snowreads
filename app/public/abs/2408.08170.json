However, it\nis usually difficult to identify the constitutive relation of the associated\nstress-free reference, without performing a destructive testing. In this paper,\nwe introduce three approaches to determine the response of the stress-free, or\nany arbitrary initially stressed reference, using the response of a given\ninitially stressed reference. The first and third approaches directly find out\nthe constitutive relations for one stressed reference from another. The second\napproach uses the response of a given stressed reference, to identify the\nstress-free material, and thereafter determines the response of any stressed\nreference. Quite interestingly, it appears that the stress-free material, or\nthe arbitrarily stressed references, can be implicit, although the given\n(known) initially stressed state is Green elastic. We also obtain a few simple\ncases of explicit constitutive relations. These approaches of changing the\nreference configuration do not begin from the stress-free state. Using the\npresent framework and the concept of symmetry, we also explore the dependence\nor independence of constitutive relation on the choice of reference. The\npresent work also develops the universal relations for stress-free isotropic\nimplicit elastic materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
