A standard solution to this is\nselecting a measurement only if its utility -- the difference between posterior\n(with the measurement) and prior information (without the measurement) --\nexceeds some threshold. Theoretically, utility, a function of the parameter\nestimate, should be evaluated at the estimate obtained with all measurements\nselected so far, hence necessitating a recalibration with each new measurement.\nHowever, we hypothesize that utility is insensitive to changes in the parameter\nestimate for many systems of interest, suggesting that evaluating utility at\nsome initial parameter guess would yield equivalent results in practice. We\nprovide evidence supporting this hypothesis for extrinsic calibration of\nmultiple inertial measurement units (IMUs), showing the reduction in\ncalibration time by two orders of magnitude by forgoing recalibration for each\nmeasurement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dX1rYx2m2rYaELz_taDN4MynMaN-LF8N7g-s9ZmVhG4","pdfSize":"1546542","objectId":"0x4dbd5e40e327b8672ee26cae505c2fee408302ddca8f3ad4bc113a0c9f3bdd58","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
