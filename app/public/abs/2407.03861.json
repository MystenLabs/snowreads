The shared task\ncomprises two subtasks: identifying new senses that words gain with time (when\ncomparing newer and older time periods) and producing the definitions for the\nidentified new senses. We implemented a conceptually simple and computationally\ninexpensive solution to both subtasks. We trained adapter-based binary\nclassification models to match glosses with usage examples and leveraged the\nprobability output of the models to identify novel senses. The same models were\nused to match examples of novel sense usages with Wiktionary definitions. Our\nsubmission attained third place on the first subtask and the first place on the\nsecond subtask.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
