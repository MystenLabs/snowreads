We measured the amount of student\nparticipative actions when the Socrative tool was used and when it was not\nused. Our experiment involved a total of 192 students, corresponding to 4\ndifferent subjects of Computer Engineering at the Universitat de les Illes\nBalears, during 2012/2013 and 2013/2014 courses. An independent paired t-test\nwas performed on the measurements. The analysis results show that student\nparticipation increases with the use of mobile devices for theory classes and\nstudents are willing to participate in class activities and share their own\nresults.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
