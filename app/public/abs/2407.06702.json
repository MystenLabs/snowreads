This prohibits\nthe exploration of multidimensional, diverse configuration space for, e.g.,\noptimization purposes.\n  This paper presents a method for performance predictions based on a network\ncell's configuration and network conditions, which utilizes neural network\narchitecture. We evaluate the idea by extensive experiments, with data from\nmore than 50,000 5G cells. The assessment included a comparison of the proposed\nmethod against models developed for fixed configuration. Results show that\ncombined configuration-performance modeling outperforms single-configuration\nmodels and allows for performance prediction of unknown configurations, i.e.,\nit is not used for model training. A substantially lower mean absolute error\nwas achieved (0.25 vs. 0.45 for fixed-configuration MLP-based models).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"7wTHgtxCeNZmIzzkRuoOpMkGynfTc6Q8NwGmaDuNHdY","pdfSize":"547796"}
