To test this assumption, we present ab\ninitio calculations of $R_{\\rm skin}$ in $^{48}$Ca and $^{208}$Pb, $\\Delta\nR^{\\rm mirr}_{\\rm ch}$ in $^{36}$Ca$-^{36}$S, $^{38}$Ca$-^{38}$Ar,\n$^{41}$Sc$-^{41}$Ca, $^{48}$Ni$-^{48}$Ca, $^{52}$Ni$-^{52}$Cr, and\n$^{54}$Ni$-^{54}$Fe mirror pairs, and $L$. Employing the recently developed 34\nchiral interaction samples, identified by the history matching approach, we\nconduct rigorous statistical analysis of correlations among $\\Delta R^{\\rm\nmirr}_{\\rm ch}$, $R_{\\rm skin}$ and $L$, accounting for quantified\nuncertainties from low-energy constants of chiral interaction, chiral effective\nfield theory truncation and many-body method approximation. The ab initio\nresults reveal an appreciable $\\Delta R^{\\rm mirr}_{\\rm ch}-L$ correlation in\n$fp$-shell mirror pairs. However, contrary to previous studies, the present\ncalculation finds that the studied $sd$-shell mirror pairs do not exhibit any\n$\\Delta R^{\\rm mirr}_{\\rm ch}-L$ correlation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-P6YTUGR76GTrrk_RtD8k2jnt6cnvlNMgRgKuwfpzqM","pdfSize":"4876606"}
