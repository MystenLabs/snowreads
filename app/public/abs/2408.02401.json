Accurately estimating these risk measures in the\ncontext of computationally expensive simulation models that lack analytical\ntractability is fundamental to effective risk management and decision making.\nIn this paper, we propose an efficient important sampling method for distortion\nrisk measures in such models that reduces the computational cost through\nmachine learning. We demonstrate the applicability and efficiency of the Monte\nCarlo method in numerical experiments on various distortion risk measures and\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
