More specifically, we consider the construction of\nparametrizations with prescribed holonomy signatures i.e., a set of angles at\nsingularities, and rotations along homology loops, preserving which is\nessential for constructing parametrizations following an input field, as well\nas for user control of the parametrization structure. Our algorithm performs\nexceptionally well on a large dataset based on Thingi10k [Zhou and Jacobson\n2016], (16156 meshes) as well as on a challenging smaller dataset of [Myles et\nal. 2014], converging, on average, in 9 iterations. Although the algorithm\nlacks a formal mathematical guarantee, presented empirical evidence and the\nconnections between convex optimization and closely related algorithms, suggest\nthat a similar formulation can be found for this algorithm in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
