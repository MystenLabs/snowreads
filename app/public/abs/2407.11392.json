To achieve a robust\nmanipulation and wide range of operations, the uncertainties on the location of\nthe contact point and multiple operating points are taken into account in the\ncontrol design by sampling the state space. The proposed control strategy is\nbased on a robust pole placement using LMIs. Moreover, to handle uncertainties\nand different operating points, we recast our problem as a robust convex\nprogram (RCP). We then consider the original RCP as a scenario convex program\n(SCP) and solve the SCP by sampling the uncertain grasp map parameter and\noperating points in the state space. For a required probabilistic level of\nconfidence, we quantify the feasibility of the SCP solution based on the number\nof sampling points. The control strategy is tested in simulation in a case\nstudy with contact location error and different initial grasps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GOitZFCUyXbcZKTUMIcThl6D2krEJm_2l-K60BDxuDE","pdfSize":"914433"}
