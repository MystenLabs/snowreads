We provide operations that\npreserve embeddability, including joining and cloning of 2-cells, as well as\n$\\Delta\\mathrm Y$-transformations. We also construct a CW complex for which\n$\\mathrm Y\\Delta$-transformations do not preserve embeddability.\n  We use these results to study 4-flat graphs, i.e., graphs that embed in\n$\\mathbb{R}^4$ after attaching any number of 2-cells to their cycles; a graph\nclass that naturally generalizes planarity and linklessness. We verify several\nconjectures of van der Holst; in particular, we prove that each of the 78\ngraphs of the Heawood family is an excluded minor for the class of 4-flat\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
