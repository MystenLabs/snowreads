These solution matrices are characterized by\nsemi-positiveness and trace preserving properties, which must be guaranteed in\nany physically meaningful numerical simulation. In this paper, novel full- and\nlow-rank exponential Euler integrators are developed for approximating the\nLindblad equation that preserve positivity and trace unconditionally.\nTheoretical results are presented that provide sharp error estimates for the\ntwo classes of exponential integration methods. Results of numerical\nexperiments are discussed that illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nschemes, beyond present state-of-the-art capabilities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
