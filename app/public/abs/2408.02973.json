The dataset used for the analysis is the intraday\nprice indices of the S&P500 from 1996 to 2023 and the intraday Bitcoin indices\nfrom 2019 to 2023, both in USD. We adopt the definition of `wide sense\nstationary', which constrains the time independence of the first and second\nmoments of a time series. The testing method used in this paper follows the\nWiener-Khinchin Theorem, i.e., that for a wide sense stationary process, the\npower spectral density and the autocorrelation are a Fourier transform pair. We\ndemonstrate that localized stationarity can be achieved by truncating the time\nseries into segments, and for each segment, detrending and normalizing the\nprice return are required. These results show that the S&P500 price return can\nachieve stationarity for the full 28-year period with a detrending window of 12\nmonths and a constrained normalization window of 10 minutes. With truncated\nsegments, a larger normalization window can be used to establish stationarity,\nindicating that within the segment the data is more homogeneous. For Bitcoin\nprice return, the segment with higher volatility presents stationarity with a\nnormalization window of 60 minutes, whereas stationarity cannot be established\nin other segments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
