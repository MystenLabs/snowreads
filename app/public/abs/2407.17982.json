We show that a model based on\na generalized Landauer formula explains the nearly constant conductance and\npredicts an Arrhenius-like dependence for low temperatures. A critical aspect\nof the model is that the relevant activation energy for conductance is either\nthe difference between the HOMO and HOMO-1 or the LUMO+1 and LUMO energies\ninstead of the HOMO-LUMO gap of the proteins. Analysis of experimental data\nconfirm the Arrhenius-like law and allows us to extract the activation\nenergies. We then calculate the energy differences with advanced DFT methods\nfor proteins used in the experiments. Our main result is that the experimental\nand theoretical activation energies for these three different proteins and\nthree differently prepared solid-state junctions match nearly perfectly,\nimplying the mechanism's validity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
