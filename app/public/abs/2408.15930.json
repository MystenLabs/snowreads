We focus on three qubits at the end of the ladder and compute the\nnon-classical correlations between two of the three qubits as measurements are\ndone on the remaining qubits. We compute both the entanglement between the two\nqubits as well as the quantum discord between them after the measurements. We\nsee that after all but three qubits are measured, the non-classical\ncorrelations developed between two of them show a trend of being stronger with\nthe length of the ladder. It is also seen that measurements on to the basis\nstates of operators belonging to the Clifford group do not produce such\ncorrelations or entanglement. The non-classical correlations produced depend\nonly on the number, location and nature of preceding non-Clifford measurements.\nOur results not only throw light on the dynamics of quantum correlations while\nan algorithm proceeds step-by-step in the Measurement-based Based Quantum\nComputing (MBQC) model but it also reveals how the last two qubits, treated as\nan open quantum system, can have increasing entanglement or other non-classical\ncorrelations as its immediate environment is interrogated through random\nmeasurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
