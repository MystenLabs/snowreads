This makes sustainable data center control a\npriority. In this paper, we introduce SustainDC, a set of Python environments\nfor benchmarking multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms for data\ncenters (DC). SustainDC supports custom DC configurations and tasks such as\nworkload scheduling, cooling optimization, and auxiliary battery management,\nwith multiple agents managing these operations while accounting for the effects\nof each other. We evaluate various MARL algorithms on SustainDC, showing their\nperformance across diverse DC designs, locations, weather conditions, grid\ncarbon intensity, and workload requirements. Our results highlight significant\nopportunities for improvement of data center operations using MARL algorithms.\nGiven the increasing use of DC due to AI, SustainDC provides a crucial platform\nfor the development and benchmarking of advanced algorithms essential for\nachieving sustainable computing and addressing other heterogeneous real-world\nchallenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
