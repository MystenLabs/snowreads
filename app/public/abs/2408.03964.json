The intricate\nnature of the telecom network ecosystem presents challenges to effectively\nmanage, operate, and optimize networks. To address these hurdles, Artificial\nIntelligence (AI) has been widely adopted to solve different tasks in telecom\nnetworks. However, these conventional AI models are often designed for specific\ntasks, rely on extensive and costly-to-collect labeled data that require\nspecialized telecom expertise for development and maintenance. The AI models\nusually fail to generalize and support diverse deployment scenarios and\napplications. In contrast, Foundation Models (FMs) show effective\ngeneralization capabilities in various domains in language, vision, and\ndecision-making tasks. FMs can be trained on multiple data modalities generated\nfrom the telecom ecosystem and leverage specialized domain knowledge. Moreover,\nFMs can be fine-tuned to solve numerous specialized tasks with minimal\ntask-specific labeled data and, in some instances, are able to leverage context\nto solve previously unseen problems. At the dawn of 6G, this paper investigates\nthe potential opportunities of using FMs to shape the future of telecom\ntechnologies and standards. In particular, the paper outlines a conceptual\nprocess for developing Telecom FMs (TFMs) and discusses emerging opportunities\nfor orchestrating specialized TFMs for network configuration, operation, and\nmaintenance. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations and challenges of\ndeveloping and deploying TFMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AHo2smyvbG6gSPqkCIruEj4uW9HxN_1T0i-GIsd-8i4","pdfSize":"1298713"}
