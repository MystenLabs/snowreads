Mobile DNNs are often\ncompressed to fit the limited resources and thus suffer from degraded accuracy\nand generalizability due to data drift. DNN evolution, e.g., continuous\nlearning and domain adaptation, has been demonstrated effective in overcoming\nthese issues, mostly for single-task DNN, leaving multi-task DNN evolution an\nimportant yet open challenge. To fill up this gap, we propose AdaBridge, which\nexploits computational redundancies in multi-task DNNs as a unique opportunity\nfor dynamic data and computation reuse, thereby improving training efficacy and\nresource efficiency among asynchronous multi-task co-evolution in edge systems.\nExperimental evaluation shows that AdaBridge achieves 11% average accuracy gain\nupon individual evolution baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
