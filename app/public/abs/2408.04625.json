In this paper, we introduce ASTRO-BFDF, a new adaptive sampling trust\nregion method specifically designed for solving unconstrained bi-fidelity\nstochastic derivative-free optimization problems. Within ASTRO-BFDF, the LF\nfunction serves two purposes: first, to identify better iterates for the HF\nfunction when a high correlation between them is indicated by the optimization\nprocess, and second, to reduce the variance of the HF function estimates by\nBi-fidelity Monte Carlo (BFMC). In particular, the sample sizes are dynamically\ndetermined with the option of employing either crude Monte Carlo or BFMC, while\nbalancing optimization error and sampling error. We demonstrate that the\niterates generated by ASTRO-BFDF converge to the first-order stationary point\nalmost surely. Additionally, we numerically demonstrate the superiority of our\nproposed algorithm by testing it on synthetic problems and simulation\noptimization problems with discrete event simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
