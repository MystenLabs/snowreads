Nonetheless, this approach confines all perturbations to the image\nlevel and suffers from the excessive presence of naive samples, thus\nnecessitating further improvement. In this paper, we introduce feature-level\nperturbation with varying intensities and forms to expand the augmentation\nspace, establishing the image-feature weak-to-strong consistency paradigm.\nFurthermore, our paradigm develops a triple-branch structure, which facilitates\ninteractions between both types of perturbations within one branch to boost\ntheir synergy. Additionally, we present a confidence-based identification\nstrategy to distinguish between naive and challenging samples, thus introducing\nadditional challenges exclusively for naive samples. Notably, our paradigm can\nseamlessly integrate with existing SSL methods. We apply the proposed paradigm\nto several representative algorithms and conduct experiments on multiple\nbenchmarks, including both balanced and imbalanced distributions for labeled\nsamples. The results demonstrate a significant enhancement in the performance\nof existing SSL algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
