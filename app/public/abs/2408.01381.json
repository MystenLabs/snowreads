It can have low losses and allows for mitigation of the\ndetrimental effect of longitudinal optical fields by an external magnetic\nfield, but it has its own issues: thermal oscillations of atoms around their\nequilibrium positions and inhomogeneous broadening of atomic spectral lines due\nto random local electric fields. We show that these complications should not\nimpede observation of Anderson localization of light in such materials. The\nthermal oscillations hardly affect light propagation whereas the inhomogeneous\nbroadening can be compensated for by increasing the number density of impurity\natoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
