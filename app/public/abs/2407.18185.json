We\nconsider scenarios in which the neutral components of doublet and triplet do\nnot mix, so that the lighter neutral scalar $h$ has (at least approximately)\nSM-like couplings to fermions and gauge bosons. We focus on the two-loop\ncorrections controlled by the quartic scalar couplings, and obtain explicit and\ncompact formulas for the $h \\gamma \\gamma$ amplitude by means of a low-energy\ntheorem that connects it to the derivative of the photon self-energy w.r.t. the\nHiggs field. We briefly discuss the numerical impact of the newly-computed\ncontributions, showing that they may be required for a precise determination of\n$\\Gamma[h\\rightarrow \\gamma \\gamma]$ in scenarios where the quartic scalar\ncouplings are large.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
