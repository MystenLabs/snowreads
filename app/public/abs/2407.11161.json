However, existing SemCom research, primarily centered\non simplified scenarios like single-pair transmissions with direct wireless\nlinks, faces significant challenges when applied to real-world radio access\nnetworks (RANs). This article introduces a Semantic-aware Radio Access Network\n(S-RAN), offering a holistic systematic view of SemCom beyond single-pair\ntransmissions. We begin by outlining the S-RAN architecture, introducing new\nphysical components and logical functions along with key design challenges. We\nthen present transceiver design for end-to-end transmission to overcome\nconventional SemCom transceiver limitations, including static channel\nconditions, oversimplified background knowledge models, and hardware\nconstraints. Later, we delve into the discussion on radio resource management\nfor multiple users, covering semantic channel modeling, performance metrics,\nresource management algorithms, and a case study, to elaborate distinctions\nfrom resource management for legacy RANs. Finally, we highlight open research\nchallenges and potential solutions. The objective of this article is to serve\nas a basis for advancing SemCom research into practical wireless systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
