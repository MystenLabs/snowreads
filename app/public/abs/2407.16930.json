We adopt the approach of implementing the electroweak part as\nthe infinite-volume version, which is denoted as the EW$_\\infty$ method in this\nwork. A general approach is established for correcting finite-volume effects in\ncases where the hadronic intermediate states are dominated by either a single\nparticle or two particles. For the single-particle case, this work derives the\ninfinite volume reconstruction (IVR) method from a new perspective. For the\ntwo-particle case, we provide the correction formulas for power-law\nfinite-volume effects and unphysical terms with exponentially divergent time\ndependence. The finite-volume formalism developed in this study has broad\napplications, including the QED corrections in various processes and the\ntwo-photon exchange contribution in $K_L\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$ or $\\eta\\to\\mu^+\\mu^-$\ndecays.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
