Information-flow\nrequirements are hyperproperties that ensure that if a component needs to act\non certain information that is only available in other components, then this\ninformation will be passed to the component. We present a new method for the\nautomatic construction of information flow assumptions from specifications\ngiven as temporal safety properties. The new method is the first approach to\nhandle situations where the required amount of information is unbounded. For\nexample, we can analyze communication protocols that transmit a stream of\nmessages in a potentially infinite loop. We show that component implementations\ncan then, in principle, be constructed from the information flow requirements\nusing a synthesis tool for hyperproperties. We additionally present a more\npractical synthesis technique that constructs the components using efficient\nmethods for standard synthesis from trace properties. We have implemented the\ntechnique in the prototype tool FlowSy, which outperforms previous approaches\nto distributed synthesis on several benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
