An AI-assisted criminal investigation\nsystem, providing prompt but precise legal counsel is in need for police\nofficers. We introduce LAPIS (Language Model Augmented Police Investigation\nSystem), an automated system that assists police officers to perform rational\nand legal investigative actions. We constructed a finetuning dataset and\nretrieval knowledgebase specialized in crime investigation legal reasoning\ntask. We extended the dataset's quality by incorporating manual curation\nefforts done by a group of domain experts. We then finetuned the pretrained\nweights of a smaller Korean language model to the newly constructed dataset and\nintegrated it with the crime investigation knowledgebase retrieval approach.\nExperimental results show LAPIS' potential in providing reliable legal guidance\nfor police officers, even better than the proprietary GPT-4 model. Qualitative\nanalysis on the rationales generated by LAPIS demonstrate the model's reasoning\nability to leverage the premises and derive legally correct conclusions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
