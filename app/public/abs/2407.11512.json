The geometry of this inhomogeneity is assumed to be uncertain, and we\nare particularly interested in studying the propagation of this behavior\nthroughout the physical model considered. A key step in our analysis consists\nof recasting the physical model-originally set in an unbounded domain-into a\ncomputationally manageable formulation based on Volume Integral Equations\n(VIEs), particularly the Lippmann-Schwinger equation. We show that both the\nleading operator in this volume integral formulation and its solution depend\nholomorphically on shape variations of the support of the aforementioned\ninhomogeneity. This property, known as shape holomorphy, is crucial in the\nanalysis and implementation of various methods used in computational\nUncertainty Quantification (UQ). We explore the implications of this result in\nforward and inverse UQ and provide numerical experiments illustrating and\nconfirming the theoretical predictions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5Hy87GdV9W9qIzwvbTjPLO7WBPEdUBxB8whnq8lh3yk","pdfSize":"753569"}
