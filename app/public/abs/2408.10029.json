We first show that\nthe optimal radius for BMOCZ is a function of the employed decoder and that the\nradius maximizing the minimum distance between polynomial zeros does not\nmaximize the minimum distance of the final code. While maximizing zero\nseparation offers an almost optimal solution with the DiZeT decoder,\nsimulations show that the ML decoder outperforms the DiZeT decoder in both\nadditive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and fading channels when the radius is\nchosen to maximize codeword separation. Finally, we analyze different\nsequence-to-subcarrier mappings for BMOCZ-based orthogonal frequency division\nmultiplexing (OFDM). We highlight a flexible time-frequency OFDM waveform that\navoids distortion introduced by a frequency-selective channel at the expense of\na higher peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR).\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
