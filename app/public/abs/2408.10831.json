A prominent example is 2D\npose estimation of animals, particularly wild species like zebras, for which\ncollecting real-world data is complex and impractical. However, many approaches\nstill require real images, consistency and style constraints, sophisticated\nanimal models, and/or powerful pre-trained networks to bridge the syn-to-real\ngap. Moreover, they often assume that the animal can be reliably detected in\nimages or videos, a hypothesis that often does not hold, e.g. in wildlife\nscenarios or aerial images. To solve this, we use synthetic data generated with\na 3D photorealistic simulator to obtain the first synthetic dataset that can be\nused for both detection and 2D pose estimation of zebras without applying any\nof the aforementioned bridging strategies. Unlike previous works, we\nextensively train and benchmark our detection and 2D pose estimation models on\nmultiple real-world and synthetic datasets using both pre-trained and\nnon-pre-trained backbones. These experiments show how the models trained from\nscratch and only with synthetic data can consistently generalize to real-world\nimages of zebras in both tasks. Moreover, we show it is possible to easily\ngeneralize those same models to 2D pose estimation of horses with a minimal\namount of real-world images to account for the domain transfer.
