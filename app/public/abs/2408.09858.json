In this paper, we introduce\nShortCircuit, a novel transformer-based architecture that leverages the\nstructural properties of AIGs and performs efficient space exploration.\nContrary to prior approaches attempting end-to-end generation of logic circuits\nusing deep networks, ShortCircuit employs a two-phase process combining\nsupervised with reinforcement learning to enhance generalization to unseen\ntruth tables. We also propose an AlphaZero variant to handle the double\nexponentially large state space and the sparsity of the rewards, enabling the\ndiscovery of near-optimal designs. To evaluate the generative performance of\nour trained model , we extract 500 truth tables from a benchmark set of 20\nreal-world circuits. ShortCircuit successfully generates AIGs for 84.6% of the\n8-input test truth tables, and outperforms the state-of-the-art logic synthesis\ntool, ABC, by 14.61% in terms of circuits size.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
