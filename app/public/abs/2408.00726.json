However, a recent study based on galaxy clusters by\nMigkas et al. (2021, arXiv:2103.13904) found an apparent spatial variation of\napproximately $9\\%$ in the Hubble constant, $H_0$, across the sky. The authors\nutilised galaxy cluster scaling relations between various cosmology-dependent\ncluster properties and a cosmology-independent property, i.e., the temperature\nof the intracluster gas $(T)$. A position-dependent systematic bias of $T$\nmeasurements can, in principle, result in an overestimation of apparent $H_0$\nvariations. In this study, we search for directional $T$ measurement biases by\nexamining the scaling relation between the member galaxy velocity dispersion\nand the gas temperature $(\\sigma_\\mathrm{v}-T)$. Additionally, we search for\napparent $H_0$ angular variations independently of $T$ by analysing the\nrelations between the X-ray luminosity and Sunyaev-Zeldovich signal with the\nvelocity dispersion, $L_\\mathrm{X}-\\sigma_\\mathrm{v}$ and\n$Y_\\mathrm{SZ}-\\sigma_\\mathrm{v}$. We utilise Monte Carlo simulations of\nisotropic cluster samples to quantify the statistical significance of any\nobserved anisotropies. We find no significant directional $T$ measurement\nbiases, and the probability that a directional $T$ bias causes the previously\nobserved $H_0$ anisotropy is only $0.002\\%$. On the other hand, from the joint\nanalysis of the $L_\\mathrm{X}-\\sigma_\\mathrm{v}$ and\n$Y_\\mathrm{SZ}-\\sigma_\\mathrm{v}$ relations, the maximum variation of $H_0$ is\nfound in the direction of $(295^\\circ\\pm71^\\circ, -30^\\circ\\pm71^\\circ)$ with a\nstatistical significance of $3.64\\sigma$, fully consistent with\narXiv:2103.13904. Our findings strongly corroborate the previously detected\nspatial anisotropy of galaxy cluster scaling relations using a new independent\ncluster property, $\\sigma_\\mathrm{v}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"brV_0H7fdBq1xztDxnLl73nSg52hI8ybgnRy-sk6KwE","pdfSize":"17625700"}
