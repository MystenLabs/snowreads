In this\nwork we specifically focus on biological systems which may be represented as\nchemical reaction networks and consider their infinitesimal homeostasis, where\nthe derivative of the input-output function is zero. The specific challenge of\nchemical reaction networks is that they often obey various conservation laws\ncomplicating the standard input-output analysis. We derive several results that\nallow to verify the existence of infinitesimal homeostasis points both in the\nabsence of conservation and under conservation laws where conserved quantities\nserve as input parameters. In particular, we introduce the notion of\ninfinitesimal concentration robustness, where the output variable remains\nnearly constant despite fluctuations in the conserved quantities. We provide\nseveral examples of chemical networks which illustrate our results both in\ndeterministic and stochastic settings.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
