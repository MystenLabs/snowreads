In many experiments,\nshear bands have shown local density variations along their path, with a\ndistinct imbalance in magnitude between local densification and dilation.\nHowever, a comprehensive mechanistic understanding or theory to explain this\nasymmetry has been lacking until now. Here, we introduce a new model that\nconsists of a sequential arrangement of alternating topological 'charges',\ngenerating a dipolar field. The resulting microscopic displacement field, when\nintegrated into the deformation gradient tensor, provides an accurate\nanalytical solution for the observed imbalances in the density variations. The\nimplications of this method are discussed, highlighting the potential to\nelucidate a broader range of observations in shear bands.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
