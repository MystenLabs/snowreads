In addition we calculate the polarization asymmetry\n$R_C=-0.441(15)$ in cold neutron-deuteron capture to NNLO in EFT($\\pi \\!\\!/$),\nin agreement with the experimental value of $R_C=-0.42\\pm 0.03$ [M. W.\nKonijnenberg et al. in Phys. Lett. B 205, 215 (1988)]. We also assess the\ndependence of $R_C$ on different fits of the two-nucleon magnetic currents.\nFinally, we consider the impact of Wigner-SU(4) symmetry and demonstrate that\nstarting from the Wigner-SU(4) symmetric limit and including perturbative\ncorrections to the breaking of Wigner-SU(4) symmetry does a good job of\ndescribing two-body triton photodisintegration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
