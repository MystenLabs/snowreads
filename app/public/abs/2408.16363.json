This work studies those\nproperties and the relevant physics, using density functional calculations,\nMonte Carlo simulations, and $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics. Our results show\nthat Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer is in the Cr$^{3+}$ $t_{2g}^3$ state with $S$ =\n3/2 and Cu$^{1+}$ $3d^{10}$ with $S$ = 0. A ligand hole in the Se 4$p$ orbitals\ngives rise to metallic behavior and enhances the FM coupling between the local\nCr$^{3+}$ $S$ = 3/2 spins. The observed in-plane magnetic anisotropy primarily\narises from exchange anisotropy, which is associated with the Cr-Se-Cr\nitinerant ferromagnetism. In contrast, both single-ion anisotropy and shape\nmagnetic anisotropy contribute negligibly. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction is also quite weak, only about 3\\% of the intralayer exchange\nparameters. Our Monte Carlo simulations show a FM Curie temperature ($T_{\\rm\nC}$) of 190 K. Moreover, the monolayer exhibits a vertical FE polarization of\n1.79 pC/m and a FE polarization switching barrier of 182 meV/f.u., and the FE\nstate remains stable above 800 K as shown by $ab$ $initio$ molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Furthermore, a magnetoelectric coupling is partially manifested by\na magnetization rotation from in-plane to out-of-plane associated with a\nFE-to-paraelectric transition. The magnetization rotation can also be induced\nby either hole or electron doping, and the hole doping increases the $T_{\\rm\nC}$ up to 238 K. In addition, tensile strain reduces the FE polarization but\nenhances $T_{\\rm C}$ to 290 K, while a compressive strain gives an opposite\neffect. Therefore, the multiferroic metallic Cu(CrSe$_2$)$_2$ monolayer may be\nexplored for advanced multifunctional electronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
