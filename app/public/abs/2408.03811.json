While traditional ASAS systems relied on rule-based algorithms or\ncomplex deep learning methods, recent advancements in Generative Language\nModels (GLMs) offer new opportunities for improvement. This study explores the\napplication of GLMs to ASAS, leveraging their off-the-shelf capabilities and\nperformance in various domains. We propose a novel pipeline that combines\nvector databases, transformer-based encoders, and GLMs to enhance short answer\nscoring accuracy. Our approach stores training responses in a vector database,\nretrieves semantically similar responses during inference, and employs a GLM to\nanalyze these responses and determine appropriate scores. We further optimize\nthe system through fine-tuned retrieval processes and prompt engineering.\nEvaluation on the SemEval 2013 dataset demonstrates a significant improvement\non the SCIENTSBANK 3-way and 2-way tasks compared to existing methods,\nhighlighting the potential of GLMs in advancing ASAS technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pTEXlQh_Na76KOeKLGMMM8iQT81O7OKEkG0ZTBdAWbk","pdfSize":"1880913"}
