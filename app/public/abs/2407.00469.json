Low waveguide losses are measured\ndown to at least 320 nm, where we achieve 1.6 dB/cm. This allows us to\ndemonstrate broadband amplitude modulators based on piezoelectrically actuated\nMEMS cantilever phase-shifters down to 320 nm, with a high extinction ratio of\n30 dB. We further demonstrate the versatility of the platform by designing and\ndemonstrating a modulator that can work with high extinction and low loss at\n320 nm and 420 nm, simultaneously, demonstrating control of multiple, disparate\nwavelengths in one device. We also demonstrate narrow-band resonant racetrack\nmodulators with quality factors of 4.7E5 and a tuning rate of 27.5 MHz/V. These\nresults should open doors for a range of novel applications in UV photonics,\nquantum science, sensing and spectroscopy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
