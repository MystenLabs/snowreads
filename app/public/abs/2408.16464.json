In\nthis work, we propose a novel fusion algorithm that optimally finds the weight\nto combine the time-of-arrival (ToA) and angle-of-arrival (AoA) likelihood\nprobability density function (PDF) of multiple BSs. In particular, we employ a\nlog-linear pooling function that fuses all BSs' PDFs using a weighted geometric\naverage. We formulated an optimization problem that minimizes the Reverse\nKullback Leibler Divergence (RKLD) and proposed an iterative algorithm based on\nthe Monte Carlo importance sampling (MCIS) approach to obtain the optimal\nfusion weights. Numerical results verify that our proposed fusion scheme with\noptimal weights outperforms the existing benchmark in terms of positioning\naccuracy in both unbiased (line-of-sight only) and biased (multipath-rich\nenvironment) scenarios.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
