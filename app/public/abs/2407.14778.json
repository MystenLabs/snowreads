We propose minimax optimal methods of estimating\nthe $\\ell_2$ norm of ${\\boldsymbol \\theta}$ and testing the hypothesis $H_0:\n{\\boldsymbol \\theta}=0$ against sparse alternatives when only partial\ninformation about ${\\boldsymbol \\Sigma}$ is available, such as an upper bound\non its Frobenius norm and the values of its diagonal entries to within an\nunknown scaling factor. We show that the minimax rates of the estimation and\ntesting are leveraged not by the dimension of the problem but by the value of\nthe Frobenius norm of ${\\boldsymbol \\Sigma}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
