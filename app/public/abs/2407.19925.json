In this paper, we give an analogue of\nMachado's distance formula for bounded weighted vector-valued functions. A\nnumber of applications are given; in particular, some types of the\nBishop--Stone--Weierstrass theorem for bounded vector-valued continuous spaces\nin the uniform topology are discussed; the splitting of $C(I \\times J, X\n\\otimes Y)$ as the closure of $C(I, X) \\otimes C(J, Y)$ in different senses and\nthe extension of continuous vector-valued functions are studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
