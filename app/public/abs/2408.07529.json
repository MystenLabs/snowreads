In this work, we numerically\noptimize the rate of these interventions: the number of stabilizer measurement\nrounds for a logical qubit encoded in a surface code patch and idling for a\ngiven time. We model the environmental noise on the circuit level, including\ngate errors, readout errors, amplitude and phase damping. We find,\nqualitatively, that the optimal number of stabilizer measurement rounds is\ngetting smaller for better qubits and getting larger for better gates or larger\ncode sizes. We discuss the implications of our results to some of the leading\narchitectures, superconducting qubits, and neutral atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
