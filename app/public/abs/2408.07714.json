For these\ncalculations, we have treated photon as a state of quark anti-quark pair and\nrepresent the TMDs in explicit form of helicity amplitudes. We have presented\nall the T-even TMDs for the photon being massless (real) and massive (virtual).\nWe have also compared our longitudinally and transversely polarized TMDs\nresults for different photon masses. The collinear parton distribution\nfunctions (PDFs) have been predicted for both the real and virtual photon\ncases. The results for the unpolarized PDF of our calculations are in good\nagreement with other model predictions. In addition to this, we have also\ndiscussed the spin-spin correlations between the quark and photon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
