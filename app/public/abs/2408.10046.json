However, existing CIL methods typically\npresume the availability of complete ground-truth labels throughout the\ntraining process, an assumption rarely met in practical applications.\nConsequently, this paper explores a more challenging problem of unsupervised\nclass incremental learning (UCIL). The essence of addressing this problem lies\nin effectively capturing comprehensive feature representations and discovering\nunknown novel classes. To achieve this, we first model the knowledge of class\ndistribution by exploiting fine-grained prototypes. Subsequently, a granularity\nalignment technique is introduced to enhance the unsupervised class discovery.\nAdditionally, we proposed a strategy to minimize overlap between novel and\nexisting classes, thereby preserving historical knowledge and mitigating the\nphenomenon of catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments on the five\ndatasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms current\nstate-of-the-art methods, indicating the effectiveness of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
