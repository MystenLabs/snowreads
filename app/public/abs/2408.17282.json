With the deployment of 5G and 6G\non the horizon, wireless communication is advancing to higher frequencies and\nlarger bandwidths enabling higher speeds and throughput. Current micro-acoustic\nresonator technology, a key component in radiofrequency front end filters, is\nstruggling to keep pace with these developments. This work presents a novel\nacoustic resonator architecture enabling multi-frequency, low-loss, and\nwideband filtering for the 5G and future 6G bands located above 3 GHz. Thanks\nto the exceptional performance of these resonators, filters for the 5G n77 and\nn79 bands are demonstrated, exhibiting fractional bandwidths of 13% and 25%\nrespectively with low insertion loss of around 1 dB. With its unique frequency\nscalability and wideband capabilities, the reported architecture offers a\npromising option for filtering and multiplexing in future mobile devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
