However, the\npresence of equivalent mutants is known to introduce redundant cost and bias\nissues, hindering the effectiveness of mutation testing in practical use.\nAlthough numerous equivalent mutant detection (EMD) techniques have been\nproposed, they exhibit limitations due to the scarcity of training data and\nchallenges in generalizing to unseen mutants. Recently, large language models\n(LLMs) have been extensively adopted in various code-related tasks and have\nshown superior performance by more accurately capturing program semantics. Yet\nthe performance of LLMs in equivalent mutant detection remains largely unclear.\nIn this paper, we conduct an empirical study on 3,302 method-level Java mutant\npairs to comprehensively investigate the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs\nfor equivalent mutant detection. Specifically, we assess the performance of\nLLMs compared to existing EMD techniques, examine the various strategies of\nLLMs, evaluate the orthogonality between EMD techniques, and measure the time\noverhead of training and inference. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based\ntechniques significantly outperform existing techniques (i.e., the average\nimprovement of 35.69% in terms of F1-score), with the fine-tuned code embedding\nstrategy being the most effective. Moreover, LLM-based techniques offer an\nexcellent balance between cost (relatively low training and inference time) and\neffectiveness. Based on our findings, we further discuss the impact of model\nsize and embedding quality, and provide several promising directions for future\nresearch. This work is the first to examine LLMs in equivalent mutant\ndetection, affirming their effectiveness and efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
