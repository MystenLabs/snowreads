The output of the\nrefractrometer can be directly calibrated in terms of beam deflection angles\nusing ray transfer matrix analysis. This paper describes a novel way to\ncalibrate the refractrometer output in terms of the spatial wavenumbers of the\ntransverse intensity distribution of the laser beam. This is accomplished by\nreplacing the plasma with a gridded structure that modulates the transverse\nintensity of the beam, producing an intensity distribution with a known Fourier\nTransform. This calibration technique will generate a one-to-one mapping of\ndeflection angle to wavenumber and will enable measurement of the size of\nFourier space available to the system. The spectrum of wavenumbers generated\nwhen the laser beam passes through a high-energy density plasma may contain\ninformation about the types of density fluctuation that are present in the\nplasma.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
