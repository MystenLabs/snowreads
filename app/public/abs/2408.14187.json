However, the SGG model's performance in predicting more fine-grained\npredicates is hindered by a significant predicate bias. According to existing\nworks, the long-tail distribution of predicates in training data results in the\nbiased scene graph. However, the semantic overlap between predicate categories\nmakes predicate prediction difficult, and there is a significant difference in\nthe sample size of semantically similar predicates, making the predicate\nprediction more difficult. Therefore, higher requirements are placed on the\ndiscriminative ability of the model. In order to address this problem, this\npaper proposes Ensemble Predicate Decoding (EPD), which employs multiple\ndecoders to attain unbiased scene graph generation. Two auxiliary decoders\ntrained on lower-frequency predicates are used to improve the discriminative\nability of the model. Extensive experiments are conducted on the VG, and the\nexperiment results show that EPD enhances the model's representation capability\nfor predicates. In addition, we find that our approach ensures a relatively\nsuperior predictive capability for more frequent predicates compared to\nprevious unbiased SGG methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EuiNsg3OphGukhrF3jbVQy6SV0iXYwTsIyDOzbYCvAo","pdfSize":"665663"}
