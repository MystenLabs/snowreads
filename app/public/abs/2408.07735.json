We propose a silicon-on-insulator photonic chip\ncapable of coherently coupling the out-of-phase beamlets from the subapertures\nof a telescope pupil into an SMF. The photonic integrated circuit (PIC)\nconsists of an array of grating couplers that are used to inject light from\nfree space into single-mode waveguides on the chip. Metallic heaters modulate\nthe refractive index of a coiled section of the waveguides, facilitating the\nco-phasing of the propagating modes. The phased beamlets can then be coherently\ncombined to efficiently deliver the light to an output SMF. In an adaptive\noptics (AO) system, the phase corrector acts as a deformable mirror (DM)\ncommanded by a controller that takes phase measurements from a wavefront sensor\n(WFS). We present experimental results for the PIC tested on an AO testbed and\ncompare the performance to simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
