Due to the increasing interest in NLP, in this\npaper we try to condense research efforts for the automatic processing of Greek\nlanguage covering the last three decades. In particular, we list and briefly\ndiscuss related works, resources and tools, categorized according to various\nprocessing layers and contexts. We are not restricted to the modern form of\nGreek language but also cover Ancient Greek and various Greek dialects. This\nsurvey can be useful for researchers and students interested in NLP tasks,\nInformation Retrieval and Knowledge Management for the Greek language.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
