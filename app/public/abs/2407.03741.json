This\npaper focuses on the new family of capacity-achieving codes, Spinal codes, to\nprovide a comprehensive analysis framework to tightly upper bound the block\nerror rate (BLER) of Spinal codes in the finite block length (FBL) regime.\nFirst, we resort to a variant of the Gallager random coding bound to upper\nbound the BLER of Spinal codes over the fading channel. Then, this paper\nderives a new bound without resorting to the use of Gallager random coding\nbound, achieving provable tightness over the wide range of signal-to-noise\nratios (SNR). The derived BLER upper bounds in this paper are generalized,\nfacilitating the performance evaluations of Spinal codes over different types\nof fast fading channels. Over the Rayleigh, Nakagami-m, and Rician fading\nchannels, this paper explicitly derived the BLER upper bounds on Spinal codes\nas case studies. Based on the bounds, we theoretically reveal that the tail\ntransmission pattern (TTP) for ML-decoded Spinal codes remains optimal in terms\nof reliability performance. Simulations verify the tightness of the bounds and\nthe insights obtained.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
