The energy derived\nfrom a sequence of successful predictions can be recycled as an immediate\nincentive and resource, driving the enhancement of predictive capabilities in\nAI agents. We propose that, through a series of straightforward\nmeta-architectural adjustments, any unsupervised learning apparatus could\nachieve complete independence from external energy sources, evolving into a\nself-sustaining physical system with a strong intrinsic 'drive' for continual\nlearning. This concept, while still purely theoretical, is exemplified through\nthe autoencoder, a quintessential model for unsupervised efficient coding. We\nuse this model to demonstrate how progressive paradigm shifts can profoundly\nalter our comprehension of learning and intelligence. By reconceptualizing\nlearning as an energy-seeking process, we highlight the potential for achieving\ntrue autonomy in learning systems, thereby bridging the gap between algorithmic\nconcepts and physical models of intelligence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
