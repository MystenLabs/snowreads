However, in certain\nnon-Hermitian models topological winding naturally arise from the dynamical\nevolution of the system and related to a new form of geometric phase. Here we\ninvestigate dynamical topological winding in non-Hermitian photonic mesh\nlattices, where the mean survival time of an optical pulse circulating in\ncoupled fiber loops is quantized and robust against Hamiltonian deformations.\nThe suggested photonic model could provide an experimentally accessible\nplatform for the observation of non-Hermitian dynamical topological windings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
