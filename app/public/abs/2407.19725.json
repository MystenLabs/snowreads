Recently,\nproduct-PCA (PPCA) has been shown to possess the efficiency-loss free\nordering-robustness property: (i) in the absence of outliers, PPCA and PCA\nshare the same asymptotic distributions; (ii), in the presence of outliers,\nPPCA is more ordering-robust than PCA in estimating the leading eigenspace.\nPPCA is thus different from the conventional robust PCA methods, and may\ndeserve further investigations. In this article, we study the high-dimensional\nstatistical properties of the PPCA eigenvalues via the techniques of random\nmatrix theory. In particular, we derive the critical value for being distant\nspiked eigenvalues, the limiting values of the sample spiked eigenvalues, and\nthe limiting spectral distribution of PPCA. Similar to the case of PCA, the\nexplicit forms of the asymptotic properties of PPCA become available under the\nspecial case of the simple spiked model. These results enable us to more\nclearly understand the superiorities of PPCA in comparison with PCA. Numerical\nstudies are conducted to verify our results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
