In most cases, the\navailability of data is not a significant issue. However, for some contexts,\nsuch as in autonomous cyber defence, we require data efficient methods.\nRecently, Quantum Machine Learning and Boltzmann Machines have been proposed as\nsolutions to this challenge. In this work we build upon the pre-existing work\nto extend the use of Deep Boltzmann Machines to the cutting edge algorithm\nProximal Policy Optimisation in a Reinforcement Learning cyber defence\nenvironment. We show that this approach, when solved using a D-WAVE quantum\nannealer, can lead to a two-fold increase in data efficiency. We therefore\nexpect it to be used by the machine learning and quantum communities who are\nhoping to capitalise on data-efficient Reinforcement Learning methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
