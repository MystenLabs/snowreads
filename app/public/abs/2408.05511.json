It is an Abelian variety of complex dimension $2^{k}$ whose\ncovering space is the space of Dirac spinors, $\\Delta_{2k}$, for the Clifford\nalgebra $Cl(\\mathbb{C}^{2k})$ associated with the vector space\n$\\mathbb{C}^{2k}$. Fixing an isomorphism $\\rho:Cl(\\mathbb{C}^{2k})\\rightarrow\nEnd (\\Delta_{2k})$, we define Clifford multiplication on $S_{\\Delta_{2k}}$ as\nthe actions of those endomorphisms in the image of $\\rho$ that preserve the\nfull rank lattice. We analyze the properties of that Clifford multiplication on\nthe 2-torsion points of the Dirac spinor torus. We identify the Clifford\nactions with permutation maps that represent all isomorphism classes of these\nactions on the group of 2-torsion points. We provide a structure theorem\ndescribing these isomorphism classes of Clifford actions in a way that is\nindependent of the choice of representatives. We conclude by extending the\nscope of our analysis to the group of $n$-torsion points and analyzing the\nfixed points and translation constants of entry-permuting maps, a broader class\nof actions of which the Clifford actions on the 2-torsion points of\n$S_{\\Delta_{2k}}$ is a subset.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
