In\npractice, DTs require proper modeling, coherent development and seamless\ndeployment along cloud and edge landscapes relying on established patterns to\nreduce operational costs. In this work, we propose KTWIN a Kubernetes-based\nServerless Platform for Digital Twins. KTWIN was developed using the\nstate-of-the-art open-source Cloud Native tools, allowing DT operators to\neasily define models through open standards and configure details of the\nunderlying services and infrastructure. The experiments carried out with the\ndeveloped prototype show that KTWIN can provide a higher level of abstraction\nto model and deploy a Digital Twin use case without compromising the solution\nscalability. The tests performed also show cost savings ranging between 60% and\n80% compared to overprovisioned scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BNpu-VPwqGLhCy2cdSoIgNm51G9u4eXUZVGRzWMPsxw","pdfSize":"1560305","txDigest":"BEg37um2U2txSEGjf9Li1DkWzKV3avTi8gpAAt172N6j","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
