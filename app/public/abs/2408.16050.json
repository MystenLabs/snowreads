In\nthis study, through the comparison of different timescales, we chart the\nevolutionary outcomes of these AGN stars as a function of disk radius and\nacross a range of supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses, spanning from $10^6$\nto $10^9 \\rm M_\\odot$, for two popular AGN disk models. We find that, in the\nouter regions of the disk, stars evolve similarly to those in the interstellar\nmedium, but in the inner and denser regions accretion quickly turns low-mass\nstars into massive stars, and their fate depends on just how quickly they\naccrete. If accretion occurs at a faster rate than nuclear burning, they can\nreach a quasi-steady `immortal' state. If stars accrete faster than they can\nthermally adjust, runaway accretion occurs, potentially preventing a\nquasi-steady state and altering the disk structure. During the AGN lifetime, in\nthe regions of the disk that produce massive stars, supernovae (SNe) and\nGamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) may occur within the disk over a wide range of optical\ndepths and ambient densities. Subsequently, in the final phase of the AGN, as\nthe disk becomes depleted, formerly immortal stars will be unable to replenish\ntheir fuel, leading to additional SNe and GRBs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
