This paper illuminates a key\naspect of these works, the behaviour of the canonical module under deformations\nin this moduli space. We demonstrate that even when there is no natural\ngeometry around, we can give a viewpoint that behaves like it, effectively\nconstructing geometry out of nothing, giving interpretation to intersection\nnumbers without cycles. Moreover, we explore some properties of this\nnormalization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
