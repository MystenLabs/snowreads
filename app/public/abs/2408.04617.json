To estimate treatment effects, DiD relies on the\n\"parallel trends assumption\", that on average treatment and comparison groups\nwould have had parallel trajectories in the absence of an intervention.\nHistorically, DiD has been considered broadly applicable and straightforward to\nimplement, but recent years have seen rapid advancements in DiD methods. This\npaper reviews and synthesizes these innovations for medical and health policy\nresearchers. We focus on four topics: (1) assessing the parallel trends\nassumption in health policy contexts; (2) relaxing the parallel trends\nassumption when appropriate; (3) employing estimators to account for staggered\ntreatment timing; and (4) conducting robust inference for analyses in which\nnormal-based clustered standard errors are inappropriate. For each, we explain\nchallenges and common pitfalls in traditional DiD and modern methods available\nto address these issues.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
