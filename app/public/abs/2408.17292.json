We highlight\nthe conceptual and practical advantages that these systems offer to the\nexperimental observation of the phenomenon, namely the massive nature of\nelementary excitations and the experimental accessibility of the different\nquadratures of the spin excitations. In particular, we go beyond the\nrelativistic regimes previously addressed in the literature, and identify\nvarious observables that show a signature of the Hawking process, as well as\nadditional features associated with the massive nature of the modes, such as\nundulations. Semi-analytical calculations of the scattering properties of the\nhorizon and of two-point correlation functions of the emitted radiation in an\nideal stationary setup are supported by time-dependent numerical simulations\nbased on Gross-Pitaevskii and Bogoliubov theory.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
