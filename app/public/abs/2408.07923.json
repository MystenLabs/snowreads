A Computational Complexity Result","authors":"Zachary Wojtowicz","authorsParsed":[["Wojtowicz","Zachary",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 15 Aug 2024 04:22:46 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-16","timestamp":1723695766000,"abstract":"  As generative foundation models improve, they also tend to become more\npersuasive, raising concerns that AI automation will enable governments, firms,\nand other actors to manipulate beliefs with unprecedented scale and\neffectiveness at virtually no cost. The full economic and social ramifications\nof this trend have been difficult to foresee, however, given that we currently\nlack a complete theoretical understanding of why persuasion is costly for human\nlabor to produce in the first place. This paper places human and AI agents on a\ncommon conceptual footing by formalizing informational persuasion as a\nmathematical decision problem and characterizing its computational complexity.\nA novel proof establishes that persuasive messages are challenging to discover\n(NP-Hard) but easy to adopt if supplied by others (NP). This asymmetry helps\nexplain why people are susceptible to persuasion, even in contexts where all\nrelevant information is publicly available. The result also illuminates why\nlitigation, strategic communication, and other persuasion-oriented activities\nhave historically been so human capital intensive, and it provides a new\ntheoretical basis for studying how AI will impact various industries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
