The nucleation and growth of\nHe/H gas bubbles (along with their isotopes) can result from impinging fluxes\nof these gases which give rise to damage at the W divertor surface. The\ninclusion of He or H in W has been studied extensively by the community,\nfinding that He bubbles modify the surface through periodic dislocation\npunching and bursting mechanisms while H bubbles impact the metal through\nplastic-strain induced material failure. However, the mechanisms which are\npresent during the combined flux of both He and H is not well-studied\natomistically. Motivated by this, an atomistic modeling study is conducted\nusing molecular dynamics to assess the behavior of mixed concentration He:H\nbubbles in W. We find that the introduction of H into a growing He bubble\nresults in a dramatic change in the nature and presence of dislocation loops\nwhich are typically generated via dislocation punching in over-pressurized He\nbubbles. Most notably, at high H concentrations, there is a switchover in\nenergetic favorability from glissile 1/2$<$111$>$ dislocations to sessile\n$<$100$>$ dislocations. This thermodynamic crossover could imply a significant\nreduction in W surface morphology changes than with pure He bubbles and,\nadditionally, we show this to have implications on the trapping of H in the\nbubbles and their associated dislocations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
