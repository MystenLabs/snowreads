Further, based on the recently developed theory of stable sets, we\nintroduce the notion of random complete normal structure so that we can prove\nthe two deeper theorems: one of which states that random complete normal\nstructure is equivalent to random normal structure for an $L^0$-convexly\ncompact set in a complete random normed module; the other of which states that\nif $G$ is an $L^0$-convexly compact subset with random normal structure of a\ncomplete random normed module, then every commutative family of nonexpansive\nmappings from $G$ to $G$ has a common fixed point. We also consider the fixed\npoint problems for isometric mappings in complete random normed modules.\nFinally, as applications of the fixed point theorems established in random\nnormed modules, when the measurable selection theorems fail to work, we can\nstill prove that a family of strong random nonexpansive operators from\n$(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P)\\times C$ to $C$ has a common random fixed point, where\n$(\\Omega,\\mathcal{F},P)$ is a probability space and $C$ is a weakly compact\nconvex subset with normal structure of a Banach space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
