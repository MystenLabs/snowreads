STRIDE aims to propel\nbipedal robotics research and education by providing a cost-effective\nimplementation with step-by-step instructions for building a bipedal robotic\nplatform while providing flexible customizations via a modular and durable\ndesign. Moreover, a versatile terrain setup and a quantitative disturbance\ninjection system are augmented to the robot platform to replicate natural\nterrains and push forces that can be used to evaluate legged locomotion in\npractical and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate the functionalities of this\nplatform by realizing an adaptive step-to-step dynamics based walking\ncontroller to achieve dynamic walking. Our work with the open-soured\nimplementation shows that STRIDE is a highly versatile and durable platform\nthat can be used in research and education to evaluate locomotion algorithms,\nmechanical designs, and robust and adaptative controls.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
