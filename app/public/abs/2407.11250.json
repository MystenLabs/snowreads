These outcomes can seemingly be improved through the actions\nof altruistic agents, which benefit other agents in the system. However, it is\nknown in specific contexts that altruistic agents can actually induce worse\noutcomes compared to a fully selfish population -- a phenomenon we term\naltruistic perversity. This paper provides a holistic investigation into the\nnecessary conditions that give rise to altruistic perversity. In particular, we\nstudy the class of two-strategy population games where one sub-population is\naltruistic and the other is selfish. We find that a population game can admit\naltruistic perversity only if the associated social welfare function is convex\nand the altruistic population is sufficiently large. Our results are a first\nstep in establishing a connection between properties of nominal agent\ninteractions and the potential impacts from altruistic behaviors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
