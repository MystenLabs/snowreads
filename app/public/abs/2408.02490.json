This study investigates the influence of microgel\nsoftness, controlled by varying the crosslinking density during synthesis via\nfree radical polymerization (FRP), on the difference between the volume phase\ntransition temperature (VPTT) and the electrokinetic transition temperature\n(ETT). These transition temperatures mark the points at which the microgel size\nand surface charge, respectively, undergo significant alterations in response\nto temperature. Here, we investigate this phenomenon, employing dynamic light\nscattering (DLS) and electrophoretic light scattering (ELS) measurements to\ncharacterize the size and electrophoretic mobility response of pNIPAM microgels\nwith different crosslinking densities as a function of temperature. By\nanalyzing the observed trends in the difference between the transition\ntemperatures, we aim to develop a hypothesis that provides a deeper physical\nunderstanding of the microgel structure and its relationship to transition\ntemperatures. This investigation thus sheds light on the intricate interplay\nbetween microgel structure and its thermoresponsive behavior, offering insights\nfor the design and optimization of pNIPAM microgels for future applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
