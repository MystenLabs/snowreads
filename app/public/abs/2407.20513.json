It\nleverages large language models to generate declarative programs in the\nDomiKnowS framework. The programs in this framework express concepts and their\nrelationships as a graph in addition to logical constraints between them. The\ngraph, later, can be connected to trainable neural models according to those\nspecifications. Our proposed pipeline utilizes techniques like dynamic\nin-context demonstration retrieval, model refinement based on feedback from a\nsymbolic parser, visualization, and user interaction to generate the tasks'\nstructure and formal knowledge representation. This approach empowers domain\nexperts, even those not well-versed in ML/AI, to formally declare their\nknowledge to be incorporated in customized neural models in the DomiKnowS\nframework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
