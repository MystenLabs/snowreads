Our research shows that\nthese algebras are related to many interesting identities. In particular, they\nare related to anti-Poisson-Jordan algebras and algebras of associative type\n$\\sigma$. We study algebras of associative type $\\sigma$ to be Koszul and\nself-dual. A basis of the free shift associative algebra generated by a\ncountable set $X$ was constructed. An analog of Wedderburn-Artin's theorem was\nestablished. The algebraic and geometric classifications of complex\n$4$-dimensional shift associative algebras are given. In particular, we proved\nthat the first non-associative shift associative algebra appears only in\ndimension $5$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"Of0O_Sa1FTQ-DOYARxH6vmb11lXiyeHoYAUX5Ocju-E","pdfSize":"275511"}
