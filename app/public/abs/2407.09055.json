This\npaper explores both traditional and more recent approaches to graph clustering.\nFirstly, key concepts and definitions in graph theory are introduced. The\nbackground section covers essential topics, including graph Laplacians and the\nintegration of Deep Learning in graph analysis. The paper then delves into\ntraditional clustering methods, including Spectral Clustering and the Leiden\nalgorithm. Following this, state-of-the-art clustering techniques that leverage\ndeep learning are examined. A comprehensive comparison of these methods is made\nthrough experiments. The paper concludes with a discussion of the practical\napplications of graph clustering and potential future research directions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
