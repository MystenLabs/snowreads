We\nstudy the UV completion of nTGCs in a renormalizable model with vector-like\nheavy fermions. We compute the one-loop heavy fermion contributions to nTGC\nvertices by matching them to dimension-8 operators in the low energy limit.\nSuch fermion loops contain either heavy fermions only or mixture of heavy\nfermions with light SM fermions. We find that their contributions can induce\ndimension-8 nTGC effective operators containing two SM Higgs-doublet fields,\nwhich are formulated with a complete set of 7 dimension-8 operators generating\noff-shell CP-even nTGCs. We present the results in terms of SMEFT coefficients\nand in terms of nTGC vertices (form factors) with two on-shell gauge bosons. In\nthe heavy-light mixing case there appear terms that cannot be accommodated by\nconventional parametrizations of form factors due to extra logarithmic\ncorrections. We further discuss the implications for probing such UV dynamics\nvia nTGCs at the high energy colliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Yw9wLPGnf2e6GPDhIyV2qoztb7kCMs6oi_Fc_DuG1SI","pdfSize":"711165"}
