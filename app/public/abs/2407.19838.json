In contrast to the rapid\nadvancement of protein design methods, the work related to RNA is more\ndemanding. Most current RNA design approaches concentrate on specified target\nattributes and rely on extensive experimental searches. However, these methods\nremain costly and inefficient due to practical limitations. In this paper, we\ncharacterize all sequence design issues as conditional generation tasks and\noffer parameterized representations for multiple problems. For these problems,\nwe have developed a universal RNA sequence generation model based on flow\nmatching, namely RNACG. RNACG can accommodate various conditional inputs and is\nportable, enabling users to customize the encoding network for conditional\ninputs as per their requirements and integrate it into the generation network.\nWe evaluated RNACG in RNA 3D structure inverse folding, 2D structure inverse\nfolding, family-specific sequence generation, and 5'UTR translation efficiency\nprediction. RNACG attains superior or competitive performance on these tasks\ncompared with other methods. RNACG exhibits extensive applicability in sequence\ngeneration and property prediction tasks, providing a novel approach to RNA\nsequence design and potential methods for simulation experiments with\nlarge-scale RNA sequence data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
