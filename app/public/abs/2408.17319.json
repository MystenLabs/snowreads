By performing an expansion\naround the UV-propagator in an Euclidean space, we manage to build\ncounter-terms to cancel the non-integrable terms in the UV limit. This\nprocedure is then combined with the so-called causal representation, and the UV\nexpansion is performed at the level of on-shell energies. The resulting\nexpressions are more compact, and they retain nice properties of the original\ncausal representation. The proposed formalism is tested up to three-loops, with\nrelevant families of topologies. In all the cases, we successfully cancel the\nUV divergences and achieve a smooth numerical implementation. These results\nconstitute a first step towards a new renormalisation program in four\nspace-time dimensions (by-passing DREG), perfectly suitable for fully numerical\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CsmY_dLA32VAqu_amfqpTsNood7--sgbXP-f6wTXaGo","pdfSize":"465887"}
