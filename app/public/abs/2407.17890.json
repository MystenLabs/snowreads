We present a direct\ntranslation including differential identities, integration theorems and various\nalgebraic identities.\n  As an illustrative example, we present the case of classical electrodynamics\nin both formalism and finish with their description of GR.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
