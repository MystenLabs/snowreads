Utilizing these precise expressions, we examine the relationship\nbetween the Lin-Lu-Yau curvature and the 0-Ollivier-Ricci curvature, resulting\nin an equality condition on regular graphs. This condition allows us to\ncharacterize edges that are bone idle in regular graphs of girth four and to\nconstruct a family of bone idle graphs with this girth. We then use our\nformulas to provide an efficient implementation of the Ollivier-Ricci curvature\non regular graphs, enabling us to identify all bone idle, regular graphs with\nfewer than 15 vertices. Moreover, we establish a rigidity theorem for cocktail\nparty graphs, proving that a regular graph is a cocktail party graph if and\nonly if its Lin-Lu-Yau curvature is equal to one. We conclude this work by\npresenting a condition on the degree of a regular graph that guarantees\npositive Ricci curvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
