We provide a theoretical\nanalysis of the convergence properties of the proposed algorithm and show its\neffectiveness for several examples, including Lorenz and Burgers' equations. In\nour numerical simulations, we further specialize the underpinning neural\narchitecture to Random Projection Neural Networks (RPNNs), a 2-layer neural\nnetwork where the first layer weights are drawn at random rather than\noptimized. This restriction substantially increases the efficiency of fitting\nRPNN's weights in comparison to a standard feedforward network without\nnegatively impacting the accuracy, as demonstrated in the SIR system example.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GwX_le3SktgvvjvHu0cVu7FgAJFbNJEX3trmwTqdyt0","pdfSize":"2368032"}
