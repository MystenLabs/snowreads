We prove that a compact\nset in the plane is $S$-removable if and only if there exists a quasiconformal\nmap from the plane onto a metric surface that maps the given set to a set of\nlinear measure zero. The statement fails if we consider maps into the plane\nrather than metric surfaces. Moreover, we prove that a set is $S$-removable\n(resp. $CH$-removable) if and only if every homeomorphism from the plane onto a\nmetric surface (resp. reciprocal metric surface) that is quasiconformal in the\ncomplement of the given set is quasiconformal everywhere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
