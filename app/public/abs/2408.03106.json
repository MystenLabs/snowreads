The framework of kinetic theory\nis used to define the perfect-fluid description that conserves baryon number,\nenergy, linear momentum and spin part of angular momentum. This leads to the\nentropy conservation although, in the presence of spin degrees of freedom, the\nperfect-fluid formalism includes extra terms whose structure is usually\nattributed to dissipation. The genuine dissipative terms appear from the\ncondition of positive entropy production in non-equilibrium processes. They are\nresponsible for the transfer between the spin and orbital parts of angular\nmomentum, with the total angular momentum being conserved.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GiGwZPhJlriSr2VOCSJtn_eagzuxcr0MPC7WDGNGUGA","pdfSize":"385679"}
