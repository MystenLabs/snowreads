At the brain scale, these\nprotein assemblies can diffuse through the brain and seed other regions,\ncreating an autocatalytic protein progression. The growth and transport of\nthese assemblies depend on various mechanisms that can be targeted\ntherapeutically. Here, we use spatially-extended\nnucleation-aggregation-fragmentation models for the dynamics of prion-like\nneurodegenerative protein-spreading in the brain to study the effect of\ndifferent drugs on whole-brain Alzheimer's disease progression.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
