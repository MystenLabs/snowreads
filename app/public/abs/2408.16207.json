We also show that in every abelian group of order at least 4\nthere exists a sequence containing each non-identity element of $G$ exactly\ntwice such that the consecutive sums also contain each non-identity element of\n$G$ twice. We apply several results to the existence of transversals in Latin\nsquares.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
