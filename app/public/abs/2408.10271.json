However, the lack of sufficiently large\ndatasets continues to hinder the application of certain machine learning\ntechniques. In this paper, we use simulated data to investigate the ability of\nneural networks to parameterize dynamics in fire science. In particular, we\ninvestigate neural networks that map five key parameters in fire spread to the\nfirst arrival time, and the corresponding inverse problem. By using simulated\ndata, we are able to characterize the error, the required dataset size, and the\nconvergence properties of these neural networks. For the inverse problem, we\nquantify the network's sensitivity in estimating each of the key parameters.\nThe findings demonstrate the potential of machine learning in fire science,\nhighlight the challenges associated with limited dataset sizes, and quantify\nthe sensitivity of neural networks to estimate key parameters governing fire\nspread dynamics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
