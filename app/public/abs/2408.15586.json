The fluid dynamics are governed by\ngravity-driven incompressible micropolar equations. We investigate the global\nwell-posedness for both the cases with and without surface tension. On one\nhand, in the case with surface tension (i.e. {\\sigma} > 0), we show that the\nglobal solution decays to the equilibrium exponentially. On the other hand, in\nthe case without surface tension (i.e. {\\sigma} = 0), the solution decays to\nthe equilibrium at an almost exponential rate. Comparing the two different\ncases for {\\sigma} > 0 and {\\sigma} = 0 reveals that the surface tension can\nenhance the decay rate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
