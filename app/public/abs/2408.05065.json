Most existing spatial transcriptomics\n(ST) technologies cannot achieve single-cell resolution, making it challenging\nto accurately determine cell types. To address this issue, various\ndeconvolution methods have been developed. Most of these methods use\nsingle-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data from the same tissue as a reference\nto infer cell types in ST data spots. However, they often overlook the\ndifferences between scRNA-seq and ST data. To overcome this limitation, we\npropose a Masked Adversarial Neural Network (MACD). MACD employs adversarial\nlearning to align real ST data with simulated ST data generated from scRNA-seq\ndata. By mapping them into a unified latent space, it can minimize the\ndifferences between the two types of data. Additionally, MACD uses masking\ntechniques to effectively learn the features of real ST data and mitigate\nnoise. We evaluated MACD on 32 simulated datasets and 2 real datasets,\ndemonstrating its accuracy in performing cell type deconvolution.
