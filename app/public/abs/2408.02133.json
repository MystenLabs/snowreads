Compared with official API\ndocumentation, which is often incomplete or out-of-date, Stack Overflow (SO)\ndiscussions possess a wealth of version knowledge that has not been explored by\nprevious approaches. To bridge this gap, we present Decide, a web-based\nvisualization of a knowledge graph that contains 2,376 version knowledge\nextracted from SO discussions. As an interactive tool, Decide allows users to\neasily check whether two libraries are compatible and explore compatibility\nknowledge of certain DL stack components with or without the version specified.\nA video demonstrating the usage of Decide is available at\nhttps://youtu.be/wqPxF2ZaZo0.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
