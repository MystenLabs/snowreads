The framework\nleverages our novel integration of an adaptive remote center of motion (RCM)\nusing admittance control. This framework operates within a redundancy\nresolution method specifically designed for the RCM constraint. We introduce a\ncompact, low-cost, and modular custom-designed instrument module (IM) that\nensures integration with the manipulator, featuring a force-torque sensor, a\nsurgical instrument, and an actuation unit for driving the surgical instrument.\nThe paper details the complete teleoperation framework, including the\ntelemanipulation trajectory mapping, kinematic modelling, control strategy, and\nthe integrated admittance controller. Finally, the system capability to perform\nvarious surgical tasks was demonstrated, including passing a thread through the\nrings, picking and placing objects, and trajectory tracking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
