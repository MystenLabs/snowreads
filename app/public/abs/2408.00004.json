This is challenging since\nthe expected transcript format depends on the context, e.g., 1945 (year) vs.\n19:45 (timestamp). We compare cascaded and end-to-end approaches to recognize\nand format numeric expression, such as years, timestamps, currency amounts, and\nquantities. For the end-to-end approach we employed a data generation strategy\nusing a large language model (LLM) together with a text to speech (TTS) model\nto generate adaptation data. The results on our test dataset show that while\napproaches based on LLMs perform well on recognizing formatted numeric\nexpressions, adapted end-to-end models offer competitive performance with the\nadvantage of lower latency and inference cost.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Si--i8gVWDAr7OKKTQ0tLSlaivB3Ue-IlvN-zjxd7bE","pdfSize":"448074"}
