Over time, the\namount of time required to process new observations increases with the size of\nthe internal map, which may influence real-time processing. In this paper, we\npresent a novel real-time loop closure detection approach for large-scale and\nlong-term SLAM. Our approach is based on a memory management method that keeps\ncomputation time for each new observation under a fixed limit. Results\ndemonstrate the approach's adaptability and scalability using four standard\ndata sets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
