We measure Ly$\\alpha$\nemission line properties for a sample of $210$ $z\\simeq6.5-13$ galaxies, with\nredshifts confirmed independently of Ly$\\alpha$ in all cases. We present $3$\nnew detections of Ly$\\alpha$ emission in JWST spectra, including a large\nequivalent width (EW $=143\\ \\r{A}$) Ly$\\alpha$ emitter with strong CIV emission\n(EW $=21\\ \\r{A}$) at $z=7.1$ in GOODS-N. We measure the redshift-dependent\nLy$\\alpha$ EW distribution across our sample. We find that strong Ly$\\alpha$\nemission (EW $>25\\ \\r{A}$) becomes increasingly rare at earlier epochs,\nsuggesting that the transmission of Ly$\\alpha$ photons decreases by $4\\times$\nbetween $z\\simeq5$ and $z\\simeq9$. We describe potential implications for the\nIGM neutral fraction. There is significant field to field variance in the\nLy$\\alpha$ emitter fraction. In contrast to the three other fields, the EGS\nshows no evidence for reduced transmission of Ly$\\alpha$ photons at\n$z\\simeq7-8$, suggesting a significantly ionized sightline may be present in\nthe field. We use available NIRCam grism observations from the FRESCO survey to\ncharacterize overdensities on large scales around known Ly$\\alpha$ emitters in\nthe GOODS fields. The strongest overdensities appear linked with extremely\nstrong Ly$\\alpha$ detections (EW $>50\\ \\r{A}$) in most cases. Future Ly$\\alpha$\nspectroscopy with JWST has the potential to constrain the size of ionized\nregions around early galaxy overdensities, providing a new probe of the\nreionization process.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
