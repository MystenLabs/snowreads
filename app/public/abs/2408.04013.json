This paper focuses on the Dragon Boat Festival, a prominent event\nin Chinese cultural heritage, and proposes leveraging Virtual Reality (VR), to\nenhance its preservation and accessibility. Traditionally, participation in the\nfestival's dragon boat races was limited to elite athletes, excluding broader\ndemographics. Our proposed solution, named MetaDragonBoat, enables virtual\nparticipation in dragon boat racing, offering immersive experiences that\nreplicate physical exertion through a cultural journey. Thus, we build a\ndigital twin of a university campus located in a region with a rich dragon boat\nracing tradition. Coupled with three paddling techniques that are enabled by\neither commercial controllers or physical paddle controllers with haptic\nfeedback, diversified users can engage in realistic rowing experiences. Our\nresults demonstrate that by integrating resistance into the paddle controls,\nusers could simulate the physical effort of dragon boat racing, promoting a\ndeeper understanding and appreciation of this cultural heritage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C3NAbwhojOKsgJYchxzjK081300QO9CKQNK2VIn_nRU","pdfSize":"14081242"}
