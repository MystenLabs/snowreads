However, along with the number of antennas\neventually increased to be extremely large and one-hop communication distance\ngradually reduced, how to significantly increase the capacity for line-of-sight\n(LOS) MIMO becomes more and more urgent. In this article, we introduce the\nquasi-fractal uniform circular array (QF-UCA) antenna structure based MIMO\nwireless communications, which can adequately exploit the potential of MIMO in\nLOS channel and greatly increase the capacity with low complexity demodulation\nschemes. Specifically, three advantages regarding QF-UCA based LOS MIMO are\nreviewed. Then, research challenges on transceiver alignment, low-rank channel\nmatrix, extended dimensions of QF-UCA, maximum number of orthogonal streams,\nand the corresponding potential solutions are discussed. Compared with\ntraditional scattering-depended MIMO communications, the QF-UCA based LOS MIMO\nwireless communication can achieve high-efficient transmission in LOS channel.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
