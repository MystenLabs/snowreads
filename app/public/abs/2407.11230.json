In this study, we employ Molecular Electron Density Theory to\ntheoretically investigate the hetero-Diels-Alder reaction involving azatrienes\nwith ethyl vinyl ether and allenyl methyl ether. Analysis of Conceptual Density\nFunctional Theory, energetic profiles, and the topological characteristics is\nconducted to elucidate the reactions. The revealed mechanism manifests as a\npolar one-step two-stages process under kinetic control. We establish a clear\nrelationship of between the periselectivity, regioselectivity, and\nstereoselectivity on one hand and the characteristics of the reactions\nmechanism on the other hand. The influence of weak interactions on reaction\nactivation barriers and bonding evolution are discussed in detail. We\ndemonstrate that substituents enhancing the reverse electron density flux\nfacilitate the feasibility of the reactions. The results lay ground for a\nmeticulous control of the reaction of azatriene in similar synthetic scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M3yhveWbpF8WfH5tkOCIkR24TodKNsgrLgUvPzZXuKM","pdfSize":"1338541"}
