In this study, we report that the\nconfinement of a magnetic field occurs regardless of the dimensionality of the\nsystem, extending even to 1D linear potential systems. By utilizing a\nvector-field magnetic force microscope, we successfully create a\nvortex-antivortex pair connected by a 1D unquantized magnetic flux in\nultra-thin superconducting films. Through an investigation of the manipulation\nand thermal behavior of the vortex pair, we uncover a long-range interaction\nmediated by the unquantized magnetic flux. These findings suggest a universal\nphenomenon of unquantized magnetic flux formation, independent of the geometry\nof the system. Our results present an experimental route for probing the impact\nof confinement on superconducting properties and order parameters in\nunconventional superconductors characterized by extremely low dimensionality.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
