For this to happen we assume essentially\nonly instability of the zero equilibrium. Methods of the Poincar\\'e-Bendixson\ntheory due to Mallet-Paret and Sell are combined with techniques used by\nWalther for the scalar case $(N = 0)$. Statements on the attractor location and\non parameter borders concerning stability and oscillation are included. The\nresults apply to models for gene regulatory systems, e.g. the `repressilator'\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
