Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Denoising Diffusion\nProbabilistic Models (DDPMs) represent significant advancements in generative\nmodeling, drawing inspiration from game theory and thermodynamics,\nrespectively. Nevertheless, the exploration of generative modeling through the\nlens of biological evolution remains largely untapped. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel family of models termed Generative Cellular Automata (GeCA),\ninspired by the evolution of an organism from a single cell. GeCAs are\nevaluated as an effective augmentation tool for retinal disease classification\nacross two imaging modalities: Fundus and Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT).\nIn the context of OCT imaging, where data is scarce and the distribution of\nclasses is inherently skewed, GeCA significantly boosts the performance of 11\ndifferent ophthalmological conditions, achieving a 12% increase in the average\nF1 score compared to conventional baselines. GeCAs outperform both diffusion\nmethods that incorporate UNet or state-of-the art variants with\ntransformer-based denoising models, under similar parameter constraints.
