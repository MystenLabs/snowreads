It is shown that the gas and the liquid\ncorrespond to regimes with clearly distinct rheological responses. A\nmicroscopic interpretation of what happens at the transition in terms of the\ntime scales relevant to the various physical processes is also presented and\nput the test against numerical data. Our work calls for more experiments to\ntest our predictions on real systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NuT8A03Y0Agq1D_I_-vOEko-6Ghp0r728yNLkKlXBQU","pdfSize":"2151166"}
