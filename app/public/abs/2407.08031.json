Ollivier's coarse Ricci curvature, we introduce a novel\nconcept of coarse extrinsic curvature on Riemannian submanifolds. This is\ndefined through Wasserstein distances between test probability measures\nsupported in the tubular neighbourhood of the submanifold. This framework\nprovides an understanding of the geometric properties of embeddings, offering\nvaluable insights into their curvature dynamics and intrinsic structures.\nAdditionally, this coarse curvature can also be extracted from empirical\nmeasures supported on random point clouds generated by a Poisson point process,\nand has the potential to extend to metric embeddings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
