However, for certain\nalgebras, for example the group algebras, they behave the same way as the\ncharacteristic zero case at good enough prime. In this paper, we initiate the\nstudy of this topic by imposing increasingly strong hypotheses on basic\nalgebras. When the algebras satisfy the right hypotheses, we have equalities of\nthe dimensions of their cohomology groups between simple modules and equalities\nof graded Cartan numbers. The examples include the Solomon descent algebras of\nfinite Coxeter groups at large enough primes, nil-Coxeter algebra, and certain\nfinite semigroup algebras at an arbitrary prime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
