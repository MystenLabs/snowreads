Unfortunately, Rayleigh backscattering noise limits the\nsignal-to-noise ratio for Sagnac systems containing long fibers and lossy\nphotonic devices. Here, we solve this problem by sending optical pulses in long\non-off bursts and using time post-selection on measurements taken with free-run\nsingle-photon avalanche detectors. We also investigate the impact of the\nresidual phase noise uncompensated by the Sagnac structure and find that the\nvariance of the phase noise scales as loop length to the third power, verifying\nan existing calculation in the literature. We measure the interference\nvisibility in Sagnac loops of varying length without active phase or\npolarization stabilization and achieve > 97% visibility in 200 km\nultra-low-loss fiber, which is, to our knowledge, the longest fiber Sagnac\ninterferometer demonstrated. Our results indicate the suitability of a Sagnac\nsystem for long-distance TFQKD networks, an important step towards the\npractical implementation of metropolitan quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
