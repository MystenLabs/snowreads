There can be considerable local enhancement of\ndark matter density in the vicinity of gravitating centers, including the Sun,\nthe Earth, as well as other planets in the solar system. Generic mechanisms for\nthe formation of such halos were recently elucidated. In this work, we studies\nthe possible halo dark matter overdensities and corresponding dark matter\nmasses allowed for various objects in the solar system. We explore spacecraft\nmissions to detect such halos with instruments such as quantum clocks, atomic\nand molecular spectrometers designed to search for fast (tens of hertz to\ngigahertz) oscillations of fundamental constants, highly sensitive\ncomagnetometers, and other quantum sensors and sensor networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
