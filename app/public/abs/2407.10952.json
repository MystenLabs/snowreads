Through a case study\nin Guangzhou, China, we argue that demolishing a historic street to construct a\nnew subway station shows competing interests between local government's\npriority to facilitate spatial connectivity and locals' priority to maintain a\nplace for social interaction and memories. We measure the social costs of the\nnew subway station through a network lens, focusing on the loss of social ties\nand memories and low travel benefits of the new station for the local\npopulations. We find that 1) the demolition will remove many small businesses\nthat support locals' daily activities, social ties, and memories, and 2) the\nnew station reduces travel distance and increases route options for passengers\nfrom other areas of the city more than locals nearby the demolition site. Our\nresults contribute to a network-based framework and methodology to understand\nand contest inequality in expanding transportation network infrastructure in\ncities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bfn5maqtdbZREWwEjygp6Z6qdo6aHBDP4_Ukg3SUpH0","pdfSize":"5685195"}
