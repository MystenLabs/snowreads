This novel approach establishes a direct link\nbetween the energy density and anisotropic factor, providing a robust framework\nfor studying these exotic stellar objects. Employing an Extended Chaplygin Gas\nequation of state, we numerically compute interior solutions for both isotropic\nand anisotropic stars, revealing distinct differences in their properties.\nAdditionally, we examine the oscillation modes and frequencies of these stars,\nhighlighting the impact of anisotropy on their pulsational behavior. Our\nresults reveal distinct differences in the stellar properties, such as the\nmetric potentials, pressure, speed of sound, and relativistic adiabatic index,\nbetween the two cases. Furthermore, we calculate the large frequency separation\nfor the fundamental and first excited modes, offering insights relevant for\nfuture asteroseismology studies. Our findings shed light on the complex\ninterplay of gravity, matter, and anisotropy in compact stars, providing a new\nperspective on dark energy's role in their structure and dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
