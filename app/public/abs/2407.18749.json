This main problem addressed in this article\nis the MRS design complexity. The proposed solution provides a modular modeling\nand simulation technique that is based on formal system engineering method,\ntherefore the MRS design complexity is decomposed and reduced. Modeling the MRS\nhas been achieved via two formal Architecture Description Languages (ADLs),\nwhich are Systems Modeling Language (SysML) and Business Process Model and\nNotation (BPMN), to design the system blueprints. By using those abstract\ndesign ADLs, the implementation of the project becomes technology agnostic.\nThis allows to transfer the design concept from on programming language to\nanother. During the simulation phase, a multi-agent environment is used to\nsimulate the MRS blueprints. The simulation has been implemented in Java Agent\nDevelopment (JADE) middleware. Therefore, its results can be used to analysis\nand verify the proposed MRS model in form of performance evaluation matrix.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CRTrLpHedeEZS9RT6_CazvZO1WlQR-eE7v4t3xd6sSw","pdfSize":"1047270"}
