When implemented using microwave photonic (MWP) technologies, also\nknown as MWP transversal filters, they provide competitive advantages over\ntheir electrical counterparts, such as low loss, large operation bandwidth, and\nstrong immunity to electromagnetic interference. Recent advances in high\nperformance optical microcombs provide compact and powerful multiwavelength\nsources for MWP transversal filters that require a larger number of wavelength\nchannels to achieve high performance, allowing for the demonstration of a\ndiverse range of filter functions with improved performance and new features.\nHere, we present a comprehensive performance analysis for microcomb based MWP\nspectral filters based on the transversal filter approach. First, we\ninvestigate the theoretical limitations in the filter spectral response induced\nby finite tap numbers. Next, we analyze the distortions in the filter spectral\nresponse resulting from experimental error sources. Finally, we assess the\ninfluence of input signals bandwidth on the filtering errors. These results\nprovide a valuable guide for the design and optimization of microcomb-based MWP\ntransversal filters for a variety of applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
