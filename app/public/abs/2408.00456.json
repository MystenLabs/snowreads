For\nthe large subclass C of spaces having three pairwise inequivalent isotropy\nirreducible summands (12 infinite families and 70 sporadic examples), we obtain\nthat existence is equivalent to the existence of a real root for certain\nquartic polynomial depending on the dimensions and two Killing constants, which\nallows a full classification and the possibility to weigh the existence and\nnon-existence pieces of C.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
