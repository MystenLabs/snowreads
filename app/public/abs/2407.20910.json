This limits their effectiveness, for example undermining trust in\nhealth experts by adding warnings to their posts or resorting to vague warnings\ninstead of granular fact-checks, which result in desensitizing users. In this\npaper, we propose to incorporate stance detection into existing automated\nsoft-moderation pipelines, with the goal of ruling out contextual false\npositives and providing more precise recommendations for social media content\nthat should receive warnings. We develop a textual deviation task called\nContrastive Textual Deviation (CTD) and show that it outperforms existing\nstance detection approaches when applied to soft moderation.We then integrate\nCTD into the stateof-the-art system for automated soft moderation Lambretta,\nshowing that our approach can reduce contextual false positives from 20% to\n2.1%, providing another important building block towards deploying reliable\nautomated soft moderation tools on social media.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
