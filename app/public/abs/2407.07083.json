Linear-exponential systems\nextend standard integer linear programs with exponential terms $2^x$ and\nremainder terms ${(x \\bmod 2^y)}$. Our result implies that the existential\ntheory of the structure $(\\mathbb{N},0,1,+,2^{(\\cdot)},V_2(\\cdot,\\cdot),\\leq)$\nhas an NP-complete satisfiability problem, thus improving upon a recent\nEXPSPACE upper bound. This theory extends the existential fragment of\nPresburger arithmetic with the exponentiation function $x \\mapsto 2^x$ and the\nbinary predicate $V_2(x,y)$ that is true whenever $y \\geq 1$ is the largest\npower of $2$ dividing $x$.\n  Our procedure for solving linear-exponential systems uses the method of\nquantifier elimination. As a by-product, we modify the classical Gaussian\nvariable elimination into a non-deterministic polynomial-time procedure for\ninteger linear programming (or: existential Presburger arithmetic).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
