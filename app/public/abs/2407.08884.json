Recently, the extensions of GR have been intensively\ninvestigated in order to solve the theoretical impasses which have arisen. In\nthis sense, it is also useful to investigate the extensions of alternative\ndescriptions of gravity, which leads us to the so-called $f(T)$ and $f(Q)$\ngravities. In this paper, we consider a family of $f(Q)$ models and obtain\ntheir corresponding Tolman-Oppenheimer-{Volkoff} equations applied to\n{polytropic} stars. Using numerical integration, it is possible to solve a\nsystem of differential equations and calculate, among other things, the maximum\nmass and mass-radius relation allowed. In addition, we explicitly show the\nnon-metricity behavior inside and outside the star.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
