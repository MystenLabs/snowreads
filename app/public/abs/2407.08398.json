In this\nwork, we propose an intuitive Lindbladian composed of two chains with reversed\nskin localization. The skin steady state is gradually delocalized as the\ninterchain coupling increases. In the single-body scenario, it corresponds to a\nshift in the scaling of the Liouvillian gap $\\Delta$ from $\\Delta \\propto N^0$\nto $\\Delta \\propto N^{-2}$. Notably, exact diagonalization results reveal a\nsystem-size sensitivity of the single-particle Liouvillian spectrum, inherited\nfrom the non-Hermitian effective Hamiltonian's system-size sensitivity. We\npredict that even an arbitrarily small coupling will induce dramatic changes in\nthe Liouvillian spectrum and steady state in the thermodynamic limit, a\nphenomenon we term the critical Liouvillian skin effect. Additionally, in the\nmany-body scenario, by employing the stochastic Schr\\\"odinger equation to\nunravel the Lindblad master equation, it is revealed that the scaling behavior\nof steady-state entanglement changes from the area law to the logarithmic law.\nThis work demonstrates the delocalization of both single-body and many-body\nskin steady states, introducing a novel mechanism for inducing entanglement\ntransitions beyond the quantum Zeno effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
