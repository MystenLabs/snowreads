In two previous papers, we develop the basic theory of formal\nmanifolds, including generalizations of vector-valued distributions and\ngeneralized functions on smooth manifolds to the setting of formal manifolds.\nIn this paper, we establish Poincar\\'e's lemma for de Rham complexes with\ncoefficients in formal functions, formal generalized functions, compactly\nsupported formal densities, or compactly supported formal distributions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yIAmwqGshW3DsCHhrYIOMssztMusd3auI_x8aF0QMxg","pdfSize":"445008"}
