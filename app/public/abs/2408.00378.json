To identify at-risk subjects and understand alterations\nof dFNC in different stages, we leverage deep learning advancements and\nintroduce a transformer-convolution framework for predicting at-risk subjects\nbased on dFNC, incorporating spatial-temporal self-attention to capture brain\nnetwork dependencies and temporal dynamics. Our model significantly outperforms\nother popular machine learning methods. By analyzing individuals with diagnosed\nAD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI), we studied the AD progression and\nobserved a higher similarity between MCI and asymptomatic AD. The interpretable\nanalysis highlights the cognitive-control network's diagnostic importance, with\nthe model focusing on intra-visual domain dFNC when predicting asymptomatic AD\nsubjects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sUwAWtmOR-D5WuUq-QDdZ_rwhkXSM-VAxiSScOg1_fc","pdfSize":"1676988"}
