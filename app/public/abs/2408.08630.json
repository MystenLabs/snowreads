These methods are the first of their kind in the field of\nmultivariate areal spatial functional data analysis. The multivariate\nfunctional Moran's I statistic is employed to assess spatial autocorrelation,\nwhile mfasPCA is utilized for dimension reduction in both univariate and\nmultivariate functional areal data. Through simulation studies and real-world\nexamples, we demonstrate that the multivariate functional Moran's I statistic\nand mfasPCA are powerful tools for evaluating spatial autocorrelation in\nunivariate and multivariate functional areal data analysis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
