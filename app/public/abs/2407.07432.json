In this paper, we introduce the concept of group magic\nspectrum of a graph G with respect to a given Abelian group A and is defined as\nspec(G, A):= {{\\lambda} : {\\lambda} is a magic constant of some A-vertex magic\nlabeling f }. In their recent work, K. M. Sabeel et al. in Australas. J.\nCombin. 85(1) (2023), 49-60 proved a forbidden subgraph characterization for\nthe group vertex magic graph. In this work, we present a new method which uses\nminimum number of vertices required for this graph. We obtain a necessary and\nsufficient condition for the spectrum of a graph G to be a subgroup when A = V4\nor Zp, where p is a prime number. Also we introduce the notion of reduced\nspectrum redspec(G, A) and study the relation between spec(G, A) and redspec(G,\nA).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KxmgLPopvn4kFcwCCJ5vKD0dsufZ-64RdWHtxlD61y8","pdfSize":"371374"}
