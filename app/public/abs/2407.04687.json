First, training AI all at once on such massive data is\nimpractical as new scans/sources/classes continuously arrive. Second, training\nAI continuously on new scans/sources/classes can lead to catastrophic\nforgetting, where AI forgets old data as it learns new data, and vice versa. To\naddress these two challenges, we propose an online learning method that enables\ntraining AI from massive medical data. Instead of repeatedly training AI on\nrandomly selected data samples, our method identifies the most significant\nsamples for the current AI model based on their data uniqueness and prediction\nuncertainty, then trains the AI on these selective data samples. Compared with\nprevalent training paradigms, our method not only improves data efficiency by\nenabling training on continual data streams, but also mitigates catastrophic\nforgetting by selectively training AI on significant data samples that might\notherwise be forgotten, outperforming by 15% in Dice score for multi-organ and\ntumor segmentation.\n  The code is available at https://github.com/MrGiovanni/OnlineLearning\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
