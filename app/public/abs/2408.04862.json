We\ndeveloped and analyzed a food chain model to gain a mechanistic understanding\nof the critical roles carnivores play in ecosystems where plants face intense\nherbivory. Our model incorporates key factors such as seed production rates,\nseed germination probabilities, local plant interactions, herbivory rates, and\ncarnivore predation rates. In the absence of carnivores, herbivores\nsignificantly reduce plant densities, often driving plants to extinction under\nhigh herbivory rates. However, the presence of carnivores suppresses herbivore\npopulations, allowing plants to recover from herbivore pressure. We found that\nplant densities increase with carnivore predation rates, highlighting top-down\neffects and underscoring the importance of conserving carnivores in ecosystems\nwhere plants are at high risk of extinction from herbivory. Our results also\nshow that carnivore density increases with seed-production rates, while\nherbivore density remains constant, indicating that plants benefit carnivores\nmore than herbivores. This increase in carnivore density driven by high\nseed-production rates reflects bottom-up effects in the system. Overall, our\nstudy demonstrates that plants, herbivores, and carnivores can coexist even\nunder intense predation stress. It suggests that carnivores play a crucial role\nin regulating plant and herbivore populations, with significant potential for\nmaintaining biodiversity within ecosystems.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
