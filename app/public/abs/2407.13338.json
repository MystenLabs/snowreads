Such challenges are intractable even for conventional algorithms\nsince observations from different views with dynamic objects involved break the\ngeometric and photometric consistency, whereas the consistency lays the\nfoundation for joint optimizing the camera pose and the map parameters. In this\npaper, we best exploit the characteristics of continual learning and propose a\nnovel SLAM framework for dynamic environments. While past efforts have been\nmade to avoid catastrophic forgetting by exploiting an experience replay\nstrategy, we view forgetting as a desirable characteristic. By adaptively\ncontrolling the replayed buffer, the ambiguity caused by moving objects can be\neasily alleviated through forgetting. We restrain the replay of the dynamic\nobjects by introducing a continually-learned classifier for dynamic object\nidentification. The iterative optimization of the neural map and the classifier\nnotably improves the robustness of the SLAM system under a dynamic environment.\nExperiments on challenging datasets verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nframework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
