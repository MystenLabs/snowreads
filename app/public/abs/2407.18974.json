His contributions ranged\nwidely across discrete mathematics over four main career phases: discrete\nprobability, matroids and graphs, computational complexity, and Tutte-Whitney\npolynomials. We give particular emphasis to his work in matroid theory and\nTutte-Whitney polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"su_6SGXfTZZMd6pnZBmBKqt6xBzevpYz2YDt3vkws-c","pdfSize":"920903"}
