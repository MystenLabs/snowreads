We show that the category of\n$n$-smooth commutative group schemes over $R$ is equivalent to a certain full\nsubcategory of Dieudonn\\'e modules over $R$. As a consequence, we show that the\nmoduli stack $\\mathrm{Sm}_n$ of $n$-smooth commutative group schemes is smooth\nover $\\mathbb{F}_p$ and that the natural truncation morphism $\\mathrm{Sm}_{n+1}\n\\to \\mathrm{Sm}_n$ is smooth and surjective.
