While factory robots excel at predefined\ntasks, they struggle with environment-specific actions like cleaning and\ncooking. Deep learning research aims to address this by enabling robots to\nautonomously execute behaviors through end-to-end learning with sensor data.\nRT-1 and ACT are notable examples that have expanded robots' capabilities.\nHowever, issues with model inference speed and hand position accuracy persist.\nHigh-quality training data and fast, stable inference mechanisms are essential\nto overcome these challenges. This paper proposes a motion generation model for\nhigh-speed, high-precision tasks, exemplified by the sports stacking task. By\nteaching motions slowly and inferring at high speeds, the model achieved a 94%\nsuccess rate in stacking cups with a real robot.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
