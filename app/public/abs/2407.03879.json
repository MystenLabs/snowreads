The findings of these\nstudies are very diverse, showing both positive and negative effects, and thus\ncalling for comparative meta-studies. In this paper we review and analyze\ndifferent studies, aiming to summarise and evaluate controlled experiments\nconducted within different scientific disciplines. We focus on the clarity of\nnon-experimental conditions' descriptions and show that in most cases a.\neducational methods used in control groups' activities are poorly described, b.\neducational materials used in control groups' activities are often unclear, and\nc. the starting conditions are unclear. We also noticed that studies in the\nfields of computer science and engineering, in general, report results more\nclearly than in other fields. Based on the above finding, we conclude with a\nfew recommendations for the execution of future empirical studies of games in\neducation for the sake of allowing a more structured comparison.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
