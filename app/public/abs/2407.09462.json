However, previous electrical techniques to detect\nantiferromagnetic dynamics have required millimeter-scale samples to achieve\nmeasurable signals. Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of\nantiferromagnetic resonance in devices 1000 times smaller using spin-filter\ntunneling in micron-scale PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which\nthe tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromaget CrSBr. This sample\ngeometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of\nthe antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$\nelectrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic\nresonance provides the means to make detailed studies of the physics governing\nthese high-frequency dynamics and to pursue applications including radiation\nsources, modulators, and detectors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
