We utilize Banach's fixed point theorem and the a\npriori energy estimates uniformly in time to ensure the global existence of\nsolutions around the steady state. In contrast to the deterministic case, the\npresence of stochastic forces lead to the lack of temporal derivatives of\nmomentum, posing challenges for energy estimates. Furthermore, Ohmic contact\nboundary conditions pose greater challenges for energy estimates compared to\nsystems with insulating boundary conditions. To address this issue, we\nestablish asymptotic stability concerning the spatial derivatives through\nweighted energy estimates for the estimates of stochastic integrals, employing\na technique distinct from that of the deterministic case. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the existence of an invariant measure based on the a priori energy\nestimates. This invariant measure precisely corresponds to the Dirac measure\ngenerated by the steady state, due to the exponential decay of perturbed\nsolutions around the steady state.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
