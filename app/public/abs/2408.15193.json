These classes\nof systems arise in mathematical finance, where the paradigm of\ndistributionally robust optimization (DRO) fits perfectly, and this serves as\nthe primary motivation for this work. We recast the optimal control problem\n(OCP) as a semi-definite program with an infinite number of constraints, making\nthe ensuing optimization problem a \\emph{semi-infinite semi-definite program}\n(SI-SDP). To numerically solve the SI-SDP, we advance an approach for solving\nconvex semi-infinite programs (SIPs) to SI-SDPs and, subsequently, solve the\nDRMPC problem. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
