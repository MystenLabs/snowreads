The substantial size and complexity of\nWSIs pose unique analytical challenges. Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) has\nemerged as a powerful approach for addressing these challenges, particularly in\ncancer classification and detection. This survey provides a comprehensive\noverview of the challenges and methodologies associated with applying MIL to\nWSI analysis, including attention mechanisms, pseudo-labeling, transformers,\npooling functions, and graph neural networks. Additionally, it explores the\npotential of MIL in discovering cancer cell morphology, constructing\ninterpretable machine learning models, and quantifying cancer grading. By\nsummarizing the current challenges, methodologies, and potential applications\nof MIL in WSI analysis, this survey aims to inform researchers about the state\nof the field and inspire future research directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
