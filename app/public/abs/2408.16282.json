The method uses coarse spaces constructed from\noptimal local approximation spaces, which are based on local eigenproblems\nposed on (discrete) harmonic spaces. We rigorously prove that the method, used\nas an iterative solver or as a preconditioner for GMRES, converges at a rate of\n$\\Lambda$, where $\\Lambda$ represents the error of the underlying MS-GFEM. The\nexponential convergence property of MS-GFEM, which is indepdendent of the fine\nmesh size $h$ even for highly oscillatory and high contrast coefficients, thus\nguarantees convergence in a few iterations with a small coarse space. We\ndevelop the theory in an abstract framework, and demonstrate its generality by\napplying it to various elliptic problems with highly heterogeneous\ncoefficients, including $H({\\rm curl})$ elliptic problems. The performance of\nthe proposed method is systematically evaluated and illustrated via\napplications to two and three dimensional heterogeneous PDEs, including\nchallenging elasticity problems in realistic composite aero-structures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
