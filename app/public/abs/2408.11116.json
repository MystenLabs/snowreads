We tackle this problem in the random case and show that a random\ninteger partition can be realized as the degree sequence of a $3$-uniform\nhypergraph with high probability. These results are in stark contrast with the\ncase of graphs, where a classical result of Erd\\H{o}s and Gallai provides an\nefficient algorithm for checking if a sequence is a degree sequence of a graph\nand a result of Pittel shows that with high probability a random partition is\nnot the degree sequence of a graph.\n  By the same method, we address analogous realizability problems about\nhigh-dimensional binary contingency tables. We prove that if\n$(\\lambda,\\mu,\\nu)$ are three independent random partitions then with high\nprobability one can construct a three-dimensional binary contingency table with\nmarginals $(\\lambda,\\mu,\\nu)$. Conversely, if one insists that the contingency\ntable forms a pyramid shape, then we show that with high probability one cannot\nconstruct such a contingency table. These two results confirm two conjectures\nof Pak and Panova.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
