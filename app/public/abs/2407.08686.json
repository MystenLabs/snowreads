In proof-of-stake (PoS), a subset of\nstakeholders participate in validating a growing ledger of transactions. For\nthe safety and liveness of the underlying system, it is desirable for the set\nof validators to include multiple independent entities as well as represent a\nnon-negligible percentage of the total stake issued. In this paper, we study a\nsecondary form of participation in the transaction validation process, which\ntakes the form of stake delegation, whereby an agent delegates their stake to\nan active validator who acts as a stake pool operator. We study payment schemes\nthat reward agents as a function of their collective actions regarding stake\npool operation and delegation. Such payment schemes serve as a mechanism to\nincentivize participation in the validation process while maintaining\ndecentralization. We observe natural trade-offs between these objectives and\nthe total expenditure required to run the relevant payment schemes. Ultimately,\nwe provide a family of payment schemes which can strike different balances\nbetween these competing objectives at equilibrium in a Bayesian game theoretic\nframework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
