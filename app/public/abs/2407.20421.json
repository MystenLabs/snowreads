In this work,\nwe propose an event-based optical flow solution based on activation\nsparsification and a neuromorphic processor, SENECA. SENECA has an event-driven\nprocessing mechanism that can exploit the sparsity in ANN activations and SNN\nspikes to accelerate the inference of both types of neural networks. The ANN\nand the SNN for comparison have similar low activation/spike density (~5%)\nthanks to our novel sparsification-aware training. In the hardware-in-loop\nexperiments designed to deduce the average time and energy consumption, the SNN\nconsumes 44.9ms and 927.0 microjoules, which are 62.5% and 75.2% of the ANN's\nconsumption, respectively. We find that SNN's higher efficiency attributes to\nits lower pixel-wise spike density (43.5% vs. 66.5%) that requires fewer memory\naccess operations for neuron states.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DvTjdjL6jkZyAeV8d_FYNuzFzRbJ8GCw8CY0-FwTk50","pdfSize":"19197320","objectId":"0x928614a5a551076ca99e4490269eaf5fcf1c24ad0ae2cb25274487523d7e997a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
