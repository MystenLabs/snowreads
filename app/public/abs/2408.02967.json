The core idea is to utilize the fractal structure of $p$-adic\nintegers, where $p$ is a prime number, and compare this with conventional\ndensities and counting measures for integers. Our approach yields some results\nin combinatorial number theory. The results show how the local fractal\nstructure of a set in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$ can provide bounds for the counting\nmeasure for its projection onto $\\mathbb{Z}$. Additionally, we establish a\nrelationship between the counting dimension of a set of integers and its\nbox-counting dimension in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$. Since our results pertain to sets\nthat are projections of closed sets in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$, we also provide both\nnecessary and sufficient combinatorial conditions for a set $E\\subset\n\\mathbb{Z}$ to be the projection of a closed set in $\\mathbb{Z}_p$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
