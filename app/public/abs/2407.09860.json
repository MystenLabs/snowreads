The spontaneous magnetization of the spin\ncomponents breaks the $SO(3)$ (or $SO(2)$) symmetry, inducing an ordered phase\nof flocking. We derive the hydrodynamic equations, similar to those formulated\nby Toner and Tu, by applying a mean-field approximation to the quantum analog\nmodel up to the next leading order. Our investigation not only establishes a\nmicroscopic connection between the Vicsek model and the Toner-Tu hydrodynamics\nfor active matter, but also aims to inspire further studies of active matter in\nthe quantum regime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rdQV743G8LFOvCsVnBbDhwQEHwrF6i9Po4JWUtcD0vI","pdfSize":"1691061"}
