Meeting these demands involves employing highly aggressive motion\nprofiles, which introduce position-dependent flexible dynamics, thus\ncompromising achievable position tracking performance. This paper introduces a\ncontrol approach enabling active compensation of position-dependent flexible\ndynamics by extending the conventional rigid-body control structure to include\nactive control of flexible dynamics. To facilitate real-time implementation of\nthe control algorithm, appropriate position-dependent weighting functions are\nintroduced, ensuring computationally efficient execution of the proposed\napproach. The efficacy of the proposed control design approach is demonstrated\nthrough experiments conducted on a state-of-the-art extreme ultraviolet (EUV)\nwafer stage.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
