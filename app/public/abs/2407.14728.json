In particular, using a\nFourier Sine transform method, we reduce the partial differential equation\ngoverning the price of a margin-call stock loan into an ordinary differential\nequation, the solution of which can be easily found (in the Fourier Sine space)\nand analytically inverted into the original space. As a result, we obtain an\nintegral representation of the value of the stock loan in terms of the unknown\noptimal exit prices, which are, in turn, governed by a Volterra integral\nequation. We thus can break the pricing problem of margin-call stock loans into\ntwo steps: 1) finding the optimal exit prices by solving numerically the\ngoverning Volterra integral equation and 2) calculating the values of\nmargin-call stock loans based on the obtained optimal exit prices. By\nvalidating and comparing with other available numerical methods, we show that\nour proposed numerical scheme offers a reliable and efficient way to calculate\nthe service fee of a margin-call stock loan contract, track the contract value\nover time, and compute the level of stock price above which it is optimal to\nexit the contract. The effects of the margin-call feature on the loan contract\nare also examined and quantified.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
