In this paper, we present a brief\nintroduction to quantum network control, an area in quantum networking\ndedicated to designing algorithms for distributing entanglement (i.e.,\nentangled qubits). We start by explaining what qubits and entanglement are and\nhow they furnish quantum network control operations such as entanglement\nswapping and teleportation. With those operations, we present a model for\ndistributing entanglement in a multi-hop quantum network to enable applications\nsuch as quantum key distribution and distributed quantum computing. We conclude\nthe paper by presenting open research problems in the field, including the\ncharacterization of the quantum network capacity region and the design of\nthroughput-optimal policies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
