We first study the intersections of line and surface\noperators in 5d Chern-Simons theory, which correspond to M2- and M5-branes,\nrespectively. A Feynman diagram computation of the correlation function of this\nconfiguration furnishes an expression reminiscent of an R-matrix derivable from\n4d Chern-Simons theory. We explain how this object is related to a Miura\noperator that is known to realize (matrix-extended) $W_{\\infty}$-algebras. For\n5d Chern-Simons theory with nonabelian gauge group, we then perform a Feynman\ndiagram computation of coproducts for deformed double current algebras and\nmatrix-extended $W_{\\infty}$-algebras from fusions of M2-branes, M5-branes, and\nM2-M5 intersections.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
