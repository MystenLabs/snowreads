Specifically, the tree splitting\nprocess is constrained to ensure overlap within a narrow band surrounding the\nrunning variable cutoff value, where the treatment effect is identified. It is\nshown that unmodified BART-based models estimate RDD treatment effects poorly,\nwhile our modified model accurately recovers treatment effects at the cutoff.\nSpecifically, BART-RDD is perhaps the first RDD method that effectively learns\nconditional average treatment effects. The new method is investigated in\nthorough simulation studies as well as an empirical application looking at the\neffect of academic probation on student performance in subsequent terms (Lindo\net al., 2010).\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
