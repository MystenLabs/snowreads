In this work, we provide a comprehensive\nclassification of Lie algebras generated by an arbitrary set of Pauli\noperators, from which an efficient method to characterize them follows. By\nmapping the problem to a graph setting, we identify a reduced set of\nequivalence classes: the free-fermionic Lie algebra, the set of all\nanti-symmetric Paulis on n qubits, the Lie algebra of symplectic Paulis on n\nqubits, and the space of all Pauli operators on n qubits, as well as controlled\nversions thereof. Moreover, out of these, we distinguish 6 Clifford\ninequivalent cases and find a simple set of canonical operators for each, which\nallow us to give a physical interpretation of the dynamics of each class. Our\nfindings reveal a no-go result for the existence of small Lie algebras beyond\nthe free-fermionic case in the Pauli setting and offer efficiently computable\ncriteria for universality and extendibility of gate sets. These results bear\nsignificant impact in ideas in a number of fields like quantum control, quantum\nmachine learning, or classical simulation of quantum circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
