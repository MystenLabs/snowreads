The key technical tool for the proof is the following\ncriterion concerning primeness of open books, which we consider to be of\nindependent interest. For open books of 3-manifolds the property of having no\nfixed essential arcs is preserved under essential Murasugi sums with a strictly\nright-veering open book, if the plumbing region of the original open book veers\nto the left. We also provide examples of open books in S^3 demonstrating that\nprimeness is not necessarily preserved under essential Murasugi sum, in fact\nnot even under stabilizations a.k.a. Hopf plumbings. Furthermore, we find that\ntrefoil plumbings need not preserve primeness. In contrast, we establish that\nfigure-eight knot plumbings do preserve primeness.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
