We show that its scaling limit is described by the\ncorresponding additive stochastic heat equation. In contrast to the case of\ncompactly supported covariance, the noise in the stochastic heat equation\nretains spatial correlation with covariance $|x|^{-\\kappa}$. Surprisingly, the\nnoise driving the limiting equation turns out to be the scaling limit of the\nnoise driving the KPZ equation so that, under a suitable coupling, one has\nconvergence in probability, unlike in the case of integrable correlations where\nfluctuations are enhanced in the limit and convergence is necessarily weak.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
