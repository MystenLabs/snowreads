The\ninterplay between oddness and inertia induces a non-equilibrium phase\ntransition from a homogeneous to a non-homogeneous phase, characterized by\nbubbles induced by odd interactions. This phenomenon occurs in the absence of\nattractions and is generated by the competition between the standard pressure\ncontribution due to particle repulsion and an effective surface tension\ngenerated by odd-induced centrifugal forces. As a signature of the phase\ntransition, the system exhibits vortex structures and oscillating spatial\nvelocity correlations, which emerge close to the analytically predicted\ntransition point. Our findings can be verified in granular experiments governed\nby odd interactions, such as spinners and colloidal magnets, and could be key\nto characterizing the emerging properties of metamaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
