By combining these\nmodels, we construct hybrid equations of state (EOSs) that capture the\ntransition between the two phases. We explore the parameter space of both\nmodels to identify the conditions under which a first-order phase transition\ncan occur and study its effects on NS properties. We identify the suitable\nparameter space and constrain the onset density of the first-order phase\ntransition. For $m_0$ = 500 MeV -- the chiral invariant mass in PDM, the phase\ntransition occurs between 1.9$n_0$ and 2.95$n_0$ and ends between 2.1$n_0$ and\n3.6$n_0$. Increasing $m_0$ to 600 MeV shifts the phase transition to higher\ndensities, occurring between 2.9$n_0$ and 4.1$n_0$ and ending between 3.4$n_0$\nand 4.6$n_0$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6NQhzhxHwX2NzmdTA3ynqvrLGxS2wlPUXDziLuQfffQ","pdfSize":"3391879","objectId":"0x7fa912840134b582fe70c213b1d576bf7dbff0617789b1bc2cf6622102644303","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
