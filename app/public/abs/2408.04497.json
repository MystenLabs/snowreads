Nevertheless, such NN-based methods are all based on the\nBorn-Oppenheimer approximation (BOA) and require a separate and computationally\nexpensive training for each nuclear configuration. In this work, we propose a\nnovel NN architecture, Schr\\\"{o}dingerNet, to solve the full electronic-nuclear\nSE by defining a loss function designed to equalize local energies across the\nsystem. This approach is based on a rotationally invariant total wavefunction\nansatz that includes both nuclear and electronic coordinates. This strategy\nallows for an efficient and accurate generation of a continuous potential\nenergy surface at any geometry within the well-sampled nuclear configuration\nspace, and also incorporates non-BO corrections, through a single training\nprocess. Comparison with benchmarks of atomic and molecular systems\ndemonstrates its accuracy and efficiency\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
