As an application, we contribute to the classification of coradically\ngraded finite-dimensional pointed coquasi-Hopf algebras over abelian groups. As\na byproduct, we show that the Nichols algebras $\\mathcal{B}(M_1\\oplus M_2\n\\oplus M_3)$ are infinite-dimensional where $M_1,M_2,M_3$ are three different\nsimple Yetter-Drinfeld modules of $D_8$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
