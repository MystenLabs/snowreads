Over fifty years of AI research, catalyzed by\ndeclining computing costs and the proliferation of data, have propelled AI into\nthe mainstream, promising significant economic benefits. Yet, this rapid\nadoption underscores risks, from bias amplification and labor disruptions to\nexistential threats posed by autonomous systems. The discourse is polarized\nbetween accelerationists, advocating for unfettered technological advancement,\nand doomers, calling for a slowdown to prevent dystopian outcomes. This piece\nadvocates for a middle path that leverages technical innovation and smart\nregulation to maximize the benefits of AI while minimizing its risks, offering\na pragmatic approach to the responsible progress of AI technology. Technical\ninvention beyond the most capable foundation models is needed to contain\ncatastrophic risks. Regulation is required to create incentives for this\nresearch while addressing current issues.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
