These networks rely\non open source code, which are sensitive to contain high number of bugs. Both,\nthe knowledge about the code of previous releases as well as the bug history of\nthe particular project can be used to evaluate the software reliability of a\nnew software release based on SRGM. In this work a framework to predict the\nnumber of the bugs of a new release, as well as other reliability parameters,\nis proposed. An exemplary implementation of this framework to two particular\nopen source projects, is described in detail. The difference between the\nprediction accuracy of the two projects is presented. Different alternatives to\nincrease the prediction accuracy are proposed and compared in this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
