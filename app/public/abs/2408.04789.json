We model the geometry and kinematics of the BLR in the\nH$\\beta$, H$\\alpha$, and MgII, emission lines for three different time periods\nto measure the potential change of structure within the BLR across time and\nline species. We consistently find a moderately edge-on $(i_{\\rm full-state} =\n53.29^{\\circ} \\,{}^{+7.29}_{-6.55})$ thick-disk $(\\theta_{\\rm opn, \\;\nfull-state} = 54.86^{\\circ} \\,{}^{+5.83}_{-4.74})$ geometry for all BLRs, with\na joint estimate for the mass of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) for each of\nthree time periods, yielding $\\log_{10}(M_{\\rm BH} / M_{\\odot}) =\n7.66^{+0.12}_{-0.13}$ when using the full dataset. The inferred individual\nvirial factor $f$ $\\sim 1$ is significantly smaller than the average factor for\na local sample of dynamically modeled AGNs. There is strong evidence for\nnon-virial motion, with over $80\\%$ of clouds on inflowing/outflowing orbits.\nWe analyze the change in model parameters across emission lines, finding the\nradii of BLRs for the emission lines are consistent with the following relative\nsizes $R_{\\rm H\\beta} \\lesssim R_{\\rm MgII } \\lesssim R_{\\rm H\\alpha}$.\nComparing results across time, we find $R_{\\rm low-state} \\lesssim R_{\\rm\nhigh-state}$, with the change in BLR size for H$\\beta$, being more significant\nthan for the other two lines. The data also reveal complex, time-evolving, and\npotentially transient dynamics of the BLR gas over decade-long timescales,\nencouraging for future dynamical modeling of fine-scale BLR kinematics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z1vonJLNalcuCilQK0KQ4gdOtXooC3zgxlVLogNFk6k","pdfSize":"41765693"}
