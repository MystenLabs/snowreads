A relatively new approach, based on so-called \"weak\nmeasurements\", suggests that such forbidden knowledge can be gained by studying\nthe system's response to an inaccurate weakly perturbing measuring device. It\ngoes further to propose revising the whole concept of physics variables, and\noffers various examples of counterintuitive quantum behaviour. Both views go to\nthe very heart of quantum theory, and yet are rarely compared directly. A new\ntechnique must either transcend the orthodox limits, or just prove that these\nlimits are indeed necessary. We study both possibilities, and find for the\northodoxy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
