The method builds on the recent work of\nAggarwal, Leung, and Munshi which treated shorter intervals. We deduce some\ncorollaries including an improvement on the error term in the Rankin-Selberg\nproblem, and on certain subconvexity bounds for $GL_3 \\times GL_2$ and $GL_3$\n$L$-functions. As a byproduct of the method of proof, we also obtain an\nestimate for an average of shifted convolution sums of $GL_3$ Fourier\ncoefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
