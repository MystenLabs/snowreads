To\nthis end, we exhibit the cartesian closed structure of the $\\infty$-category of\ndouble $\\infty$-categories and various localizations. We prove a theorem that\ncharacterizes the companions and conjoints in functor double\n$\\infty$-categories via the notion of companionable and conjointable 2-cells in\ndouble $\\infty$-categories. Moreover, we show that under suitable conditions,\nfunctor double $\\infty$-categories are horizontally closed. Throughout the\npaper, we highlight a few applications to $(\\infty,2)$-category theory and\nindexed exponentiability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
