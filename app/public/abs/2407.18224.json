However, in bilayer systems influenced by charge\nfractionalization, a more exotic form of interlayer exciton can emerge, where\npairing occurs between constituents that carry fractional charges. Despite\nnumerous theoretical predictions for such fractional excitons, their\nexperimental observation has remained elusive. Here, we report transport\nsignatures of excitonic pairing within fractional quantum Hall effect states.\nBy probing the composition of these excitons and their impact on the underlying\nwavefunction, we uncover two novel quantum phases of matter. One of these\norders can be viewed as the fractional counterpart of the exciton condensate at\na total filling of one, while the other involves a more unusual type of exciton\nthat obeys fermionic and anyonic quantum statistics, challenging the standard\nparadigm of bosonic excitons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
