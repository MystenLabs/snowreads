The existence of the time\nperiodic solution is proved using the spectral decomposition of the linear\nprincipal part and the Poincar\\'{e} map. On the other hand, the proof of the\nstability of the time-periodic solutions is generally problematic due to the\nslow time decay induced by the time periodic solutions. Based on the regularity\nestimates of the time periodic solution derived from the smoothing effect of\nthe semigroup, sharp decay properties of the perturbation from the time\nperiodic solution are proved, which proves the stability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
