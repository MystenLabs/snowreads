We focus on relevant two-quark-two-lepton operators\n($O^{3}_{lq}$, $O^{1}_{lequ}$, and $O^{3}_{lequ}$). It is known that these\noperators have tiny effects on the inclusive cross section of standard model tW\nproduction and are thus typically ignored in the SMEFT searches. However, we\nshow that by employing smart observables, such as $m_{T2}$, the\npp$\\rightarrow$t$\\ell\\nu$ process is significantly sensitive to these\noperators. We set the most stringent limit on the coupling strength of the\n$O^{3}_{lq}$ operator by reinterpreting the results of a search for new\nphenomena with two opposite-charge leptons, jets and missing transverse\nmomentum at $\\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV performed by the ATLAS collaboration. The\nlimits derived on the $O^{1}_{lequ}$ and $O^{3}_{lequ}$ operators are\ncomparable to those obtained from probing EFT effects in\npp$\\rightarrow$t$\\bar{\\rm t}\\ell\\nu$ and pp$\\rightarrow$t$\\bar{\\rm t}\\ell\\ell$\nprocesses at the LHC. Consequently, we propose to include the effects of these\nthree operators on the pp$\\rightarrow$t$\\ell\\nu$ process in future global SMEFT\nanalyses to increase the sensitivity and to reduce possible degeneracies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"-j1NLUgZ7BMdjM2XmgPgji1vtn23CIGPfhVJ9YRNA40","pdfSize":"677380","txDigest":"Gpk1njr6nZGxXWjfALvYYrVpFyTBoxCNnEh8BDH6tGif","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
