This raises the question,\nto which extent the consideration of electronic correlations, present in real\nsystems, modify these results. Exact solutions of correlated electronic systems\nwith non-trivial topological properties, although fundamental are scarce. Among\nthe non-interacting soluble models, we single out the Kitaev p-wave\nsuperconducting chain. It plays a crucial role in clarifying the appearance of\nemergent quasi-particles, the Majorana modes, associated with non-trivial\ntopological properties. Given the relevance of this model, it would be\nextremely useful if it can be extended to include correlations and still remain\nsolvable. In this work we investigate a superconducting Kitaev chain that\ninteracts through a Falicov-Kimball Hamiltonian with a background of localized\nelectrons. For some relevant values of the parameters of this extended model\nsolutions can be obtained, which allows for a detailed study of the interplay\nbetween electronic correlations and non-trivial topological behavior. Besides,\nthe random occupation of the chain by the local moments brings the new\ninteresting effects associated with disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
