This feature is found to emanate from the\nenhancement of the breakup cross-section, due to the continuum-continuum\ncouplings coming exclusively from its Coulomb component. We further speculate\nthat the enhancement of the Coulomb breakup cross-section at sub-barrier\nincident energies by the continuum-continuum couplings could be associated with\nthe projectile breaking up on the outgoing trajectory, provided these couplings\ncan be proven to delay the breakup process.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
