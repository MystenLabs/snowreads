Our approach relies on coupling\nthe target chiral system to adatom spins. Due to the substrate chirality, the\nadatom spins are expected to order in a noncoplanar configuration with a\nnonzero spin chirality. Here, we obtain concrete results for chiral substrates\nwhich are invariant under arbitrary spin rotations, and are coupled to three\nadatoms carrying classical moments. By exploring all the accessible magnetic\nground states, we identify the regimes in which nonzero spin chirality is\ninduced on the adatom complex. We apply our method to valley-polarized bilayer\ngraphene and $d+id$ superconductors, and find qualitatively different ground\nstate diagrams. Our analysis shows that the adatom spin chirality fully encodes\nthe properties of the substrate chirality.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yiUNFwksaJ6a5Vz_pi2RQGna_LbAv3vPuWC-HXSQpH0","pdfSize":"1427335"}
