However, VQE algorithms suffer from\na plethora of issues, such as barren plateaus, local minima, quantum hardware\nnoise, and limited qubit connectivity, thus posing challenges for their\nsuccessful deployment on hardware and simulators. In this work, we propose a\nVQE optimization strategy that builds upon recent advances in the literature,\nand exhibits very shallow circuit depths when applied to the specific system of\ninterest, namely a model Hamiltonian representing a cuprate superconductor.\nThese features make our approach a favorable candidate for generating good\nground state approximations on current NISQ devices. Our findings illustrate\nthe potential of VQE algorithmic development for leveraging the full\ncapabilities of NISQ devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
