The\nmain advantage of this method is that it can be easily applied to cases that\nare beyond the reach of the techniques currently used in the literature, such\nas random walks with long-ranged memory kernels or randomly stopped sums where\nthe random time is not concentrated around its expectation. The method reveals\nthe role of the characteristic function when Cram\\'er's condition is violated\nand provides a unified approach within regular variation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
