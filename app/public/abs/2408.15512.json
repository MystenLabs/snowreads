This study explores the feasibility of constructing\nan autonomous simulation agent (ASA) powered by LLM, through sophisticated API\nintegration, to automate the entire research process, from experimental design,\nremote upload and simulation execution, data analysis, to report compilation.\nUsing a simulation problem of polymer chain conformations as a case study, we\nassessed the performance of ASAs powered by different LLMs including\nGPT-4-Turbo. Our findings revealed that ASA-GPT-4o achieved near-flawless\nexecution on designated research missions, underscoring the potential of LLMs\nto manage complete scientific investigations autonomously. The outlined\nautomation can be iteratively performed up to twenty cycles without human\nintervention, illustrating the potential of LLMs for large-scale autonomous\nresearch endeavors. Additionally, we discussed the intrinsic traits of ASAs in\nmanaging extensive tasks, focusing on self-validation mechanisms and the\nbalance between local attention and global oversight.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
