We carry out the calculations for a scalar\nfield with a potential coupled to gravity, and work within the thin-wall\napproximation, where the bubble wall is thin compared to the size of the\nbubble. We show that the false de Sitter vacuum is unstable, independently of\nthe height of the potential and the relative depth of the true vacuum compared\nto the false vacuum. The false Minkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua can be stable\ndespite the existence of a lower energy true vacuum. However, when the relative\ndepth of the true and false vacua exceeds a critical value, which depends on\nthe potential of the false vacuum and the height of the barrier, then the false\nMinkowski and anti-de Sitter vacua become unstable. We calculate the\nprobability for the decay of the false de Sitter, Minkowski and anti-de Sitter\nvacua, as a function of the parameters characterizing the field potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
