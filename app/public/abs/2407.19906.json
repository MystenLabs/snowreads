Inspired by well-known map projections from\nthe unit sphere onto its tangent planes, used in practice in cartography, these\nembeddings address the common drawback of the amplitude embedding method,\nwherein scalar multiples of data points are identified and information about\nthe norm of data is lost.\n  We show how reverse map projections can be utilised as equivariant embeddings\nfor quantum machine learning. Using these methods, we can leverage symmetries\nin classical datasets to significantly strengthen performance on quantum\nmachine learning tasks.\n  Finally, we select four values of $\\alpha$ with which to perform a simple\nclassification task, taking $E_\\alpha$ as the embedding and experimenting with\nboth equivariant and non-equivariant setups. We compare their results alongside\nthose of standard amplitude embedding.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tCn9P1zHCZdI0QvuZOjD_ToAipqbVrfmPmhhkfnwmJw","pdfSize":"752440"}
