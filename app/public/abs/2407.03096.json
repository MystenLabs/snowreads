In this Letter, we\nexplore the collective advantage of qubit reset of coherent qubits in three\naspects. First, for the quasistatic process, the thermodynamic cost of\ncollective reset is remarkably lower than parallel reset because of the reduced\nHilbert space dimension due to entanglement effects. Second, for the\nfinite-time qubit reset, we prove that the error probability fades away and\nper-qubit heat production tends the Landauer bound for initially continuous\nprotocols in the thermodynamic limit. Third, we show that qubit reset\nperformance enhances with the increase in the number of qubits. Our results,\nillustrated by different protocols, provide a blueprint for future quantum\ndevice fabrication.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
