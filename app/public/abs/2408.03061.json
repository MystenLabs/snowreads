We show that the flat-space limit of these\ncurves in three dimensional (A)dS spacetimes is well-defined. We find that if\nthe length of the curves is calculated from the radial coordinate where the\nretarded time is extremum, then after taking the flat-space limit, the\nentanglement entropy of the dual theory of three-dimensional flat spacetime is\nobtained. For dS spacetime, the radial coordinate corresponding to the extremum\nof retarded time is located inside the cosmological horizon. Our results\nsuggest that on the field theory side, the entanglement entropy in the dual\ntheory of flat spacetimes should be obtained from the ultra-relativistic limit\nof pseudo entropy in the dual CFT to (A)ds spacetimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
