In special cases, this equation is\nreduced to a set of the various well-known equations describing nonlinear\nsolitary waves in the different areas of physics. Using both the slowly varying\nenvelope approximation and the generalized perturbation reduction method, the\ngeneralized equation is transformed into the coupled nonlinear Schrodinger\nequations and the two-component nonlinear solitary wave solution is obtained.\nExplicit analytical expressions for the shape and parameters of two-component\nnonlinear wave consisting of two breathers oscillating with the sum and\ndifference frequencies and wave numbers are presented. The solution of the\ngeneralized equation coincides with the vector 0\\pi pulse of the self-induced\ntransparency.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
