Our\nresults concern its asymptotic behavior in the joint limit $\\beta, \\ell \\to\n\\infty$, both in the subcritical regime $\\ell \\ll \\rme^{\\beta C_W}$ and in the\nsupercritical regime $\\ell \\gg \\rme^{\\beta C_W}$, where $C_W$ denotes the\nsurface tension. In the former case, in which the measure concentrates on the\npure phases, we prove the corresponding large deviation principle. The\nassociated rate function is the Modica-Mortola functional modified to take into\naccount the entropy of the locations of the interfaces. Further, we provide the\nsharp asymptotics of the probability of having a given number of transitions\nbetween the two pure phases. In the supercritical regime, the measure does not\nlonger concentrate and we show that the interfaces are asymptotically\ndistributed according to a Poisson point process.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
