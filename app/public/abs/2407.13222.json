The proposed system non-contactly\ncollects data using FMCW radar, which depends on breath rates. Various support\nvector machine kernels are used to classify the observed data into normal and\nabnormal states. Prolonged experiments show good accuracy in breath rate\nclassification, confirming the model's efficacy. The best accuracy is 95\npercent with the smallest number of support vectors in the case of the\nquadratic polynomial kernel.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
