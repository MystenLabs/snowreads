For example when\nprompted to generate images of people in certain professions, these models tend\nto systematically generate specific genders or ethnicity. In this paper, we\nshow that this bias is already present in the text encoder of the model and\nintroduce a Mixture-of-Experts approach by identifying text-encoded bias in the\nlatent space and then creating a bias-identification gate. More specifically,\nwe propose MoESD (Mixture of Experts Stable Diffusion) with BiAs (Bias\nAdapters) to mitigate gender bias. We also demonstrate that a special token is\nessential during the mitigation process. With experiments focusing on gender\nbias, we demonstrate that our approach successfully mitigates gender bias while\nmaintaining image quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
