Training robots to operate in such complex environments is\nchallenging, often requiring human supervision for adaptation and learning.\nInteractive reinforcement learning (IRL) is a key training methodology in\nhuman-computer interaction. This paper presents a comparative study of two IRL\nalgorithms: Q-learning and SARSA, both trained in a virtual\ngrid-simulation-based warehouse environment. To maintain consistent feedback\nrewards and avoid bias, feedback was provided by the same individual throughout\nthe study.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
