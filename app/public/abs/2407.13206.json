These cancellation times follow a discrete\nprobability mass function derived from the Tsallis $q$-exponential\ndistribution, or equivalently, the second form of the Pareto distribution. By\ncombining fractional L'{e}vy stable motion as the model for limit order inflow\nwith the power-law distribution for cancellation times, we propose an\ninnovative approach to modeling order imbalance in financial markets. We extend\nthis model to a broader context, illustrating its applicability to opinion\ndynamics in social systems where opinions have a finite lifespan. This proposed\nmodel exemplifies a stochastic time series characterized by stationary\nincrements and broken self-similarity. Consequently, it offers a novel\nframework for testing methods to evaluate long-range dependence in such time\nseries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
