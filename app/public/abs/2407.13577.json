However, there is\nstill no clear consensus for the optimal way to describe glacier and ice-sheet\nsliding. Typically, sliding is parameterised using a traction coefficient\nnominally linked to a given theory describing one or a limited set of sliding\nprocesses. However, this approach precludes the possibility of multiple\nsimultaneous and spatio-temporally varying sliding modes with inaccuracies\nresulting in model error propagation as the system evolves away from the\nconditions under which it was optimised for. Here, revisiting early theoretical\nwork, we describe glacier sliding as a scale- and setting-dependent 'inner\nflow' that arises from multiple overlapping sub-processes, bridging divides\nbetween hard and soft beds, rough and smooth beds, and stick-slip and\ncontinuous sliding as well as providing a consistent definition for form drag.\nThe corresponding 'outer flow' then accounts for 'normal' ice deformation. We\npropose that the significance of 'Iken's bound' is then reduced if form drag\ndominates over subglacial cavitation in a given region, possibly explaining the\npersistent functionality of Weertman-type sliding in process-agnostic sliding\nstudies over rough topography. Last, reviewing observation-based studies we\nsuggest that a simple 'unified' sliding relationship controlled by a single\ntunable coefficient may not be a realistic prospect, but that a Weertman-type\nrelationship with careful consideration of the power value is presently the\n'least bad' option.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
