However,\nthe meridional flow near the solar poles is still unclear. The Hinode\nobservations show that the magnetic flux density in polar caps decreases from\nthe lower latitudes to the poles. Using a surface flux transport model, we\nsimulate the global radial magnetic field to explore the physical process\nleading to the observed polar magnetic distribution pattern. For the first\ntime, the high-resolution observations of the polar magnetic fields observed by\nHinode are used to directly constrain the simulation. Our simulation reproduces\nthe observed properties of the polar magnetic fields, suggesting the existence\nof a counter-cell meridional flow in the solar polar caps with a maximum\namplitude of about 3 m s$^{-1}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
