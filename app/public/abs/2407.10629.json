These methods steer models towards\nfair performance, preventing potential elimination of valuable information that\narises from representation manipulation. Reinforcement Learning (RL), with its\ncapacity for learning through interaction and adjusting reward functions to\nencourage desired behaviors, emerges as a promising tool in this domain. In\nthis paper, we explore the usage of RL to address bias in imbalanced\nclassification by scaling the reward function to mitigate bias. We employ the\ncontextual multi-armed bandit framework and adapt three popular RL algorithms\nto suit our objectives, demonstrating a novel approach to mitigating bias.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
