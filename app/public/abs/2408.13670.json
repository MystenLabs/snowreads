The\ntheory of $q$-deformed quadratic irrationals and quadratic equations with\ninteger coefficients is known and entirely based on this invariance. In this\npaper, we consider the case of cubic irrationals. We show that irreducible\ncubic equations with three distinct real roots and cyclic Galois group~$C_3$\n(or $\\Z/3\\Z$) acting by a third order element of $\\PSL(2,\\Z)$, have a canonical\n$q$-deformation, that we describe. This class of cubic equations contains\nwell-known examples including the equations that describe regular $7$- and\n$9$-gons.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
