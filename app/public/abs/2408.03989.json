The results are given for a general non-Abelian gauge\ntheory with arbitrary (compact semi-simple) gauge group and $n_f$ light fermion\nflavors (quarks) in a common arbitrary representation of the gauge group, which\nincludes QCD as a special case. In particular, we allow for arbitrary flavor\ncontents of each of the currents. For the axial-vector current the included\ncontributions from so-called singlet diagrams are consistent with the one-loop\naxial anomaly.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
