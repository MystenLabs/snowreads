Assuming that the potential wells are\nsymmetric, we derive the semi-classical asymptotics of the splitting between\nthe ground and second state energies. The flux effects due to the Aharonov-Bohm\nvector potential are of lower order compared to the contributions coming from\nthe potential wells.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
