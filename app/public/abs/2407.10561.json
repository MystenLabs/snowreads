In our model, the broker\ntrades in the lit exchange where trades have instantaneous and transient price\nimpact with exponential resilience, while both clients trade with the broker.\nThe informed trader and the broker maximise expected wealth subject to\ninventory penalties, while the uninformed trader is not strategic and sends the\nbroker random buy and sell orders. We characterise the Nash equilibrium of the\ntrading strategies with the solution to a coupled system of forward-backward\nstochastic differential equations (FBSDEs). We solve this system explicitly and\nstudy the effect of information, profitability, and inventory control in the\ntrading strategies of the broker and the informed trader.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GNekiVYuqPOSIexwsrw0Y1QDXd0b6335gwTFYS9oN74","pdfSize":"956663","objectId":"0x6578ca25023e5d82d758601d33e992546d2a005e7bf94f9beb67123ea4e7dfa9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
