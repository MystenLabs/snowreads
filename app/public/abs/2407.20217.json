We develop new results concerning the question\nof which (multi)graphs~$G$ maximize $R(G,p)$ for a given number of vertices\n$n$, edges $m$ and a given parameter $p$ -- such graphs are called optimally\nreliable graphs -- paying particular attention to uniqueness and to whether the\nanswer depends upon $p$.\n  We generalize the concept of a distillation, and build a framework which we\nuse to identify all optimally reliable graphs for which $m-n\\in\\{1,2,3\\}$.\nThese graphs are uniformly optimal in $p$. Many of them have been previously\nidentified, but there are serious problems with these treatments, especially\nfor the case $m-n=3$. We also obtain some partial results for $m-n\\in\\{4,5\\}$.\n  For $m-n=3$, the optimal graphs were incorrectly identified by Wang in 1994,\nin the infinite number of cases where $m\\equiv 5 \\pmod{9}$ and $m\\geq 14$. This\nerroneous result, which concerns subdivisions of $K_{3,3}$, has been cited\nextensively and the mistake has not been detected. Furthermore, while the\noptimal graphs were correctly identified for other values of $m$, the proof is\nincorrect, as it also uses a claim for which we give a counterexample. Our\nproof of the rectified statement is self-contained.\n  Regarding $m-n=4$, it was recently shown by Romero and Safe that the optimal\ngraph depends upon $p$ for infinitely many $m$. We find a new such set of\n$m$-values, which gives a different perspective on why this phenomenon occurs.\nThis leads us to conjecture that there are only finitely many $m$ for which\nthere are uniformly optimal graphs when $m-n=4$, but that, for $m-n=5$, there\nare again infinitely many uniformly optimal graphs. We hope that our general\nresults and methods will be useful for continued investigations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
