While most of reported topological phenomena found in\nmanganites are related to the bulk-like DMI, the understanding of interfacial\nDMI and its origin in oxide interfaces remain limited. Here we experimentally\ninvestigate the interfacial DMI of La_{0.7}Sr_{0.3}MnO_{3} (LSMO) films grown\non various substrates by employing spin-wave propagation with drift velocities\nat room temperature. Our findings reveal a giant interfacial DMI coefficient\n(\\mathit{D} _{s}) of 1.96 pJ/m in LSMO/NdGaO_{3}(110) system, exceeding\npreviously reported values in oxides by one to two orders of magnitude.\nFirst-principles calculations further show that with the aid of 6\\mathit{s}\nelectrons, the 4\\mathit{f} electrons from Nd play a key role in enhancing the\nspin-orbit coupling of the 3\\mathit{d} electrons in Mn, ultimately leading to\nthe observed giant interfacial DMI. This discovery of giant interfacial DMI\nthrough engineering the interface of oxides provides valuable insights for\nadvancing functional chiral magnonics and spintronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
