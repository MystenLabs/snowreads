We introduce Tree-of-Traversals, a novel zero-shot reasoning\nalgorithm that enables augmentation of black-box LLMs with one or more KGs. The\nalgorithm equips a LLM with actions for interfacing a KG and enables the LLM to\nperform tree search over possible thoughts and actions to find high confidence\nreasoning paths. We evaluate on two popular benchmark datasets. Our results\nshow that Tree-of-Traversals significantly improves performance on question\nanswering and KG question answering tasks.
