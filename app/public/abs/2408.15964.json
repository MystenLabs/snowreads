The resulting model has closed-form hazard and\ncumulative hazard functions, facilitating likelihood and Bayesian inference on\nthe parameters. We show that this model can capture a range of hazard shapes,\nsuch as increasing, decreasing, unimodal, bathtub, and oscillatory patterns,\nand characterize the tails of the corresponding survival function. We\nillustrate the use of this model in survival analysis using real data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
