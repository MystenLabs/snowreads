However,\nthe factors that determine the multiplicity of protostellar systems have not\nbeen systematically characterized through their molecular gas. Nobeyama 45m\nRadio Observatory OTF maps of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$ (J = 1--0)\ntoward five subregions in Perseus, complemented with single pointing APEX\nobservations of HNC (J = 4--3) are used to derive physical parameters of the\ndense gas. Both observations have angular resolutions of $\\sim$18\", equivalent\nto $\\sim$5000 AU scales at the distance of Perseus. Kinetic gas temperature is\nderived from the $I$(HCN)/$I$(HNC) J = 1--0 ratio, and H$_2$ density is\nobtained from the HNC J=4--3/J=1--0 ratio. These parameters are used to obtain\nthe N$_2$H$^+$ and HCO$^+$ gas masses. The inferred and derived parameters are\ncompared to source parameters. Inferred mean kinetic gas temperature\n($I$(HCN)/$I$(HNC) J=1--0 ratio; ranging between 15 and 26 K), and H$_2$\nvolumetric density (HNC J=4--3/J=1--0; 10$^5$ -- 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) do not show\ncorrelations with multiplicity in Perseus. The derived gas and dust masses, 1.3\nto 16 $\\times~10^{-9}$ M$_{\\odot}$ for the N$_2$H$^+$ gas mass, 0.1 to 25\nM$_{\\odot}$ for envelope dust masses (850 $\\mu$m), and 0.8 to 10\n$\\times~10^{-10}$ M$_{\\odot}$ for the HCO$^+$ gas mass, are correlated to\nmultiplicity and number of protostellar components. The warm gas masses are a\nfactor of 16 lower than the cold gas masses. This work shows that gas and dust\nmass is correlated to multiplicity at $\\sim$5000 AU scales in Perseus. Higher\norder multiples tend to have higher gas and dust masses in general, while close\nbinaries (separations $\\leq$7\") and single protostars have similar gas and dust\nmass distributions. On the other hand, H$_2$ density and kinetic gas\ntemperature do not show any correlation with multiplicity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
