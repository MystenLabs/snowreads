The novel approach enhances the traditional\nanalysis based on Jacobian matrices by incorporating the Taylor series boundary\nerror of estimation and the eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, resulting in a\nfresh criterion for global stability. The main strength of this methodology\nlies in its unrestricted nature regarding the number of equilibrium points or\nthe system's dimension, giving it a competitive edge over alternative methods\nfor global stability analysis. The efficacy of this method has been validated\nthrough its application to two established benchmark systems within the\nindustrial domain. The results suggest that the expanded Jacobian stability\nanalysis can ensure global stability under specific circumstances, which are\nthoroughly elaborated upon in the manuscript. The proposed approach serves as a\nrobust tool for assessing the global stability of nonlinear systems and holds\npromise for advancing the realms of nonlinear control and optimization.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_IVZy4RRv3oont-Yet6aCDQD2RwdgPMdG0MAmTrysZg","pdfSize":"376942"}
