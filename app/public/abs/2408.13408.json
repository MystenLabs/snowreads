This\npaper investigates the potential of employing multi-modal medical imaging at\nvarious treatment stages to enhance cervical cancer treatment outcomes\nprediction. We show that among Gray Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features,\ncontrast emerges as the most effective texture feature regarding prediction\naccuracy. Integration of multi-modal imaging and texture analysis offers a\npromising avenue for personalized and targeted interventions, as well as more\neffective management of cervical cancer. Moreover, there is potential to reduce\nthe number of time measurements and modalities in future cervical cancer\ntreatment. This research contributes to advancing the field of precision\ndiagnostics by leveraging the information embedded in noninvasive medical\nimages, contributing to improving prognostication and optimizing therapeutic\nstrategies for individuals diagnosed with cervical cancer.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
