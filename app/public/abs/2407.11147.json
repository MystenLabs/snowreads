Our analysis reveals, in particular,\nphenomena of linear index growth for sequences of minimal hypersurfaces of\nfixed topological type, in strong contrast to the three-dimensional scenario.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
