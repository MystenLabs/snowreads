To facilitate\ncalculating such fluctuations, we develop tools to account for correlations\nbetween causal intervals with different cardinalities. We present a convenient\ndecomposition of the fluctuations of the causal set action into contributions\nthat depend on different kinds of correlations. This decomposition can be used\nin causal sets approximated by any spacetime manifold $\\mathcal M$. Our work\npaves the way for investigating a number of interesting discreteness effects,\nsuch as certain aspects of the Everpresent $\\Lambda$ cosmological model.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
