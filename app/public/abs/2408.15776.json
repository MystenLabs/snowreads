We improve this to fixed-parameter-linear delay, following an FPT\npreprocessing phase. The memory consumption of our algorithm is exponential\nwith respect to the treewidth of the hypergraph.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
