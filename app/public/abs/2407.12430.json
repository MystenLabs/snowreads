Unlike the normal fluid whose surface tension decreases\nlinearly with temperature, the self-rewetting fluid consider in the current\nwork has a quadratic temperature dependence of surface tension with a\nwell-defined minimum. we first explored the influence of the Marangoni number\non droplet migration, and found that the droplet hardly deforms and migrates\nslowly when the Marangoni number is small. However, as the Marangoni number\nincreases, the droplet begins to deform and elongate, and its migration speed\nincreases. Subsequently, we studied the effect of surface wettability on\ndroplet migration. The results show that the droplet migrate towards regions of\nhigher surface energy on hydrophilic surfaces and in the opposite direction on\nhydrophobic surfaces. Furthermore, by varying the viscosity ratio and the\ninclination angle of the plate, we found that the droplet's migration speed\ndecreases with an increase in the viscosity ratio. In particular, two vortices\nappear inside the droplet at a high viscosity ratio, whereas only one vortex is\npresent at a low viscosity ratio.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
