To do so, we propose a novel framework that splits the concept\nof tube-based model predictive control into two parts. One runs locally on the\nsystem and is responsible for disturbance rejection, while the other runs\nremotely and provides optimal input trajectories that satisfy the system's\nstate and input constraints. Key to our approach is the presence of a nominal\nmodel and an ancillary controller on the local system. Theoretical guarantees\nregarding the recursive feasibility and the tracking capabilities in the\npresence of disturbances and packet losses in both directions are provided. To\ntest the efficacy of the proposed approach, we compare it to a state-of-the-art\nsolution in the case of controlling a cartpole system. Extensive simulations\nare carried out with both linearized and nonlinear system dynamics, as well as\ndifferent packet loss probabilities and disturbances.
