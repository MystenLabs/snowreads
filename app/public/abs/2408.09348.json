Existing solutions often fail to effectively\nmodel intricate stroke details or adequately address the temporal aspects of\ndrawing. We introduce hyperstroke, a novel stroke representation designed to\ncapture precise fine stroke details, including RGB appearance and alpha-channel\nopacity. Using a Vector Quantization approach, hyperstroke learns compact\ntokenized representations of strokes from real-life drawing videos of artistic\ndrawing. With hyperstroke, we propose to model assistive drawing via a\ntransformer-based architecture, to enable intuitive and user-friendly drawing\napplications, which are experimented in our exploratory evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
