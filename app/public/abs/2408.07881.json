While this procedure is\nresilient to noise and control imperfections, the potential for quantum\nadvantage is unclear. By upper-bounding the gap of the Markov chain, we\nidentify competing factors that limit the algorithm's performance. One needs\nthe quantum dynamics to efficiently delocalize the system over a range of\nclassical states, however, it is also detrimental to introduce too much entropy\nthrough the quench. Specifically, we show that in the long-time limit, the gap\nof the Markov chain is bounded by the inverse participation ratio of the\nclassical states in the eigenstate basis, showing there is no advantage when\nquenching to an ergodic system. For the paradigmatic Sherrington-Kirkpatrick\nand 3-spin model, we identify the regime of optimal spectral gap scaling and\nlink it to the system's eigenstate properties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
