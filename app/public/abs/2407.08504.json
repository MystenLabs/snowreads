By keeping track of the\nreference energy in total energy calculations, we explicitly show that the\n\"potential alignment\" correction vanishes, and the classic Markov-Payne\ncorrection yields accurate results. From linear response theory, we further\nformulate an accurate expression for the quadrupole correction. Application to\nnumerous defects including anisotropic material yields accurate formation\nenergies in small supercells and the historically slow convergence of the 2+\ndiamond vacancy is shown to be a result of slow varying gap levels of the\ndefect leading to a size dependent dielectric constant.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
