We show that the real component of the tidal\nresponse function isn't zero, indicating that a rotating BTZ black hole\npossesses non-zero tidal Love numbers. Additionally, we observe scale-dependent\nbehaviour, known as log-running, in the tidal response function. We also\nconduct a separate analysis on an extremal rotating BTZ black hole, finding\nqualitative similarities with its non-extremal counterpart. In addition, we\npresent a procedure to calculate the tidal response function of a charged\nrotating BTZ black hole as well.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
