In particular, the tasks of different\ntypes and service requirements in MEC network are offloaded from one UAV to\nanother. To pursue the goal of low-carbon edge computing, we study the problem\nof minimizing system energy consumption by jointly optimizing computation\nresource allocation, task scheduling, service placement, and UAV trajectories.\nConsidering the inherent unpredictability associated with task generation and\nthe dynamic nature of wireless fading channels, addressing this problem\npresents a significant challenge. To overcome this issue, we reformulate the\ncomplicated non-convex problem as a Markov decision process and propose a soft\nactor-critic-based trajectory optimization and resource allocation algorithm to\nimplement a flexible learning strategy. Numerical results illustrate that\nwithin a multi-UAV-enabled MEC network, the proposed algorithm effectively\nreduces the system energy consumption in heterogeneous tasks and services\nscenarios compared to other baseline solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
