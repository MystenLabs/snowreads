Resonant mode allows\nfor low power, high frequency operation but requires strict homogeneity of the\nmagnetic fields inside the device. This design was found to efficiently flip\nneutrons at 96.6$\\pm 0.6\\%$ at an effective frequency of 4 MHz with a beam size\nof $2.5~\\times~2.5$~cm and a wavelength of 0.4 nm. The high frequency and\nefficiency enable this device to perform high-resolution neutron spectroscopy\nwith comparable performance to currently implemented rf flipper designs. The\nlimitation of the maximum frequency was found due to the field homogeneity of\nthe device. We numerically analyze the maximum possible efficiency of this\ndesign using a Bloch solver simulation with magnetic fields generated from\nfinite-element simulations. We also discuss future improvements of the\nefficiency and frequency to the design based on the experimental and simulation\nresults.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
