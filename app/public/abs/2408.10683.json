Relationships between arguments are specified in\nargumentation frameworks (AFs), and conditions are placed on sets (extensions)\nof arguments that allow AFs to be evaluated. For more expressiveness, AFs are\naugmented with \\emph{acceptance conditions} on directly interacting arguments\nor a constraint on the admissible sets of arguments, resulting in dialectic\nframeworks or constrained argumentation frameworks. In this paper, we consider\nflexible conditions for \\emph{rejecting} an argument from an extension, which\nwe call rejection conditions (RCs). On the technical level, we associate each\nargument with a specific logic program. We analyze the resulting complexity,\nincluding the structural parameter treewidth. Rejection AFs are highly\nexpressive, giving rise to natural problems on higher levels of the polynomial\nhierarchy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
