The\nnanoplate is described within a simplified strain gradient elasticity theory\nfor isotropic materials, under the Kirchhoff-Love kinematic assumptions in\ninfinitesimal deformation. We prove a global H\\\"older stability estimate of the\nsubgrade coefficient by performing a single interior measurement of the\ntransverse deflection of the nanoplate induced by a load concentrated at one\npoint.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
