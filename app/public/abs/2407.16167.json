Currently, the trajectory planning is mostly done by\nparticle or kinematic model-based optimization controllers. The output of these\nplanners, since they do not consider CG height and its effects, is not unique\nfor different vehicle types, especially for high CG vehicles. As a result, the\ntracking controller may have to work hard to avoid vehicle handling and comfort\nconstraints while trying to realize these sub-optimal trajectories. This paper\ntries to address this problem by considering a planner with simplified double\ntrack model with estimation of lateral and roll based load transfer using\nsteady state equations and a simplified tire model to reduce solver workload.\nThe developed planner is compared with the widely used particle and kinematic\nmodel planners in collision avoidance scenarios in both high and low\nacceleration conditions and with different vehicle heights.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HUx4J35s6JiD29OhSGkD5lzt2UvPREBLciuQtsJ71v8","pdfSize":"1273679","objectId":"0xf03823d260c69ed4db8215e2208dc82266af67e9920c4d85591fe6e37f1e1488","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
