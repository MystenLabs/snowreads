The algorithm initially\ncomputes a Mondrian forest and uses this estimator to identify a relevant\nfeature subspace of the inputs from an estimate of the expected gradient outer\nproduct (EGOP) of the regression function. In addition, we introduce an\niterative approach known as Transformed Iterative Mondrian (TrIM) forest to\nimprove the Mondrian forest estimator by using the EGOP estimate to update the\nset of features and weights used by the Mondrian partitioning mechanism. We\nobtain consistency guarantees and convergence rates for the estimation of the\nEGOP matrix and the random forest estimator obtained from one iteration of the\nTrIM algorithm. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed\nalgorithm for learning the relevant feature subspace across a variety of\nsettings with both simulated and real data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
