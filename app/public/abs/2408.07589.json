This paper focuses on optimizing UAV trajectories to ensure\neffective communication in disaster-stricken areas using terahertz (THz) links.\nWe address specific challenges such as energy consumption, user priority\nlevels, and navigating complex urban environments to maintain Line of Sight\n(LoS) connections amidst 3D obstacles. Our contributions include the\ndevelopment of a detailed modeling approach using online 3D map data, the\nformulation of an optimal trajectory optimization problem, and the proposal of\na Genetic Algorithm (GA)-based method alongside an enhanced heuristic algorithm\nfor faster convergence. Through 3D simulations, we demonstrate the trade-off\nbetween minimizing total service time and prioritizing higher-weight nodes,\nshowing the impact of different priority weight factors on the trajectory time.\nThe proposed algorithms are evaluated using real-world data from the West Bay\narea of Doha, Qatar, demonstrating their effectiveness in optimizing UAV\ntrajectories for emergency response.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
