A common approach is to use large language models\n(LLMs) to construct a hierarchical framework that first plans and then writes.\nDespite the fact that the generated novels reach a sufficient length, they\nexhibit poor logical coherence and appeal in their plots and deficiencies in\ncharacter and event depiction, ultimately compromising the overall narrative\nquality. In this paper, we propose a method named Extracting Excelsior and\nExpanding. Ex3 initially extracts structure information from raw novel data. By\ncombining this structure information with the novel data, an\ninstruction-following dataset is meticulously crafted. This dataset is then\nutilized to fine-tune the LLM, aiming for excelsior generation performance. In\nthe final stage, a tree-like expansion method is deployed to facilitate the\ngeneration of arbitrarily long novels. Evaluation against previous methods\nshowcases Ex3's ability to produce higher-quality long-form novels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"6nXhHOVT8IKw2lajGlWpdliiA-rhrOvyQoHndN3QtJ0","pdfSize":"2091597"}
