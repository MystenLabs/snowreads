The results indicate that 90% of the farmers encounter challenges\nin farming, and all of them express interest in adopting smart farming to\naddress these issues. While 60% of farmers are currently utilizing IoT\ntechnologies, they encounter challenges in implementing smart farming\npractices. Thus, smart farming presents solutions to prevalent challenges\nincluding adverse weather, water scarcity, and labor shortages, though barriers\ninclude cost and educational challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
