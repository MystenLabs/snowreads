The system also displays a complex cascade of\nmagnetic phases arising from geometric and magnetic exchange frustration, with\nhigh sensitivity to the application and direction of small magnetic fields. At\nlow temperature, Eu$_5$Sn$_2$As$_6$ exhibits negative colossal\nmagnetoresistance of up to a factor of $6\\times10^3$. This may be a lower bound\nas the conductivity appears to be shunted by an unknown conduction channel,\ncausing the resistivity to saturate. Mechanisms for the low temperature\nsaturation of resistivity are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
