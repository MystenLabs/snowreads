Using a priori estimates, we show that the periodic waves\nlocally uniformly converge to waves with negative tails, which are transformed\nto the desired branch of solutions. The obtained branch reaches a highest wave,\nthe behavior of which varies with $s$. The work is a generalisation of recent\nwork by Ehrnstr\\\"om-Nik-Walker, and is as far as we know the first simultaneous\nconstruction of small, intermediate and highest solitary waves for the complete\nfamily of (inhomogeneous) fractional KdV equations with negative-order\ndispersive operators. The obtained waves display exponential decay rate as $|x|\n\\to \\infty$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
