However, their domain structures and associated properties\nare basically unknown, despite their potential to result in optimized or new\nphenomena. Density functional theory calculations are performed to investigate\nthe effect of epitaxial strain on multidomains of (Al,Sc)N nitride systems and\nto compare it with the monodomain case. The multidomain systems are predicted\nto have five strain-induced regions, to be denoted as Regions I to V,\nrespectively. Each of these regions is associated with rather different values\nor behaviors of physical properties such as axial ratio, polarizations,\ninternal parameters, bond lengths, etc. Of particular interest is the\nprediction of bent domains under compressive strain extending beyond $-$5.5%,\nwhich indicates that domain walls may play a key role in the mechanical failure\nproperties of these systems. Interestingly, such bending induces the creation\nof a finite in-plane polarization (in addition to out-of-plane dipoles) due to\ngeometric and symmetry considerations. Strikingly too, the bent domains have\nlower energy than the wurtzite monodomains and have atomically sharp\nboundaries. Our findings may pave the way for domain wall engineering in\nferroelectric nitrides.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
