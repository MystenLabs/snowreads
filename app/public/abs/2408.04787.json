In this work,\nwe prove two quite general results, showing that topological pressure is always\ncomputable from above given an enumeration for a forbidden list inducing the\nsubshift, and that for strongly irreducible shifts of finite type, topological\npressure is computable. Our results apply to subshifts on all finitely\ngenerated amenable groups with decidable word problem and generalize several\nprevious results which applied only to $\\mathbb{Z}^d$-subshifts.\n  As corollaries, we obtain some results related to ground state energy and\nentropy, proving that the map sending $\\phi$ to $\\sup_{\\mu \\in M_\\sigma(X)}\n\\int \\phi d\\mu$ is computable/computable from above when $P_X(\\phi)$ is, and\nthat the map sending $\\phi$ to its ground state/residual entropy is computable\nfrom above when $P_X(\\phi)$ is computable.\n  We conclude by giving explicit bounds on computation time of $P_X(\\phi)$ in\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}^d$ setting for SI SFTs and locally constant and rational valued\n$\\phi$, and show that in the special case $X = A^{\\mathbb{Z}^2}$, this\nalgorithm runs in singly exponential time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
