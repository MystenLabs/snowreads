We\nfound that the high stocking density tends to neutralize the delay effect on\nstability. Conditions are established on the parameters to ensure the global\nstability of the equilibrium solution in the case of constant stocking, as well\nas the global stability of the $2$-periodic solution in the case of\n$2$-periodic stocking. Our approach extensively relies on the utilization of\nthe embedding technique. Whether constant stocking or periodic stocking, the\nmodel has the potential to undergo a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in both cases.\nHowever, the Neimark-Sacker bifurcation in the $2$-periodic case results in the\nemergence of two invariant curves that collectively function as a single\nattractor. Finally, we pose open questions in the form of conjectures about\nglobal stability for certain choices of the parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
