We show that this is a special\ncase of a more general phenomenon: The problem of determining the position of\nthe mean among the order statistics of Gaussian random points on the real line\n(\"Youden's demon problem\") is the same as a natural generalization of\nSylvester's Four Point problem to Gaussian points in $\\mathbb{R}^d$. Our main\ntool is the observation that the Gale dual of independent samples in\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$ itself can be taken to be a set of independent points\n(conditioned on barycenter at the origin) when the distribution of the points\nis Gaussian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
