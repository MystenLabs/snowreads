These involutions show the joint symmetry of the\ndistributions of the following two statistics. The first counts the number of\nparts of a partition divisible by $s$, whereas the second counts the number of\ncells in the Ferrers diagram of a partition whose leg length is zero and whose\narm length has remainder $s-1$ when dividing by $s$. In particular, for $s=1$\nthis involution is just conjugation. Additionally, we provide explicit\nexpressions for the bivariate generating functions.\n  Our primary motivation to construct these involutions is that we know only of\ntwo other \"natural\" bijections on integer partitions of a given size, one of\nwhich is the Glaisher-Franklin bijection sending the set of parts divisible by\n$s$, each divided by $s$, to the set of parts occurring at least $s$ times.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ACQ9LB5HjZuGZZsz2u_5ExXDxtPZTr0N3F22VdJkc8M","pdfSize":"316376"}
