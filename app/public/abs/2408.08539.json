The efficiency of the optimization using this method was\ndemonstrated using a model function. By combining Bayesian optimization with\ndata assimilation, the maximum value of the model function was found more\nefficiently. A practical demonstration was also conducted by constructing a\ndata assimilation model for the bandgap of\n(Sr$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$La$_{x_{1}}$Na$_{x_{2}}$)(Ti$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$Ga$_{x_{1}}$Ta$_{x_{2}}$)O$_{3}$.\nThe concentration dependence of the bandgap was analyzed, and synthesis was\nperformed with chemical compositions in the sparse region of the training data\npoints to validate the predictions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
