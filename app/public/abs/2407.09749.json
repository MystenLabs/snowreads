One challenging mathematical\nproblem associated with PAT is reconstructing the initial pressure of the wave\nequation from data collected at the specific surface where the detectors are\npositioned. The study addresses this problem when PAT is modeled by a wave\nequation with unknown sound speed $c$, which is a function of spatial\nvariables, and under the assumption that both the Dirichlet and Neumann\nboundary values on the detector surface are measured. In practical, we\nintroduce a novel implicit learning framework to simultaneously estimate the\nunknown $c$ and the reconstruction operator using only Dirichlet and Neumann\nboundary measurement data. The experimental results confirm the success of our\nproposed framework, demonstrating its ability to accurately estimate variable\nsound speed and the reconstruction operator in PAT.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
