The functional is machine-learned with\nGaussian process regression (GPR) from data computed with Kohn-Sham DFT with\nplane wave bases and local pseudopotentials. The dataset includes multiple\nphases of unary, binary, and ternary compounds containing Li, Al, Mg, Si, As,\nGa, Sb, Na, Sn, P, and In. A total of 433 materials were used for training, and\n18 strained structures were used for each material. Averaged (over the unit\ncell) kinetic energy density is fitted as a function of averaged terms of the\n4th order gradient expansion and the product of the density and effective\npotential. The kinetic energy predicted by the model allows reproducing\nenergy-volume curves around equilibrium geometry with good accuracy. We show\nthat the GPR model beats linear and polynomial regressions. We also find that\nunary compounds sample a wider region of the descriptor space than binary and\nternary compounds, and it is therefore important to include them in the\ntraining set; a GPR model trained on a small number of unary compounds is able\nto extrapolate relatively well to binary and ternary compounds but not vice\nversa.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
