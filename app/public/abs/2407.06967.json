In this paper we present \\textsf{INTERACT},\nan authoring tool for creating advanced 3D physics-based Intelligent Tutoring\nSystems (ITS) by individual developers or small-scale development teams.\n\\textsf{INTERACT} is based on a cutting edge physics engine allowing realistic\ninteractions such as collision detection and ergonomic evaluations. We\ndemonstrate the benefits of \\textsf{INTERACT} by developing a set of training\nscenarios for a use case of a Laser cutting machine. The use case illustrates\nthe numerous possibilities such as creating interaction with objects, ease of\nconfiguring a scenario and how to design the visual effects to the machine.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
