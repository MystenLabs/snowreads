This paper develops a formal framework for\ndescribing these algorithms in terms of string diagrams: a key step towards\nintegrating these hybrid algorithms into existing work using string diagrams\nfor machine learning and differentiable programming. A notable feature of our\nstring diagrams is the use of functor boxes, which correspond to a\nquantum-classical interfaces. The functor used is a lax monoidal functor\nembedding the quantum systems into classical, and the lax monoidality imposes\nrestrictions on the string diagrams when extracting classical data from quantum\nsystems via measurement. In this way, our framework provides initial steps\ntoward a denotational semantics for hybrid quantum machine learning algorithms\nthat captures important features of quantum-classical interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tuUfGYcdpuGV3ksWeBqqQPh89xxvCF8af3dvGUI3H_8","pdfSize":"434449"}
