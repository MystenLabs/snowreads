In frequentist and Bayesian statistical analysis, methods\nsuch as Mixed linear models allow the variability or correlation within\nindividuals to be taken into account. However, in more straightforward\nscenarios, where only two stages of an experiment are observed (pre-treatment\nvs. post-treatment), there are only a few tools available, mainly for\ncontinuous outcomes. Thus, this work introduces a Bayesian statistical\nmethodology for comparing paired samples in binary pretest-posttest scenarios.\nWe establish a Bayesian probabilistic model for the inferential analysis of the\nunknown quantities, which is validated and refined through simulation analyses,\nand present an application to a dataset taken from the Television School and\nFamily Smoking Prevention and Cessation Project (TVSFP) (Flay et al., 1995).\nThe application of the Full Bayesian Significance Test (FBST) for precise\nhypothesis testing, along with the implementation of adaptive significance\nlevels in the decision-making process, is included.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
