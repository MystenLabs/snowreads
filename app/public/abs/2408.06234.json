The computation is done\nin the framework of Lipatov's gauge-invariant EFT for Multi-Regge processes in\nQCD with the tilted-Wilson-line regularisation for rapidity divergences. As\nexpected, only single-logarithmic rapidity divergence proportional to the\none-loop Regge trajectory of a gluon remains in the final result for\nimpact-factors. Numerical comparison with Regge limits ($s/(-t) \\gg 1$) of\none-loop QCD amplitudes, described in the paper, provides a strong cross-check\nof obtained results. The relations of obtained results with other\nregularisation schemes for rapidity divergences used in low-$x$ physics, such\nas BFKL scheme, High-Energy Factorisation (HEF) scheme and shockwave scheme,\nare given.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
