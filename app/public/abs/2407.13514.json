While useful for studying topological patterns in functional brain\nconnectivity, the main limitation of these methods is their inability to\ncapture the directional dynamics - which is crucial for understanding effective\nbrain connectivity. We propose the Causality-Based Topological Ranking (CBTR)\nmethod, which integrates Causal Inference (CI) to assess effective brain\nconnectivity with Hodge Decomposition (HD) to rank brain regions based on their\nmutual influence. Our simulations confirm that the CBTR method accurately and\nconsistently identifies hierarchical structures in multivariate time series\ndata. Moreover, this method effectively identifies brain regions showing the\nmost significant interaction changes with other regions during seizures using\nelectroencephalogram (EEG) data. These results provide novel insights into the\nbrain's hierarchical organization and illuminate the impact of seizures on its\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
