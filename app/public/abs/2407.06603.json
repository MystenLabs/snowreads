In this paper we first give a\ndecomposition $W_{(d-1,1)}(V,\\K)=\\bigoplus_{i=1}^{d-1}W_{(d-1,1)}^i(V,\\K)$. We\nfinally prove the vanishing of the hyperdeterminant of any\n$F\\in(\\bigoplus_{\\lambda\\ne(d),(d-1,1)})\\oplus W_{(d-1,1)}^i(V,\\K)$. This\nimproves the result in [10] and [1], where the same result was proved without\nthis new last summand.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
