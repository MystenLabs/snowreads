Traditional computer-aided drug design (CADD) has made\nsignificant progress in accelerating this process, but the development of\nquantum computing offers potential due to its unique capabilities. This paper\ndiscusses the integration of quantum computing into drug discovery and\ndevelopment, focusing on how quantum technologies might accelerate and enhance\nvarious stages of the drug development cycle. Specifically, we explore the\napplication of quantum computing in addressing challenges related to drug\ndiscovery, such as molecular simulation and the prediction of drug-target\ninteractions, as well as the optimization of clinical trial outcomes. By\nleveraging the inherent capabilities of quantum computing, we might be able to\nreduce the time and cost associated with bringing new drugs to market,\nultimately benefiting public health.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MO05xxsdNGO6LkYobGj16zYox4cjuiLk9nKhQS3p9Hg","pdfSize":"4176822"}
