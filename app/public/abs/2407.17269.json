{"id":"2407.17269","title":"Advanced Penetration Testing for Enhancing 5G Security","authors":"Shari-Ann Smith-Haynes","authorsParsed":[["Smith-Haynes","Shari-Ann",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 13:35:35 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-25","timestamp":1721828135000,"abstract":"  Advances in fifth-generation (5G) networks enable unprecedented reliability,\nspeed, and connectivity compared to previous mobile networks. These\nadvancements can revolutionize various sectors by supporting applications\nrequiring real-time data processing. However, the rapid deployment and\nintegration of 5G networks bring security concerns that must be addressed to\noperate these infrastructures safely. This paper reviews penetration testing\napproaches for identifying security vulnerabilities in 5G networks. Penetration\ntesting is an ethical hacking technique used to simulate a network's security\nposture in the event of cyberattacks. This review highlights the capabilities,\nadvantages, and limitations of recent 5G-targeting security tools for\npenetration testing. It examines ways adversaries exploit vulnerabilities in 5G\nnetworks, covering tactics and strategies targeted at 5G features. A key topic\nexplored is the comparison of penetration testing methods for 5G and earlier\ngenerations. The article delves into the unique characteristics of 5G,\nincluding massive MIMO, edge computing, and network slicing, and how these\naspects require new penetration testing methods. Understanding these\ndifferences helps develop more effective security solutions tailored to 5G\nnetworks. Our research also indicates that 5G penetration testing should use a\nmultithreaded approach for addressing current security challenges. Furthermore,\nthis paper includes case studies illustrating practical challenges and\nlimitations in real-world applications of penetration testing in 5G networks. A\ncomparative analysis of penetration testing tools for 5G networks highlights\ntheir effectiveness in mitigating vulnerabilities, emphasizing the need for\nadvanced security measures against evolving cyber threats in 5G deployment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3XnLnrOulBPrZXo_XIRbncl6rUXRX8gK7Q8_SZeJ4kU","pdfSize":"371724"}
