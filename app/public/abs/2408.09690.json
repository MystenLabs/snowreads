Although widely believed to\nbe important in counterbalancing against collapse in star formation, a clear\nevaluation of the role of the magnetic field in star formation remains hard to\nachieve. Past research attempts to evaluate the importance of magnetic forces\nusing diagnostics such as the mass-to-flux ratio, which measures its strength\nbut not how it functions. Since star formation is a complex process and the\nobserved regions have complex structures, mapping the importance of the\nmagnetic field is necessary. We propose a new technique, the Curvature Mapping\nMethod, to evaluate the role of the magnetic force by providing maps of the\nmagnetic force estimated using polarization observations. The Curvature Mapping\nMethod provides maps with the contribution of the magnetic force clearly\noutlined. We apply the method to the star formation region of Orion A and\nprovide a first quantitative result where the magnetic force arising from the\npinched magnetic field does provide support against gravity. By comparing it\nagainst the gravitational force, we find that the magnetic force is enough to\naffect the low-density gas but is insufficient to support the dense region from\ncollapse. The method effectively uses information contained in polarization\nmaps and can be applied to data from surveys to understand the role of the\nB-field.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
