Consequently, the motivations for investigating physical systems\ncapable of performing this task are numerous. Furthermore, the potential to\ndevelop an optical computer to replace conventional computers has led us to\ncreate an optical algorithm and propose an experimental setup for implementing\nthe derivative of one-dimensional real-valued functions using a paraxial and\nmonochromatic laser beam. To complement the differentiation algorithm, we have\nexperimentally implemented a novel optical algorithm that can transfer a\ntwo-dimensional phase-encoded function to the intensity profile of a light\nbeam. Additionally, we demonstrate how to implement the n-th derivative of\nfunctions encoded in the phase of the transverse profile of photons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RmQ6JpapzV_IE7IykIYmTIffkFcnrIgOSCyOkDaj1J0","pdfSize":"2600516"}
