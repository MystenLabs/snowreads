These states require transparent interfaces between the\nsemiconductor and superconductor, which are typically realised by in-situ\ndeposition of an Al superconducting layer. Here we present a hybrid material\nbased on an InAs two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) combined with in-situ\ndeposited Nb and NbTi superconductors, which offer a larger operating range in\ntemperature and magnetic field due to their larger superconducting gap. We\novercome the inherent difficulty associated with the formation of an amorphous\ninterface between III-V semiconductors and Nb-based superconductors by\nintroducing a 7 nm Al interlayer. The Al interlayer provides an epitaxial\nconnection between an in-situ magnetron sputtered Nb or NbTi thin film and a\nshallow InAs 2DEG. This metal-to-metal epitaxy is achieved by optimization of\nthe material stack and results in an induced superconducting gap of\napproximately 1 meV, determined from transport measurements of\nsuperconductor-semiconductor Josephson junctions. This induced gap is\napproximately five times larger than the values reported for Al-based hybrid\nmaterials and indicates the formation of highly-transparent interfaces that are\nrequired in high-quality hybrid material platforms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
