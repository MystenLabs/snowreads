We study this question in two-dimensional de Sitter JT\ngravity coupled to conformal matter. The effect of the boundaries has its roots\nin quantum corrections to the vacuum energy of the CFT due to Casimir-like\neffects. We consider two different kinds of timelike boundaries, either at\nlocations where the coordinate $\\varphi$ is constant or at locations where the\ndilaton is constant. For each kind we compute the vacuum expectation value of\nthe matter CFT stress tensor. The stress tensor violates the null energy\ncondition in the first case and saturates it in the second case, with each case\nexhibiting a negative energy density in the vacuum state. We then compute the\nsemiclassical backreaction of this energy density and show how it can make the\nspacetime \"fatter\" or \"taller\" or a combination of both, depending on the\nregime. The spacetime getting fatter corresponds to an increase in the value of\nthe dilaton at the horizon and hence also in the static patch horizon area in\nthe higher-dimensional solution. We comment on the implications of our results\nfor the quantum theories living on the timelike boundaries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
