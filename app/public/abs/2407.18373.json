However, traditional deep neural networks often face\nchallenges in achieving high accuracy without incurring significant\ncomputational costs. In this work, we implement the Physics-Informed\nKolmogorov-Arnold Neural Networks (PIKAN) through efficient-KAN and WAV-KAN,\nwhich utilize the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem. PIKAN demonstrates\nsuperior performance compared to conventional deep neural networks, achieving\nthe same level of accuracy with fewer layers and reduced computational\noverhead. We explore both B-spline and wavelet-based implementations of PIKAN\nand benchmark their performance across various ordinary and partial\ndifferential equations using unsupervised (data-free) and supervised\n(data-driven) techniques. For certain differential equations, the data-free\napproach suffices to find accurate solutions, while in more complex scenarios,\nthe data-driven method enhances the PIKAN's ability to converge to the correct\nsolution. We validate our results against numerical solutions and achieve $99\n\\%$ accuracy in most scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
