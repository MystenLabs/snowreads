The associated deformed $su(2)$ algebra,\n$su_{\\nu}(2)$, and the deformed $so(3)$ algebra, $so_{\\nu}(3)$, are constructed\nfor the widely used Jordan-Schwinger and Holstein-Primakoff realizations,\ncommenting on various aspects and ingredients of the formalism for both\nsingle-mode and two-mode cases. Finally, in this framework the parity-deformed\n$so_{\\nu}(3)$ representation is analyzed, due to its potential application in\nthe study of qubit and qutrit systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vxrkXatNQhl9d2Ot9qcaYunH79uS0U4Od8sSXZ4JtJU","pdfSize":"443760","objectId":"0x596eb151378a73f9a0e9d0843d3558dc7cca782019e4e48d499fc362ff7e678e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
