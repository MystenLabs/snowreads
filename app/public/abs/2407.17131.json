However, the importance of phase convention has\nbeen overlooked for a long time and the sources of different conventions are\nnever explicitly addressed. This obscure situation can cause mistakes and\nmisinterpretations in hadron physics. In this paper, we systematically analyze\nand compare the flavor $SU_3$ phase conventions from the perspective of the\nquark model. All sources which could lead to different conventions are pointed\nout and carefully studied. With the tool of the quark model, we also clarify\nsome misconceptions and demonstrate a consistent way to incorporate different\nconventions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cMWb6CZzVzJPOmr4AAGcJ4R1N93TF4xRgZZQKIxPt64","pdfSize":"615504","objectId":"0x1cb5099c9ac4fe77c42a99c7af31c347e4cc35d0a849be5ec0282e64cff103d2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
