Individual treatment effect offers the\nmost granular measure of treatment effect on an individual level, and is the\nmost useful to facilitate personalized care. However, its estimation and\ninference remain underdeveloped due to several challenges. In this article, we\npropose a novel conformal diffusion model-based approach that addresses those\nintricate challenges. We integrate the highly flexible diffusion modeling, the\nmodel-free statistical inference paradigm of conformal inference, along with\npropensity score and covariate local approximation that tackle distributional\nshifts. We unbiasedly estimate the distributions of potential outcomes for\nindividual treatment effect, construct an informative confidence interval, and\nestablish rigorous theoretical guarantees. We demonstrate the competitive\nperformance of the proposed method over existing solutions through extensive\nnumerical studies.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
