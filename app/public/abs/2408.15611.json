Our methods enumerate several lengths beyond\nthe currently known state-of-the-art available searches: we conducted\nexhaustive searches for periodic Golay pairs of all lengths $v \\leq 72$ using\nour methods, while only lengths $v \\leq 34$ had previously been exhaustively\nenumerated. Our methods are applicable to periodic complementary sequences in\ngeneral. We utilize sequence compression, a method of sequence generation\nderived in 2013 by Djokovi\\'c and Kotsireas. We also introduce and implement a\nnew method of \"multi-level\" compression, where sequences are uncompressed in\nseveral steps. This method allowed us to exhaustively search all lengths $v\n\\leq 72$ using less than 10 CPU years. For cases of complementary sequences\nwhere uncompression is not possible, we introduce some new methods of sequence\ngeneration inspired by the isomorph-free exhaustive generation algorithm of\norderly generation. Finally, we pose a conjecture regarding the structure of\nperiodic Golay pairs and prove it holds in many lengths, including all lengths\n$v \\lt 100$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
