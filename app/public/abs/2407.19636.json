Recent discoveries on\nsurface-specific electronic states on other 3d transition-metal disulfide\npyrites motivate us to further investigate the surface of NiS2, where metallic\nsurface conduction is discussed. Here, the spectroscopic-imaging\nscanning-tunneling-microscopy observations revealed that the surface is not\nmetallic, contrary to the expectation. Instead, the Mott gap is closed near\nstep edges, suggesting possible electrical conduction from one-dimensional\nchannels. The edge anomaly was observed irrespective of its magnetic order and\nis limited to the insulator phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jVXB5yhWUQGc9yOiCA-jjMn8FuQkAvMcrSoydCQMtDM","pdfSize":"2747986"}
