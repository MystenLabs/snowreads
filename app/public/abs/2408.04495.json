Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational\nfield of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive\ncrosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be\neffectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black\nhole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy\ncondition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the\namount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be\ninstrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also\nconsider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and\npoint out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them\nfrom the thermodynamic point of view.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
