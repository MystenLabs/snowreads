Continuing the paradigm of machine learning algebraic\ngeometry, we here investigate the triple intersection numbers, focusing on\ncertain divisibility invariants constructed therefrom, using the Inception\nconvolutional neural network. We find $\\sim90\\%$ accuracies in prediction in a\nstandard fivefold cross-validation, signifying that more sophisticated tasks of\nidentification of manifold topologies can also be performed by machine\nlearning.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"T5qLUvfcJgY1NwuPC_RSKn1U0pgJJ_wU6FSam6ekXAU","pdfSize":"514371"}
