Build upon recent advancements of the general\nsynthetic iterative scheme (GSIS), this paper presents an efficient solver to\nsimulate the large displacement of rigid-body in rarefied gas flows. The newly\ndeveloped solver utilizes a dual time step method to solve the mesoscopic\nkinetic and macroscopic synthetic equations alternately, in an arbitrary\nLagrangian-Eulerian framework. Additionally, the overset mesh is used and the\nsix degree-of-freedom rigid body dynamics equation is integrated to track the\nmotion of solids. Four moving boundary problems encompassing a wide range of\nflow velocities and gas rarefaction are simulated, including the periodic\npitching of airfoil, particle motion in lid-driven cavity flow, two-body\nseparation in supersonic flow, and three-dimensional lunar landing,\ndemonstrating the accuracy and efficiency of the GSIS in handling multi-scale\nmoving boundary problems within an overset framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_26wXS6RXpNMCmPvNUfMBS7AFu5d7BwFgkSA7GQCkm8","pdfSize":"12993675"}
