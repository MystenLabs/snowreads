Since the pioneering contribution of Johnson\n(1960), the optimal hedge ratio based on futures is regularly utilized. The\ncurrent paper suggests an explicit and efficient method for testing the null\nhypothesis of a symmetric optimal hedge ratio against an asymmetric alternative\none within a multivariate setting. If the null is rejected, the position\ndependent optimal hedge ratios can be estimated via the suggested model. This\napproach is expected to enhance the accuracy of the implemented hedging\nstrategies compared to the standard methods since it accounts for the fact that\nthe source of risk depends on whether the investor is a buyer or a seller of\nthe risky asset. An application is provided using spot and futures prices of\nBitcoin. The results strongly support the view that the optimal hedge ratio for\nthis cryptocurrency is position dependent. The investor that is long in Bitcoin\nhas a much higher conditional optimal hedge ratio compared to the one that is\nshort in the asset. The difference between the two conditional optimal hedge\nratios is statistically significant, which has important repercussions for\nimplementing risk management strategies.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
