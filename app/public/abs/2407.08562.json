Comput. `85] developed\nsubgraph listing algorithms for triangles, 4-cycle and $k$-cliques, where $k\n\\geq 3.$ The runtimes of their algorithms are parameterized by the number of\nedges $m$ and the arboricity $\\alpha$ of a graph. The arboricity $\\alpha$ of a\ngraph is the minimum number of spanning forests required to cover it. Their\nwork introduces: * A triangle listing algorithm that runs in $O(m\\alpha)$ time.\n* An output-sensitive 4-Cycle-Listing algorithm that lists all 4-cycles in\n$O(m\\alpha + t)$ time, where $t$ is the number of 4-cycles in the graph. * A\nk-Clique-Listing algorithm that runs in $O(m\\alpha^{k-2})$ time, for $k \\geq\n4.$\n  Despite the widespread use of these algorithms in practice, no improvements\nhave been made over them in the past few decades. Therefore, recent work has\ngone into studying lower bounds for subgraph listing problems. The works of\nKopelowitz, Pettie and Porat [SODA `16] and Vassilevska W. and Xu [FOCS `20]\nshowed that the triangle-listing algorithm of Chiba and Nishizeki is optimal\nunder the $\\mathsf{3SUM}$ and $\\mathsf{APSP}$ hypotheses respectively. However,\nit remained open whether the remaining algorithms were optimal.\n  In this note, we show that in fact all the above algorithms are optimal under\npopular hardness conjectures. First, we show that the\n$\\mathsf{4}\\text{-}\\mathsf{Cycle}\\text{-}\\mathsf{Listing}$ algorithm is tight\nunder the $\\mathsf{3SUM}$ hypothesis following the techniques of Jin and Xu\n[STOC `23], and Abboud, Bringmann and Fishcher [STOC `23] . Additionally, we\nshow that the $k\\text{-}\\mathsf{Clique}\\text{-}\\mathsf{Listing}$ algorithm is\nessentially tight under the exact $k$-clique hypothesis by following the\ntechniques of Dalirooyfard, Mathialagan, Vassilevska W. and Xu [STOC `24].\nThese hardness results hold even when the number of 4-cycles or $k$-cliques in\nthe graph is small.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z-vgXA6vDamlckcNV33Yneygy9dh8lGxInHVtMC-Y90","pdfSize":"423460"}
