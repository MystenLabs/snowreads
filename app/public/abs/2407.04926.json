On the other hand,\ntracking-by-attention (TBA) methods have the potential to outperform TBD\nmethods, particularly for long occlusions and challenging detection settings.\nThis work investigates why TBA methods continue to lag in performance behind\nTBD methods using a LiDAR-based joint detector and tracker called JDT3D. Based\non this analysis, we propose two generalizable methods to bridge the gap\nbetween TBD and TBA methods: track sampling augmentation and confidence-based\nquery propagation. JDT3D is trained and evaluated on the nuScenes dataset,\nachieving 0.574 on the AMOTA metric on the nuScenes test set, outperforming all\nexisting LiDAR-based TBA approaches by over 6%. Based on our results, we\nfurther discuss some potential challenges with the existing TBA model\nformulation to explain the continued gap in performance with TBD methods.
