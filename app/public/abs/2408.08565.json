The seesaw mechanism explains the smallness of\nthese masses through the introduction of heavy right-handed neutrino (RHN)\nstates. The RHN states can aslo generate Dirac neutrino masses at tree or loop\nlevel. These heavy states can exist at the electroweak scale, approximately in\nthe $\\mathcal{O}(\\mathrm{GeV})$ range, and can be investigated through current\nand future collider experiments. This scenario, where other new physics\ninteractions occur at scales much higher than the RHN scale, can be described\nusing an effective field theory (EFT) framework known as $N_R$-EFT. This study\nfocuses on constraining the Wilson coefficients of $N_R$-EFT operators, which\nprimarily contribute to tri-lepton production and missing energy signals at the\nLHC. We examine both the scenarios where the RHN mass $M_N$ is less than and\ngreater than the $W$ boson mass $M_W$, and provide predictions for the\nHigh-Luminosity run of the LHC (HL-LHC).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vxWtpx_SbD8phbnt7IsGMaKo4sKgtmPeFIOJA_B5-k4","pdfSize":"3410327"}
