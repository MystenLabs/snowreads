We extend this model by incorporating\nthe symmetric conditions at the end of the Universe, which impose constraints\non the allowed perturbation modes. These constrained modes conflict with the\ninteger wave vectors required by the global spatial geometry in a closed\nuniverse. To resolve this conflict, only specific values of curvature are\npermissible, and in particular the curvature density is constrained to be\n$\\Omega_K \\in \\{-0.014, -0.009, -0.003, \\ldots\\}$, consistent with Planck\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
