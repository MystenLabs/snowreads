The\nNN-equalizers are combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to\napproach the information rates of joint detection and decoding (JDD) with\nconsiderably less complexity than JDD and other existing equalizers.\nSimulations for short-haul optical fiber links with square-law detection\nillustrate the gains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
