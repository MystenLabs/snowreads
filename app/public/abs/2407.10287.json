Here we present\ngeneral methods to obtain Gauss relations among those generalized\nhypergeometric functions. The hypergeometric expressions of Feynman integral\nare analytically continued from some connected component to another by the\nGauss inverse relations, then continued to the whole domain of definition by\nthe Gauss-Kummer relations. The Laurant series of the Feynman integral around\nthe time-space dimension $D=4$ is obtained by the Gauss adjacent relations\nwhere the coefficients of powers of $D-4$ are given as some finite linear\ncombinations of hypergeometric functions with integer parameters. As an\nexample, we illustrate how to use the method to obtain the analytic expression\nof the Feynman integral of one-loop self energy in its whole domain of\ndefinition.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
