However,\nexisting dimension reduction methods often discuss communication in the absence\nof a formal framework, while frameworks proposed to address this gap are\nimpractical in data analysis. This work bridges the formal framework of\nM-Information Flow with practical analysis of real neural data. To this end, we\npropose Iterative Regression, a message-dependent linear dimension reduction\ntechnique that iteratively finds an orthonormal basis such that each basis\nvector maximizes correlation between the projected data and the message. We\nthen define 'M-forwarding' to formally capture the notion of a message being\nforwarded from one neural population to another. We apply our methodology to\nrecordings we collected from two neural populations in a simplified model of\nwhisker-based sensory detection in mice, and show that the low-dimensional\nM-forwarding structure we infer supports biological evidence of a similar\nstructure between the two original, high-dimensional populations.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
