KV\nstores frequently consist of heterogeneous clusters, characterized by varying\nhardware specifications of the deployment nodes, with each node potentially\nrunning a distinct version of the KV store software. This heterogeneity is\naccompanied by the diverse metadata that they need to manage. In this study, we\nintroduce MetaHive, a cache-optimized approach to managing metadata in\nheterogeneous KV store clusters. MetaHive disaggregates the original data from\nits associated metadata to promote independence between them, while maintaining\ntheir interconnection during usage. This makes the metadata opaque from the\ndownstream processes and the other KV stores in the cluster. MetaHive also\nensures that the KV and metadata entries are stored in the vicinity of each\nother in memory and storage. This allows MetaHive to optimally utilize the\ncaching mechanism without extra storage read overhead for metadata retrieval.\nWe deploy MetaHive to ensure data integrity in RocksDB and demonstrate its\nrapid data validation with minimal effect on performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"AcAYjKuyYs5XD-UR3Nvf7OTAepyLfhYlsnumSc5G0ZA","pdfSize":"2091839"}
