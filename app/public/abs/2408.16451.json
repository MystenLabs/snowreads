Traditional\nmethods for identifying tooth-marked tongues are subjective and inconsistent\nbecause they rely on practitioner experience. We propose a novel fully\nautomated Weakly Supervised method using Vision transformer and Multiple\ninstance learning WSVM for tongue extraction and tooth-marked tongue\nrecognition. Our approach first accurately detects and extracts the tongue\nregion from clinical images, removing any irrelevant background information.\nThen, we implement an end-to-end weakly supervised object detection method. We\nutilize Vision Transformer (ViT) to process tongue images in patches and employ\nmultiple instance loss to identify tooth-marked regions with only image-level\nannotations. WSVM achieves high accuracy in tooth-marked tongue classification,\nand visualization experiments demonstrate its effectiveness in pinpointing\nthese regions. This automated approach enhances the objectivity and accuracy of\ntooth-marked tongue diagnosis. It provides significant clinical value by\nassisting TCM practitioners in making precise diagnoses and treatment\nrecommendations.
