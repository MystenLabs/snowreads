The initial disruption can have energies on\npar with supernovae and power a very fast transient. In this work we examine\nthe primary flare that will follow the initial transient, which arises when\nstreams of gas from the disrupted stars travel around the central black hole\nand collide with each other on the antipodal side with respect to the original\ncollision. We present a simple analytic estimate for the properties of the\nflare, which depends on the distance of the collision from the central black\nhole and on the center of mass velocity of the colliding stars. We also present\nfirst of their kind radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of a few examples of\nstellar collisions and post-collision flow of the ejected gas, and calculate\nthe expected bolometric light curves. We find that such post-collision flares\nare expected to be similar to flares which arise in tidal disruptions events of\nsingle stars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Sr1K_bJs_TwmsFzJORYsG6MkmJ_pl4_vMWskA22_hH0","pdfSize":"1913527"}
