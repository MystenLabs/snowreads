By applying the central limit theorem\n(CLT), we derive approximate expressions for the system outage probability when\nthe RIS has a large number of elements. Also, we adopt the block-correlation\nchannel model to simplify the outage probability expressions, reducing the\ncomputational complexity and shedding light on the impact of the number of\nports. Numerical results validate the effectiveness of our analysis, especially\nin scenarios with a large number of RIS elements.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
