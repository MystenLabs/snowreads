This evolution method shows that the saturation scale and\ngeometric scaling are retained. We derived analytical results for the\nintegrated and unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution functions and\ncompared them with the CJ15 parametrization group and the unintegrated color\ndipole gluon distribution models respectively. The Sudakov form factor into the\nevolution of the unintegrated color dipole gluon distribution is incorporated\nand the results are considered at small and large values of $k_{t}^{2}$\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gxze9qKUNJWnC9_hbl6pjyqKJyx0aCkka9xoJaSxGCI","pdfSize":"302014","objectId":"0x38d94016be84d2dd13846bf2418e6eaec6df5614b0b82f04c06979718b3bdf3e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
