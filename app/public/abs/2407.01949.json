Technologies are being developed\nto remove large quantities of carbon from the atmosphere. Enhanced rock\nweathering (ERW), where fine-grained silicate minerals are spread on soil, is a\npromising carbon removal method that can also support crop yields and maintain\noverall soil health. Quantifying the amount of carbon removed by ERW is crucial\nfor understanding the potential of ERW globally and for building trust in\ncommercial operations. However, reliable and scalable quantification in complex\nmedia like soil is challenging and there is not yet a consensus on the best\nmethod of doing so. Here we discuss mass-balance methods, where stocks of base\ncations in soil are monitored over time to infer the amount of inorganic carbon\nbrought into solution by weathering reactions. First, we review the fundamental\nconcepts of mass-balance methods and explain different ways of approaching the\nmass-balance problem. Then we discuss experimental planning and data\ncollection, suggesting some best practices. Next, we present a software package\ndesigned to facilitate a range of tasks in ERW like uncertainty analysis,\nplanning field trials, and validating statistical methods. Finally, we briefly\nreview ways of estimating carbon removal using mass balance before discussing\nsome advantages of Bayesian inference in this context and presenting an example\nBayesian model. The model is fit to simulated data and recovers the correct\nanswer with a clear representation of uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C-N85W3_VoaKx6Xae3s4ZXS9OiGVX3GwMdUgiSWWk_s","pdfSize":"1913973"}
