In a\ndeparture from existing work, this result is valid under only sub-exponential\nassumptions on the summands, and does not require any assumptions on their\nsmoothness or lattice structure. The derived saddlepoint approximation result\ncan be directly applied to resampling-based hypothesis tests, including\nbootstrap, sign-flipping and conditional randomization tests. We exemplify this\nby providing the first rigorous justification of a saddlepoint approximation\nfor the sign-flipping test of symmetry about the origin, initially proposed in\n1955. On the way to our main result, we establish a conditional Berry-Esseen\ninequality for sums of conditionally independent random variables, which may be\nof independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
