By considering neutral meson\nmixings, such as $f_1(1285) - a_1^0(1260)$, $f_{1S}(1420) - a_1^0(1260)$ and\n$\\eta-\\pi^0$ for the channels investigated, the leading three-meson\ninteractions may lead to decay amplitudes that undergo interference and a\nresulting ratio of decay rate into charged pions,\n$\\Gamma_{\\pi^+}/\\Gamma_{\\pi^-}$, slightly smaller than one. For that it will be\nassumed that the produced charged vector mesons or charged scalar mesons\nundergo absorption, decay into channels without charged pions, or any other\ninelastic process that may suppress their decays into charged pions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
