We subdivide the time interval into sub-intervals, then we\nuse the quadratic polynomials for the approximation between two successive\nintervals. The main properties of the stochastic numerical methods, e.g.\nconvergence, consistency, and stability are analyzed. We test the proposed\nmethod in SDE problem, demonstrating promising results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
