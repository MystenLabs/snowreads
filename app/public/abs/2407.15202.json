Despite the application of deep learning methods to DTA prediction,\nthe achieved accuracy remain suboptimal. In this work, inspired by the recent\nsuccess of retrieval methods, we propose $k$NN-DTA, a non-parametric\nembedding-based retrieval method adopted on a pre-trained DTA prediction model,\nwhich can extend the power of the DTA model with no or negligible cost.\nDifferent from existing methods, we introduce two neighbor aggregation ways\nfrom both embedding space and label space that are integrated into a unified\nframework. Specifically, we propose a \\emph{label aggregation} with\n\\emph{pair-wise retrieval} and a \\emph{representation aggregation} with\n\\emph{point-wise retrieval} of the nearest neighbors. This method executes in\nthe inference phase and can efficiently boost the DTA prediction performance\nwith no training cost. In addition, we propose an extension, Ada-$k$NN-DTA, an\ninstance-wise and adaptive aggregation with lightweight learning. Results on\nfour benchmark datasets show that $k$NN-DTA brings significant improvements,\noutperforming previous state-of-the-art (SOTA) results, e.g, on BindingDB\nIC$_{50}$ and $K_i$ testbeds, $k$NN-DTA obtains new records of RMSE\n$\\bf{0.684}$ and $\\bf{0.750}$. The extended Ada-$k$NN-DTA further improves the\nperformance to be $\\bf{0.675}$ and $\\bf{0.735}$ RMSE. These results strongly\nprove the effectiveness of our method. Results in other settings and\ncomprehensive studies/analyses also show the great potential of our $k$NN-DTA\napproach.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
