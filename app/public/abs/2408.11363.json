To streamline this process, we introduce ProteinGPT, a\nstate-of-the-art multi-modal protein chat system, that allows users to upload\nprotein sequences and/or structures for comprehensive protein analysis and\nresponsive inquiries. ProteinGPT seamlessly integrates protein sequence and\nstructure encoders with linear projection layers for precise representation\nadaptation, coupled with a large language model (LLM) to generate accurate and\ncontextually relevant responses. To train ProteinGPT, we construct a\nlarge-scale dataset of 132,092 proteins with annotations, and optimize the\ninstruction-tuning process using GPT-4o. This innovative system ensures\naccurate alignment between the user-uploaded data and prompts, simplifying\nprotein analysis. Experiments show that ProteinGPT can produce promising\nresponses to proteins and their corresponding questions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZKM5WcnTbpY3e-TJM7l7jZmU20PS6-l1isDgiRmMg-U","pdfSize":"1805735"}
