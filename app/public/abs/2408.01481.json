Recent studies have applied machine\nlearning to evaluate creativity in drawings, but not paintings. Our research\naddresses this gap by developing a CNN model to automatically assess the\ncreativity of human paintings. Using a dataset of six hundred paintings by\nprofessionals and children, our model achieved 90% accuracy and faster\nevaluation times than human raters. This approach demonstrates the potential of\nmachine learning in advancing artistic creativity assessment, offering a more\nefficient alternative to traditional methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Q1KGl9qB9Sle_vQ3ysQQ-pKfxMeIdWGXEizqIuKvqnY","pdfSize":"973216","txDigest":"6m6NjPwVnVeo5h7cKJecL1bF8J5KRbirgs2Jqenfb1JW","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
