Detailed simulations show that it is highly\nthermodynamically efficient while functioning as a Maxwell demon -- converting\nheat to work. The physically-calibrated design is targeted to direct\nexperimental exploration. However, variations in Josephson junction fabrication\nintroduce asymmetries that result in energy inefficiency and low operational\nfidelity. We provide a design solution that mitigates these practical\nchallenges. The resulting platform is ideally suited to probe the thermodynamic\nfoundations of information processing devices far from equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
