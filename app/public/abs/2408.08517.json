The electric field along compact\ndirections is equivalent to time-dependent homogeneous configuration of Wilson\nline moduli, which would be relevant to physics in the early universe. In\nparticular, we consider models with and without background magnetic fluxes,\nwhich lead to completely different effects of the electric field due to the\ndifference in the Kaluza-Klein (KK) level structure. We show that, in the case\nwithout magnetic fluxes, the deceleration of KK momenta may cause\nnon-perturbative KK particle production dubbed as the KK Schwinger effect,\nwhereas in the case with magnetic flux such KK particle production does not\ntake place but flavor structure of low energy effective theory may be affected.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0lOC2n1fV4fLP2cIbi2-4r9ehkXPOMHdu32xhWARCzw","pdfSize":"1231406"}
