It is\na code implementation of the Algorithm 4 (MMJ distance by Calculation and Copy)\nin a previous paper. The distance matrix is also called the all points path\ndistance (APPD). We conducted experiments to test the implementation and\nalgorithm, compared it with several other algorithms for solving the APPD\nmatrix. Result shows Algorithm 4 works good for solving the widest path or\nminimax path APPD matrix. It can drastically improve the efficiency for\ncomputing the APPD matrix. There are several theoretical outcomes which claim\nthe APPD matrix can be solved accurately in $ O(n^2) $ . However, they are\nimpractical because there is no code implementation of these algorithms. It\nseems Algorithm 4 is the first algorithm that has an actual code implementation\nfor solving the APPD matrix of minimax path or widest path problem in $ O(n^2)\n$, in an undirected dense graph.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
