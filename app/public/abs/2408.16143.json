This characterization covers graphs having\nat least $k-1$ vertices with degree not divisible by $k$. In addition, we\ninvestigate almost equitable factorizations in arbitrary edge-connected graphs.\n  Next, we establish a simpler criterion for the existence of factorizations\n$G_1,\\ldots, G_k$ satisfying $d_{G_i}(v)\\ge \\lfloor d_G(v)/k\\rfloor$ for all\nvertices $v$ (reps. $d_{G_i}(v)\\le \\lceil d_G(v)/k\\rceil$). As an application,\nwe come up with a criterion to determine whether a highly edge-connected graph\nwith $\\delta(G)\\ge \\delta_1+\\cdots+ \\delta_m$ (resp. $\\Delta(G)\\le\n\\Delta_1+\\cdots+ \\Delta_m$) can be edge-decomposed into factors $G_1,\\ldots,\nG_m$ satisfying $\\delta(G_i)\\ge \\delta_i$ (resp. $\\Delta(G_i)\\le \\Delta_i$) for\nall $i$ with $1\\le i \\le m$, provided that $\\delta_1+\\cdots+ \\delta_m$ is\ndivisible by an odd number $p$ and $\\delta_i\\ge p-1\\ge 2$ (resp.\n$\\Delta_1+\\cdots+ \\Delta_m$ is divisible by $p$ and $\\Delta_i\\ge p-1\\ge 2$).\n  For graphs of even order, we replace an odd-edge-connectivity condition. In\nparticular, for the special case $m=2$, we refine the needed\nodd-edge-connectivity further by giving a sufficient odd-edge-connectivity\ncondition for a graph $G$ to have a partial parity factor $F$ such that for\neach vertex $v$ with a given parity constraint, $| d_{F}(v)-\\varepsilon\nd_G(v)|< 2$, and for all other vertices $v$, $| d_{F}(v)-\\varepsilon d_G(v)|\\le\n1$, where $\\varepsilon $ is a real number and $0< \\varepsilon < 1$. Finally we\nintroduce another application on the existence of almost even factorizations of\nodd-edge-connected graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
