We show that the dispersion of composite fermions\n(CFs) is a deterministic factor driving the distinction. We find that CFs with\ntwo quantized vortices in the 1LL have a non-quasiconvex dispersion.\nConsequently, in the filling fraction $7/3$, CFs occupy the second\n$\\Lambda$-level instead of the first. The corresponding ground state wave\nfunction, based on the CF wave function ansatz, is identified to be the\nfermionic Haffnian wave function rather than the Laughlin wave function. The\nconclusion is supported by numerical evidence from exact diagonalizations in\nboth disk and spherical geometries. Furthermore, we show that the dispersion\nbecomes quasiconvex in wide quantum wells or for CFs with four quantized\nvortices in the filling fraction $11/5$, coinciding with observations that the\ndistinction between the Landau levels disappears under these circumstances.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
