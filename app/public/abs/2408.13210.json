We determine the effect of\nstable stratification on the tearing instability under the Boussinesq\napproximation. Our results generalise previous work that considered only\nspecific parameter regimes, and we show that the length scale of the fastest\ngrowing mode depends non-monotonically on the stratification strength. We\nconfirm our analytical results by solving the linearised equations numerically,\nand we discuss whether the instability could operate in the solar tachocline.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
