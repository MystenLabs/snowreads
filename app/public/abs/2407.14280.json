Some recent methods exploit multiple\nlatent representations and their connection, making this research question even\nmore entangled. Our goal is to understand how operations in the latent space\naffect the underlying concepts. To that end, we explore the task of concept\nblending through diffusion models. Diffusion models are based on a connection\nbetween a latent representation of textual prompts and a latent space that\nenables image reconstruction and generation. This task allows us to try\ndifferent text-based combination strategies, and evaluate easily through a\nvisual analysis. Our conclusion is that concept blending through space\nmanipulation is possible, although the best strategy depends on the context of\nthe blend.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oZM5nFvS2SLlKbkgcnicqQ45x34ErelEhi9ypk3Up_k","pdfSize":"2875571"}
