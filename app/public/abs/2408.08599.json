Events with energetic photon-jet\npairs are selected, where the photon and jet are approximately back-to-back in\nazimuth. The angular correlation between jets and charged-particle tracks with\ntransverse momentum ($p_\\text{T}$) in the range 0.5-2.0 GeV in the hemisphere\nopposite to the jet, $|\\Delta\\phi\\text{(jet,track)}|>\\pi/2$, is measured as a\nfunction of their relative pseudorapidity difference,\n$|\\Delta\\eta\\text{(jet,track)}|$. In central Pb+Pb collisions, these\ncorrelations are predicted to be sensitive to the diffusion wake in the\nquark-gluon plasma resulting from the lost energy of high-$p_\\text{T}$ partons\ntraversing the plasma, with a characteristic modification as a function of\n$|\\Delta\\eta\\text{(jet,track)}|$. The correlations are examined with different\nselections on the jet-to-photon $p_\\text{T}$ ratio to select events with\ndifferent degrees of energy loss. No diffusion wake signal is observed within\nthe current sensitivity and upper limits at 95% confidence level on the\ndiffusion wake amplitude are reported.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VNSzMyhoHcZ75lmfqCWgneExLBaWnez1cwuhzwgimdk","pdfSize":"1530582"}
