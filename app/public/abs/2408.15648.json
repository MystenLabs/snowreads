Our main result establishes that the set of rational maps\nwith minimal resultant has positive density. Additionally, for degree 2\nrational maps, we perform explicit computations demonstrating that over\n$32.7\\%$ possess a squarefree, and hence minimal, resultant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
