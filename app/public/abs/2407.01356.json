Often, the input is time-evolving, shifting the\ngoal to tracking the evolution of underlying patterns instead. To adapt to this\nmore complex setting, existing methods incorporate temporal regularization but\nthey either have overly constrained structural requirements or lack uniqueness\nwhich is crucial for interpretation. In this paper, in order to capture the\nunderlying evolving patterns, we introduce t(emporal)PARAFAC2 which utilizes\ntemporal smoothness regularization on the evolving factors. We propose an\nalgorithmic framework that employs Alternating Optimization (AO) and the\nAlternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) to fit the model.\nFurthermore, we extend the algorithmic framework to the case of partially\nobserved data. Our numerical experiments on both simulated and real datasets\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the temporal smoothness regularization, in\nparticular, in the case of data with missing entries. We also provide an\nextensive comparison of different approaches for handling missing data within\nthe proposed framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
