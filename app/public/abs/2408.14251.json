A prominent class of bosonic\ncodes are Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) codes of which implementations have\nbeen demonstrated with trapped ions and microwave cavities. In this work, we\ninvestigate theoretically the preparation and error correction of a GKP qubit\nin a vibrational mode of a neutral atom stored in an optical dipole trap. This\nplatform has recently shown remarkable progress in simultaneously controlling\nthe motional and electronic degrees of freedom of trapped atoms. The protocols\nwe develop make use of motional states and, additionally, internal electronic\nstates of the trapped atom to serve as an ancilla qubit. We compare optical\ntweezer arrays and optical lattices and find that the latter provide more\nflexible control over the confinement in the out-of-plane direction, which can\nbe utilized to optimize the conditions for the implementation of GKP codes.\nConcretely, the different frequency scales that the harmonic oscillators in the\naxial and radial lattice directions exhibit and a small oscillator\nanharmonicity prove to be beneficial for robust encodings of GKP states.\nFinally, we underpin the experimental feasibility of the proposed protocols by\nnumerically simulating the preparation of GKP qubits in optical lattices with\nrealistic parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
