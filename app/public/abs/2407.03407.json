We show that this\ncoupling bears important consequences even in a nearly flat background, through\nits signature in thermal fluctuations. Starting from the Ginzburg-Landau free\nenergy of a chiral superfluid minimally coupled to the background geometry, we\nshow that the interaction strength between vortices gets renormalized by\ngeometry fluctuations. In our setup, these arise from the shape fluctuations of\nthe underlying two-dimensional substrate, and are controlled by its bending\nrigidity and tension. In the tensionless limit, the fluctuations lower the\nvortex interaction strength at large distances, which leads to a lowering of\nthe BKT transition temperature. We study this effect in terms of the\nrenormalization group flow of a dual sine-Gordon theory of the superfluid\ntransition coupled to the substrate shape. It shows that, in turn, the chiral\nsuperfluid order can suppress the amplitude of shape fluctuations, resulting in\nan extended phase diagram which links the superfluid transition to the\ncrumpling transition of the substrate. These reveal thermodynamic signatures of\nchirality in the superfluid transition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
