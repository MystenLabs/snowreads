We introduce the\nnotion of a maximal UHF subalgebra and use it to obtain the C*-algebraic alonog\nof this result. We say a UHF subalgebra $B$ of a unital C*-algebra $A$ is a\nmaximal UHF subalgebra if it contains the unit of $A$ any other such\nC*-subalgebra embeds unitaly into $B$. We prove that if $K_0(A)$ is\nunperforated and has a certain $K_0$-lifting property, then $B$ exists and is\nunique up to isomorphism, in particular, all simple separable unital\nC*-algebras with tracial rank zero and all unital Kirchberg algebras whose\n$K_0$-groups are unperforated, have a maximal UHF subalgebra. Not every unital\nC*-algebra has a maximal UHF subalgebra, for instance, the unital universal\nfree product $\\mathrm{M}_2 \\ast_{r} \\mathrm{M}_3$. As an application, we give a\nC*-algebraic realization of the rational subgroup $\\mathbb{Q}(G,u)$ of any\ndimension group $G$ with order unit $u$, that is, there is a simple unital AF\nalgebra (and a unital Kirchberg algebra) $A$ with a maximal UHF subalgebra $B$\nsuch that $(G,u)\\cong (K_0(A), [1]_0)$ and and $\\mathbb{Q}(G,u)\\cong K_0(B)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
