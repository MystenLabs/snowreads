We do this by\nanalyzing special relativity as it was originally formulated. Then, we examine\nthe relationship of the theory with the result of the Michelson and Morley\nexperiment. We point out that in diverse a historical context the same\nexperiment can be thought of as providing different conceptualizations of\nphenomena. This demonstrates why special relativity prevailed over its rival\ntheories. This theory made a new reinterpretation of the experiment by\nassociating it with a novel phenomenon, namely, the invariance of the speed of\nlight, a phenomenon that was not the one originally investigated. This leads us\nto an understanding of how this experiment could have been interpreted in a\ncompletely different historical context.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
