The artifact is a product of two 1D responses,\noverwhelming the desired 2D response. We confirm that by analyzing the 2D\nRaman-THz response of a x-cut beta barium borate (BBO) crystal. We furthermore\nshow that this artifact can be effectively suppressed by implementing a special\ndetection scheme. We successfully isolate the desired third-order 2D Raman-THz\nresponse, revealing a distinct cross-peak feature, whose frequency position\nsuggests the coupling between two crystal phonons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
