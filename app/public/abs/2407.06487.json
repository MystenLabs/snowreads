Here, we report SOTs generated by magnetron-sputtered 1T'\nMoTe2/Permalloy (Py; Ni80Fe20)/MgO heterostructures using both spin-torque\nferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and second harmonic Hall measurements. We\nobserved unconventional FL and DL torques in our samples due to spins polarized\nnormal to the interface of MoTe2 and Py layers, and studied the influence of\ncrystallographic order and MoTe2 layer thickness on the SOTs. By comparing the\nRaman spectra of 1T' MoTe2 samples prepared in different ways, we found a\ntensile strain in sputtered MoTe2 films, which might further enhance the\ngeneration of unconventional torques by reducing the symmetry of 1T' MoTe2.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
