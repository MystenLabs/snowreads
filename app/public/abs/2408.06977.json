Identification without external\ninstruments is achieved under one of two assumptions: either the endogenous\nregressor is a nonlinear function of one component of the error term,\nconditional on the exogenous regressors, or the dependence between the\nendogenous and exogenous regressors is nonlinear. Under these conditions, we\nprove consistency and asymptotic normality. Monte Carlo simulations and an\napplication on German insolvency data illustrate the usefulness of the method.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"WGeKDwvd9_A2kI0LCY-Y5yhL-j0Skq2wDFYjC84mrpo","pdfSize":"275532"}
