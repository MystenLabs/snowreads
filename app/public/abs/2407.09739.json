Our aim is to efficiently learn the importance\nof different input variables, e.g., in vehicle safety experimentation, we study\nthe impact of the thickness of various components on safety objectives. Since\nfunction evaluations are expensive, we use active learning to prioritize\nexperimental resources where they yield the most value. We propose novel active\nlearning acquisition functions that directly target key quantities of\nderivative-based global sensitivity measures (DGSMs) under Gaussian process\nsurrogate models. We showcase the first application of active learning directly\nto DGSMs, and develop tractable uncertainty reduction and information gain\nacquisition functions for these measures. Through comprehensive evaluation on\nsynthetic and real-world problems, our study demonstrates how these active\nlearning acquisition strategies substantially enhance the sample efficiency of\nDGSM estimation, particularly with limited evaluation budgets. Our work paves\nthe way for more efficient and accurate sensitivity analysis in various\nscientific and engineering applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
