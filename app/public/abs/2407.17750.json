Additionally, we establish bounds for\nthe self-intersection number in terms of the word length. We also prove that\nthe spectrum of self-intersection numbers of 2-low-lying arcs covers all\nnatural numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
