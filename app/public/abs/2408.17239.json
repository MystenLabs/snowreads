Many of these tests were singleplex, and only tested for the\npresence of a single pathogen. Multiplex tests can test for the presence of\nseveral pathogens using only a single swab, which can allow for: surveillance\nof more pathogens, targeting of antiviral interventions, a reduced burden of\ntesting, and lower costs. Test sensitivity however, particularly in LFD tests,\nis highly conditional on the viral concentration dynamics of individuals. To\ninform the use of multiplex testing in outbreak detection it is therefore\nnecessary to investigate the interactions between outbreak detection strategies\nand the differing viral concentration trajectories of key pathogens. Viral\nconcentration trajectories are estimated for SARS-CoV-2, and Influenza A/B.\nTesting strategies for the first five symptomatic cases in an outbreak are then\nsimulated and used to evaluate key performance indicators. Strategies that use\na combination of multiplex LFD and PCR tests achieve; high levels of detection,\ndetect outbreaks rapidly, and have the lowest burden of testing across multiple\npathogens. Influenza B was estimated to have lower rates of detection due to\nits modelled viral concentration dynamics.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
