Leveraging a custom radio-over-fiber (RFoF) system\ncharacterized via classical spectral interference, we validate its\neffectiveness for quantum networking by multiplexing the RFoF clock with one\nphoton from a frequency-bin-entangled pair and distributing the coexisting\nquantum-classical signals over fiber. Phase modulation of the two photons\nreveals nonlocal correlations in excellent agreement with theory: in-phase\nmodulation produces additional sidebands in the joint spectral intensity, while\nout-of-phase modulation is nonlocally canceled. Our simple, feedback-free\ndesign attains sub-picosecond synchronization -- namely, drift less than\n$\\sim$0.5 ps in a 5.5 km fiber over 30 min (fractionally only\n$\\sim$2$\\times$10$^{-8}$ of the total fiber delay) -- and should facilitate\nfrequency-encoded quantum networking protocols such as high-dimensional quantum\nkey distribution and entanglement swapping, unlocking frequency-bin qubits for\npractical quantum communications in deployed metropolitan-scale networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
