Einstein's theory of\nGeneral Relativity famously predicted that the effect is twice the Newtonian\nvalue, a prediction that was verified during the 1919 solar eclipse. Recent\ntheories of vector gravity can be interpreted to imply that gravity will have a\ndifferent effect on pulsed light versus continuous-wave (CW) light propagating\nbetween the two mirrors of an optical cavity. Interestingly, we are not aware\nof any previous experiments to determine the relative effect of gravity on the\npropagation of pulsed versus CW light. In order to observe if there are small\ndifferences, we use a 6 GHz electro-optic frequency comb and low-noise CW laser\nto make careful measurements of the resonance frequencies of a high-finesse\noptical cavity. Once correcting for the effects of mirror dispersion, we\ndetermine that the cavity resonance frequencies for pulsed and CW light are the\nsame to within our experimental error, which is on the order of $10^{-12}$ of\nthe optical frequency, and one part in 700 of the expected gravitational shift.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
