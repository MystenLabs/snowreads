However, as the wireless spectrum is\nbecoming more and more crowded, it is very difficult to achieve efficient\nantijamming results with FH-based schemes. Orbital angular momentum (OAM),\nwhich provides the new angular/mode dimension for wireless communications,\noffers an intriguing way for antijamming. In this paper, we propose to use the\northogonality of OAM-modes for antijamming in wireless communications. In\nparticular, we propose the mode hopping (MH) scheme for antijamming within the\nnarrow frequency band. We derive the closed-form expression of bit error rate\n(BER) for multiple users scenario with our developed MH scheme. Our developed\nMH scheme can achieve the same antijamming results within the narrow frequency\nband as compared with the conventional wideband FH scheme. Furthermore, we\npropose mode-frequency hopping (MFH) scheme, which jointly uses our developed\nMH scheme and the conventional FH scheme to further decrease the BER for\nwireless communication. Numerical results are presented to show that the BER of\nour developed MH scheme within the narrow frequency band is the same with that\nof the conventional wideband FH scheme. Moreover, the BER of our developed MFH\nschemes is much smaller than that of the conventional FH schemes for wireless\ncommunications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
