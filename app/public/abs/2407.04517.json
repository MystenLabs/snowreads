For $1\\leq i \\leq n$, let $P_i$ be the poset obtained from $P$ by\nreplacing $S$ by an antichain of size $i$. We show that the $h$-polynomial of\n$\\mathscr{A}(P)$ can be written in terms of the $h$-polynomials of\n$\\mathscr{A}(P_i)$ and type B Narayana polynomials. We then use the identity to\ndeduce several identities involving Narayana polynomials, Eulerian polynomials,\nand stack-sorting preimages.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
