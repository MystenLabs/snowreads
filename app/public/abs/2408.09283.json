The vectors are composed of levels that split a\nformula into equal-sized regions of one or more types (e.g., rectangles or\nellipses). For each region type, this produces a pyramid of overlapping\nregions, where the first level contains the entire formula, and the final level\nthe finest-grained regions. In this work, we introduce concentric rectangles\nfor regions, and analyze whether subsequent PHOC levels encode redundant\ninformation by omitting levels from PHOC configurations. As a baseline, we\ninclude a bag of words PHOC containing only the first whole-formula level.\nFinally, using the ARQMath-3 formula retrieval benchmark, we demonstrate that\nsome levels encoded in the original PHOC configurations are redundant, that\nPHOC models with rectangular regions outperform earlier PHOC models, and that\ndespite their simplicity, PHOC models are surprisingly competitive with the\nstate-of-the-art. PHOC is not math-specific, and might be used for chemical\ndiagrams, charts, or other graphics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
