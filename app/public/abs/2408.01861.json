The proposed approach employs the\npredictive covariance matrix for selection of data batches to exploit full\ncorrelation of samples. We theoretically analyse our proposed algorithm taking\ndifferent optimality criteria into consideration and provide empirical\ncomparisons highlighting the advantage of incorporating derivatives\ninformation. Our results show the effectiveness of our approach across diverse\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"aHbZArPED6u0UmZfwqOMVrnClWH-4qtoSBcCFppEmcU","pdfSize":"1853028"}
