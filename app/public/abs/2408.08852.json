These efforts have established\nfoundational models in this field. However, the effective utilization of these\nspatial representations for urban forecasting applications remains\nunder-explored. To address this gap, we introduce GeoTransformer, a novel\nstructure that synergizes the Transformer architecture with geospatial\nstatistics prior. GeoTransformer employs an innovative geospatial attention\nmechanism to incorporate extensive urban information and spatial dependencies\ninto a unified predictive model. Specifically, we compute geospatial weighted\nattention scores between the target region and surrounding regions and leverage\nthe integrated urban information for predictions. Extensive experiments on GDP\nand ride-share demand prediction tasks demonstrate that GeoTransformer\nsignificantly outperforms existing baseline models, showcasing its potential to\nenhance urban forecasting tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o13abHDuVymsJeFe3xUknyw0COrHMVOLuoLS6wvOwcQ","pdfSize":"3019001"}
