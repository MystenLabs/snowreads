The Artemis Accords, a series of international agreements, have\nfurther catalyzed this progress by fostering cooperation in space exploration,\nemphasizing the use of cutting-edge technologies. In parallel, the widespread\nadoption of the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2) by companies across various\nsectors underscores its robustness and versatility. This paper evaluates the\nperformances of available ROS 2 MiddleWare (RMW), such as FastRTPS, CycloneDDS\nand Zenoh, over a mesh network with a dynamic topology. The final choice of RMW\nis determined by the one that would fit the most the scenario: an exploration\nof the extreme extra-terrestrial environment using a MRS. The conducted study\nin a real environment highlights Zenoh as a potential solution for future\napplications, showing a reduced delay, reachability, and CPU usage while being\ncompetitive on data overhead and RAM usage over a dynamic mesh topology\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8VzlzYOs5WYWSHwmC-I4uWYtQaifofEoj_hXThplgdI","pdfSize":"4830551"}
