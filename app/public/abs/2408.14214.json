Our approach draws on detailed historical data to model the\ndynamics of the market participants, producing results that are entirely\ndata-driven and free of bias. While traditional time series forecasting methods\noften struggle to account for nonlinear regime changes in growth, our approach\nsuccessfully captures the onset of buildout as well as external economic\nshocks, such as the 1990 and 2008-2011 recessions and the 2021 post-pandemic\nboom.\n  This research serves as a valuable tool for urban planners, homeowner\nassociations, and property stakeholders aiming to navigate the complexities of\ngrowth at master-planned communities during periods of both system stability\nand instability.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nA0wn0tvLmoXKqHM01xIgw3Z2mjDu5kIaW9XARWK5EE","pdfSize":"905766"}
