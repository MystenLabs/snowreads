The [O I] 63 $\\mu$m line\nluminosity is $(4.5\\pm1.5) \\times 10^{9}~L_{\\rm \\odot}$, corresponding to the\n[O I] 63 $\\mu$m-to-far-infrared luminosity ratio of $\\approx 6.7\\times10^{-4}$,\nwhich is consistent with the value obtained in the local universe. Remarkably,\n[O I] 63 $\\mu$m is as bright as [C II] 158 $\\mu$m, resulting in the [O I]-to-[C\nII] line luminosity ratio of $1.3\\pm0.5$. Based on a careful comparison of the\nluminosity ratios of [O I] 63 $\\mu$m, [C II] 158 $\\mu$m, and dust continuum\nemission to models of photo-dissociation regions, we find that J2054-0005 has a\ngas density log($n_{\\rm H}$/cm$^{-3}$)$=3.7\\pm0.3$ and an incident\nfar-ultraviolet radiation field of log($G/G_{\\rm 0}$)$= 3.0\\pm0.1$, showing\nthat [O I] 63 $\\mu$m serves as an important coolant of the dense and warm gas\nin J2054-0005. A close examination of the [O I] and [C II] line profiles\nsuggests that the [O I] line may be partially self-absorbed, however deeper\nobservations are needed to verify this conclusion. Regardless, the gas density\nand incident radiation field are in a broad agreement with the values obtained\nin nearby star-forming galaxies and objects with [O I] 63 $\\mu$m observations\nat $z=1-3$ with the Herschel Space Observatory. These results demonstrate the\npower of ALMA high-frequency observations targeting [O I] 63 $\\mu$m to examine\nthe properties of photo-dissociation regions in high-redshift galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"n4R5s4oEkmTchknZNECNEvmwJ7-OMlRoGdKxbezp1Dw","pdfSize":"1081687"}
