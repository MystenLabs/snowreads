We analytically determine the phase boundary, and characterize the\nlocalization of normal modes using their inverse participation ratio. We\ncompute energy-dependent mobility edges and provide evidence for the emergence\nof a topological Anderson insulator within specific parameter ranges. Whereas\nthe phase transition boundary is affected by the quasi-periodic modulation, the\ntopologically insulating Anderson phase is stable with respect to the chiral\ndisorder in a quasi-periodic setup. Additionally, our results also uncover a\nre-entrant topological phase transition from non-trivial to trivial phases for\ncertain values of quasi-periodic modulation with fixed chiral disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t3RFj2omOsFfw3EM9cB1xXguWxy_9B42GZBtLBtO6OA","pdfSize":"4015233"}
