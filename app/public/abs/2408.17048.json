This method transforms a\nproduct state in a multi-qubit system into an entangled state with high\nfidelity and robustness. By employing global and continuous driving laser\nfields, we demonstrate the generation of two-qubit Bell state and three-qubit W\nstate, via sequential RAP pulses within the Rydberg blockade regime. As an\nillustrative example, applying this technique to alkali atoms, we predict\nfidelities exceeding 0.9995 for two-qubit Bell and three-qubit W state, along\nwith excellent robustness. Furthermore, our scheme can be extended to generate\nentanglement between weakly coupled atoms and to create four-qubit Greenberger-\nHorne-Zeilinger states through spatial correlations. Our approach holds the\npotential for extension to larger atomic arrays, offering a straightforward and\nefficient method to generate high-fidelity entangled states in neutral atom\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Io0HU6oNDyNVTI_R6WsCaZ6EMU72CgMeBmgq0qKN1-s","pdfSize":"2088502"}
