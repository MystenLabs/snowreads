While the giant\ngraviton indices may be written as suitable contour integrals, care must be\ntaken in their evaluation, as there can be an ambiguity in choice of\nintegration contour or, equivalently, \"pole selection\". We resolve this\nambiguity by using Murthy's recent expansion of the superconformal index to\nprovide a rigorous underpinning of the evaluation of the supergravity giant\ngraviton indices. In doing so, we directly relate Murthy's giant graviton\nexpansion to the supergravity D3-brane expansion.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
