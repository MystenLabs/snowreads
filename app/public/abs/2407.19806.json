Using\nStein's method in conjunction with Malliavin's calculus and the Poisson\nembedding representation, our result applies to a variety of point processes\nincluding discrete and continuous Hawkes processes. In particular, we establish\nan explicit convergence rate for stable continuous non-linear Hawkes processes\nand for discrete Hawkes processes. Finally, we obtain an upper bound in the\ncontext of nearly unstable Hawkes processes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
