Making a user-specific summary is a challenging task as it\nrequires: i) acquiring relevant information about a user; ii) aggregating and\nintegrating the information into a user-model; and iii) utilizing the provided\ninformation in making the personalized summary. Therefore, in this paper, we\npropose a solution to a substantial and challenging problem in summarization,\ni.e., recommending a summary for a specific user. The proposed approach, called\nSumRecom, brings the human into the loop and focuses on three aspects:\npersonalization, interaction, and learning user's interest without the need for\nreference summaries. SumRecom has two steps: i) The user preference extractor\nto capture users' inclination in choosing essential concepts, and ii) The\nsummarizer to discover the user's best-fitted summary based on the given\nfeedback. Various automatic and human evaluations on the benchmark dataset\ndemonstrate the supremacy SumRecom in generating user-specific summaries.\nDocument summarization and Interactive summarization and Personalized\nsummarization and Reinforcement learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ebCM6C1tCWI4oKPNYdGslFYKBzxZY_p7LR7NNtrgR3o","pdfSize":"1337765"}
