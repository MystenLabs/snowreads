It is found that N/Z and mass equilibration take place at different\ncollision stages. The N/Z relaxation is observed in the approaching phase (from\nfirst contact to deepest contact) with a very short time, whereas interestingly\nwe find for the first time that mass equilibration only takes place in the\nseparation phase (from the deepest contact to re-separation), which are\nexplained by investigating the dynamical asymmetry between the approaching and\nseparation phases. The mass equilibration also could be clarified with a\ndynamical potential energy surface. Our results provide a new insight into the\nequilibration dynamics of the quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
