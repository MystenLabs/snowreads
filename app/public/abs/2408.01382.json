This requires a scalar prediction as in\nbinary classification, whereas a multiclass probabilistic prediction is a\ndiscrete probability distribution, living on a multidimensional simplex. In\nsuch a multiclass setting the Shapley values are typically computed separately\non each class in a one-vs-rest manner, ignoring the compositional nature of the\noutput distribution. In this paper, we introduce Shapley compositions as a\nwell-founded way to properly explain a multiclass probabilistic prediction,\nusing the Aitchison geometry from compositional data analysis. We prove that\nthe Shapley composition is the unique quantity satisfying linearity, symmetry\nand efficiency on the Aitchison simplex, extending the corresponding axiomatic\nproperties of the standard Shapley value. We demonstrate this proper multiclass\ntreatment in a range of scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W0ez-coSSqylwrDcPlO4umhowXko6Pj-BiGB1Vmurn4","pdfSize":"861108"}
