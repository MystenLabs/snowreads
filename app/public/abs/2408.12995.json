These include (1) sensitivity, (2) block sensitivity, (3) witness\ncomplexity, (4) subcube partition complexity and (5) algorithmic complexity.\nEach of these is concerned with \"worst-case\" inputs. It has been shown that\nthere is \"asymptotic separation\" between these complexity measures and very\nrecently, due to the work of Huang, it has been established that they are all\n\"polynomially related\". In this paper, we study the notion of distributional\ncomplexity where the input bits are independent and one considers all of the\nabove notions in expectation. We obtain a number of results concerning\ndistributional complexity measures, among others addressing the above concepts\nof \"asymptotic separation\" and being \"polynomially related\" in this context. We\nintroduce a new distributional complexity measure, local witness complexity,\nwhich only makes sense in the distributional context and we also study a new\nversion of algorithmic complexity which involves partial information. Many\ninteresting examples are presented including some related to percolation. The\nlatter connects a number of the recent developments in percolation theory over\nthe last two decades with the study of complexity measures in theoretical\ncomputer science.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
