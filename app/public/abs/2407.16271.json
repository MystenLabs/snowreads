The structure with a hybrid\ndielectric-semiconductor top mirror has a significantly higher calculated\nquality-factor (~65000 for 5 $\\mu$m pillar) due to better vertical mode\nconfinement. The minimum laser threshold (~370 $\\mu$W for 5 $\\mu$m pillar)\ncoincided with a temperature of 130 K, which is close to zero gain to cavity\ndetuning. Lasing up to 220 K was demonstrated with a laser threshold of about\n2.2 mW.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zxCNtsv-uXDn5htsbywlr64m1dLKpmkWFoJtBWISBNk","pdfSize":"927960"}
