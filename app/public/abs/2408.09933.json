The system is built with four\nstages: selecting a baseline model, exploring effective data augmentation (DA)\nmethods for fine-tuning, applying a co-enhancement strategy based on gradient\nnorm aware minimization (GAM) for secondary fine-tuning, and fusing logits\nscores from the two best-performing fine-tuned models. The system utilizes the\nWav2Vec2 front-end feature extractor and the AASIST back-end classifier as the\nbaseline model. During model fine-tuning, three distinct DA policies have been\ninvestigated: single-DA, random-DA, and cascade-DA. Moreover, the employed\nGAM-based co-enhancement strategy, designed to fine-tune the augmented model at\nboth data and optimizer levels, helps the Adam optimizer find flatter minima,\nthereby boosting model generalization. Overall, the final fusion system\nachieves a minDCF of 0.115 and an EER of 4.04% on the evaluation set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
