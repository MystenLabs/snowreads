In particular,\nreal-time applications have very strict network requirements. However, building\na network that hosts real-time applications is a cost-intensive endeavor,\nespecially for experimental systems such as testbeds. Systems that provide\nguaranteed real-time networking capabilities usually work with expensive\nsoftware-defined switches. In contrast, real-time networking systems based on\nlow-cost hardware face the limitation of lower link speeds. This paper fills\nthis gap and presents Low-Cost Deterministic Networking (LCDN), a system\ndesigned to work with inexpensive, common off-the-shelf switches and devices.\nLCDN works at Gigabit speed and enables powerful testbeds to host real-time\napplications with strict delay guarantees. This paper also provides an\nevaluation of the determinism of the switch and a Raspberry Pi used as an end\ndevice to demonstrate the applicability of LCDN on inexpensive low-power\nreduced capacity apparatus.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
