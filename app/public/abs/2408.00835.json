We analyze stasis with various\nmachine learning techniques on the full $2N$-dimensional space of decay rates\nand abundances, which serve as inputs to the system of Boltzmann equations that\ngoverns the dynamics. We construct a differentiable Boltzmann solver to\nmaximize the number of stasis $e$-folds $\\mathcal{N}$. High-stasis\nconfigurations obtained by gradient ascent motivate log-uniform distributions\non rates and abundances to accompany power-law distributions of previous works.\nWe demonstrate that random configurations drawn from these families of\ndistributions regularly exhibit many $e$-folds of stasis. We additionally use\nthem as priors in a Bayesian analysis conditioned on stasis, using stochastic\nvariational inference with normalizing flows to model the posterior. All three\nnumerical analyses demonstrate the generality of stasis and point to a new\nmodel in which the rates and abundances are exponential in the species index.\nWe show that the exponential model solves the exact stasis equations, is an\nattractor, and satisfies $\\mathcal{N}\\propto N$, exhibiting inflation-level\n$e$-folding with a relatively low number of species. This is contrasted with\nthe $\\mathcal{N}\\propto \\log(N)$ scaling of power-law models. Finally, we\ndiscuss implications for the emergent string conjecture and string axiverse.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lCDeSWFQkTfoy4YXzGfRdMmt0g_NsyylZaTPI7pz4L0","pdfSize":"7094817"}
