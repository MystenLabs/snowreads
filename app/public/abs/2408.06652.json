However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$\nand, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of\neffective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection.\nFortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues\nabout potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent\nswampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most\nstraightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around\nthe GUT scale, leading to an anthropic abundance of dark matter. We found that\nthis range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent\nconcept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility.\nIf axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their\ndecay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario,\nwhere axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a\nlaser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
