Utilizing computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with an\nin-house Immersed-Boundary Method (IBM) solver, we investigate how different\nwaveform patterns, specifically carangiform and anguilliform, influence the\ndispersion of chemical cues in both water and air environments. Our findings\nreveal that vortex dynamics significantly impact the overall trajectory of odor\nspots, although the alignment between odor spots and coherent flow structures\nis not always precise. We also evaluate the relative contributions of diffusion\nand convection in odor transport, showing that convection dominates in water,\ndriven by higher Schmidt numbers, while diffusion plays a more prominent role\nalongside convection in air. Additionally, the anguilliform waveform generally\nproduces stronger and farther-reaching chemical cues compared to carangiform\nswimmers. The critical roles of Strouhal number and Reynolds number in\ndetermining the efficiency of odor dispersion are also explained, offering\ninsights that could enhance the design of more efficient, adaptive, and\nintelligent autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) by integrating sensory and\nhydrodynamic principles inspired by fish locomotion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
