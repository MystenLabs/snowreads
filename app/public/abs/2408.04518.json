This was done using the\nJOREK code for extended MHD simulations, including the ion diamagnetic drift\nand the establishment of ExB flows. Simulations with single toroidal harmonics\nwere performed for multiple times during the build-up of the pedestal, to\nassess the evolution of the linear stability of modes occurring near the edge.\nWhen changing the average ion masses from 2.0 to 2.5 and 3.0, the variations\nwere small, and MHD's momentum equation was shown to be the major cause for\nthem. As a second step, simulations with multiple toroidal harmonics were\nperformed to simulate an Edge Localized Mode (ELM) crash, again comparing\nbetween the average ion masses of 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0. The resulting variations\nof heat and particle losses were compared to JET results. The experimental\ndifferences between ion masses could not be reproduced. Together with the fact\nthat the simulations' pedestal for an average ion mass of 2.5 and 3.0 was not\nmatched to the experiment, this indicates that other effects, such as\nsmall-scale turbulences, must be included - for example, by adapting the\nsimulations' transport coefficients - to explain the experimental differences.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
