When the attractive interaction kernel is radially symmetric and\nstrictly increasing on its domain it is previously known that all stationary\nsolutions are radially symmetric and decreasing up to a translation; however,\nthis result has not been extended to accommodate attractive kernels that are\nnon-decreasing, for instance, attractive kernels with bounded support. For the\ndiffusion coefficient $m>1$, we show that, for attractive kernels that are\nradially symmetric and non-decreasing, all stationary states are radially\nsymmetric and decreasing up to a translation on each connected subset of their\nsupport. Furthermore, for $m>2$, we prove analytically that stationary states\nhave an upper-bound independent of the initial data, confirming previous\nnumerical results given in the literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
