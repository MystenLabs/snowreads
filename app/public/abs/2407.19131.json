Constructing and classifying measures is a\ndifficult problem, and so far only a handful of cases have been worked out. In\nthis paper, we obtain some of the first general results on measures. Our main\ntheorem states that if $\\mathfrak{F}$ is distal (in the sense of Simon), and\nthere are some bounds on automorphism groups, then $\\mathfrak{F}$ admits only\nfinitely many measures; moreover, we give an effective upper bound on their\nnumber. For example, if $\\mathfrak{F}$ is the class of ``$s$-dimensional\npermutations'' (finite sets equipped with $s$ total orders), we show that the\nnumber of measures is bounded above by approximately $\\exp(\\exp(s^2 \\log{s}))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
