Existing machine learning architectures often struggle to\nrepresent these algorithmic decisions as discrete state transitions. Therefore,\nwe propose a novel framework: GraphFSA (Graph Finite State Automaton). GraphFSA\nis designed to learn a finite state automaton that runs on each node of a given\ngraph. We test GraphFSA on cellular automata problems, showcasing its abilities\nin a straightforward algorithmic setting. For a comprehensive empirical\nevaluation of our framework, we create a diverse range of synthetic problems.\nAs our main application, we then focus on learning more elaborate graph\nalgorithms. Our findings suggest that GraphFSA exhibits strong generalization\nand extrapolation abilities, presenting an alternative approach to represent\nthese algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
