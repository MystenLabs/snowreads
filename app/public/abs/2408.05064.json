This work aims to assess a data harvest network architecture\nwhere users generate data and LEO satellites harvest data from users when\npassing by. By developing a novel stochastic geometry Cox point process model\nthat simultaneously generates orbits and the motion of LEO satellite harvesters\non them, we analyze key performance indices of such a network by deriving the\nfollowing: (i) the average fraction of time that the typical user is served by\nLEO satellite harvesters, (ii) the average amount of data uploaded per each\nsatellite pass, (iii) the maximum harvesting capacity of the proposed network\nmodel, and (iv) the delay distribution in the proposed network. These key\nmetrics are given as functions of key network variables such as $\\lambda$ the\nmean number of orbits and $\\mu$ the mean number of satellites per orbit.\nProviding rich comprehensive analytical results and practical interpretations\nof these results, this work assesses the potential of the delay-tolerant use of\nLEO satellites and also serves as a versatile framework to analyze, design, and\noptimize delay-tolerant LEO satellite networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"f1xstLa_f8k4GNf99T8JfJ7Jtt46j-urjQRzYkYr14A","pdfSize":"2807328"}
