{"id":"2407.14551","title":"The holographic principle comes from finiteness of the universe's\n  geometry","authors":"Arkady Bolotin","authorsParsed":[["Bolotin","Arkady",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 17 Jul 2024 14:49:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-23","timestamp":1721227751000,"abstract":"  Discovered as an apparent pattern, a universal relation between geometry and\ninformation called the holographic principle has yet to be explained. This\nrelation is unfolded in the present paper. As it is demonstrated there, the\norigin of the holographic principle lies in the fact that a geometry of\nphysical space has only a finite number of points. Furthermore, it is shown\nthat the puzzlement of the holographic principle can be explained by a\nmagnification of grid cells used to discretize geometrical magnitudes such as\nareas and volumes into sets of points. To wit, when grid cells of the Planck\nscale are projected from the surface of the observable universe into its\ninterior, they become enlarged. For that reason, the space inside the\nobservable universe is described by the set of points whose cardinality is\nequal to the number of points that constitute the universe's surface.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
