In practice, we usually characterize the magnetization of the GRB\njets ($\\sigma_0$) through the ratio between the Poynting flux and matter\n(baryonic) flux. With the increasing value of $\\sigma_0$, magnetic energy\ngradually takes on a dominant role in the acceleration and energy dissipation\nof the jet, causing the proportion of thermal component in the prompt-emission\nspectrum of GRBs to gradually decrease or even be completely suppressed. In\nthis work, we conducted an extensive analysis of the time-resolved spectrum for\nall \\textit{Fermi} GRBs with known redshift, and we diagnose $\\sigma_0$ for\neach time bin by contrasting the thermal and nonthermal radiation components.\nOur results suggest that most GRB jets should contain a significant magnetic\nenergy component, likely with magnetization factors $\\sigma_{0}\\geq 10$. The\nvalue of $\\sigma_{0}$ seems vary significantly within the same GRB. Future\nstudies with more samples, especially those with lower-energy spectral\ninformation coverage, will further verify our results.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
