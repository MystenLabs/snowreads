Combining Ramsey,\ntime-correlation of single-shot measurements, and CPMG experiments, we cover\nthe qubit noise power spectrum over a frequency range of nine orders of\nmagnitude without any gaps. We find that the low-frequency noise spectrum is\nsimilar across three different devices suggesting that it is dominated by the\nhyperfine coupling to nuclei. The effects of charge noise are smaller, but not\nnegligible, and are device dependent as confirmed from the noise\ncross-correlations. We also observe differences to spectra reported in GaAs\n{[Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 177702 (2017), Phys. Rev. Lett. 101, 236803 (2008)]},\nwhich we attribute to the presence of the valley degree of freedom in silicon.\nFinally, we observe $T_2^*$ to increase upon increasing the external magnetic\nfield, which we speculate is due to the increasing field-gradient of the\nmicromagnet suppressing nuclear spin diffusion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
