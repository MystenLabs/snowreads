One challenge with\npopulation analyses of SNe Ia is Malmquist bias, where we preferentially\nobserve the brighter SNe due to limitations of our telescopes. If untreated,\nthis bias can propagate through to our posteriors on cosmological parameters.\nIn this paper, we develop a novel technique of using a normalising flow to\nlearn the non-analytical likelihood of observing a SN Ia for a given survey\nfrom simulations, that is independent of any cosmological model. The learnt\nlikelihood is then used in a hierarchical Bayesian model with Hamiltonian Monte\nCarlo sampling to put constraints on different sets of cosmological parameters\nconditioned on the observed data. We verify this technique on toy model\nsimulations finding excellent agreement with analytically-derived posteriors to\nwithin $1 \\sigma$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
