An illustrative example is the\nonline sale of flight tickets, where customers navigate through multiple web\npages. Initially, they view the ticket cost, followed by ancillary expenses\nsuch as insurance and additional luggage fees. Coherent pricing policies for\ncomplementary items are essential because optimizing the pricing of each item\nindividually is ineffective. Our scenario also involves a sales constraint,\nwhich specifies a minimum number of items to sell, and uncertainty regarding\ncustomer demand curves. To tackle this problem, we originally formulate it as a\nMarkov Decision Process with constraints. Leveraging online learning tools, we\ndesign a primal-dual online optimization algorithm. We empirically evaluate our\napproach using synthetic settings randomly generated from real-world data,\ncovering various configurations from stationary to non-stationary, and compare\nits performance in terms of constraints violation and regret against well-known\nbaselines optimizing each state singularly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
