Both non-zero-sum and\nzero-sum LQ-SDG problems are studied. It is shown that the zero-sum LQ-SDG\nproblem can be considered a special non-zero-sum LQ-SDG problem. The open-loop\nNash equilibrium point of non-zero-sum (zero-sum, respectively) LQ-SDG problem\nis characterized by the solvability of a system of constrained forward-backward\nstochastic differential equations (FBSDEs, for short) in an infinite horizon\nand the convexity (convexity-concavity, respectively) of the performance\nfunctional and their corresponding closed-loop Nash equilibrium strategy are\ncharacterized by the solvability of a system of constrained coupled algebra\nRiccati equations (CAREs, for short) with certain stabilizing conditions. In\naddition, the closed-loop representation of open-loop Nash equilibrium point\nfor non-zero-sum (zero-sum, respectively) LQ-SDG is provided by the\nnon-symmetric (symmetric, respectively) solution to a system CAREs. At the end\nof this paper, we provide three concrete examples and solve their\nopen-loop/closed-loop Nash equilibrium strategy based on the obtained results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
