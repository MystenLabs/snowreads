As an application, we present\na new condition for the reconstructibility of a graph. In particular, we show\nthat a graph with at least three vertices is reconstructible if there exists a\nvertex-deleted subgraph that is almost controllable and has a nontrivial\nautomorphism.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
