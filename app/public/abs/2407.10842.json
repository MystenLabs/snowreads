The\ncases of smooth and weakly singular kernels are both considered. In the first\noccurrence, the method uses a Gauss-Legendre rule whereas in the second one\nresorts to a product rule based on Legendre nodes. Stability and convergence\nare proved in functional spaces equipped with the uniform norm and several\nnumerical tests are given to show the good performance of the proposed method.\nAn application to the interior Neumann problem for the Laplace equation with\nnonlinear boundary conditions is also considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wel3efq964TXp97-E0_-HeIPMgJzfEz5ExgrXrv17Js","pdfSize":"318300"}
