This\nresult implies a generalization of known Markov chain perturbation bounds for\nthe stationary distribution to the case where the perturbed chain is not\nirreducible. It further yields an improved perturbation bound in 1-norm. As a\nspecial case, Kemeny's constant can be interpreted as the translated bias in an\nMRP with constant reward 1, which offers an intuitive explanation why it is a\nconstant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
