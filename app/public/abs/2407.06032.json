Warm Inflation, producing both thermal and quantum\nfluctuations, yield a complex form of scalar power spectrum, which, in general,\ncannot be directly written as a function of the comoving wavenumber $k$, an\nessential step to incorporate the primordial spectra into CAMB to do an MCMC\nanalysis through CosmoMC/Cobaya. In this paper, we devised an efficient\ngeneralized methodology to mould the WI power spectra as a function of $k$,\nwithout the need of slow-roll approximation of the inflationary dynamics. The\nmethodology is directly applicable to any Warm Inflation model, including the\nones with complex forms of the dissipative coefficient and the inflaton\npotential.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
