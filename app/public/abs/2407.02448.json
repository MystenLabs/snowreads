Many systems and techniques have been developed to\nresolve this classification task. Nevertheless, two of the major challenges\nfaced in this context are the limited performance and the problem of imbalanced\ndata. In this study, we propose a novel approach that leverages ensemble\nlearning and semi-supervised learning based on previously manually labeled. We\nconducted experiments on a benchmark dataset by classifying Arabic tweets into\n5 distinct classes: non-hate, general hate, racial, religious, or sexism.\nExperimental results show that: (1) ensemble learning based on pre-trained\nlanguage models outperforms existing related works; (2) Our proposed data\naugmentation improves the accuracy results of hate speech detection from Arabic\ntweets and outperforms existing related works. Our main contribution is the\nachievement of encouraging results in Arabic hate speech detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QQMtIYuzjovFXRiFLG-r6vwcIFJqf2H8J98r28_JSa8","pdfSize":"407170"}
