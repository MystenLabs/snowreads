Specifically, we investigate the origin of magnetic\nmultipolar interactions in $d^2$ Mott insulators. In addition, we show that an\nadmixture of quadrupolar and octupolar magnetic order simultaneously induces\nelectrical quadrupolar and ferroelectric polarization. Our theoretical\nformalism extends the multiferroic framework to the higher-order sector,\nexploring the possibility of coexisting multipolar orders of the same and\ndifferent ranks. We finally comment on some of the experimental signatures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
