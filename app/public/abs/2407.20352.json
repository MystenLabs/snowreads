{"id":"2407.20352","title":"Designing Time-Series Models With Hypernetworks & Adversarial Portfolios","authors":"Filip Stan\\v{e}k","authorsParsed":[["StanÄ›k","Filip",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2024 18:06:29 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-31","timestamp":1722276389000,"abstract":"  This article describes the methods that achieved 4th and 6th place in the\nforecasting and investment challenges, respectively, of the M6 competition,\nultimately securing the 1st place in the overall duathlon ranking. In the\nforecasting challenge, we tested a novel meta-learning model that utilizes\nhypernetworks to design a parametric model tailored to a specific family of\nforecasting tasks. This approach allowed us to leverage similarities observed\nacross individual forecasting tasks while also acknowledging potential\nheterogeneity in their data generating processes. The model's training can be\ndirectly performed with backpropagation, eliminating the need for reliance on\nhigher-order derivatives and is equivalent to a simultaneous search over the\nspace of parametric functions and their optimal parameter values. The proposed\nmodel's capabilities extend beyond M6, demonstrating superiority over\nstate-of-the-art meta-learning methods in the sinusoidal regression task and\noutperforming conventional parametric models on time-series from the M4\ncompetition. In the investment challenge, we adjusted portfolio weights to\ninduce greater or smaller correlation between our submission and that of other\nparticipants, depending on the current ranking, aiming to maximize the\nprobability of achieving a good rank.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
