We extend this result in two directions by considering\na time-independent version of the L\\'evy-Leblond equation. First, we construct\na $ \\mathbb{Z}_2^3 $-graded colour Lie superalgebra containing operators that\nleave the eigenspaces invariant and demonstrate the utility of this algebra in\nconstructing general solutions for the free equation. Second, we find that the\nladder operators for the harmonic oscillator generate a $\n\\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2 $-graded colour Lie superalgebra and we use the\noperators from this algebra to compute the spectrum. These results illustrate\ntwo points: the L\\'evy-Leblond equation admits colour Lie superalgebras with\ngradings higher than $ \\mathbb{Z}_2\\times\\mathbb{Z}_2 $ and colour Lie\nsuperalgebras appear for potentials besides the free potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
