We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of the\nstructural and superconducting properties of the system using various\ntechniques, including X-ray diffraction (XRD), resistivity, magnetization, and\nspecific heat measurements. Based on our XRD analysis, we found that the spinel\nsuperconductor CuRh2Se4-xTex crystallizes in the space group Fd3m(227) with x\nin the region of 0 to 0.28, while the layered compound CuRh2Se4-xTex\ncrystallizes in the space group P3m1 (164) with x in the region of 2.8 to 4.0.\nThe upper critical magnetic field can be increased from 0.95(2) T for CuRh2Se4\nto 3.44(1) T for CuRh2Se3.72Te0.28 by doping with elemental Te. However, the\nlayered compound CuRh2Se4-xTex did not exhibit superconducting properties.\nBesides, the specific heat measurements of CuRh2Se4-xTex (x = 0, 0.1, 0.28)\nindicate that the Te element doping affects the electronic structure and\ninteractions of the material and breaks the stability of the superconducting\npairing, which leads to a decrease in the Tc. Finally, we show the electronic\nphase diagram of Tc with Te doping to summarise our findings.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
