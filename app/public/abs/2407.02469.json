However, robust predictions of such\ntimescales are only available for certain cases. Inspired by the harmonic\ntheory of Langer, we derive a general activation rate for multi-dimensional\nspin systems. Assuming local thermal equilibrium in the initial minimum and\nderiving an expression for the flow of probability density along the real\nunstable dynamical mode at the saddle point, we obtain the expression for the\nactivation rate that is a function of the Gilbert damping parameter, $\\alpha$.\nWe find that this expression remains valid for the physically relevant regime\nof $\\alpha\\ll1$. When the activation is characterized by a coherent\nreorientation of all spins, we gain insight into the prefactor of the Arrhenius\nlaw by writing it in terms of spin wave frequencies and, for the case of a\nfinite antiferromagnetic spin chain, obtain an expression that depends\nexponentially on the square of the system size indicating a break-down of the\nMeyer-Neldel rule.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
