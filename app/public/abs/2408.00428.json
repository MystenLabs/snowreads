To achieve low\nlatency and high-quality image reconstruction over a bandwidth-constrained\nnoisy wireless channel, we propose a stable diffusion (SD)-based goal-oriented\nsemantic communication (GSC) framework. In this framework, we design a semantic\nautoencoder that effectively extracts semantic information from images to\nreduce the transmission data size while ensuring high-quality reconstruction.\nRecognizing the impact of wireless channel noise on semantic information\ntransmission, we propose an SD-based denoiser for GSC (SD-GSC) conditional on\ninstantaneous channel gain to remove the channel noise from the received noisy\nsemantic information under known channel. For scenarios with unknown channel,\nwe further propose a parallel SD denoiser for GSC (PSD-GSC) to jointly learn\nthe distribution of channel gains and denoise the received semantic\ninformation. Experimental results show that SD-GSC outperforms state-of-the-art\nADJSCC and Latent-Diff DNSC, with the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR)\nimprovement by 7 dB and 5 dB, and the Fr\\'echet Inception Distance (FID)\nreduction by 16 and 20, respectively. Additionally, PSD-GSC archives PSNR\nimprovement of 2 dB and FID reduction of 6 compared to MMSE equalizer-enhanced\nSD-GSC.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
