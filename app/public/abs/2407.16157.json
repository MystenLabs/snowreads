While\nthis review is focused on bulk viscosity in the conditions present in neutron\nstar mergers, I present a history of bulk viscosity research in dense matter,\nfrom its role in damping radial oscillations in neutron stars through its\ncurrent applications in neutron star mergers. The majority of the chapter\nconsists of calculations of the bulk viscosity from Urca processes in generic\nneutron-proton-electron ($npe$) matter, and then in dense matter containing\nmuons ($npe\\mu$ matter) as well. I make several approximations in these\ncalculations to keep the focus on the concepts. More precise calculations exist\nin the literature, to which I refer the reader. One concept I attempt to\nelucidate is the thermodynamic behavior of a fluid element throughout an\noscillation and how that leads to bulk-viscous dissipation. I conclude with a\ndiscussion of the recent research into the role of weak interactions and bulk\nviscosity in neutron star mergers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3dJzKFaVgow7ELvJ-qg5i80vv5OXDYYdCkEfdN5ndBQ","pdfSize":"1621242"}
