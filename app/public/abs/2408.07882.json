Within\ntailored parameter regimes, the system can exhibit three counterintuitive\ntransport phenomena of anomalous thermodiffusion, absolute negative mobility\nand reverse heat transport respectively. These counterintuitive phenomena do\nnot violate the second law of thermodynamics. Moreover, absolute negative\nmobility and reverse heat transport can be identified by a reversible energy\nlevel. These anomalous transports are different from thermoelectric transports\nand provide different perspectives for a more comprehensive understanding of\nthe transport characteristics of quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
