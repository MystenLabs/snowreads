We compare different group ideals in the realm of locally compact\ngroups. In particular, we show that a subset of a locally compact abelian group\nis relatively compact if and only if it is coarsely bounded. Using this result,\nwe prove that an infinite-dimensional Banach space cannot be embedded into any\nproduct of locally compact groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
