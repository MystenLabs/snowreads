Each such parabola contains an\nassociated stairway-like path connecting certain points on it, induced by the\nalternating application of the aforementioned operators. Any two lattice points\nin the plane can be connected by paths along the square grid composed of steps\neither on these stairways or towards taxicab neighbors. This leads to the\nnotion of the parabolic-taxicab distance between two lattice points, obtained\nas the minimum number of steps of this kind needed to reach one point from the\nother.\n  In this paper, we describe patterns generated by points on paths of bounded\nparabolic-taxicab length and provide a complete description of the balls\ncentered at the origin. In particular, we prove an earlier conjecture on the\narea of these balls.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
