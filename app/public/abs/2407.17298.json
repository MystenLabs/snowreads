We\ndevelop a model wherein non-pharmaceutical intervention methods are\nimplemented, but a portion of the population does not comply with them, and\nthis noncompliance affects the spread of the disease. Drawing from social\ncontagion theory, our model allows for the spread of noncompliance parallel to\nthe spread of the disease. The quantities of interest for control are the\nreduction in infection rate among the compliant population, the rate of spread\nof noncompliance, and the rate at which non-compliant individuals become\ncompliant after, e.g., receiving more or better information about the\nunderlying disease. We prove the existence of global-in-time solutions for\nfixed controls and study the regularity properties of the resulting\ncontrol-to-state map. The existence of optimal control is then established in\nan abstract framework for a fairly general class of objective functions.\nNecessary first--order optimality conditions are obtained via a Lagrangian\nbased stationarity system. We conclude with a discussion regarding minimization\nof the size of infected and non-compliant populations and present simulations\nwith various parameters values to demonstrate the behavior of the model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
