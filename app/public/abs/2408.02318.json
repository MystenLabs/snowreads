Overseeing the XDC network is currently the\nXDC Foundation, a non-profit organization established to encourage the growth,\nenhancement, and adoption of the XDC Network through community-driven projects\nsuch as GitHub. This whitepaper discusses the real-time assessment of the XDC\nnetwork's decentralization, scalability, and security aspects as well as the\nNakamoto coefficient estimation that follows, which is a measure of a\ndecentralized system's decentralization nature that quantifies the minimal\nnumber of nodes or entities needed to compromise the system. A high coefficient\ndenotes greater decentralization, while a low number denotes increased\ndisruption risk. The XDC network's real-time computation of the high Nakamoto\ncoefficient demonstrates its highly decentralized character. The article also\naddresses the diversity of consensus and execution clients, the host\ndistribution, the geo-distribution, and some of the outstanding issues and\nbusiness considerations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hAWYaLen7uWAxzJkkGWtTEE2sHVRwelp6tNZbOR6wqw","pdfSize":"493388","txDigest":"6QWRUfvXsxWNpJFApkreWEuXnukWqFodUojsbCeYcWN3","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
