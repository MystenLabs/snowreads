The absence of the Wannier obstructions can further accompany\ntopological boundary states that are detachable from the bulk bands. Here, we\nelucidate a close connection between these detachable topological boundary\nstates and non-Hermitian topology. Identifying topological boundary states as\nnon-Hermitian topology, we demonstrate that intrinsic non-Hermitian topology\nleads to the inevitable spectral flow. By contrast, we show that extrinsic\nnon-Hermitian topology underlies the detachment of topological boundary states\nand clarify anti-Hermitian topology of the detached boundary states. Based on\nthis connection and $K$-theory, we complete the tenfold classification of\nWannier localizability and detachable topological boundary states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
