They are typically thought\neither to be captured asteroids or to have accreted from a debris disk produced\nby a giant impact. Here, we present an alternative scenario wherein fragments\nof a tidally disrupted asteroid are captured and evolve into a collisional\nproto-satellite disk. We simulate the initial disruption and the fragments'\nsubsequent orbital evolution. We find that tens of percent of an unbound\nasteroid's mass can be captured and survive beyond collisional timescales,\nacross a broad range of periapsis distances, speeds, masses, spins, and\norientations in the Sun--Mars frame. Furthermore, more than one percent of the\nasteroid's mass could evolve to circularise in the moons' accretion region. The\nresulting lower mass requirement for the parent body than that for a giant\nimpact could increase the likelihood of this route to forming a proto-satellite\ndisk that, unlike direct capture, could also naturally explain the moons'\norbits. These formation scenarios imply different properties of Mars's moons to\nbe tested by upcoming spacecraft missions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
