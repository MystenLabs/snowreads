This practice can be\nprivacy-invasive. Users can limit ad tracking on Android via the AdID setting;\nfurther, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) gives user an opt-out right\nvia Global Privacy Control (GPC). However, neither of these two privacy\ncontrols have been studied before as to whether they help Android users\nexercise their legally mandated opt-out right. In response, we evaluate how\nmany Android apps are subject to the CCPA opt-out right and find it applicable\nto approximately 70% of apps on the top free app lists of the US Google Play\nStore. Our dynamic analysis of 1,811 apps from these lists shows that neither\nthe AdID setting nor GPC effectively prevents the selling and sharing of\npersonal information in California. For example, when disabling the AdID and\nsending GPC signals to the most common ad tracking domain in our dataset that\nimplements the US Privacy String, only 4% of apps connecting to the domain\nindicate the opt-out status. To mitigate this shortcoming, Android's AdID\nsetting should be evolved towards a universal GPC setting as part of Google's\nPrivacy Sandbox.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
