In view of the structure of the solutions of the Toda\nlattice, we find new balancing configuration using techniques of integrable\nsystems. This allows us to construct new singly periodic minimal surfaces. The\ngenus of these minimal surfaces equals $j(j+1)/2-1$. They are natural\ngeneralization of the Riemann minimal surfaces, which have genus zero.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"PgHLo8xU7jCllhBGSd2oT42dG6UftYc_H1fsb8yTvu4","pdfSize":"284163"}
