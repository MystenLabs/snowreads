Both the specific volume and temperature are proved to be\nbounded from below and above independently of both time and space. Moreover, it\nis shown that the global solution is asymptotically stable as time tends to\ninfinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
