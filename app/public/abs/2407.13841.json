Images or spectrograms,\nprojected into different subspaces, formed by orthogonal bases in pixel,\nFourier or wavelet domains, can be used to solve these tasks remarkably well\nregardless of whether it is the top subspace where data varies the most, some\nintermediate subspace with moderate variability--or the bottom subspace where\ndata varies the least. This phenomenon occurs because different subspaces have\na large degree of redundant information relevant to the task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
