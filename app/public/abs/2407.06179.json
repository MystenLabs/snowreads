This paper\nproposes a potential mechanism for non-uniqueness, illustrated in a natural\ndyadic shell model. We show that, for the Obukhov model with $d>2$, there exist\ninitial data at the critical regularity that give rise to two distinct\nLeray-Hopf solutions. These solutions exhibit an approximately discretely\nself-similar structure, with non-uniqueness resulting from a partial breaking\nof the scaling symmetry. The fundamental observation is that, in a certain\nscenario, the dynamics reduce to a sequence of weakly coupled\nfinite-dimensional systems. Moreover, the predominant nonlinear interactions\nare identical to those arising in convex integration, suggesting the\npossibility of a similar construction in the full PDE setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
