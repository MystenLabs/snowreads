This phenomenon allows us to envision a future where such profound\nexperiences are accessible to diverse spaceflight participants. In this\nposition paper, we advocate for acknowledging how design decisions made at the\ngenesis of commercial spaceflight might impact space travelers of this\nspeculative future. In proposing salutogenesis as an orienting topic, a\npotential design framework, and as a metric for spaceflight participant\nexperience, we offer a call to action for the broader experience design\ncommunity to engage with the design of profound experiences for spaceflight\nparticipants.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
