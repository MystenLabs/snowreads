Despite achieving impressive\nperformance, advanced object detection methods like YOLOv8 still face\nchallenges in handling the complex conditions found at construction sites. To\nsolve these problems, this study presents the Global Stability Optimization\nYOLO (GSO-YOLO) model to address challenges in complex construction sites. The\nmodel integrates the Global Optimization Module (GOM) and Steady Capture Module\n(SCM) to enhance global contextual information capture and detection stability.\nThe innovative AIoU loss function, which combines CIoU and EIoU, improves\ndetection accuracy and efficiency. Experiments on datasets like SODA, MOCS, and\nCIS show that GSO-YOLO outperforms existing methods, achieving SOTA\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
