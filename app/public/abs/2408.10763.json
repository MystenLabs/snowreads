As it highly affects the electricity demand, especially on the\nlocal level, the integrated modeling and simulation of all sectors is a\npromising approach for analyzing design decisions or complex control\nstrategies. This paper analyzes the increase in electricity demand resulting\nfrom sector coupling, mainly due to integrating electric vehicles into urban\nenergy systems. Therefore, we utilize a digital twin of an existing local\nenergy system and extend it with a mobility simulation model to evaluate the\nimpact of electric vehicles on the distribution grid level. Our findings\nindicate a significant rise in annual electricity consumption attributed to\nelectric vehicles, with home charging alone resulting in a 78% increase.\nHowever, we demonstrate that integrating photovoltaic and battery energy\nstorage systems can effectively mitigate this rise.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
