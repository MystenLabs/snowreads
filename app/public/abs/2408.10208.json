In particular, we consider Pad\\'e approximant based rational\napproximation of the exact TBC and a spatially local form of the exact TBC\nobtained under its high-frequency approximation. For the spatial\ndiscretization, we use a Legendre-Galerkin spectral method with a\nboundary-adapted basis to ensure the bandedness of the resulting linear system.\nTemporal discretization is then addressed with two one-step methods, namely,\nthe backward-differentiation formula of order 1 (BDF1) and the trapezoidal rule\n(TR). Finally, several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the methods where we study the stability and convergence\nbehaviour empirically.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"L6xwtRzI8q-rVKOhZQ29Yl-aJ-rrlWoGFyY6XJeUfS8","pdfSize":"1200691"}
