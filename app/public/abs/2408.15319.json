By appropriately\nchoosing the classical weights, we obtain boson representations of various\nknown solvable models, including quantum dimer and vertex models, toric code,\nand certain Levin-Wen string-net models. We also systematically construct\nsolvable models with other interesting ground states, including ``quantum spin\nliquids,'' supersolids, ``Bose-Einstein insulators,'' Bose liquids with ``Bose\nsurfaces'', and Bose-Einstein condensates that permit adiabatic evolution from\na non-interacting limit to a Gutzwiller-projected limit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
