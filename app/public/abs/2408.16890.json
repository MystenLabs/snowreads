This paper supports\nrobotic parts-to-picker operations in warehousing by optimizing\norder-workstation assignments, item-pod assignments and the schedule of order\nfulfillment at workstations. The model maximizes throughput, while managing\nhuman workload at the workstations and congestion in the facility. We solve it\nvia large-scale neighborhood search, with a novel learn-then-optimize approach\nto subproblem generation. The algorithm relies on an offline machine learning\nprocedure to predict objective improvements based on subproblem features, and\nan online optimization model to generate a new subproblem at each iteration. In\ncollaboration with Amazon Robotics, we show that our model and algorithm\ngenerate much stronger solutions for practical problems than state-of-the-art\napproaches. In particular, our solution enhances the utilization of robotic\nfleets by coordinating robotic tasks for human operators to pick multiple items\nat once, and by coordinating robotic routes to avoid congestion in the\nfacility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
