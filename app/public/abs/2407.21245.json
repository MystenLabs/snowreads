A typical approach to address this\nis the addition of compliance mechanisms to hardware to absorb and compensate\nfor some of these errors. However, for fine-grained manipulation tasks, the\nlocation and choice of appropriate compliance mechanisms are critical for\nsuccess. For objects to be inserted in a target site on a flat surface, the\nobject must first be successfully aligned with the opening of the slot, as well\nas correctly oriented along its central axis, before it can be inserted. We\ndeveloped the Four-Axis Adaptive Finger Hand (FAAF hand) that is equipped with\nfingers that can passively adapt in four axes (x, y, z, yaw) enabling it to\nperform insertion tasks including lid fitting in the presence of significant\nlocalization errors. Furthermore, this adaptivity allows the use of simple\ncontrol methods without requiring contact sensors or other devices. Our results\nconfirm the ability of the FAAF hand on challenging insertion tasks of square\nand triangle-shaped pegs (or prisms) and placing of container lids in the\npresence of position errors in all directions and rotational error along the\nobject's central axis, using a simple control scheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
