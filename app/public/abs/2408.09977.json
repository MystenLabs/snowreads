In the present work and specifically for\nspiral galaxy rotation curves, an alternative possibility is explored, in the\nform of an axially symmetric vortex mass distribution of finite extent\nthreading the centre of the galaxy and perpendicular to its disk. Some general\nconsiderations are developed and characteristic properties are identified,\npointing to the potential interest of such an alternative to be studied in\nearnest.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zI653A8JcngqzAAsnx6KMSwkCGgKZSLOYSHkhP1TEdk","pdfSize":"1061520"}
