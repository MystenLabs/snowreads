We propose Propper, which handles flawed\nand probabilistic background knowledge by extending ILP with a combination of\nneurosymbolic inference, a continuous criterion for hypothesis selection (BCE)\nand a relaxation of the hypothesis constrainer (NoisyCombo). For relational\npatterns in noisy images, Propper can learn programs from as few as 8 examples.\nIt outperforms binary ILP and statistical models such as a Graph Neural\nNetwork.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
