We also discuss how the rates and formation sites of planets are\naffected when considering their habitability, and when including possible\nthreatening sources related to star formation and nuclear activity. Overall, we\nconservatively estimate a cumulative number of some $10^{20}$ Earth-like\nplanets and around $10^{18}$ habitable Earths in our past lightcone. Finally,\nwe find that a few $10^{17}$ are older than our own Earth, an occurrence which\nplaces a loose lower limit a few $10^{-18}$ to the odds for a habitable world\nto ever hosting a civilization in the observable Universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
