It is the first dataset designed to benchmark transnational few-shot\ncrop type classification algorithms that supports advancements in algorithmic\ndevelopment and research comparability. It comprises 706 683 multi-class\nlabeled data points across 176 classes, featuring annual time series of\nper-parcel median pixel values from Sentinel-2 L1C data for 2021, along with\ncrop type labels and spatial coordinates. Based on the open-source EuroCrops\ncollection, EuroCropsML is publicly available on Zenodo.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
