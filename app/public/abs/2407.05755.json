We find\nthat planar Feynman integrals in QFT, as well as many related quantities,\nsatisfy an infinite number of positivity conditions: the functions, as well as\nall their signed derivatives, are non-negative in a specified kinematic region.\nSuch functions are known as completely monotonic (CM) in the mathematics\nliterature. A powerful way to certify complete monotonicity is via integral\nrepresentations. We thus show that it applies to non-planar integrals\npossessing a Euclidean region, to cosmological correlators, as well as to\ncertain stringy integrals. Motivated by Positive Geometry, we investigate\npositivity properties in planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory. We\npresent evidence, based on known analytic multi-loop results, that the CM\nproperty extends to several physical quantities in this theory. This includes\nthe (suitably normalized) finite remainder function of the six-particle\nmaximally-helicity violating (MHV) amplitude, four-point scattering amplitudes\non the Coulomb branch, four-point correlation functions, as well as the\nangle-dependent cusp anomalous dimension. Our findings are however not limited\nto supersymmetric theories. It is shown that the CM property holds for the QCD\nand QED cusp anomalous dimensions, to three and four loops, respectively. We\ncomment on open questions, and on possible numerical applications of complete\nmonotonicity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
