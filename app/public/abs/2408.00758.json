Text-book quantum error correction demands that qubits are reset\nafter measurement. However, fast qubit reset has proven challenging to execute\nat high fidelity. Consequently, many cutting-edge quantum error correction\nexperiments are opting for the no-reset approach, where physical reset is not\nperformed. It has recently been postulated that no-reset is functionally\nequivalent to reset procedures, as well as being faster and easier. For memory\nexperiments, we confirm numerically that resetting provides no benefit. On the\nother hand, we identify a remarkable difference during logical operations. We\nfind that unconditionally resetting qubits can reduce the duration of\nfault-tolerant logical operation by up to a factor of two as the number of\nmeasurement errors that can be tolerated is doubled. We support this with\nnumerical simulations. However, our simulations also reveal that the no-reset\nperformance is superior if the reset duration or infidelity exceeds a given\nthreshold. Lastly, we introduce two novel syndrome extraction circuits that can\nreduce the time overhead of no-reset approaches. Our findings provide guidance\non how experimentalists should design future experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
