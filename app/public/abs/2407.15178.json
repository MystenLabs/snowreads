We investigate how this form\nof bulk viscosity may assist in explaining the early universe's behaviour, with\na particular focus on non-singular bounce scenario by studying the various\nenergy conditions and other related cosmological observables and how the model\nparameters affect the evolution of the Universe. We demonstrate that the NEC\nand SEC violation occurs at the bounce point while DEC is satisfied. Finally,\nwe carried out a stability check based on linear order perturbation to the\nHubble parameter. We found that the perturbation vanishes asymptotically at\nlater times, which indicates a stable behaviour of the bounce scenario\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
