{"id":"2408.00732","title":"Concerns for Self-Localization of Ad-Hoc Arrays Using Time Difference of\n  Arrivals","authors":"Faxian Cao","authorsParsed":[["Cao","Faxian",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2024 17:23:22 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-02","timestamp":1722533002000,"abstract":"  This document presents some insights and observations regarding the paper\nthat was published in IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing (TSP), titled\n\"Self-Localization of Ad-Hoc Arrays Using Time Difference of Arrivals\". In the\nspirit of constructive feedback, I wish to highlight two key areas of\nconsideration. The first pertains to aspects related to methodology,\nexperimental results, and statements made in the paper. The second part\naddresses specific equation/typographical errors. This work aims to initiate a\nconstructive dialogue concerning certain aspects of the paper published in IEEE\nTSP. Our intention is to provide feedback that contributes to the ongoing\nimprovement of the paper's robustness and clarity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
