For any prescribed deterministic function under some\nconditions, we construct solutions to each system whose energy is the fixed\nfunction. Consequently, we prove non-uniqueness of almost sure Markov\nselections of suitable class of weak solutions associated to the momentum\nsurface quasi-geostrophic equations in both cases of noise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
