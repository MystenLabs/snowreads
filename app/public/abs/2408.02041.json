Moreover, by using Ekeland's variational\nprinciple and Clark's Theorem, respectively, we prove that the system has at\nleast one or multiple semi-trivial solutions when the perturbation terms\nsatisfy different assumptions. Finally, we present a nonexistence result of\nsolutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
