The\nelectronic and phonon structures are calculated, highlighting the importance of\nantibonding Pd-As interactions in determining the properties of this material.\nThe calculated electron-phonon copling parameter $\\lambda = 0.76$ agrees very\nwell with the experimental finding, which confirms the conventional pairing\nmechanism in Mg$_4$Pd$_7$As$_6$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nkTK5J_nsVvFKk6ahkygHKRR_V757ghojzmTy2VnDr0","pdfSize":"7203447"}
