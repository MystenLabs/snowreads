The main goal is to evaluate the accu-racy of\nmeasurements provided by the sensors. This study presents rele-vance, for\ninstance, in tremor/Parkinson disease analysis as well as no touch mechanisms\nfor activation and control of devices. This scenario is especially interesting\nin COVID-19 scenario. Removing the need to touch a surface, the risk of\ncontagion is reduced.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RSIV7UJr6KNt4SpiDiUlSb88_peUwdAT43gKATLiM_c","pdfSize":"926885"}
