In this note we show that the space\n$C_p(X)$ of continuous real-valued functions on a Tychonoff space $X$ with the\ntopology of pointwise convergence, fails to satisfy the property (B) if and\nonly if the space $X$ has the following property $(\\kappa)$: every sequence of\ndisjoint finite subsets of $X$ has a subsequence with point--finite open\nexpansion. Additionally, we provide an analogous characterization for the\ncompact--open topology on $C(X)$. Finally, we give examples of Tychonoff spaces\n$X$ whose all bounded subsets are finite, yet $X$ fails to have the property\n$(\\kappa)$. This answers a question of Tkachuk.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
