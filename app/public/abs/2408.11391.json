We present a method to\nconstruct Bell inequalities with violation feature analogous to original\nelegant Bell inequality in high dimension from a simple analytic quantum bound.\nA Bell inequality with such feature is derived in three dimension for the first\ntime. It shows larger violation than existing Bell inequalities of similar\nclasses while requiring arguably small number of measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
