These are\nrelevant for the integrands of scattering amplitudes in planar N=4\nsuper-Yang-Mills. At one-loop the idea was to view the set of all loop momenta,\nwhich we refer to as the one-loop fiber geometry, as a fibration over the\ntree-level kinematic data. This led to the notion of tree-level chambers,\nsubsets of the tree-level kinematic space for which the combinatorial structure\nof the one-loop fiber remains unchanged, that allowed for a novel\nrepresentation of the one-loop integrand. The goal of this paper is to extend\nthese ideas to two loops for MHV integrands. Our approach will be to view the\ngeometry accessed by the second loop momentum, similarly referred to as the\ntwo-loop fiber geometry, as a fibration over both the one-loop kinematic data\nand the position of the first loop momentum in the one-loop fiber. This will\nlead to the notion of one-loop chambers, subsets of the one-loop fibers for\nwhich the combinatorial structure of the two-loop fiber remains unchanged. We\nwill characterise the full set of one-loop chambers and their corresponding\ntwo-loop fibers and present formulae for their canonical forms. Ultimately,\nthis will result in a new formula for the two-loop MHV integrand written as a\nfibration of fibration.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
