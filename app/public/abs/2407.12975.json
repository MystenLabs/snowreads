We\ndemonstrate that the significance in both the $b\\bar{b}$ and semi-leptonic $WW$\nfinal states can be enhanced by factors of up to three compared to inclusive\ncross section determinations of this coupling for transversely-polarized\nelectrons. If the positrons can be simultaneously longitudinally polarized,\neven at the level of 30\\%, the significance can be enhanced by a factor of five\nor more. The method utilizes quantum interference between the Higgs signal and\nthe continuum background and is also applicable in other $WW$ and $ZZ$ final\nstates.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
