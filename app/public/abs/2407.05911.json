This is a method relying on techniques from dyadic Harmonic\nAnalysis which has received a lot of attention in recent years. Essentially, it\nallows for a unified approach to proving weighted norm inequalities for a large\nvariety of operators. In this work, we will introduce the basic ideas of dyadic\nHarmonic Analysis, which we use to build up to the main result we discuss on\npointwise sparse domination, which is the Lerner-Ombrosi theorem. We also give\napplications of this theorem to some families of operators, mainly relating to\nsingular integral operators. The text has been structured so as to motivate the\nintroduction of new ideas through the lens of solving specific problems in\nHarmonic Analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
