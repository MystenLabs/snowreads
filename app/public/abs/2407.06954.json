For this purpose well equilibrated configurations from\ndifferent initial temperatures, Ts, belonging to the fluid phase, are quenched\nto a fixed subzero temperature. Our results on kinetics, for a wide range of\nTs, following such quenches, show quicker crystallization of samples that are\nhotter at the beginning. This implies the presence of the puzzling Mpemba\neffect (ME). Via a similar study, we also identify ME in fluid to solid\ntransitions in a Lennard-Jones (LJ) model. In the latter case, the ME appears\npurely as an outcome of the influence of critical fluctuations on the\nnonequilibrium growth process, for which we present interesting scaling\nresults. For the TIP4P/Ice case, on the other hand, we show that delay in\nnucleation, due to metastability, can alone be a driving factor for the\nexhibition of ME. To substantiate the difference between the two cases, we also\npresent LJ-like scaling results for ME in a magnetic transition. Our\nsimulations indicate that in each of the systems the effect can be observed\nindependent of the cooling rate that may vary when samples from different Ts\nare brought in contact with a heat reservoir working at a fixed lower\ntemperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
