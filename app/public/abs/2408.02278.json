In this paper we compute quasi-elliptic\ncohomology of 4-spheres under the action by some finite subgroups that are the\nmost interesting isotropy groups where the M5-branes may sit.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
