Despite\nrecent advancements, the issue of solving stiff chemically reacting problems\nwithin computational fluid dynamics remains a significant issue. In this study\nwe propose a novel approach utilizing a multi-layer-perceptron mixer\narchitecture (MLP-Mixer) to model the time-series of stiff chemical kinetics.\nWe evaluate this method using the ROBER system, a benchmark model in chemical\nkinetics, to compare its performance with traditional numerical techniques.\nThis study provides insight into the industrial utility of the recently\ndeveloped MLP-Mixer architecture to model chemical kinetics and provides\nmotivation for such neural architecture to be used as a base for time-series\nfoundation models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
