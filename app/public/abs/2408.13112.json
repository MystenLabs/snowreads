The proposed theory is developed in the general framework of\ndynamic programming which leads to think of computational laws dictated by\nclassic Hamiltonian equations. Those equations lead to the formulation of a\nneural propagation scheme in cognitive agents modeled by dynamic neural\nnetworks which exhibits locality in both space and time, thus contributing the\nlongstanding debate on biological plausibility of learning algorithms like\nBackpropagation. We interpret the learning process in terms of energy exchange\nwith the environment and show the crucial role of energy dissipation and its\nlinks with focus of attention mechanisms and conscious behavior.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
