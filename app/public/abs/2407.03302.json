The possibilities of\nreplicating the emergence of a complex behavior like language have strong\nintuitive appeal, yet it is necessary to complement this with clear notions of\nhow such research can be applicable to other fields of science, technology, and\nengineering. This paper comprehensively reviews the applications of emergent\ncommunication research across machine learning, natural language processing,\nlinguistics, and cognitive science. Each application is illustrated with a\ndescription of its scope, an explication of emergent communication's unique\nrole in addressing it, a summary of the extant literature working towards the\napplication, and brief recommendations for near-term research directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
