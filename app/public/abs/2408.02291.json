As keypoints\nshould be semantically and geometrically consistent across all the 3D frames -\neach keypoint should be anchored to a specific part of the deforming shape\nirrespective of intrinsic and extrinsic motion. This paper presents, \"SelfGeo\",\na self-supervised method that computes persistent 3D keypoints of non-rigid\nobjects from arbitrary PCDs without the need of human annotations. The gist of\nSelfGeo is to estimate keypoints between frames that respect invariant\nproperties of deforming bodies. Our main contribution is to enforce that\nkeypoints deform along with the shape while keeping constant geodesic distances\namong them. This principle is then propagated to the design of a set of losses\nwhich minimization let emerge repeatable keypoints in specific semantic\nlocations of the non-rigid shape. We show experimentally that the use of\ngeodesic has a clear advantage in challenging dynamic scenes and with different\nclasses of deforming shapes (humans and animals).
