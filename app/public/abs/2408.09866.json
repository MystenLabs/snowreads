The current objective is to enhance\nthe memory density of memory cells while performing logic operations within the\nsame memory unit. Present study demonstrates that integrating SOT with an\nout-of-plane magnetic field effectively achieves multiple magnetic states in\nperpendicularly magnetized heterostructures. This study further explores this\napproach, experimentally demonstrating reconfigurable logic operations within a\nsingle SOT device using W/Pt/Co/AlOxheterostructures. Our results show that\nmultistate tuning by SOT integration with out-of-plane magnetic field enables\nreconfigurable logic operations, including AND, OR, NOR, NAND, and Always ON,\nwithin a single device. Additionally, we found that careful selection of input\nlogic operations allows multiple configurations to achieve the same logic\nfunction within a single memory device. To enhance multistate memory density,\nwe proposed and experimentally verified a two-step writing process, achieving\nthe highest reported multistate memory density in SOT-based memory devices.\nThese findings highlight the potential of integrating SOT and magnetic field\neffects to realize high-density, multifunctional in-memory logic devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wUODgxHH-80FOBNX7CAoPQ3XasBSOkn8eWD0Hd3R7ew","pdfSize":"9037109"}
