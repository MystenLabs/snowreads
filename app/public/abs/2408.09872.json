These capabilities open the way towards\nthe exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with\na kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural\nimplementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in\ndiscrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an\nauxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite\nfeaturing an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the\ndynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic\nrealizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on\nthe environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which\nwe characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes\nthe large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems\nas a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum\nprocessors and simulators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TNftDA2G3cpr2DABhZ8IQp7pRSnRbBsosblpafrIRU0","pdfSize":"3280077"}
