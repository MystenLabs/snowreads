In this paper, the Crank-Nicolson\nmethod and the tempered weighted and shifts Gr\\\"unwald formula are firstly\napplied to discretize the tempered fractional diffusion equations. We then\nobtain that the coefficient matrix of the discretized system has the structure\nof the sum of the identity matrix and a diagonal matrix multiplied by a\nsymmetric positive definite(SPD) Toeplitz matrix. Based on the properties of\nSPD Toeplitz matrices, we use $\\tau$ matrix approximate it and then propose a\nnovel approximate inverse preconditioner to approximate the coefficient matrix.\nThe $\\tau$ matrix based approximate inverse preconditioner can be efficiently\ncomputed using the discrete sine transform(DST). In spectral analysis, the\neigenvalues of the preconditioned coefficient matrix are clustered around 1,\nensuring fast convergence of Krylov subspace methods with the new\npreconditioner. Finally, numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed preconditioner.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
