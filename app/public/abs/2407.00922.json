Addressing a pressing\nissue in the digital age, we investigate public reactions to AI-created\nfabrications through a structured experiment on a simulated academic conference\nplatform. Our findings indicate a profound public challenge in discerning such\ncontent, highlighted by GAI's capacity for realistic fabrications. To counter\nthis, we introduce an innovative approach employing large language models like\nChatGPT for truthfulness assess-ment. We detail a specific workflow for\nscrutinizing the authenticity of everyday digital content, aimed at boosting\npublic awareness and capability in identifying fake mate-rials. We apply this\nworkflow to an agent bot on Telegram to help users identify the authenticity of\ntext content through conversations. Our project encapsulates a two-pronged\nstrategy: generating fake content to understand its dynamics and developing\nassessment techniques to mitigate its impact. As part of that effort we propose\nthe creation of speculative fact-checking wearables in the shape of reading\nglasses and a clip-on. As a computational media art initiative, this project\nunder-scores the delicate interplay between technological progress, ethical\nconsid-erations, and societal consciousness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
