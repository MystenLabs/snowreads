Precision measurements at a future Z factory would yield sensitivity\nto MSSM that is complementary to direct searches at the LHC, provided that the\nsystematic uncertainties can be reduced to a level comparable to the expected\nstatistical uncertainties.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EzayKXPL-XZ22SVJnCkhvrsablWi7suz0dxv6aO_Dyg","pdfSize":"839025","objectId":"0xeee88c86846a2f7706c9ebf1b30d98cfb5a4a232f584d43ee57f4e349684ca7c","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
