Precision measurements at a future Z factory would yield sensitivity\nto MSSM that is complementary to direct searches at the LHC, provided that the\nsystematic uncertainties can be reduced to a level comparable to the expected\nstatistical uncertainties.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EzayKXPL-XZ22SVJnCkhvrsablWi7suz0dxv6aO_Dyg","pdfSize":"839025"}
