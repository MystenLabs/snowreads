Motivated by applications in geophysics, the\nMHD system considered here is anisotropic with small vertical dissipation and\nsmall horizontal magnetic diffusion. By exploiting the enhanced dissipation due\nto the background magnetic field and introducing three layers of energy\nfunctionals, we are able to establish global-in-time uniform bounds that are\nindependent of vertical viscosity and horizontal resistivity. These global\nconormal regularity estimates allow us to pass to the limit and obtain the\nconvergence to the MHD system with no vertical dissipation and horizontal\nmagnetic diffusion. In the special case of the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes,\nexplicit long-time rates are also extracted in the zero vertical viscosity\nlimit. This result complements the important work of Xiao and Xin\n\\cite{Xiao2007,Xiao2013}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
