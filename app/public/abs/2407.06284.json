Dramatically affected by cosmic variance,\nthese scales are of interest to large-scale structure studies as they exhibit\nrelevant corrections due to general relativity (GR) in the $n$-point statistics\nof cosmological random fields. We focus on the relativistic, sample-dependent\nDoppler contribution to the observed clustering of galaxies, whose detection\nwill further confirm the validity of GR in cosmological regimes. Sample- and\nscale-dependent, the Doppler term is more likely to be detected via\ncross-correlation measurements, where it acts as an imaginary correction to the\npower spectrum of fluctuations in galaxy number counts. We present a method\nallowing us to exploit multi-tracer benefits from a single data set, by\nsubdividing a galaxy population into two sub-samples, according to galaxies'\nluminosity/magnitude. To overcome cosmic variance we rely on a multi-tracer\napproach, and to maximise the detectability of the relativistic Doppler\ncontribution in the data, we optimise sample selection. As a result, we find\nthe optimal split and forecast the relativistic Doppler detection significance\nfor both a DESI-like Bright Galaxy Sample and a $Euclid$-like H$\\alpha$ galaxy\npopulation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
