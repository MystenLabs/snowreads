For all prescribed values of the mass, we prove\nexistence of a positive radial solution by a variational argument, which\nexploits a delicate analysis on the mountain pass level. Under an additional\nmonotonicity assumption on the nonlinearity, such a solution turns out to be\nalso a ground state in $H^1(\\mathbb R^2)$. Our work extends in several\ndirections the results by Deng-Yu.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
