Existing FCS-MPC\nmethods typically pursue practical stability guarantees, which ensure\nconvergence to a bounded invariant set that contains a desired steady state. As\nsuch, current FCS-MPC methods result in unpredictable steady-state behavior due\nto arbitrary switching among the available finite control inputs. Motivated by\nthis, we present a FCS-MPC design that aims to stabilize a steady-state limit\ncycle compatible with a desired output reference via a suitable cost function.\nWe provide conditions in terms of periodic terminal costs and finite control\nset control laws that guarantee asymptotic stability of the developed limit\ncycle FCS-MPC algorithm. Moreover, we develop conditions for recursive\nfeasibility of limit cycle FCS-MPC in terms of periodic terminal sets and we\nprovide systematic methods for computing ellipsoidal and polytopic periodically\ninvariant sets that contain a desired steady-state limit cycle. Compared to\nexisting periodic terminal ingredients for tracking MPC with a continuous\ncontrol set, we design and compute terminal ingredients using a finite control\nset. The developed methodology is validated on switched systems and power\nelectronics benchmark examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
