Our approach achieves real-time replanning by dividing the\nworkspace into cells and utilizing a hierarchical planner. Specifically,\nmulti-commodity flow-based high-level planners route robots through the cells\nto reduce congestion, while an anytime low-level planner computes\ncollision-free paths for robots within each cell in parallel. Despite resulting\nin longer paths compared to the baseline multi-agent pathfinding algorithm, our\nmethod produces a solution with significant improvement in computation time.\nSpecifically, we show empirical results of a 500-times speedup in computation\ntime compared to the baseline multi-agent pathfinding approach on the\nenvironments we study. We account for the robot's embodiment and support\nnon-stop execution when replanning continuously. We demonstrate the real-time\nperformance of our algorithm with up to 142 robots in simulation, and a\nrepresentative 32 physical Crazyflie nano-quadrotor experiment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o0mu0wqTvCm5YW0sNkt57ExAdx2qtA7YRUIoJImqTfQ","pdfSize":"6294464","objectId":"0x0807c434ff3df0c688dd8d8c16dc08ad3cdfdc0a8891c11cbd15cf2429ffa5dc","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
