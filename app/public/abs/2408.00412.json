We prove that this pair of functors is\nan adjoint pair and that the functor from vertex algebras to factorization\nalgebras is fully faithful. Also, we identify the class of factorization\nalgebras that are categorically equivalent to vertex algebras. To illustrate,\nwe check the compatibility with the commutative structures and the\nfactorization algebras constructed as factorization envelopes, including the\nKac-Moody factorization algebra, the quantum observables of the $\\beta\\gamma$\nsystem, and the Virasoro factorization algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gtb9um4NziUCLf_8gGNxdwY5jRjTcotkq0MvZKTYAlg","pdfSize":"577451"}
