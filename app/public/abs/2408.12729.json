Tip speed ratios of $4<\\lambda<7$ were investigated and measurements were\nacquired up to 6.5 diameters downstream of the turbine. Through an\ninvestigation of the turbulent statistics, it is shown that the wake recovery\nwas accelerated due to the higher turbulence levels associated with lower tip\nspeed ratios. The energy spectra indicate that larger broadband turbulence\nlevels at lower tip speed ratios contributes to a more rapidly recovering wake.\nWake meandering and a coherent core structure were also studied, and it is\nshown that these flow features are tip speed ratio invariant, when considering\ntheir Strouhal numbers. This finding contradicts some previous studies\nregarding the core structure, indicating that the structure was formed by a\nbulk rotor geometric feature, rather than by the rotating blades. Finally, the\ncore structure was shown to persist farther into the near wake with decreasing\ntip speed ratio. The structure's lifetime is hypothesized to be related to its\nstrength relative to the turbulence in the core, which decreases with\nincreasing tip speed ratio.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DdiaP6dnstYBDHp7K-B_g2ZN1F0dJ5sLFIT_xuIxFoE","pdfSize":"2456825"}
