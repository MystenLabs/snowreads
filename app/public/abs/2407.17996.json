To overcome these challenges, we propose a joint\nRGB-Spectral decomposition model guided enhancement framework, which consists\nof two steps: joint decomposition and prior-guided enhancement. Firstly, we\nleverage the complementarity between RGB and Low-resolution Multi-Spectral\nImages (Lr-MSI) to predict shading, reflectance, and material semantic priors.\nSubsequently, these priors are seamlessly integrated into the established\nHDRNet to promote dynamic range enhancement, color mapping, and grid expert\nlearning, respectively. Additionally, we construct a high-quality Mobile-Spec\ndataset to support our research, and our experiments validate the effectiveness\nof Lr-MSI in the tone enhancement task. This work aims to establish a solid\nfoundation for advancing spectral vision in mobile photography.
