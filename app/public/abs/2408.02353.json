By incorporating the principle of vehicle area\nconservation, a new set of traffic flow variables centered on the concept of\nvehicle area has been introduced. These variables, namely areal flow and areal\ndensity, exhibit the remarkable characteristic of being conserved across time\nand space and seamlessly related to the traditional space mean speed. Next, the\nstudy successfully established a bi-variate relationship among these newly\nintroduced area-based traffic variables based on empirical data from three\nlocations for stream and mode-specific. It is shown that the conventional\nsolution methods for the hyperbolic conservation laws remain applicable to the\nproposed continuum model. Finally, a multi-class cell transmission model\nnumerical scheme is developed and used to illustrate the performance of the\nproposed model in replicating the seepage and platoon dispersion behavior in\nmixed traffic conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2zZ8s7VGVoV6tKn0318-Fldsi5D0Y83tJIvtBNM2Wlc","pdfSize":"11453737","txDigest":"G25RgA8RXb5EHUhvUWsEu3xJXD2GqWavWNAMzCQwZCfg","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
