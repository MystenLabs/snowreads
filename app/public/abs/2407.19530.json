The pre-periodic\nterms add up to the $(k-1)(d+1)$-st partial sum of the corresponding formal\npower series, and thus the Riordan array of $p(t)$ generates a sequence of\ncolumn partial sums. We classify linear and quadratic polynomials, and present\na particular family of polynomials of higher degrees, for which such sequences\nof column partial sums are eventually periodic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"UsSZgJ9NjLWlfa2zhhE--BOCF13wWf65JlXnl_8eB2c","pdfSize":"3188982"}
