In this\npaper, we propose two novel approaches to accelerate the convergence of current\niterative MIMO detectors in ELAA channels. Our approaches exploit the static\ncomponents of the ELAA channel, which include line of sight (LoS) paths and\ndeterministic non-LoS (NLoS) components due to channel hardening effects. This\npaper proposes novel convergence acceleration techniques for fast iterative\nELAA-MIMO detection by leveraging the static channel component, including the\nLoS paths and deterministic NLoS components that arise due to channel\nhardening. Specifically, these static channel components are utilized in two\nways: as preconditioning matrices for general iterative algorithms, and as\ninitialization for quasi-Newton (QN) methods. Simulation results show that the\nproposed approaches converge significantly faster compared to current iterative\nMIMO detectors, especially under strong LoS conditions with high Rician\nK-factor. Furthermore, QN methods with the proposed initialization matrix\nconsistently achieve the best convergence performance while maintaining low\ncomplexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
