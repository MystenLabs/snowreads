Here, we propose a phase-sensitive ultra-high\nspatial resolution optical frequency domain reflectometry tech-nique, in which\nthe test fiber is embedded into the anode of a lithium-ion battery to monitor\nthe mechanical evolution of the anode material during cycling. We investigated\nthe strain evolution of the anode material under different loading levels and\nused this method to infer the morphological changes of the material.\nFurthermore, combining this with battery capacity in-formation provides a new\napproach for assessing the performance of lithium-ion batteries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
