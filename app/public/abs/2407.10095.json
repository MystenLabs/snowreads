The worldsheet geometry also\ndisplays characteristic permanent changes caused by the gravitational wave\npulse. The above effects collectively demonstrate features akin to what is\nknown as `memory' in gravitational wave physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
