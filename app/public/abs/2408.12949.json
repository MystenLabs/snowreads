In the case of hyperthermal hydrogen atom\nscattering, they lead to nonadiabatic energy loss and highly inelastic\nscattering. Molecular dynamics with electronic friction simulations where\nfriction is computed under an isotropic homogeneous electron gas approximation\nhave previously shown good agreement with measured kinetic energy loss\ndistributions, suggesting that this level of theoretical description is\nsufficient to describe nonadiabatic effects of atomic scattering. In this work,\nwe show that similar agreement with room temperature experiments can also be\nachieved with friction derived from density functional theory linear response\ncalculations. The apparent agreement of the homogeneous electron gas\napproximation with experiment arises from a fortuitous cancellation of errors\nwhere friction is overestimated close to the surface and the spin transition is\nneglected. Only for scattering at low temperatures can both approximations be\ndistinguished and differences rationalised in terms of the number of bounces of\nthe atom on the surface. We identify the signatures of nonadiabatic energy loss\nof different levels of theory, which future low-temperature scattering\nexperiments will be able to measure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
