However, the\nreliability and precision of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS), such\nas the Global Positioning System (GPS), are compromised by multi-path errors\nand non-line-of-sight scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach to\nenhance GPS accuracy by combining visual data from RGB cameras with wireless\nsignals captured at millimeter-wave (mmWave) and sub-terahertz (sub-THz)\nbasestations. We propose a sensing-aided framework for (i) site-specific GPS\ndata characterization and (ii) GPS position de-noising that utilizes\nmulti-modal visual and wireless information. Our approach is validated in a\nrealistic Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) scenario using a comprehensive\nreal-world dataset, demonstrating a substantial reduction in localization error\nto sub-meter levels. This method represents a significant advancement in\nachieving precise localization, particularly beneficial for high-mobility\napplications in 5G and beyond networks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GHstjKpbWJjrUrW56AnoO0x6sv4AciJ1NJimG4-_Fmw","pdfSize":"2397478"}
