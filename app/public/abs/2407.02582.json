The result is sharp in\nview of the fact that such a conservation law holds for all weak solutions in\nthe class $C_{t,x}^0 \\subset L_{t,x}^3$ (Isett-Vicol, 2015) and resolves the\nOnsager conjecture for SQG. The construction is achieved by means of a Nash\niteration together with the linear decoupling method recently introduced in\nGiri-Radu (2023).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
