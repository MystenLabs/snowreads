Such activity may also result in motility-induced\ncrystallization (MIC) into clusters with an inner crystalline structure. We\npresent a higher-order active Phase-Field-Crystal (PFC) model and employ it to\nstudy the interplay of passive (i.e., thermodynamic) and active (i.e.,\nmotility-induced) condensation and crystallization. Morphological phase\ndiagrams indicate the various occurring phase coexistences and transitions,\ne.g., the destruction of passive clusters by density-independent activity and\nthe creation of such clusters by a density-dependent activity. Finally,\nrotating crystallites are analyzed in some detail.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
