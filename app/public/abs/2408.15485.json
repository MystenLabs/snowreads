The novel metamaterial unit cell structure\nis designed based on transmission phase, amplitude, and electric field response\nto model DWPT using PTM. Theoretical analysis of the electric field (e-field),\ncoupling effect, and current distribution at the metamaterial interface\nenhances the intelligence and reconfigurability of the PTM lens. The modeled\n2-bit 6x6 array PTM is designed to operate at a frequency of 4 GHz. The\nreconfigurable architecture comprises a fixed system with a single-layer PTM\nlens capable of 60{\\deg} beam scanning. The PTM lens, along with a distribution\nboard, is fabricated and experimentally tested. The results between simulation\nand measurements are in good agreement. The system enables dynamic optimisation\nof the beam pattern to track the positions of mobile users with minimal\nsoftware-hardware complexity. This novel work presents a low-cost experiment\nachieving an average 90.7% beamforming accuracy throughout the analytical and\nmeasurement processes of DWPT for movable users, utilizing a programmable\ntransmit metamaterial array.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
