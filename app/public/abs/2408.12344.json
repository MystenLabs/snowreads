For $n=1$, we use the conformal multiplet\nrecombination method to determine the leading anomalous dimensions of the\nfundamental scalar operator $\\phi$ and the bilinear composite operators\n$\\mathcal J$. Then we extend the $n=1$ analysis to the Potts model with\n$S_{N+1}$ symmetry and its higher-derivative generalization, in which $\\phi$ is\npromoted to an $N$-component field. We further examine the Chew-Frautschi plots\nand their $N$ dependence. However, for each integer $n>1$, the leading\nanomalous dimensions of $\\phi$ and $ \\mathcal{J}$ are not fully determined and\ncontain one unconstrained constant, which in the canonical cases can be fixed\nby the results from the traditional diagrammatic method. In all cases, we\nverify that the multiplet-recombination results are consistent with crossing\nsymmetry using the analytic bootstrap methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
