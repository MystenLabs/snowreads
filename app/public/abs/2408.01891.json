Boden and Karimi introduced a determinant of\ncheckerboard colorable virtual knots. We prove that their determinant mod $8$\nis classified by the coefficient of $z^2$ in the ascending polynomial which is\nan extension of the Conway polynomial for classical knots.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
