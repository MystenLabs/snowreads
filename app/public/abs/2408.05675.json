In the paper, the main result is\na quantitative stability theorem for the nonlocal free energy assuming symmetry\non the potential. In addition, several results that involve uniqueness,\nnon-existence, and moduli estimates from the theory for crystals are proven\nalso in the nonlocal context.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
