During shower development, two consecutive splittings sometimes\noverlap quantum mechanically, so that they cannot be treated independently.\nSome of these effects can be absorbed into an effective value of a medium\nparameter known as $\\hat q$. Previous calculations (with certain simplifying\nassumptions) have found that, after adjusting the value of $\\hat q$, the\nleftover effect of overlapping splittings is quite small for purely gluonic\nlarge-$N_c$ showers but is very much larger for large-$N_f$ QED showers, at\ncomparable values of $N\\alpha$. Here, by investigating the same problem for QCD\nwith *quarks* in the large-$N_f$ limit of many quark flavors, we make a first\nstudy of whether the small effect in purely gluonic showers (i) was merely an\naccident or (ii) is more broadly characteristic of such overlap effects in QCD.\nWe also offer a qualitative explanation for the large size of the effect in QED\nvs. QCD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
