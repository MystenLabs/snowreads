We describe basic constructions that\nnaturally appear in this theory: shifted cotangent bundles and the AKSZ\nprocedure. Along the way, we also develop the theory of shifted symplectic\ngroupoids presenting shifted symplectic structures on quotients and define a\ndeformation to the normal cone for shifted Lagrangian morphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
