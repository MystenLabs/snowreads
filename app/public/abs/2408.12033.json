In the vicinity of a dielectric or metallic surface, Casimir-Polder\neffects can modify collective atomic frequency shifts and decay rates. In this\nwork, we study cooperative fluorescent emission next to resonant surfaces using\nthe coupled dipoles model. We show that cooperative effects, expected in free\nspace, are absent when the atoms are close to a surface whose polariton\nresonances coincide with the dominant atomic dipole coupling. In this case,\ncooperative effects are overshadowed by the very fast decay of the atomic\nfluorescence into surface modes. We illustrate our formalism and our results by\nconsidering a line of cesium 6D3/2 atoms in front of a sapphire surface.\nFinally, we propose the study of Cesium 6P3/2 atoms in front of a resonant\nmetasurface as the most promising scenario for experimentally demonstrating the\nresults of our study.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
