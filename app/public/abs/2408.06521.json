Omics technologies are revealing a large and growing number\nof new glial cell subtypes, defined by their gene expression profile. These\nsubtypes have significant implications for understanding glial cell function,\ncell-cell communications, and glia-specific changes between homeostasis and\nconditions such as neurological disease. For many, the training in how to\nanalyze, interpret, and understand these large datasets has been through\nreading and understanding literature from other fields like biostatistics.\nHere, we provide a primer for glial biologists on experimental design and\nanalysis of single-cell RNA-seq datasets. Our goal is to further the\nunderstanding of why decisions might be made about datasets and to enhance\nbiologists' ability to interpret and critique their work and the work of\nothers. We review the steps involved in single-cell analysis with a focus on\ndecision points and particular notes for glia. The goal of this primer is to\nensure that single-cell 'omics experiments continue to advance glial biology in\na rigorous and replicable way.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
