It can serve as the symmetry of a\nfinite geometry G. The symmetry is a subset of the orthogonal group or unitary\ngroup and isospectral Lax deformations produce commuting flows d/dt\nD=[B(g(D)),D] on this symmetry space. In this note, we remark that like in the\nToda case, D_t=Q_t* D_0 Q_t with exp(-t g(D))=Q_t R_t solves the Lax system.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
