Almost\ninvariably, spatial models of viral infections make use of a wide, flat\ncomputational domain which is assumed to be representative of the entire\naffected tissue. Implicit in this assumption is that either the tissue being\nmodelled is largely wide and homogeneous, or that the topology of the tissue\nhas little influence on the dynamics of the system. This assumption fails to\ntake into account the distinctive geometry of the lung. The lung is\ncharacterised by a tubular, highly branching structure, and moreover is\nspatially heterogeneous: deeper regions of the lung are composed of far\nnarrower airways and are associated with more severe infection. Here, we extend\na typical multicellular model of viral dynamics to account for two essential\nfeatures of the geometry of the lung: the tubular structure of airways, and the\nbranching process between airway generations. We show that, with this more\nrealistic tissue geometry, the dynamics of infection are substantially changed\ncompared to the standard approach, and that the resulting model is equipped to\ntackle important biological phenomena that are not well-addressed with existing\nmodels, including viral lineage dynamics in the lung, and heterogeneity in\nimmune responses to infection in different regions of the respiratory tree.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
