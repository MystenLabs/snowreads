This indicates a variation in spin-orbit interaction strength\ndepending on whether the magnetic field penetrates the interface from a\nferromagnetic to a non-magnetic metal or vice versa. Systematic measurements of\nover 100 nanomagnets revealed a consistent, yet unexpected, pattern between\nvariations in magnetic anisotropy and spin-orbit interactions with\nmagnetization reversal. These changes align along a single straight line with a\nnegative slope, suggesting a complex and indirect relationship. Our findings\nalso suggest the presence of an additional, yet-to-be-identified effect that\ninfluences the change in magnetic anisotropy with magnetization reversal,\nbeyond the variations in spin-orbit interaction strength. This finding\nhighlights the complexity of magnetic behavior at the nanoscale and the\ncritical role of magnetization direction in determining anisotropic properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
