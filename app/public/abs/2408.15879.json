This paper explores the\npotential of LLMs, to shape user perspectives and subsequently influence their\ndecisions on particular tasks. This capability finds applications in diverse\ndomains such as Investment, Credit cards and Insurance, wherein they assist\nusers in selecting appropriate insurance policies, investment plans, Credit\ncards, Retail, as well as in Behavioral Change Support Systems (BCSS).\n  We present a sophisticated multi-agent framework wherein a consortium of\nagents operate in collaborative manner. The primary agent engages directly with\nuser agents through persuasive dialogue, while the auxiliary agents perform\ntasks such as information retrieval, response analysis, development of\npersuasion strategies, and validation of facts. Empirical evidence from our\nexperiments demonstrates that this collaborative methodology significantly\nenhances the persuasive efficacy of the LLM. We continuously analyze the\nresistance of the user agent to persuasive efforts and counteract it by\nemploying a combination of rule-based and LLM-based resistance-persuasion\nmapping techniques.\n  We employ simulated personas and generate conversations in insurance,\nbanking, and retail domains to evaluate the proficiency of large language\nmodels (LLMs) in recognizing, adjusting to, and influencing various personality\ntypes. Concurrently, we examine the resistance mechanisms employed by LLM\nsimulated personas. Persuasion is quantified via measurable surveys before and\nafter interaction, LLM-generated scores on conversation, and user decisions\n(purchase or non-purchase).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NlLKudUCToOTWM133XDVpi_zUz3HBWZG1U7zylP9Ldw","pdfSize":"943596"}
