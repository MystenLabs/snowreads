Due to the roughness of complex-valued\nspace-time white noise, this equation is a singular stochastic partial\ndifferential equation and its solution is expected to be a distribution-valued\nstochastic process. For this reason, the non-linear term is ill-defined and\nneeds to be renormalized. We first use the theory of complex multiple\nWiener-Ito integral to renormalize this equation and then consider its global\nwell-posedness. Further, we prove its ergodicity using an asymptotic coupling\nargument for a large dissipation coefficient.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
