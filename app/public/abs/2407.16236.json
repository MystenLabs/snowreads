We are able to prove that E_2-algebras\nwhose cohomology ring is a polynomial algebra on even degree classes are\nintrinsically formal. As a consequence we prove E_2-formality of the\nclassifying space of some compact Lie group or of Davis-Januszkiewicz spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
