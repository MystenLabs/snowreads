{"id":"2407.16523","title":"The cogrowth inequality from Whitehead's algorithm","authors":"Asif Shaikh","authorsParsed":[["Shaikh","Asif",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 23 Jul 2024 14:36:43 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-24","timestamp":1721745403000,"abstract":"  This article focuses on free factors $H\\leq F_m$ of the free group $F_m$ with\nfinite rank $m > 2$, and specifically addresses the implications of Ascari's\nrefinement of the Whitehead automorphism $\\varphi$ for $H$ as introduced in\n\\cite{ascari2021fine}. Ascari showed that if the core $\\Delta_H$ of $H$ has\nmore than one vertex, then the core $\\Delta_{\\varphi(H)}$ of $\\varphi(H)$ can\nbe derived from $\\Delta_H$. We consider the regular language $L_H$ of reduced\nwords from $F_m$ representing elements of $H$, and employ the construction of\n$\\mathcal{B}_H$ described in \\cite{DGS2021}. $\\mathcal{B}_H$ is a finite\nergodic, deterministic automaton that recognizes $L_H$. Extending Ascari's\nresult, we show that for the aforementioned free factors $H$ of $F_m$, the\nautomaton $\\mathcal{B}_{\\varphi(H)}$ can be obtained from $\\mathcal{B}_H$.\nFurther, we present a method for deriving the adjacency matrix of the\ntransition graph of $\\mathcal{B}_{\\varphi(H)}$ from that of $\\mathcal{B}_H$ and\nestablish that $\\alpha_H < \\alpha_{\\varphi(H)}$, where $\\alpha_H,\n\\alpha_{\\varphi(H)}$ represent the cogrowths of $H$ and $\\varphi(H)$,\nrespectively, with respect to a fixed basis $X$ of $F_m$. The proof is based on\nthe Perron-Frobenius theory for non-negative matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zNABvuc-qM6tRnE1V-a1G3MKaKBJyRUCMEK8vK0VV6Y","pdfSize":"529589"}
