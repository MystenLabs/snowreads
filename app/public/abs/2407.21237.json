We associate to\n$\\rho$ an explicit locally $\\mathbb{Q}_p$-analytic representation $\\pi_1(\\rho)$\nof $\\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$, which encodes some $p$-adic Hodge parameters of $\\rho$.\nWhen $K=\\mathbb{Q}_p$, it encodes the full information hence reciprocally\ndetermines $\\rho$. When $\\rho$ is associated to $p$-adic automorphic\nrepresentations, we show under mild hypotheses that $\\pi_1(\\rho)$ is a\nsubrepresentation of the $\\mathrm{GL}_n(K)$-representation globally associated\nto $\\rho$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
