The ability of quantum\nbits (qubits) to be in a superposition state allows quantum computers to\nperform certain calculations that are not possible with even the most powerful\nclassical (digital) computers. This work has established a method for\ncalculating the ground state energies of small lattices which should be\nscalable to larger lattices that cannot be calculated by classical computers.\nHalf-filled lattices of sizes 1x4, 2x2, 2x4, and 3x4 were studied. The\ncalculated energies for the 1x4 and 2x2 lattices without Coulomb repulsion\nbetween the electrons and for the 1x4 lattice with Coulomb repulsion agrees\nwith the true energies to within 0.60%, while for the 2x2 lattice with Coulomb\nrepulsion the agreement is within 1.50% For the 2x4 lattice, the true energy\nwithout Coulomb repulsion was found to agree within 0.18%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YyWs-1ziueDRLywBvD-pn3jg1-Ju26x9WSs26UueQI8","pdfSize":"20844637"}
