Current ST methods, categorized into next-generation sequencing-based\n(seq-based) and fluorescence in situ hybridization-based (image-based) methods,\noffer innovative insights into the functional dynamics of biological tissues.\nHowever, these methods are limited by their cellular resolution and the\nquantity of genes they can detect. To address these limitations, we propose\nSpaDiT, a deep learning method that utilizes a diffusion generative model to\nintegrate scRNA-seq and ST data for the prediction of undetected genes. By\nemploying a Transformer-based diffusion model, SpaDiT not only accurately\npredicts unknown genes but also effectively generates the spatial structure of\nST genes. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of SpaDiT through extensive\nexperiments on both seq-based and image-based ST data. SpaDiT significantly\ncontributes to ST gene prediction methods with its innovative approach.\nCompared to eight leading baseline methods, SpaDiT achieved state-of-the-art\nperformance across multiple metrics, highlighting its substantial\nbioinformatics contribution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
