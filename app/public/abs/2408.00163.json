The main goal of the\ncollaboration is to develop a framework to implement AI and machine learning\ntechniques in problems emerging from the phenomenology of high energy exclusive\nscattering processes from nucleons and nuclei, maximizing the information that\ncan be extracted from various sets of experimental data, while implementing\ntheoretical constraints from lattice QCD. A specific perspective embraced by\nEXCLAIM is to use the methods of theoretical physics to understand the working\nof ML, beyond its standardized applications to physics analyses which most\noften rely on industrially provided tools, in an automated way.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
