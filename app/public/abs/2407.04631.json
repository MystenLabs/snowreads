Advances in light\nsources for ARPES experiments are currently leading to a vast increase of data\nacquisition rates and data quantity. On the other hand, access time to the most\nadvanced ARPES instruments remains strictly limited, calling for fast,\neffective, and on-the-fly data analysis tools to exploit this time. In response\nto this need, we introduce ARPESNet, a versatile autoencoder network that\nefficiently summmarises and compresses ARPES datasets. We train ARPESNet on a\nlarge and varied dataset of 2-dimensional ARPES data extracted by cutting\nstandard 3-dimensional ARPES datasets along random directions in $\\mathbf{k}$.\nTo test the data representation capacity of ARPESNet, we compare $k$-means\nclustering quality between data compressed by ARPESNet, data compressed by\ndiscrete cosine transform, and raw data, at different noise levels. ARPESNet\ndata excels in clustering quality despite its high compression ratio.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
