We carry out a search for\nhigh-threshold magic state distillation routines for a highly-symmetric qutrit\nmagic state known as the strange state. Our search covers a large class of\n$[[n,1]]_3$ qutrit stabilizer codes with up to 23 qutrits, and is facilitated\nby a theorem that relates the distillation performance of a qudit stabilizer\ncode to its weight-enumerators. We could not find any code with $n<23$ qutrits\nthat distills the strange state with better than linear noise suppression,\nother than the 11-qutrit Golay code. However, for $n=23$, we find over 600 CSS\ncodes that can distill the qutrit strange state with cubic noise suppression.\nWhile none of these codes surpass the threshold of the 11-qutrit Golay code,\ntheir existence suggests that, for large codes, the ability to distill the\nqutrit strange state is somewhat generic.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
