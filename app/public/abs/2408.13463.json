It\nhelps to carry out a series of downstream tasks, like understanding human\nbehaviors. Due to the complexity of human behaviors, many highly valuable\nbehaviors are not yet encompassed within the available datasets for HAR, e.g.,\nhuman habitual behaviors (HHBs). HHBs hold significant importance for analyzing\na person's personality, habits, and psychological changes. To solve these\nproblems, in this work, we build a novel video dataset to demonstrate various\nHHBs. These behaviors in the proposed dataset are able to reflect internal\nmental states and specific emotions of the characters, e.g., crossing arms\nsuggests to shield oneself from perceived threats. The dataset contains 30\ncategories of habitual behaviors including more than 300,000 frames and 6,899\naction instances. Since these behaviors usually appear at small local parts of\nhuman action videos, it is difficult for existing action recognition methods to\nhandle these local features. Therefore, we also propose a two-stream model\nusing both human skeletons and RGB appearances. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method has much better performance in action\nrecognition than the existing methods on the proposed dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
