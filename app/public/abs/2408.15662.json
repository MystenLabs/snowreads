Using the Stokes remark, we transform this integral to the integral for\nthe soliton's equations of motion and then derive the Hamilton equations for\nthe soliton's dynamics in a universal form expressed in terms of the Riemann\ninvariants for the hydrodynamic background wave. The physical properties are\nspecified by the concrete expressions for the Riemann invariants. The theory is\nillustrated by its application to the soliton's dynamics which is described by\nthe Kaup-Boussinesq system.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
