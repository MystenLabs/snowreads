These observations are used in concluding several\nproperties of groups having essential subgroups. Finally, a short proof of the\nwell-known theorem of Eilenberg and Moore that the only injective object in the\ncategory of groups is the trivial group is given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
