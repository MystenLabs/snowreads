This paper addresses this challenge by\nemploying the recently introduced alternating SFQ (xSFQ) logic family. xSFQ\nleverages dual-rail alternating encoding to eliminate the clock dependency from\nthe superconducting gate semantics. This obviates the need for ad hoc\nmodifications to existing synthesis tools and avoids unnecessary circuit\nresource overheads, marking a significant advancement in superconducting\ncircuit design automation. Our implementation results demonstrate an average\nreduction of over 80\\% in the Josephson junction count for circuits from the\nISCAS85, EPFL, and ISCAS89 benchmark suites.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
