Munarini-Torri found a\nstriking combinatorial interpretation of the Cayley continuants in terms of the\njoint distribution of the number of odd cycles and the number of even cycles of\npermutations of $[n]=\\{1,2,\\ldots, n\\}$. In view of a general setting,\n$r$-regular cycles (with length not divisible by $r$) and $r$-singular cycles\n(with length divisible by $r$) have been extensively studied largely related to\nroots of permutations. We introduce the wide band Cayley continuants as an\nextension of the original Cayley continuants, and we show that they can be\ninterpreted in terms of the joint distribution of the number of $r$-regular\ncycles and the number of $r$-singular cycles over permutations of $[n]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
