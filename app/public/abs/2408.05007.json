However, only a handful of such cores have been observed. Here,\ndifferent than previous search in distributed star formation regions in the\nGalactic plane, we search for high-mass prestellar cores in the Orion GMC, by\nobserving the 7 most massive starless cores selected from previous deep\ncontinuum surveys. We present ALMA ACA Band 6 and Band 7 continuum and line\nobservations toward the 7 cores, in which we identify 9 dense cores at both\nbands. The derived maximum core mass is less than 11 Msun, based on different\ndust temperatures. We find no high-mass prestellar cores in this sample,\naligning with the results of previous surveys, thereby challenging the\nexistence of such cores in Orion. Outside Orion, further detailed studies are\nneeded for remaining high-mass prestellar core candidates to confirm their\nstatus as massive, starless cores.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lvZVX9co8eI8e_X30WPjQkATNlG7QPkLQpILYBf_pkE","pdfSize":"1700313"}
