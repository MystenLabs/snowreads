The construction of the numerical scheme\nuses an equivalent first-order hyperbolic system of equations as an\nintermediate step, for which a vectorial lattice Boltzmann formulation is\nintroduced. The only difference to conventional lattice Boltzmann formulations\nis the usage of vector-valued populations, so that all computational benefits\nof the algorithm are preserved. Using the asymptotic expansion technique and\nthe notion of pre-stability structures we further establish second-order\nconsistency as well as analytical stability estimates. Lastly, we introduce a\nsecond-order consistent initialization of the populations as well as a boundary\nformulation for Dirichlet boundary conditions on 2D rectangular domains. All\ntheoretical derivations are numerically verified by convergence studies using\nmanufactured solutions and long-term stability tests.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XXd36hyqr3ZHGR3AanFZsW3R2oaQlnlqFUXlKN6p2tM","pdfSize":"1049697"}
