This paper proposes a modification to\nthe Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) to compensate for the combined effects of\nspace charge and magnetic field imperfections under resonance crossing. The new\nRDTs are named modified RDTs. The effectiveness of the modified RDTs is\ndemonstrated through simulations of half-integer and 3rd-order resonance\ncrossings using the lattice of the High Intensity Heavy-Ion Accelerator\nFacility Booster Ring (HIAF-BRing). The simulations illustrate that the\ncompensation provided by the modified RDTs significantly suppresses emittance\ngrowth and reduces distortion in the phase space.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uBaIPAU0sN1L5x-ACkvfTFK6MhzGjqi9PLEEK8HY5gA","pdfSize":"8347772","txDigest":"8BkSsnsze9LmRywCtFqFn4enQ9yFZe3VgSTxRuqwtusn","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
