To alleviate beam squint effect,\nwe propose to maximize the minimum analog beamforming gain across the entire\nwideband spectrum by appropriately adjusting MAs' positions, which is a highly\nchallenging task. By introducing a slack variable and adopting the\ncutting-the-edge smoothed-gradient-descent-ascent (SGDA) method, we develop\nalgorithms to resolve the aforementioned challenge. Numerical results verify\nthe effectiveness of our proposed algorithms and demonstrate the benefit of\nutilizing MA array to mitigate beam squint effect in NF wideband system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
