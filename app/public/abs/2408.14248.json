The proposed deep learning autoencoder-based model\neliminates the computational complexity of existing PAPR reduction techniques,\nsuch as Selective Mapping (SLM), by leveraging a novel decoder architecture at\nthe receiver. In addition, No side information is needed in our approach,\nunlike SLM which requires knowledge of the PAPR distribution. Simulation\nresults demonstrate significant improvements in both PAPR reduction and Bit\nError Rate (BER) performance compared to traditional techniques. It achieves\nerror-free transmission with over 10 dB PAPR reduction compared to unmitigated\nand 1 dB gain over SLM technique. Furthermore, our approach exhibits robustness\nagainst noise and nonlinearity effects, enabling reliable transmission over\noptical channels with varying levels of impairment. The proposed technique has\nfar-reaching implications for next-generation optical communication systems,\nwhere efficient PAPR reduction is crucial for ensuring reliable data transfer.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
