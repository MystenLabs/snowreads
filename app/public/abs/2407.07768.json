Since then, numerous theoretical developments and improvements\nhave been made, as well as the first attempts to introduce them into real-life\nindustrial applications. The present introductory chapter provides an overview\nof the subject, highlights some of the achievements to date and discusses\npossible perspectives.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
