Instead, each agent trusts opinions within the\nMinkowski sum $\\xi+\\mathcal{O}$, where $\\xi$ is the agent's current opinion and\n$\\mathcal{O}$ is the confidence set defining acceptable deviations. During each\niteration, agents update their opinions by simultaneously averaging the trusted\nopinions. Unlike traditional HK systems, where $\\mathcal{O}$ is a ball in some\nnorm, our model allows the confidence set to be non-convex and even unbounded.\n  We demonstrate that the new model, referred to as SCOD (Set-based Confidence\nOpinion Dynamics), can exhibit properties absent in the conventional HK model.\nSome solutions may converge to non-equilibrium points in the state space, while\nothers oscillate periodically. These ``pathologies'' disappear if the set\n$\\mathcal{O}$ is symmetric and contains zero in its interior: similar to the\nusual HK model, SCOD then converges in a finite number of iterations to one of\nthe equilibrium points. The latter property is also preserved if one agent is\n\"stubborn\" and resists changing their opinion, yet still influences the others;\nhowever, two stubborn agents can lead to oscillations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"L5tjHuYTSU70kdSB_hdRriLTwM1k8mbj_O_McmEilWM","pdfSize":"793628","txDigest":"5kRZYXJpBHhm5RCwQ3VcbH89SLpTjuD31VMBrYtiS21T","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
