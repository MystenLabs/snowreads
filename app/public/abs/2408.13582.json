In this technical report, we briefly introduce the solution\nof our team \"yuanjie\" for video object segmentation in the 6-th LSVOS Challenge\nVOS Track at ECCV 2024. We believe that our proposed CSS-Segment will perform\nbetter in videos of complex object motion and long-term presentation. In this\nreport, we successfully validated the effectiveness of the CSS-Segment in video\nobject segmentation. Finally, our method achieved a J\\&F score of 80.84 in and\ntest phases, and ultimately ranked 2nd in the 6-th LSVOS Challenge VOS Track at\nECCV 2024.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
