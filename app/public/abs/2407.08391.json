So far the rapid switching has remained unexplained by theory.\nHere a very simple bare bones theory explains the key experimental features in\nterms of an avalanche model suggested by avalanche diodes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9Jqlf1brdv6SWgHM6Ch1Que-GDha_iusgWHpgvf1ULo","pdfSize":"532926"}
