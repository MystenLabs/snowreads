The integration of an\noptimized sensor such as Event Camera with an optimized network is essential\nfor maximizing these benefits. This paper introduces the innovative concept of\nsensing without seeing to detect driver distraction, leveraging computationally\nefficient spiking neural networks (SNN). To the best of our knowledge, this\nstudy is the first to utilize event camera data with spiking neural networks\nfor driver distraction. The proposed Spiking-DD network not only achieve state\nof the art performance but also exhibit fewer parameters and provides greater\naccuracy than current event-based methodologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xK8x6H72i2frOkfJ4GxIZ_jUOCzZCc09bZeCaWMDtF4","pdfSize":"689063"}
