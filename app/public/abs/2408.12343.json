We study the effect of rotation on\nthe emission of charges in the near-extremal rotating charged Nariai black hole\nand compare it to those from the near-extremal Nariai black hole and\nnear-extremal Kerr-Newman black hole in de Sitter space. The emission has an\nexponential amplification for charges with high energy and becomes catastrophic\nwhen the two horizons are very close to each together. The angular momentum of\nblack holes decreases the mean number of charges by a factor not by an order.\nWe observe a catastrophic emission of boson condensation for charges with the\neffective energy equal to the chemical potential in the spacelike outer region\nof the cosmological horizon. Further, the rotating charged Nariai black holes\ncan evolve into singular spacetimes with a naked singularity by the Schwinger\npair production.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
