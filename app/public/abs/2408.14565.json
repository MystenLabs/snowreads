It is shown\nthat low-complexity coding schemes that achieve any point in the rate-fronthaul\nregion of joint coding and compression can be constructed starting from at most\n$4(K+L)-2$ point-to-point codes designed for symmetric channels. This reduces\nthe seemingly hard task of constructing good codes for C-RAN's to the much\nbetter understood task of finding good codes for single-user channels. To show\nthis result, an equivalence between the achievable rate-fronthaul regions of\njoint coding and successive coding is established. Then, rate-splitting and\nquantization-splitting techniques are used to show that the task of achieving a\nrate-fronthaul point in the joint coding region can be simplified to that of\nachieving a corner point in a higher-dimensional C-RAN problem. As a\nby-product, some interesting properties of the rate-fronthaul region of joint\ndecoding for uplink C-RAN's are also derived.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
