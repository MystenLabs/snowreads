In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework called SDLNet- Statistical analysis with Deep\nLearning Network that identifies co-occurring objects in conjunction with base\nobjects in multilabel object categories. The pipeline of proposed work is\nimplemented in two stages: in the first stage of SDLNet we deal with multilabel\ndetectors for discovering labels, and in the second stage we perform\nco-occurrence matrix analysis. In co-occurrence matrix analysis, we learn\nco-occurrence statistics by setting base classes and frequently occurring\nclasses, following this we build association rules and generate frequent\npatterns. The crucial part of SDLNet is recognizing base classes and making\nconsideration for co-occurring classes. Finally, the generated co-occurrence\nmatrix based on frequent patterns will show base classes and their\ncorresponding co-occurring classes. SDLNet is evaluated on two publicly\navailable datasets: Pascal VOC and MS-COCO. The experimental results on these\nbenchmark datasets are reported in Sec 4.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
