Here, we derive\nexplicit analytical expressions for the amplitudes of modes of surface\ndeformation of a homogeneous, isotropic, linearly elastic sphere. The modes\nunder consideration correspond to overall changes in volume and to relative\nuniaxial elongation or contraction. Both situations of an elastic sphere\nembedded under no-slip conditions in a linearly elastic, homogeneous,\nisotropic, infinitely extended background medium and of a free-standing elastic\nsphere are considered. For example, our analytical expressions are important as\na basis for computational material optimization in the context of spherical\nsoft actuators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
