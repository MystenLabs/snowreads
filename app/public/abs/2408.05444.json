It is demonstrated that our algorithms converge to the\nunique least-norm solution of the matrix equation when it is consistent and\ntheir convergence rate is faster than that of the randomized block Kaczmarz\nmethod (ME-RBK). Moreover, the block Kaczmarz method (ME-BK) for solving the\nmatrix equation $AXB=C$ is investigated and it is found that the ME-BK method\nconverges to the solution $A^{+}CB^{+}+X^{0}-A^{+}AX^{0}BB^{+}$ when it is\nconsistent. The numerical tests verify the theoretical results and the methods\npresented in this paper are applied to the color image restoration problem to\nobtain satisfactory restored images.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
