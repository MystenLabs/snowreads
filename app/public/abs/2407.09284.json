In\nthis paper we introduce and analyse a Deep BSDE scheme for nonlinear\nintegro-PDEs with unbounded nonlocal operators -problems arising in e.g.\nstochastic control and games involving infinite activity jump-processes. The\nscheme is based on a stochastic forward-backward SDE representation of the\nsolution of the PDE and (i) approximation of small jumps by a Gaussian process,\n(ii) simulation of the forward part, and (iii) a neural net regression for the\nbackward part. Unlike grid-based schemes, it does not suffer from the curse of\ndimensionality and is therefore suitable for high dimensional problems. The\nscheme is designed to be convergent even in the infinite activity/unbounded\nnonlocal operator case. A full convergence analysis is given and constitutes\nthe main part of the paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zkQ1Q7r99SRqbC-1DIVNBa-rmqMbU4pdmT37270SN6A","pdfSize":"403765"}
