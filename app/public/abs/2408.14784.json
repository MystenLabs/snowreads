This model\ninvolves formulating mathematical equations and algorithms for the shape of a\ndeformed particle based on the geometrical as well as physical properties of\nthe particles, such as their size and elasticity. The model also accounts for\nthe conservation of energy associated with the particle shape during\ninteraction with other particles as well as with rigid walls. To verify the\naccuracy of the shape of the deformed particles, we start with a single\ndeformable particle in an overcompressed box which we compare with the\nnumerically simulated deformable polygon (DP) model. Then we extend our method\nto a jammed packing of deformable particles which we also verify through the DP\nmodel. We also provide a protocol to calculate the total force acting on such\ndeformable particles solely based on their deformation and to obtain both\nathermal jammed packings as well as packings in thermal equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
