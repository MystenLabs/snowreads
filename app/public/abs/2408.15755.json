Complex numerical schemes must be used in the analysis of the\noutput data in order to appropriately deal with the coupling between\ninterfacial and bulk fluid flows, and to separate viscous and elastic\ncontribution or the interfacial response. We present a second generation code\nfor analyzing the interfacial shear rheology experimental results of small\namplitude oscillatory measurements made with a DWR rotational rheometer. The\npackage presented here improves significantly the accuracy and applicability\nrange of the previous available software packages by implementing: i) a\nphysically motivated iterative scheme based on the probe's equation of motion,\nii) an increased user selectable spatial resolution, and iii) a second order\napproximation for the velocity gradients at the ring surfaces. Moreover, the\noptimization of the computational effort allows, in many cases, for on-the-fly\nexecution during data acquisition in real experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
