It is shown that the proposed approach provides new physical\nproperties and methods for retrieval of the signal light fields and improvement\nof the basic parameters of quantum memory. We demonstrate how the pre-created\ncoherence can enable quantum storage with low quantum noise, programmable and\non demand retrieval of signal light fields in atomic ensembles with natural\ninhomogeneous broadening. The feasibility of implementing this proposal in\nvarious crystals doped with rare earth ions, as well as in atomic gases with a\nRaman transition indicates a new way for the development of optical quantum\nmemory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rKyviGJAc4ulKVSaOeF0-PnltA-ON5kxfqUkESCP6LY","pdfSize":"469704"}
