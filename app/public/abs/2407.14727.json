In contrast, there are fewer tasks available for languages other than\nEnglish and for the financial domain. In particular, tasks in Japanese and the\nfinancial domain are limited. We construct two large datasets using materials\npublished by a Japanese central government agency. The datasets provide three\nJapanese financial NLP tasks, which include a 3-class and 12-class\nclassification for categorizing sentences, as well as a 5-class classification\ntask for sentiment analysis. Our datasets are designed to be comprehensive and\nup-to-date, leveraging an automatic update framework that ensures the latest\ntask datasets are publicly available anytime.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
