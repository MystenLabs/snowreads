As opposed to many existing control strategies, which do not\nconsider spatial constraints, the proposed strategy considers spatial\nconstraints on each degree of freedom movement of the UAV. Such consideration\nmakes the design appealing for many practical applications, such as pipeline\ninspection, boundary tracking, etc. The proposed design accounts for the\nlimited information about the inertia matrix, thereby affirming its inherent\nrobustness against unmodeled dynamics and other imperfections. We rigorously\nshow that the UAV will converge to its desired path by maintaining bounded\nposition, orientation, and linear and angular speeds. Finally, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of the proposed strategy through various numerical\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bdIGH_sRC1RU4WDiSwoPuuCl6K_jMvkB8RQRvrnsxBs","pdfSize":"4834154"}
