Results from GRBs-only,\nSNe Ia and GRBs+SNe Ia indicate that the energy is transferred from dark energy\nto dark matter and the coincidence problem is alleviated. The value of H0 from\nGRBs+SNe Ia in the IDE scenario shows agreement with the SH0ES measurement.\nConsidering the age estimate of the quasar APM 08279+5255 at z = 3.91, we find\nthat the phenomenological IDE scenario can predict a cosmic age greater than\nthat of the {\\Lambda}CDM model, thus the cosmic age problem can be alleviated.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
