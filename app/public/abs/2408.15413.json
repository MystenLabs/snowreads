In\nparticular, heuristics on the relationship between graph symmetries and the\napproximation ratio achieved by a QAOA simulation are considered. To do so, we\nfirst solve the MaxCut problem on well-known graphs, then we consider a simple\nand controllable perturbation of the graph and find again the approximate\nMaxCut with the QAOA. Through an analysis of the spectrum of the graphs and\ntheir perturbations, as well as a careful study of the associated automorphism\ngroups, we aim to extract valuable insights into how symmetry impacts the\nperformance of QAOA. These insights can then be leveraged to heuristically\nreduce the quantum circuit complexity, the number of training steps, or the\nnumber of parameters involved, thus enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness\nof QAOA-based solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
