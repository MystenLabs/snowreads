We prove this result subject to only minor conditions\nthat the sequence is ergodic and the tails of the marginals are not too heavy.\nThe second result is a central limit theorem for the persistence diagram\nevaluated on the class of all step functions; this result holds as long as a\n$\\rho$-mixing criterion is satisfied and the distributions of the partial\nmaxima do not decay too slowly. Our results greatly expand those extant in the\nliterature to allow for more fruitful use in statistical applications, beyond\nidealized settings. Examples of distributions and functions for which the limit\ntheory holds are provided throughout.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
