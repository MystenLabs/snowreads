While automotive vendors\nprioritize safety, there remains a critical need for comprehensive assessment\nand analysis of cyber risks. In this context, this paper proposes a Social\nMedia Automotive Threat Intelligence (SOCMATI) framework, specifically designed\nfor the emerging field of automotive cybersecurity. The framework leverages\nadvanced intelligence techniques and machine learning models to extract\nvaluable insights from social media. Four use cases illustrate the framework's\npotential by demonstrating how it can significantly enhance threat assessment\nprocedures within the automotive industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
