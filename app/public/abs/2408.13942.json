The\nquasi-two-body $D\\to a_0(980)^+P$ decays are governed by the external\n$W$-emission diagram in which $a_0(980)^+$ is emitted. The predicted branching\nfractions in the $q\\bar q$ model of $a_0(980)$ are too small by one to two\norders of magnitude compared to experiment as the amplitude is suppressed by\nthe smallness of the $a_0(980)^+$ decay constant, while those for $D^+\\to\na_0(980)^0 P$ and $D^0\\to a_0(980)^{-}P$ are usually too large. These\ndiscrepancies can be resolved provided that $a_0(980)$ is a tetraquark state.\nIn this case, there exist two additional $T$-like topological amplitudes,\ndenoted by $\\overline{T}$ and $\\tilde T$ which readily account for the\ndiscrepancies. An important implication of the tetraquark model is that the\n$D_s^+\\to a_0(980)^+\\pi^0+a_0(980)^0\\pi^+$ decay is not a purely\n$W$-annihilation process as in the diquark model of $a_0(980)$; it receives\ndominant contributions from $\\overline{T}$ newly noticed in this work.\nTherefore, measurements of $(D,D_s^+)\\to a_0(980)P$ decays lend strong support\nto the tetraquark picture of $a_0(980)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
