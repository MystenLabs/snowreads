We have found conditions under\nwhich this quotient structure becomes a topological ternary semigroup. We have\nalso obtained conditions that make this quotient a topological ternary group,\nwhenever the base structure is a topological ternary group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
