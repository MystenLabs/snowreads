We explore the mathematical features of this product graph,\nspecifically in terms of its spectral characteristics. We have calculated the\ncharacteristic polynomials of the adjacency, Laplacian, and signless Laplacian\nmatrices. Moreover, we investigate the conditions under which two graphs are\ncospectral regarding this product. A significant portion of our study is\ndedicated to computing the Kirchhoff index, the number of spanning trees and\nthe sequence of non-cospectral equienergetic product graphs. We also outline\nspecific criteria that determine when the product graph is integral.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MhlO7EB0YcNbD_PUxl3n1YlLFmkiR09CafkgMgdfNp8","pdfSize":"342215"}
