Previous studies have\npredominantly focused on integrating the attention mechanism into relation\nclassification at a global scale, overlooking the importance of the local\ncontext. To address this gap, this paper introduces a novel global-local\nattention mechanism for relation classification, which enhances global\nattention with a localized focus. Additionally, we propose innovative hard and\nsoft localization mechanisms to identify potential keywords for local\nattention. By incorporating both hard and soft localization strategies, our\napproach offers a more nuanced and comprehensive understanding of the\ncontextual cues that contribute to effective relation classification. Our\nexperimental results on the SemEval-2010 Task 8 dataset highlight the superior\nperformance of our method compared to previous attention-based approaches in\nrelation classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
