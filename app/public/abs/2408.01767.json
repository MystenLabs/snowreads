Good embedded spaces\nrepresent the data well to support classification and advanced techniques such\nas open-set recognition, few-short learning and explainability. This paper\npresents a compact overview of different techniques to design embedded spaces\nfor classification. It compares different loss functions and constraints on the\nnetwork parameters with respect to the achievable geometric structure of the\nembedded space. The techniques are demonstrated with two and three-dimensional\nembeddings for the MNIST, Fashion MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, allowing visual\ninspection of the embedded spaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MOJY6YZ5NGriRQy9en3HAvK2IPgcx35gzRkTq2qjpPo","pdfSize":"2871018","txDigest":"EHpESbE7wGVb6MKS4dFLHpy7NZb6cDRXcfcnAEi1baiw","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
