There is ample evidence that the holographic superconductors are\ndescribed by the standard GL theory, but the exact form of the dual GL theory\nis little known. We identify the dual GL theory for a class of bulk\n5-dimensional holographic superconductors, where numerical coefficients are\nobtained analytically.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LGWtpXsJpBxNyZPaU8pKmuRS0gG7g8esr-8rm6-UbKQ","pdfSize":"501091"}
