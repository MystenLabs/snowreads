In designing\nalgorithms, compilers, and systems, data movement is a common bottleneck in\nhigh-performance computation, in which we improve cache and memory performance.\nWe study a special type of data reuse in the form of repeated traversals, or\nre-traversals, which are based on the symmetric group. The cyclic and sawtooth\ntraces are previously known results in symmetric locality, and in this work, we\nwould like to generalize this result for any re-traversal. Then, we also\nprovide an abstract framework for applications in compiler design and machine\nlearning models to improve the memory performance of certain programs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
