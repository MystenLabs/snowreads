We initially detect\ninstance-wise keypoints with a YOLOv8s model to compute 6D pose estimates of\nknown objects by solving PnP. We use a ray tracing approach to track a\ngeometric scene graph consisting of mesh models of object instances. In\ncontrast to classical point-to-point matching, this leads to more robust\nresults, especially under occlusions between objects instances. We show that\nusing this hybrid strategy leads to robust self-localization, pre-segmentation\nof the range sensor data and accurate pose tracking of objects using the same\nenvironmental representation. All detected objects are integrated into a\nsemantic scene graph. This scene graph then serves as a front end to a semantic\nmapping framework to allow spatial reasoning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
