Our research focuses on eigenvalue behavior\nand operator recovery from spectra. We find that two spectra alone are\ninsufficient to fully recover the potentials. Additionally, we consider the\nAmbarzumian-type inverse problem for Dirac-type operators with a delay. Our\nresults have significant implications for the study of inverse problems related\nto the differential operators with a constant delay and may inform future\nresearch directions in this field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
