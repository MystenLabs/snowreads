Using the coincidence between bosonization and Lie-Poisson dynamics\non an affine U(1) group, we show that wave profiles which are periodic in time\nproduce Berry phases accumulated by the underlying fermionic field. These\nphases can be evaluated in closed form for any Hamiltonian, and they serve as a\ndiagnostic of nonlinearity. As an explicit example, we discuss the Korteweg-de\nVries equation, viewed as a model of nonlinear quantum Hall edge modes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
