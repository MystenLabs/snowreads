Our approach adapts a representation-theoretic method\noriginally due to Bryant in the context of $\\mathrm{G}_2$ geometry. We show how\nthis strategy can also be used to deduce the number of geometric flows of a\ngiven $H$-structure; we illustrate this in the $\\mathrm{G}_2$,\n$\\mathrm{Spin}(7)$ and $\\mathrm{SU}(3)$ cases. Our investigation also leads us\nto derive explicit expressions for the Ricci and self-dual Weyl curvature in\nterms of the intrinsic torsion of the underlying $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$-structure. We\ncompute the first variation formulae of all the quadratic functionals in the\ntorsion; these provide natural building blocks for $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ gradient\nflows. In particular, our results demonstrate that both the negative gradient\nflow of the Dirichlet energy of the intrinsic torsion and the Ricci harmonic\nflow are parabolic after a modified DeTurck's trick.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
