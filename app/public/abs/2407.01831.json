There are numerous models that can account\nfor various observations of GRBs in the gamma-ray and X-ray energy ranges due\nto the flexibility in the number of parameters that can be tuned to increase\nagreement with data. Furthermore, these models lack predictive power that can\ntest future spectropolarimetric observations of GRBs across the electromagnetic\nspectrum. In this work, we use the MCRaT radiative transfer code to calculate\nthe X-ray spectropolarimetric signatures expected from the photospheric model\nfor two unique hydrodynamic simulations of long GRBs. We make time-resolved and\ntime-integrated comparisons between the X-ray and gamma-ray mock observations,\nshedding light on the information that can be obtained from X-ray prompt\nemission signatures. Our results show that the $T_{90}$ derived from the X-ray\nlightcurve is the best diagnostic for the time that the central engine is\nactive. We also find that our simulations reproduce the observed\ncharacteristics of the Einstein Probe detected GRB240315C. Based on our\nsimulations, we are also able to make predictions for future X-ray\nspectropolarimetric measurements. Our results show the importance of conducting\nglobal radiative transfer calculations of GRB jets to better contextualize the\nprompt emission observations and constrain the mechanisms that produce the\nprompt emission.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nj-fEF3KS4lhaQJzlwC7MAH9hvY8OC7Hr1ckB0jkycE","pdfSize":"1203520","objectId":"0x3ec2daf4e82809d350cd02f87fba230674acd168a466343b284e0a766b84aa34","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
