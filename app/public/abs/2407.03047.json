While resilience to many types of noise\ncan be achieved through suitable control schemes, resilience to amplitude noise\nseems to be elusive within the common harmonic approximation for the bus mode\nof trapped ions. We show that weak an-harmonicities admit control schemes that\nachieve amplitude noise-resilience consistent with state-of-the-art\nexperimental requirements, and that the required an-harmonicities can be\nachieved with current standards of micro-structured traps or even the\nintrinsically an-harmonic Coulomb interaction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
