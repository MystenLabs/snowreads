We use the software to explore sensors designed to enhance performance\nin high dynamic range (HDR) environments, such as driving through daytime\ntunnels and under nighttime conditions. We synthesize physically realistic HDR\nspectral radiance images and use them as the input to digital twins that model\nthe optics and sensors of different systems. This paper makes three main\ncontributions: (a) We create a labeled (instance segmentation and depth),\nsynthetic radiance dataset of HDR driving scenes. (b) We describe the\ndevelopment and validation of the end-to-end simulation framework. (c) We\npresent a comparative analysis of two single-shot sensors designed for HDR. We\nopen-source both the dataset and the software.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
