In this paper, we present Make-An-Agent, a novel policy\nparameter generator that leverages the power of conditional diffusion models\nfor behavior-to-policy generation. Guided by behavior embeddings that encode\ntrajectory information, our policy generator synthesizes latent parameter\nrepresentations, which can then be decoded into policy networks. Trained on\npolicy network checkpoints and their corresponding trajectories, our generation\nmodel demonstrates remarkable versatility and scalability on multiple tasks and\nhas a strong generalization ability on unseen tasks to output well-performed\npolicies with only few-shot demonstrations as inputs. We showcase its efficacy\nand efficiency on various domains and tasks, including varying objectives,\nbehaviors, and even across different robot manipulators. Beyond simulation, we\ndirectly deploy policies generated by Make-An-Agent onto real-world robots on\nlocomotion tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
