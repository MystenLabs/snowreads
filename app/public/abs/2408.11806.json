We show that the simplicial ratio\ncaptures the frequency, as well as the rarity, of simplicial interactions in a\nhypergraph while the simplicial matrix provides more fine-grained details. We\nthen compute the simplicial ratio, as well as the simplicial matrix, for 10\nreal-world hypergraphs and, from the data collected, hypothesize that\nsimplicial interactions are more and more deliberate as edge size increases. We\nthen present a new Chung-Lu model that includes a parameter controlling (in\nexpectation) the frequency of simplicial interactions. We use this new model,\nas well as the real-world hypergraphs, to show that multiple stochastic\nprocesses exhibit different behaviour when performed on simplicial hypergraphs\nvs. non-simplicial hypergraphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6KDTXitkJQGKM5xOiGQ6nFdIsPIWORe9CSVG74dQVaE","pdfSize":"1616655"}
