The proposed\napproach integrates coarsening in both approximation order ($p$) and mesh\nresolution ($h$), to address the computational and memory efficiency challenges\nthat are often encountered in conventional high-order numerical simulations.\nOur numerical results reveal that $ph$MG offers significant improvements over\ntraditional spatial-coarsening-only multigrid ($h$MG) techniques for problems\ndiscretized with Taylor-Hood elements across a variety of problem sizes and\ndiscretization orders. In particular, the $ph$MG method exhibits superior\nperformance in reducing setup and solve times, particularly when dealing with\nhigher discretization orders and unstructured problem domains. For\nScott-Vogelius discretizations, while monolithic $ph$MG delivers low iteration\ncounts and competitive solve phase timings, it exhibits a discernibly slower\nsetup phase when compared to a multilevel (non-monolithic)\nfull-block-factorization (FBF) preconditioner where $ph$MG is employed only for\nthe velocity unknowns. This is primarily due to the setup costs of the larger\nmixed-field relaxation patches with monolithic $ph$MG versus the patch setup\ncosts with a single unknown type for FBF.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
