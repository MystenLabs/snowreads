Due to angular momentum\nexchange, dynamical coupling is stronger when the orbital and rotational\nangular momenta are closer in magnitudes. Thus, the spin-orbit coupling effects\nare significantly different for ellipsoidal secondaries and primaries. In the\npresent work, a high-order Hamiltonian model in terms of eccentricity is\nformulated to study the effects of spin-orbit coupling for the case of\nellipsoidal primary body in a binary asteroid system. Our results show that the\nspin-orbit coupling problem for the ellipsoidal primary holds two kinds of spin\nequilibrium, while there is only one for the ellipsoidal secondary. In\nparticular, 1:1 and 2:3 spin-orbit resonances are further studied by taking\nboth the classical pendulum approximation as well as adiabatic approximation\n(Wisdom's perturbative treatment). It shows that there is a critical value of\ntotal angular momentum, around which the pendulum approximation fails to work.\nDynamical structures are totally different when the total angular momentum is\non two sides of the critical value.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
