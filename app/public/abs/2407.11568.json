Until now, various\nmeasures, operational interpretations and generalizations about coherence have\nbeen proposed. However, it is still not clear about the role coherence playing\nin quantum dynamics. In this work, in terms of unitary evolutions, the effect\nof coherence is fully exhibited. Firstly, by introducing the new concept,\naverage quantum distance, we show that for time-independent Hamiltonians,\nquantum coherence is the average evolution speed and vice versa. Secondly,\nbeyond this average setting, for general cases, we show that how coherence and\nHamiltonians' eigenvalues determine the instantaneous evolution speed together,\nwhere their trade-off is actually the energy uncertainty. Our results\ndefinitely clarify the role coherence playing in quantum systems' dynamics,\ncorrelating quantum resources with quantum dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Flpc8owvqdc9dz6bFVPYTTaz4lYpMDI1SO-coL1wIOE","pdfSize":"242325"}
