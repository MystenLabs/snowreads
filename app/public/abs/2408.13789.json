As a proof of concept,\nwe showcase efficient resonant ablation and microstructure fabrication on\nenamel at the hydroxyapatite resonant wavelength of 9.5 {\\mu}m, with a laser\nintensity two orders-of-magnitude lower than that required by non-resonant\nfemtosecond lasers, which could foster more precision surgical applications\nwith superior biosafety.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dHsnbb3FJ87GAbHbm5iU4HT7oJNhzs9OLJ8SDabW0Os","pdfSize":"1311704"}
