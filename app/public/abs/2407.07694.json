However, many existing approaches to qubit control\nsuffer from a scale-performance trade-off, impeding progress towards the\ncreation of useful devices. Here, we present a vision for an electronically\ncontrolled trapped-ion quantum computer that alleviates this bottleneck. Our\narchitecture utilizes shared current-carrying traces and local tuning\nelectrodes in a microfabricated chip to perform quantum gates with low noise\nand crosstalk regardless of device size. To verify our approach, we\nexperimentally demonstrate low-noise site-selective single- and two-qubit gates\nin a seven-zone ion trap that can control up to 10 qubits. We implement\nelectronic single-qubit gates with 99.99916(7)% fidelity, and demonstrate\nconsistent performance with low crosstalk across the device. We also\nelectronically generate two-qubit maximally entangled states with 99.97(1)%\nfidelity and long-term stable performance over continuous system operation.\nThese state-of-the-art results validate the path to directly scaling these\ntechniques to large-scale quantum computers based on electronically controlled\ntrapped-ion qubits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
