It provides a primitive storage element, namely\na quantum S-R flip-flop design using quantum CNOT and SWAP gates that can be\nreplicated to obtain a quantum register for any given number of qubits. The\naforementioned quantum buffers are then obtained using the simplified QPN model\nand quantum registers. $\\!\\!$The quantum S-R flip-flop and quantum buffer\ndesigns have been tested using OpenQASM and Qiskit on IBM quantum computers and\nsimulators and the results validate the presented quantum S-R flip-flop and\nbuffer designs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
