Palle (see Phys. Rev. B 110, 026501 (2024), arXiv:2404.02918)\nargued that our Ward-Takahashi identities failed to include some important\nadditional terms and thus are incorrect. We agree that our Ward-Takahashi\nidentities have ignored some potentially important contributions and here give\nsome remarks on the role played by the additional terms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
