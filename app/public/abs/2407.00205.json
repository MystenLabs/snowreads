This review highlights two types of SGWB: those\ngenerated by scalar curvature perturbations associated with PBH formation in\nthe early Universe and those composed of ensembles of GWs emitted by PBH\nbinaries. After describing detection methods and a brief introduction on\nBayesian inference, we discuss current constraints imposed by LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA\n(LVK) observations through the non-detection of the SGWBs and discuss their\nphysical implications.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
