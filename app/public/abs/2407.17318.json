We note that the hidden-charm pentaquark states,\n$P_{\\psi}^{N}(4312)$, $P_{\\psi}^{N}(4440)$, and $P_{\\psi}^{N}(4457)$, have only\nbeen observed in the $J/\\psi p$ channel. In this work, we employ the effective\nLagrangian approach to systematically investigate the two-body and three-body\ndecays of the heavy quark spin symmetry multiplet of hadronic molecules\n$\\bar{D}^{(*)}\\Sigma_c^{(*)}$. Our results show that the partial decay widths\nof the hidden-charm pentaquark molecules into $\\bar{D}^{(*)}\\Lambda_c \\pi$ are\nsizable so that $\\bar{D}^{(*)}\\Lambda_c \\pi$ are promising channels to search\nfor them, which can help clarify their molecular nature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
