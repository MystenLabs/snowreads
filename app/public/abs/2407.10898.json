This paper is a first-of-its-kind application\nof SVD entanglement entropy to a system of chiral Dirac oscillators which prove\nto be natural to study the SVD formalism because the two chiral oscillator\nground states can be taken as the pre-selected and post-selected states. We\nargue how this alternative for entanglement entropy is better and more\nintuitive than the von Neumann one to study quantum phase transition. We also\nprovide as an illustrative example, a new generalized proof of the SVD\nentanglement entropy being $\\log2$ for a pair of Bell states that differ from\neach other by relative phases.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OnwR_llRmIxdGNl0R71uMz6r-zVrrjBEtHpN9w0aHIU","pdfSize":"726389"}
