The purpose of this paper is to\ngive a relationship between NcHO and 2pQRM, and the fiber decomposition of NcHO\nby 2pQRM is shown. We also construct Feynman-Kac formulas of NcHO and 2pQRM.\nThen asymptotic behaviors of the spectral zeta function of 2pQRM is considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CyQ-87HuXas9pXsOdzwYL_BshwX5hnWfqzrP4sIjf8s","pdfSize":"405224"}
