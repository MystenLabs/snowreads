Following\nrecent comparison principles, we work in a framework in which we consider a\nsubsolution and a supersolution for two equations in terms of two Hamiltonians\nthat can be seen as an upper and lower bound of our original Hamiltonian\nrespectively. The upper and lower bound are formulated in terms of a relaxed\nLyapunov function which allows us to restrict part of the analysis to compact\nsets and to work with almost optimizers of the considered control problems. For\nthis reason, we can relax assumptions on the control problem: most notably, we\ndo not need completeness of set of controlled paths. Moreover, our strategy\navoids a-priori analysis on the regularity of the candidate solutions. We then\nexplore the context of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman and Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs\nequations to verify our assumptions in a convex and non-convex setting\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
