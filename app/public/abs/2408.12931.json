{"id":"2408.12931","title":"Exponent-Strings and Their Edit Distance","authors":"Ingyu Baek","authorsParsed":[["Baek","Ingyu",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 23 Aug 2024 09:22:36 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-26","timestamp":1724404956000,"abstract":"  An exponent-string is an extension of traditional strings that can\nincorporate real-numbered exponents, indicating the quantity of characters.\nThis novel representation overcomes the limitations of traditional discrete\nstring by enabling precise data representation for applications such as\nphonetic transcription that contains sound duration.\n  Although applications of exponent-string are focused on exponent-string with\nreal-numbered exponents, formal definition uses arbitrary semigroup. For any\nsemigroup $S$, $S$-exponent-strings are allowed to have elements of $S$ as\nexponents. We investigate algebraic properties of $S$-exponent-strings and\nfurther justify $\\mathbb{R}^+$-exponent-string is a natural extension of the\nstring.\n  Motivated by the problem of calculating the similarity between spoken phone\nsequence and correct phone sequence, we develop exp-edit distance -- a\nspecialized metric designed to measure the similarity between\n$\\mathbb{R}^+$-exponent-strings. By extending the traditional string edit\ndistance to handle continuous values, exp-edit distance deals with\n$\\mathbb{R}^+$-exponent-strings that embody both discrete and continuous\nproperties. Our exploration includes a rigorous mathematical formulation of\nexp-edit distance and an algorithm to compute it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
