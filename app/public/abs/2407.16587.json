To simplify our analysis we consider a particular\nconfiguration in which the boost is aligned with the black hole angular\nmomentum. The boosted Kerr-Newman black hole is obtained considering the\ncomplete asymptotic Lorentz transformations of Robinson-Trautman coordinates to\nBondi-Sachs, including the perturbation term of the boosted Robinson-Trautman\nmetric. To verify that the final form of the metric is indeed a solution of\nEinstein field equations, we evaluate the corresponding energy-momentum tensor\nthe boosted Kerr-Newman solution. To this end, we consider the electromagnetic\nenergy-momentum tensor built with the Kerr boosted metric together with its\ntimelike killing vector. We show that the Papapetrou field thus obtained\nengender an energy-momentum tensor which satisfies Einstein field equations up\nto 4th order for the Kerr-Newman metric. To proceed, we examine the causal\nstructure of the boosted Kerr-Newman black hole in Bondi-Sachs coordinates as\nin a preferred timelike foliation. We show that the ultimate effect of a\nnonvanishing charge is to shrink the overall size of the event horizon and\nergosphere areas when compared to the neutral boosted Kerr black holes.\nConsidering the preferred timelike foliation we obtain the electromagnetic\nfields for a proper nonrotating frame of reference. We show that while the\nelectric field displays a pure radial behaviour, the magnetic counterpart\ndevelops an involved structure with two intense lobes of the magnetic field\nobserved in the direction opposite to the boost.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
