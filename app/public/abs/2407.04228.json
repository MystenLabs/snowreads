A conjecture of\nVenkatesh describes the structure of the contribution of $\\Pi$ to the homology\nof the locally symmetric spaces associated to $\\mathbf{G}$. We investigate this\nconjecture in the setting of $p$-adic homology with $p$ a totally split prime.\nAlong the way, we elaborate on the relations between Venkatesh's conjecture and\ncompleted homology, the Taylor-Wiles method and the $p$-adic local Langlands\ncorrespondence. Our main result is a `big $R=T$' theorem in characteristic 0,\nfrom which we deduce a variant of the $p$-adic realisation of Venkatesh's\nconjecture, conditional on various natural conjectures and technical\nassumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
