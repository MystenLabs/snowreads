We establish\ncharacterizations of these function spaces by the $phi$-transform, the atomic\nand molecular decomposition and the wavelet decomposition. As applications we\nprove boundedness of Caldeon-Zygmund operators and the pseudo-differential\noperators on the function spaces. Moreover, we give characterizations via\noscillations and differences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
