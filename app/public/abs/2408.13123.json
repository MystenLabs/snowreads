Despite\nadvancements, existing methods often fail to provide reliable predictions,\nlargely due to the uncertainty of missing views and the inconsistent quality of\nimputed data. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel framework called\nEvidential Deep Partial Multi-View Classification (EDP-MVC). Initially, we use\nK-means imputation to address missing views, creating a complete set of\nmulti-view data. However, the potential conflicts and uncertainties within this\nimputed data can affect the reliability of downstream inferences. To manage\nthis, we introduce a Conflict-Aware Evidential Fusion Network (CAEFN), which\ndynamically adjusts based on the reliability of the evidence, ensuring\ntrustworthy discount fusion and producing reliable inference outcomes.\nComprehensive experiments on various benchmark datasets reveal EDP-MVC not only\nmatches but often surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
