To this end,\nwe have used a combination of molecular dynamics simulation and the continuous\nversion of the square-well (CSW) intermolecular potential recently proposed by\nZer\\'on et al. [Mol. Phys. 116, 3355 (2018)]. In addition to that, we have also\ndetermined a number of equilibrium properties, including internal energy,\ncompressibility factor, radial distribution function, and coordination number.\nAll properties are evaluated in a wide range of temperatures and densities,\nincluding subcritical and supercritical thermodynamic conditions. Results\nobtained in this work show an excellent agreement with available data reported\nin the literature and demonstrate that the CSW intermolecular potential can be\nused in molecular dynamics simulations to emulate SW transport properties with\nconfidence.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N7eEep4aurA9wJ4OCwQqJdLYMtQlKZqXBSSEpO3r2Pc","pdfSize":"325310"}
