Thus, in this work, we provide a\ntheoretical analysis to guide the optimization of clustering via distribution\nlearning. To achieve better results, we embed deep clustering guided by a\ntheoretical analysis. Furthermore, the distribution learning method cannot\nalways be directly applied to data. To overcome this issue, we introduce a\nclustering-oriented distribution learning method called Monte-Carlo\nMarginalization for Clustering. We integrate Monte-Carlo Marginalization for\nClustering into Deep Clustering, resulting in Deep Clustering via Distribution\nLearning (DCDL). Eventually, the proposed DCDL achieves promising results\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods on popular datasets. Considering a\nclustering task, the new distribution learning method outperforms previous\nmethods as well.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5mcsq2hMOMbaCkHN9M7rzyQUooQIiHGb9oT6OZBbUD0","pdfSize":"4140819"}
