Under the non-trivial mean condition on the\ninitial data $w_1$, the unknowns $w$ and $\\psi$ grow polynomially with the\noptimal rates $t^{3/4}$ and $t^{1/4}$, respectively, as large time.\nFurthermore, asymptotic profiles of them are introduced by the diffusion plate\nfunction, which explains a hidden cancellation mechanism in the shear stress\n$\\partial_x w-\\psi$. As an application of our results, we study the semilinear\ndissipative Timoshenko system with a power nonlinearity. Precisely, if the\npower is greater than the Fujita exponent, then the global in time existence of\nSobolev solution is proved for the case of equal wave speeds, which partly\ngives a positive answer to the open problem in Racke-Said-Houari (2013).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
