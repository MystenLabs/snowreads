A developed approach for\nidentifying bottlenecks in manufacturing simulations, for which the application\nof quantum computing potentially provides a speed-up or increase in accuracy,\nis presented. Moreover, indicators of quantum computing suitability and\nfeasibility are defined with the main objective of identifying whether a\nmanufacturing simulation bottleneck is suitable for quantum computing\napplications. First results of testing a hybrid routine as an application\napproach for the milling dynamics simulation on quantum machines are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
