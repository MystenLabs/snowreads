This work uses the composite operator formalism to\nexamine two-orbital strongly correlated Hubbard models. We observe the\nspontaneous breaking of orbital symmetry, where the electron density in one of\nthe orbitals reaches half-filling, resulting in an orbitally selective Mott\nphase (OSMP). This broken symmetry phase becomes unstable at a critical average\nelectronic density away from half-filling. Furthermore, significant orbital\ndifferentiation persists up to a moderate inter-orbital hopping, beyond which\nthe system abruptly transitions to an orbitally uniform phase. In the OSMP\nphase, the electrons in the two orbitals are weakly hybridized, resulting in a\nsmall Fermi surface. The volume of the Fermi surface jumps at the transition\nfrom the OSMP to the orbitally uniform phase. We also discuss the physical\nmechanisms leading to the collapse of the OSMP phase under different\nperturbations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"so8ZlV7aP2wIAyVD91OliTCGfoiP8vHXFnUtADPFkaY","pdfSize":"1121162"}
