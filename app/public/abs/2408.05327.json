To do so, we cast the problem in a quantum\nwires framework, which is a dimensional deconstruction framework that allows us\nto study the (2+1) dimensional spin liquids phase from a series of coupled\n(1+1) dimensional theories. The lower dimension grants us the ability to\nperform a bosonization procedure, which yields two different partition\nfunctions connected by a strong-weak duality transformation. This bosonization\nprocedure is illuminating in that it makes the fixed point structure of the\nmodel unequivocal. Then, we proceed by studying the RG flow through the $ \\beta\n$-functions, which we use to determine the phase structure. We find that the\nquantum spin liquid phase is realized and stable in the deep IR limit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
