In\nrearrangement tasks, it is crucial to detect the objects that need to be\nrearranged according to the goal and current states. In this study, we focus on\nRearrangement Target Detection (RTD), where the model generates a change mask\nfor objects that should be rearranged. Although many studies have been\nconducted in the field of Scene Change Detection (SCD), most SCD methods often\nfail to segment objects with complex shapes and fail to detect the change in\nthe angle of objects that can be opened or closed. In this study, we propose a\nCo-Scale Cross-Attentional Transformer for RTD. We introduce the Serial Encoder\nwhich consists of a sequence of serial blocks and the Cross-Attentional Encoder\nwhich models the relationship between the goal and current states. We built a\nnew dataset consisting of RGB images and change masks regarding the goal and\ncurrent states. We validated our method on the dataset and the results\ndemonstrated that our method outperformed baseline methods on $F_1$-score and\nmean IoU.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
