The DOME recommendations aim to enhance the validation and\nreproducibility of ML research by establishing standards for key aspects such\nas data handling and processing, optimization, evaluation, and model\ninterpretability. The recommendations help to ensure that key details are\nreported transparently by providing a structured set of questions. Here, we\nintroduce the DOME Registry (URL: registry.dome-ml.org), a database that allows\nscientists to manage and access comprehensive DOME-related information on\npublished ML studies. The registry uses external resources like ORCID, APICURON\nand the Data Stewardship Wizard to streamline the annotation process and ensure\ncomprehensive documentation. By assigning unique identifiers and DOME scores to\npublications, the registry fosters a standardized evaluation of ML methods.\nFuture plans include continuing to grow the registry through community\ncuration, improving the DOME score definition and encouraging publishers to\nadopt DOME standards, promoting transparency and reproducibility of ML in the\nlife sciences.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
