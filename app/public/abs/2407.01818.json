{"id":"2407.01818","title":"Predicting public market behavior from private equity deals","authors":"Paolo Barucca and Flaviano Morone","authorsParsed":[["Barucca","Paolo",""],["Morone","Flaviano",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 1 Jul 2024 21:35:40 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-03","timestamp":1719869740000,"abstract":"  We process private equity transactions to predict public market behavior with\na logit model. Specifically, we estimate our model to predict quarterly returns\nfor both the broad market and for individual sectors. Our hypothesis is that\nprivate equity investments (in aggregate) carry predictive signal about\npublicly traded securities. The key source of such predictive signal is the\nfact that, during their diligence process, private equity fund managers are\nprivy to valuable company information that may not yet be reflected in the\npublic markets at the time of their investment. Thus, we posit that we can\ndiscover investors' collective near-term insight via detailed analysis of the\ntiming and nature of the deals they execute. We evaluate the accuracy of the\nestimated model by applying it to test data where we know the correct output\nvalue. Remarkably, our model performs consistently better than a null model\nsimply based on return statistics, while showing a predictive accuracy of up to\n70% in sectors such as Consumer Services, Communications, and Non Energy\nMinerals.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
