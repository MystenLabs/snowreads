With this analysis I\nshow that, while the number of papers is increasing overall and within the\nvisualization field, we still have to improve quite a bit to escape the\nreplication crisis. I base my analysis on the data published by the GRSI as\nwell as publication data for the different venues in visualization and lists of\njournal papers that have been presented at visualization-focused conferences. I\nalso analyze the differences between the involved journals as well as the\npercentage of reproducible papers in the different presentation venues.\nFurthermore, I look at the authors of the publications and, in particular,\ntheir affiliation countries to see where most reproducible papers come from.\nFinally, I discuss potential reasons for the low reproducibility numbers and\nsuggest possible ways to overcome these obstacles.
