It is known that every hypergraph with $n$ vertices admits a\n$(1 \\pm \\epsilon)$-sparsifier with $\\tilde{O}(n/\\epsilon^2)$ hyperedges. In\nthis work, we explore the task of building such a sparsifier by using only\nlinear measurements (a \\emph{linear sketch}) over the hyperedges of $G$, and\nprovide nearly-matching upper and lower bounds for this task.\n  Specifically, we show that there is a randomized linear sketch of size\n$\\widetilde{O}(n r \\log(m) / \\epsilon^2)$ bits which with high probability\ncontains sufficient information to recover a $(1 \\pm \\epsilon)$ cut-sparsifier\nwith $\\tilde{O}(n/\\epsilon^2)$ hyperedges for any hypergraph with at most $m$\nedges each of which has arity bounded by $r$. This immediately gives a dynamic\nstreaming algorithm for hypergraph cut sparsification with an identical space\ncomplexity, improving on the previous best known bound of $\\widetilde{O}(n r^2\n\\log^4(m) / \\epsilon^2)$ bits of space (Guha, McGregor, and Tench, PODS 2015).\nWe complement our algorithmic result above with a nearly-matching lower bound.\nWe show that for every $\\epsilon \\in (0,1)$, one needs $\\Omega(nr \\log(m/n) /\n\\log(n))$ bits to construct a $(1 \\pm \\epsilon)$-sparsifier via linear\nsketching, thus showing that our linear sketch achieves an optimal dependence\non both $r$ and $\\log(m)$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
