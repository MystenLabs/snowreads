The proposed control law is\nbased on the constructions of control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control\nbarrier functions (CBFs) for cascaded systems. To address nonholonomicity, we\ndesign the nominal controller that guarantees global asymptotic stability and\nlocal exponential stability for the closed-loop system in polar coordinates and\nconstruct a strict Lyapunov function valid on any compact sets. Furthermore, we\npresent a procedure for constructing CBFs for cascaded systems, utilizing the\nCBF of the kinematic model through integrator backstepping. Quadratic\nprogramming is employed to combine CLFs and CBFs to integrate both stability\nand safety in the closed loop. The proposed control law is time-invariant,\ncontinuous along trajectories, and easy to implement. Our main results\nguarantee both safety and local asymptotic stability for the closed-loop\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
