Better acquisition policies can\nreduce costs while maintaining or even improving the performance of downstream\npredictors. Inspired by the maximization of conditional mutual information, we\npropose an approach to train acquirers end-to-end using only the downstream\nloss. We show that our method outperforms random acquisition policy, matches a\nmodel with an unrestrained budget, but does not yet overtake a static\nacquisition strategy. We highlight the assumptions and outline avenues for\nfuture work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
