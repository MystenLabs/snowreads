We present numerical simulations\nof a scalar model for DST fluids in a planar simple shear using the Smoothed\nParticle Hydrodynamics (SPH) approach. The model reproduces the spatially\nhomogeneous instability mechanism based on the competition between the inertial\nand microstructural timescales, with good congruence to the theoretical\npredictions. Spatial inhomogeneities arising from a stress-splitting\ninstability are rationalised within the context of local components of the\nmicrostructure evolution. Using this effect, the addition of non-locality in\nthe model is found to produce an alternative mechanism of temporal\ninstabilities, driven by the inhomogeneous pattern formation. The reported\narrangement of the microstructure is generally in agreement with the\nexperimental data on gradient pattern formation in DST. Simulations in a\nparameter space representative of realistic DST materials resulted in aperiodic\noscillations in measured shear rate and stress, driven by formation of\ngap-spanning frictional structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZjhXlwCWRYfVop_MyPPzQw6iw-JA1o0wN2VBb6o6--k","pdfSize":"4744010"}
