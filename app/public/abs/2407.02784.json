However, such high-amplitude cats\nhave not been prepared due to the limitations rooted in the existing method.\nHere, we demonstrate a principle that a large SC-like state can be generated by\nthe superposition of two kittens in which two nearby coherent states interfere\nand grow to an enlarged coherent-like state. Further, we propose a scheme to\nbreed the cat beyond the limitation in the former works with a high probability\nby realizing the superposition of two SCs in coupled waveguides. The principle\nand scheme demonstrated here provide a new perspective on understanding quantum\nsuperposition in phase space and a better solution for the efficient generation\nof SCs on chips.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
