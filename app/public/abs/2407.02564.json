Of particular importance is a class called Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS)\ncodes, which includes many important examples such as toric codes, color codes,\nand fractons. Recent studies have revealed that the decoding transition for\nthese QECCs could be intrinsically captured by calculating\ninformation-theoretic quantities from the mixed state. Here we perform a simple\nanalytic calculation of the coherent information for general CSS codes under\nlocal incoherent Pauli errors via diagonalization of the density matrices and\nmapping to classical statistical mechanical (SM) models. Our result establishes\na rigorous connection between the decoding transition of the quantum code and\nthe phase transition in the random classical SM model. It is also directly\nconfirmed for CSS codes that exact error correction is possible if and only if\nthe maximum-likelihood (ML) decoder always succeeds in the asymptotic limit.\nThus, the fundamental threshold is saturated by the optimal decoder.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q7K6ihqV37H2bp7KsfPA0HzMFWpwOPnPM4tDLzsWZkE","pdfSize":"1730946"}
