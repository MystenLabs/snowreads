Overall, counterpoise corrections to post-CCSD(T) contributions are\nabout two orders of magnitude less important than those to the CCSD(T)\ninteraction energy. Counterpoise corrections for connected quadruple\nsubstitutions (Q) are negligible, and $(Q)_\\Lambda - (Q)$ or $T_4 - (Q)$\nespecially so. In contrast, for atomization energies, the $T_3-(T)$ CP\ncorrection can reach about 0.05 \\kcalmol~for small basis sets like cc-pVDZ,\nthought it rapidly tapers off with cc-pVTZ and especially aug-cc-pVTZ basis\nsets. It is reduced to insignificance by the extrapolation of $T_3-(T)$ applied\nin both W4 and HEAT thermochemistry protocols.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
