These sequences have nice mathematical structures and good\nrandomness properties that are favorable in practical applications. During the\npast five decades, the crosscorrelation between m-sequences of the same period\nhas been intensively studied, and a particular research focus has been on\ninvestigating the cross-correlation spectra with few possibles values. In this\nchapter we summarize all known results on this topic in the literature and\npromote several open problems for future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
