Reverse annealing can potentially generate better solutions but\nnecessitates an appropriate initial state. Ways to find such states are\ngenerally unknown or highly problem dependent, offer limited success, and\nseverely restrict the scope of reverse annealing. We use a general method that\nimproves the overall solution quality and quantity by feeding reverse annealing\nwith low-quality solutions obtained from forward annealing. An experimental\ndemonstration of solving the graph coloring problem using the D-Wave quantum\nannealers shows that our method is able to convert invalid solutions obtained\nfrom forward annealing to at least one valid solution obtained after assisted\nreverse annealing for $57\\%$ of $459$ random Erd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi graphs. Our\nmethod significantly outperforms random initial states, obtains more unique\nsolutions on average, and widens the applicability of reverse annealing.\nAlthough the average number of valid solutions obtained drops exponentially\nwith the problem size, a scaling analysis for the graph coloring problem shows\nthat our method effectively extends the computational reach of conventional\nforward annealing using reverse annealing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
