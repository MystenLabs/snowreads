That is,\nfor any geodesic in the Thurston metric and any subsurface R of S, we find an\ninterval of times where the length of the boundary of R is uniformly bounded\nand the restriction of the geodesic to the subsurface R resembles a geodesic in\nthe Teichmuller space of R. In particular, the set of short curves in R during\nthe active interval represents a reparametrized quasi-geodesic in the curve\ngraph of R (no backtracking) and the amount of movement in the curve graph of R\noutside of the active interval is uniformly bounded which justifies the name\nactive interval. These intervals provide an analogue of the active intervals\nintroduced by the third author in the setting of Teichmuller space equipped\nwith the Teichmuller metric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
