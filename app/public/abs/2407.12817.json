In this paper, we propose a non-autoregressive speech error\ncorrection method. A Confidence Module measures the uncertainty of each word of\nthe N-best ASR hypotheses as the reference to find the wrong word position.\nBesides, the acoustic feature from the ASR encoder is also used to provide the\ncorrect pronunciation references. N-best candidates from ASR are aligned using\nthe edit path, to confirm each other and recover some missing character errors.\nFurthermore, the cross-attention mechanism fuses the information between error\ncorrection references and the ASR hypothesis. The experimental results show\nthat both the acoustic and confidence references help with error correction.\nThe proposed system reduces the error rate by 21% compared with the ASR model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MXzs2AkBpLfkPArEhI4k2M9pQwzNED4MtAFSG8kKGkA","pdfSize":"356865"}
