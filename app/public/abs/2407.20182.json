Here, we study this system at the\ncommensurate filling of $\\nu_{\\rm tot}=2$. Our focus is on the $1+1$ filling\nsetting of $\\nu_{\\rm Mo} =\\nu_{\\rm W}=1$, which enables a Kondo lattice\ndescription. We find a Kondo semimetal due to the sizable intra-orbital hopping\namong the electrons in the $\\rm{MoTe_2}$ layer. The Kondo-driven (emergent)\nflat band is naturally pinned to the Fermi energy. When combined with the\ninherent topology of the electronic structure, a topological Kondo semimetal\nphase ensues. We calculate the valley Hall response and, due to the breaking of\ninversion symmetry, also identify a spontaneous Hall effect. There is a Berry\ncurvature dodecapole, which leads to a fourth-order spontaneous Hall effect in\nthe perturbative regime of the electric field that is further amplified in the\nnon-perturbative regime. As such, the system provides a tunable setting to\nsimulate topological Kondo semimetals. Finally, we discuss the pathways that\nconnect the physics realized here to the Weyl Kondo semimetals and their\nproximate phases that have been advanced in recent years in topological Kondo\nlattice models and materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
