Motivated by\nthe theory of group representations, we decompose the layers of an equivariant\nneural network into simple representations. The nonlinear activation functions\nlead to interesting nonlinear equivariant maps between simple representations.\nFor example, the rectified linear unit (ReLU) gives rise to piecewise linear\nmaps. We show that these considerations lead to a filtration of equivariant\nneural networks, generalizing Fourier series. This observation might provide a\nuseful tool for interpreting equivariant neural networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
