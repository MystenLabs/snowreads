Previous EA methods mainly focus on aligning a pair of KGs, and to the\nbest of our knowledge, no existing EA method considers aligning multiple (more\nthan two) KGs. To fill this research gap, in this work, we study a novel\nproblem of aligning multiple KGs and propose an effective framework named\nMultiEA to solve the problem. First, we embed the entities of all the candidate\nKGs into a common feature space by a shared KG encoder. Then, we explore three\nalignment strategies to minimize the distances among pre-aligned entities. In\nparticular, we propose an innovative inference enhancement technique to improve\nthe alignment performance by incorporating high-order similarities. Finally, to\nverify the effectiveness of MultiEA, we construct two new real-world benchmark\ndatasets and conduct extensive experiments on them. The results show that our\nMultiEA can effectively and efficiently align multiple KGs in a single pass.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
