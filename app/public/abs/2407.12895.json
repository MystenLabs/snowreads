The paper gives a systematic overview of UATs starting from the\npreliminary results on function approximation, such as Taylor's theorem,\nFourier's theorem, Weierstrass approximation theorem, Kolmogorov - Arnold\nrepresentation theorem, etc. Theoretical and numerical aspects of UATs are\ncovered from both arbitrary width and depth.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HJGDOvtgOSpE0FtQInHw8rNntFyGvCFakxEQp5AuAtY","pdfSize":"436502"}
