I demonstrate that tensors provide a\ngeneral framework to discuss magnetic symmetry using both spin groups and\nmagnetic point groups, which have often been contrasted in recent literature. I\nalso provide a natural classification of altermagnets in terms of the\nlowest-order tensorial forms that are permitted in each of the 69 altermagnetic\npoint groups. This approach clarifies the connection between altermagnetism and\nwell-known bulk properties, establishing that the vast majority of\naltermagnetic materials must also be piezomagnetic and MOKE-active, and\nprovides a rational criterion to search for potential altermagnets among known\nmaterials and to test them when the magnetic structure is unknown or ambiguous.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GDVtv6PIgK_GcaoV1qk_5amnF8UxxenfnBuXM0M9EVA","pdfSize":"13252043","objectId":"0x7cc8d863b61e5dd11cc3cb9e929a722735d2f60f03534080b919672d538036a7","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
