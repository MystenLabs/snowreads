This article presents the potential of SEM-COM to transform\nVehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communications, with a particular emphasis on its\nability to enhance communication efficiency and intelligence. We discuss the\ncore components and metrics that characterize SEM-COM, providing insights into\nits operational framework within the context of V2X communications. We\nillustrate the applicability and practicality of SEM-COM through real-world\nvehicular use cases, demonstrate the potential of SEM-COM to enhance aspects of\nintelligent mobility, such as communication efficiency and decision-making.\nFinally, the article identifies key open research questions for SEM-COM V2X,\npointing to areas that require further exploration and thus setting a\nfoundation for future work in this evolving domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
