This is a pivotal task for conversational\nanalysis, given the ubiquity and challenges of politeness in interactions. The\ncomputational approach to politeness has witnessed great interest from the\nconversational analysis community. This article is a compilation of past works\nin computational politeness in natural language processing. We view four\nmilestones in the research so far, viz. supervised and weakly-supervised\nfeature extraction to identify and induce politeness in a given text,\nincorporation of context beyond the target text, study of politeness across\ndifferent social factors, and study the relationship between politeness and\nvarious sociolinguistic cues. In this article, we describe the datasets,\napproaches, trends, and issues in computational politeness research. We also\ndiscuss representative performance values and provide pointers to future works,\nas given in the prior works. In terms of resources to understand the\nstate-of-the-art, this survey presents several valuable illustrations, most\nprominently, a table summarizing the past papers along different dimensions,\nsuch as the types of features, annotation techniques, and datasets used.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ENGps7eTYgTwZ5VxEIVPZh2lfPVT3e390mPnEe7gf5U","pdfSize":"1057331"}
