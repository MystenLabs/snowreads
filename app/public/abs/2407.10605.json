We\nmodel the Casimir apparatus rotating with constant angular speed using\nappropriate $\\kappa$-deformed coordinates. We find the $\\kappa$-deformed\ncentripetal force on a single plate, as well as for parallel plates. We show\nthat the Casimir energy, including the divergent part (self energies of the\nplates) experiences centripetal forces like a conventional mass. We also find\ncentripetal force on oriented parallel plates rotating with constant angular\nspeed in $\\kappa$-space-time. Results show that the mass-energy equivalence\nprinciple holds in the $\\kappa$-space-time.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
