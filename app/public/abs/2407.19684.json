The author used user transaction data from\na certain online payment platform as a sample, with a total of 284908 sample\nrecords, including 593 positive samples (fraud samples) and 285214 negative\nsamples (normal samples), to conduct an empirical study on user fraud detection\nbased on data mining. In this process, facing the problem of imbalanced\npositive and negative samples, the author proposes to use the Under Sampling\nmethod to construct sub samples, and then perform feature scaling, outlier\ndetection, feature screening and other processing on the sub samples. Then,\nfour classification models, logistic regression, K-nearest neighbor algorithm,\ndecision tree, and support vector machine, are trained on the processed sub\nsamples. The prediction results of the four models are evaluated, and the\nresults show that the recall rate, Fl score, and AUC value of the logistic\nregression model are the highest, indicating that the detection method based on\ncomputer data mining is practical and feasible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
