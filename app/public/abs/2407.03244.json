This study explores the dynamics of hydrogen bonds in\nCH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$ across a temperature range from 70 K to 350 K, using\nmolecular dynamics simulations with machine-learning force fields. The results\nindicate that the lifetime of hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing\ntemperature from 7.6 ps (70 K) to 0.16 ps (350 K), exhibiting Arrhenius-type\nbehaviour. The geometric conditions for hydrogen bonding, which include bond\nlengths and angles, maintain consistency across the full temperature range. The\nrelevance of hydrogen bonds for the vibrational states of the material is also\nevidenced through a detailed analysis of the vibrational power spectra,\ndemonstrating their significant effect on the physical properties for this\nclass of perovskites.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
