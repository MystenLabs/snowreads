To achieve this,\nfirstly a brand new iterative method based on the standard discrete-time\nalgebraic Riccati equation (DARE) and its input weighting matrix is proposed to\nsolve the MARE. For the single-input case, the iteration can be initialized by\nan arbitrary positive input weighting if and only if the MARE has a stabilizing\nsolution; nevertheless a pre-given input weighting matrix of a sufficiently\nlarge magnitude is used to perform the iteration for the multi-input case when\nthe characteristic parameter belongs to a specified subset. Benefit from the\ndeveloped specific iteration structure, the Q-learning (QL) algorithm can be\nemployed to subtly solve the MARE where only the system input/output data is\nused thus the system model is not required. Finally, a numerical simulation\nexample is given to verify the effectiveness of the theoretical results and the\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UipFUwPZnuhrQqiZwFuxFHWiZLUyox4L-JcfhPYZfLs","pdfSize":"700494"}
