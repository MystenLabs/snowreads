Using\nthis approach, we have obtained first-order rotation series solutions, which\ndescribe slowly rotating KR black holes. For this solutions, we have plotted\nthe black hole shadow contours under various parameters using the numerical\nbackward ray-tracing method. As the Lorentz-violating parameter increases, not\nonly the apparent size of the black hole shadow decreases, but also the effects\nof rotation, such as the D-shaped structure and frame-dragging, are amplified.\nFurthermore, the KR field also enhances gravitational lensing, causing the\nshadow to occupy a larger area within the photon ring. This distinctive feature\ncan differentiate KR gravity from general relativity. Additionally, using the\nlatest observational data from EHT on M87* and Sgr A*, we have provided\nconstraints on the Lorentz-violating parameter of rotating KR black holes. We\nfound that, compared to static black holes, rotating black holes allow for the\npresence of stronger Lorentz violation effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
