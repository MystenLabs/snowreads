We give fine sufficient criteria for i-isospectrality in given\ndegree i and for representation equivalence. These allow us to produce very\nsmall exotic examples of isospectral orbifolds: hyperbolic 3-orbifolds that are\ni-isospectral for all i but not representation equivalent, hyperbolic\n3-orbifolds that are 0-isospectral but not 1-isospectral, and others. Using the\nsame method, we also give sufficient criteria for rationality of regulator\nquotients Reg_i(Y_1)^2/Reg_i(Y_2)^2 for Vign\\'eras orbifolds Y_1, Y_2,\nsometimes even when they are not isospectral. Moreover, we establish a link\nbetween the primes that enter in these regulator quotients and at which torsion\nhomology of Y_1 and Y_2 can differ, and Galois representations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B-gTw2Dz2DfiuayaaRM5zXdwV8sPdt4RJCwvOYm5zx4","pdfSize":"1733446"}
