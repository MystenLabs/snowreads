Modal trees are presented as an inductive type allowing\nprecise positioning and transformations which give rise to the formal\ndefinition of rewriting rules and facilitates formalization in proof\nassistants. Furthermore, we provide a rewrite normalization theorem for\nsystematic rule application. The normalization of the rewriting process\nenhances proof search efficiency and facilitates implementation.\n  By providing ${\\sf TRC}$ as an efficient provability tool for\n$\\mathcal{\\mathbf{RC}}$, we aim to help on the study of various aspects of the\nlogic such as the subformula property and rule admissibility.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
