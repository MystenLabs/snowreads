Taking\nthe hadron resonance gas picture at face value, chemical freeze-out points at a\ngiven baryochemical potential provide a lower bound on the possible temperature\nof the QCD CP. We first verify that the freeze-out data in heavy-ion collisions\nare well described by a constant energy per particle curve, $E/N = \\rm const$,\nunder strangeness neutrality conditions ($\\mu_S \\neq 0$, $\\mu_Q \\neq 0$). We\nthen evaluate the hypothetical freeze-out curve based on this criterion in the\nabsence of strangeness neutrality ($\\mu_S = 0$, $\\mu_Q = 0$) and confront it\nwith recent predictions on the CP location. We find that recent estimates based\non Yang-Lee edge singularities from lattice QCD data on coarse lattices place\nthe CP significantly below the freeze-out curve and are thus disfavored by the\nheavy-ion data. On the other hand, predictions based on functional methods and\nholography place the CP slightly above the freeze-out curve, indicating that\nthe QCD CP may be located very close to the chemical freeze-out in A+A\ncollisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.5 \\div 5$ GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
