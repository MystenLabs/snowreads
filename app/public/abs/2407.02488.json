In 2+1D\ntopological phases, a direct correspondence can exist between anyonic\nexcitations in the bulk and the topological point defects/primary fields in the\nboundary 1+1D conformal field theory. In this paper, we study how line\nexcitations in 3+1D topological phases become line defects in the boundary 2+1D\ntheory using the Topological Holography/Symmetry Topological Field Theory\nframework. We emphasize the importance of \"descendent\" line excitations and\ndemonstrate in particular the effect of the Majorana chain defect: it leads to\na distinct loop condensed gapped boundary state of the 3+1D fermionic Z2\ntopological order, and leaves signatures in the 2+1D Majorana-cone critical\ntheory that describes the transition between the two types of loop condensed\nboundaries. Effects of non-invertible line excitations, such as Cheshire\nstrings, are also discussed in bosonic 3+1D topological phases and the\ncorresponding 2+1D critical points.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kMx5inVh9ruMOrAEHlrsRXrYKWbdyFaGjyhjZpqB2Ls","pdfSize":"1358085"}
