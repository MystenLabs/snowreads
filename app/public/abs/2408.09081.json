This is best-possible for\nlarge $\\Delta$ because $K_{2,\\Delta}$ requires $2\\Delta$ colors. In addition,\nthere is an example with $\\Delta=4$ that requires $12$ colors.\n  We also establish that an outerplanar graph with maximum degree $\\Delta$ can\nbe B-colored with $\\max\\{\\Delta,6\\}$ colors. This is almost best-possible\nbecause $\\Delta$ colors are necessary and there is an example with $\\Delta=4$\nthat requires $5$ colors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
