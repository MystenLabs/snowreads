In\nparticular, we obtain a variety of applications to sequences of Ricci shrinkers\nconverging in a weak pointed sense to a possibly singular limit Ricci shrinker,\nfor instance no new conical end can form in the limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
