S. Nichols et\nal., Phys. Rev. E 106, 025312 (2022)] for analytically continuing noisy\nimaginary time correlation functions to the real frequency axis. Our\nimplementation supports fermionic and bosonic correlation functions on either\nthe imaginary time or Matsubara frequency axes, and treatment of the covariance\nerror in the input data. This paper presents an overview of the DEAC algorithm\nand the features implemented in the SmoQyDEAC.jl. It also provides detailed\nbenchmarks of the package's output against the popular maximum entropy and\nstochastic analytic continuation methods. The code for this package can be\ndownloaded from our GitHub repository at\nhttps://github.com/SmoQySuite/SmoQyDEAC.jl or installed using the Julia package\nmanager. The online documentation, including examples, can be accessed at\nhttps://smoqysuite.github.io/SmoQyDEAC.jl/stable/.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
