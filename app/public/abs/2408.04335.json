We extend the inequality to a suitable weighted\nSobolev space, although no clear connection with standard Sobolev spaces on\n$\\mathbb{S}^N$ through stereographic projection is present, except for the\nplanar case. Moreover, in any dimension $N \\geq 2$, we show that the Euclidean\nOnofri inequality is equivalent to the logarithmic Moser-Trudinger inequality\nwith sharp constant proved by Carleson and Chang for balls in $\\mathbb{R}^N$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
