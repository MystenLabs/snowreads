Our\nmethodology encompasses time series K-means clustering, graph-based algorithms\n(DeepWalk and LINE), and static attribute clustering, visualized through\ninnovative hybrid charts. Key findings reveal significant variations in player\nengagement, skill levels, and social interactions across five primary user\nsegments, ranging from highly active and skilled players to inactive or new\nusers. We also analyze the impact of external factors on user retention and the\nnetwork structure within clusters, uncovering correlations between cluster\ncohesion and player activity levels. This research provides valuable insights\nfor game developers and marketers, offering data-driven recommendations for\npersonalized game experiences, targeted marketing strategies, and improved\nplayer retention in online gaming environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
