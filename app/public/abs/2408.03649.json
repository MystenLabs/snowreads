We present a\ncomprehensive phenomenological study of this scenario, focusing on its key\nfeature: the logarithmic-shaped potential. This potential gives rise to a\nrelatively light scalar boson that mixes with the Higgs boson and leads to\nfirst-order phase transitions (FOPTs) in the early Universe. Our detailed\nanalysis includes providing exact and analytical solutions for the vacuum\nstructure and scalar interactions, classifying four patterns of cosmic thermal\nhistory, and calculating the supercooled FOPT dynamics and GWs. By combining\nfuture collider and gravitational wave experiments, we can probe the conformal\nsymmetry breaking scales up to $10^5-10^8$ GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
