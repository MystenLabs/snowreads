In this article, we show that in the periodic problem in $\\mathbb\nT^d$ the exponent $d/(2(d+1))$ is necessary for all non-singular polynomial\nsymbols $P$ regardless of the degree of $P$. Among the differential operators\ncovered, we highlight the natural powers of the Laplacian $\\Delta^k$ for $k \\in\n\\mathbb N$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
