Subsequent targeted searches triggered by the EP240219a alert identified\na faint, untriggered gamma-ray burst (GRB) in the archived data of Fermi/GBM,\nSwift/BAT, Insight-HXMT/HE and INTEGRAL/SPI-ACS. The EP/WXT light curve reveals\na long duration of approximately 160 seconds with a slow decay, whereas the\nFermi/GBM light curve shows a total duration of approximately 70 seconds. The\npeak in the Fermi/GBM light curve occurs slightly later with respect to the\npeak seen in the EP/WXT light curve. Our spectral analysis shows that a single\ncutoff power-law model effectively describes the joint EP/WXT-Fermi/GBM spectra\nin general, indicating coherent broad emission typical of GRBs. The model\nyielded a photon index of $\\sim -1.70 \\pm 0.05$ and a peak energy of $\\sim 257\n\\pm 134$ keV. After detection of GRB 240219A, long-term observations identified\nseveral candidates in optical and radio wavelengths, none of which was\nconfirmed as the afterglow counterpart during subsequent optical and\nnear-infrared follow-ups. The analysis of GRB 240219A classifies it as an X-ray\nrich GRB with a high peak energy, presenting both challenges and opportunities\nfor studying the physical origins of X-ray flashes (XRFs), X-ray rich GRBs\n(XRRs), and classical GRBs (C-GRBs). Furthermore, linking the cutoff power-law\ncomponent to non-thermal synchrotron radiation suggests that the burst is\ndriven by a Poynting flux-dominated outflow.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
