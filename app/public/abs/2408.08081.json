We prove that under mild conditions, the homology of\nthis group is independent of the object, and can be expressed in terms of the\nscissors congruence K-theory spectrum defined by Zakharevich. We therefore\nobtain both a group-theoretic interpretation of Zakharevich's higher scissors\ncongruence K-theory, as well as a method to compute the homology of scissors\nautomorphism groups. We apply this to various families of groups, such as\ninterval exchange groups and Brin--Thompson groups, recovering results of\nSzymik--Wahl, Li, and Tanner, and obtaining new results as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
