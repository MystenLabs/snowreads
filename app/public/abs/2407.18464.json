Here, we discuss an\nalternative way of visualizing the polarization tensor, by means of the\npolarization ellipsoid, which is based on the ideas of Lam\\'{e}'s stress\nellipsoid and is drawn by the polarization vectors produced by electric fields\nhaving the same magnitude. We compare both ellipsoids as a first introductory\nway of visualizing the polarization tensor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uFWZxqKP9keWFlzb6T_YerzUnRMhBtbxd_GYWON1t6k","pdfSize":"180472","objectId":"0x8f9c529654beda67b8a9aa98e00b2a394b630d4e66943de99c03e0a7d57b5b02","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
