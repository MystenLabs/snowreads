Here, we investigate an\nensemble approach to decoding that combines the classifiers trained on data\nfrom other subjects to decode cognitive states in a new subject. We compare it\nwith the conventional decoding approach on five different datasets and\ncognitive tasks. We find that it outperforms the conventional approach by up to\n20% in accuracy, especially for datasets with limited per-subject data. The\nensemble approach is particularly advantageous when the classifier is trained\nin voxel space. Furthermore, a Multi-layer Perceptron turns out to be a good\ndefault choice as an ensemble method. These results show that the pre-training\nstrategy reduces the need for large per-subject data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
