The\nline ratio in the inner polar bin is distinct from that measured for the inner\nplanar bin with 99.99% confidence and with $>$ 99.9% confidence we conclude\nthat it lies outside the star formation regime. The effective hardening of the\nionization of the CGM along the polar axis, at small radii, could either\nindicate relic effects of AGN activity or shock ionization. In either case,\nthis signature appears to be ubiquitous across the stellar mass range we are\nable to explore with our spectral stacking technique and currently available\narchival data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H0-gYLcJihTy9HKBZRkLqvk4-7rF_YJhokyJdl_lv7Y","pdfSize":"733736"}
