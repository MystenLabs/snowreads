The branching fractions of $B^+ \\to K^+ X(4630)/Y(4626)$ and $B_s^0 \\to\n\\eta X(4630)/Y(4626)$ have been evaluated using an effective Lagrangian\napproach, which are of the order of $10^{-5}$ and the ratios of these branching\nfractions are almost independent on the model parameter. Based on the present\nestimations, we propose to search $Y(4626)$ in the process $B^+ \\to K^+ J/\\psi\n\\eta^{(\\prime)}$, which should be accessible by the LHCb and Belle II\nCollaborations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
