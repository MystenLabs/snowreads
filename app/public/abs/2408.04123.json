While traditional approaches to automatic emotion recognition have\nfocused on decontextualized signals, recent research emphasizes the importance\nof context in shaping emotion perceptions. This paper contributes to the\nemerging field of context-based emotion recognition by leveraging psychological\ntheories of human emotion perception to inform the design of automated methods.\nWe propose an approach that combines emotion recognition methods with Bayesian\nCue Integration (BCI) to integrate emotion inferences from decontextualized\nfacial expressions and contextual knowledge inferred via Large-language Models.\nWe test this approach in the context of interpreting facial expressions during\na social task, the prisoner's dilemma. Our results provide clear support for\nBCI across a range of automatic emotion recognition methods. The best automated\nmethod achieved results comparable to human observers, suggesting the potential\nfor this approach to advance the field of affective computing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
