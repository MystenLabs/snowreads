We consider the fractional Fokker-Planck\nequation (FFPE), which models the time evolution of probability densities for\nsystems driven by L\\'evy processes, relevant in scenarios where Gaussian\nassumptions fail. The paper presents an efficient and accurate numerical\napproach for the free-space FFPE with constant coefficients and Dirac-delta\ninitial conditions. This method utilizes the integral representation of the\nsolutions and enables the efficient handling of very high-dimensional problems\nusing fast algorithms. Our work is the first to present a high-precision\nnumerical solver for the free-space FFPE with Dirac-delta initial conditions.\nThis opens the door for future research on more complex scenarios, including\nthose with variable coefficients and other types of initial conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
