We conduct direct numerical simulations of turbulent\nPlane Couette flow, the shear flow between two differentially moving plates, to\nreveal intriguing behaviour in response to a modulation in the velocity of one\nof the plates: the response of the flow to modulations can be calculated from a\nsuperposition of the response to each Fourier mode of the modulation. We fix\nthe shear Reynolds number as $Re_s=3\\times10^4$, and measure the propagation of\na modulated forcing in the flow close to the resonant frequency of the system.\nWe find that the amplitude and phase response of the flow can be largely\ncaptured using models based on laminar flow, regardless of the waveform used to\nforce the flow. Furthermore, we find that linear superposition can effectively\ndescribe the flow's response to these perturbations as long as the modulation\nis smaller than the base flow. Our findings unveil the persistence of linear\nsuperposition in a turbulent flow under specific conditions, even when\nperturbations occur at time-scales closely aligned with the system's\ncharacteristic time-scales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
