We study\nthe problem from scratch, extending some classical results from the flat case\n(capillary water waves) to the spherical geometry: the reduction to a problem\non the boundary, its Hamiltonian structure, the analyticity and tame estimates\nfor the Dirichlet-Neumann operator in Sobolev class, and a linearization\nformula for it, both with the method of the good unknown of Alinhac and by a\ndifferential geometry approach. Then we prove the bifurcation of traveling\nwaves, which are nontrivial (i.e., nonspherical) fixed profiles rotating with\nconstant angular velocity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c3PoeMkXN-0o48cX_B9T9fCBUnwF6OCxtwuvftWi5Rw","pdfSize":"931128","txDigest":"4Xdk9VkZ9Cq99fDjCabjPVDYPgaXseNhZoBbCuV5nsSc","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
