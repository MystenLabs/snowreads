This analysis is pivotal for evaluating the model's capability\nto represent diverse ground states, thus enhancing our understanding of its\nstrengths and weaknesses. Subsequently, we modify the Restricted Boltzmann\nMachine to accommodate arbitrary ground states by introducing essential\nnon-local connections efficiently. The new model is not only analytically\nsolvable but also demonstrates efficient and accurate performance when solved\nusing machine learning techniques. Then we generalize our the model from $Z_2$\nto $Z_n$ toric code and discuss future directions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
