The CZT's anode is composed of a $22 \\times\n22$ array of pixels while the cathode is planar. TERI will contain four of\nthose crystals with each pixel having an energy range of $40 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$ up\nto $3 \\ \\mathrm{MeV}$ with a resolution of $1.3 \\%$ full-width-at-half maximum\nat $662 \\ \\mathrm{keV}$. As the detectors are 3D position sensitive, TERI can\nCompton image events. TERI is fitted with a coded-aperture mask which permits\nimaging low energy photons in the photoelectric regime. TERI's primary mission\nis to space-qualify large-volume CZT and measure its degradation due to\nradiation damage in a space environment. Its secondary mission includes\ndetecting and localizing astrophysical gamma-ray transients.
