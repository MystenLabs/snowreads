However, many generative AI tools are\nimperfect for product design applications as they are not built for the goals\nand requirements of product design. The unclear link between text input and\nimage output further complicates their application. This work empirically\ninvestigates design space exploration strategies that can successfully yield\nproduct images that are feasible, novel, and aesthetic, which are three common\ngoals in product design. Specifically, user actions within the global and local\nediting modes, including their time spent, prompt length, mono vs.\nmulti-criteria prompts, and goal orientation of prompts, are analyzed. Key\nfindings reveal the pivotal role of mono vs. multi-criteria and goal\norientation of prompts in achieving specific design goals over time and prompt\nlength. The study recommends prioritizing the use of multi-criteria prompts for\nfeasibility and novelty during global editing, while favoring mono-criteria\nprompts for aesthetics during local editing. Overall, this paper underscores\nthe nuanced relationship between the AI-driven text-to-image models and their\neffectiveness in product design, urging designers to carefully structure\nprompts during different editing modes to better meet the unique demands of\nproduct design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
