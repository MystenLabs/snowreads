However, existing methods often struggle to simultaneously\nsatisfy these two critical requirements. To address this issue, this paper\nproposes a sampling-based trajectory planning method with a hierarchical\nstructure for formation flight in dense obstacle environments. To ensure\nreliable local sensing information sharing among UAVs, each UAV generates a\nsafe flight corridor (SFC), which is transmitted to the leader UAV.\nSubsequently, a sampling-based formation guidance path generation method is\ndesigned as the front-end strategy, steering the formation to fly in the\ndesired shape safely with the formation connectivity provided by the SFCs.\nFurthermore, a model predictive path integral (MPPI) based distributed\ntrajectory optimization method is developed as the back-end part, which ensures\nthe smoothness, safety and dynamics feasibility of the executable trajectory.\nTo validate the efficiency of the developed algorithm, comprehensive simulation\ncomparisons are conducted.
