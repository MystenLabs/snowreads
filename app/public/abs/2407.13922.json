These systems can identify social media users,\nsearch for missing persons, and verify identity of individuals. While computer\nvision models are often evaluated for accuracy on available benchmarks, more\nannotated data is necessary to learn about their robustness and fairness\nagainst semantic distributional shifts in input data, especially in face data.\nAmong annotated data, counterfactual examples grant strong explainability\ncharacteristics. Because collecting natural face data is prohibitively\nexpensive, we put forth a generative AI-based framework to construct targeted,\ncounterfactual, high-quality synthetic face data. Our synthetic data pipeline\nhas many use cases, including face recognition systems sensitivity evaluations\nand image understanding system probes. The pipeline is validated with multiple\nuser studies. We showcase the efficacy of our face generation pipeline on a\nleading commercial vision model. We identify facial attributes that cause\nvision systems to fail.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
