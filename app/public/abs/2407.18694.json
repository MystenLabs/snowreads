This\nextends results of Dudas and the first author, where the quasi-split case was\nhandled. This allows to construct new irreducible representations of parahoric\nsubgroups of $p$-adic groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
