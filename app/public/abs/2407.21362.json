A celebrated\nresult of McConnel states that if $D$ is a proper subgroup of $\\mathbb{F}_q^*$,\nand $f:\\mathbb{F}_q \\to \\mathbb{F}_q$ is a function such that\n$(f(x)-f(y))/(x-y) \\in D$ whenever $x \\neq y$, then $f(x)$ necessarily has the\nform $ax^{p^j}+b$. In this notes, we give a sufficient condition on $D$ to\nobtain the same conclusion on $f$. In particular, we show that McConnel's\ntheorem extends if $D$ has small doubling.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
