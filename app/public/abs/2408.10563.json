Our\nsemantics is developed using Approximation Fixpoint Theory (AFT), a powerful\nformalism that has successfully been used to give meaning to diverse\nnon-monotonic formalisms. The proposed semantics generalizes the classical\ntwo-valued stable model semantics of (Gelfond and Lifschitz 1988) as-well-as\nthe three-valued one of (Przymusinski 1990), retaining their desirable\nproperties. Due to the use of AFT, we also get for free alternative semantics\nfor higher-order logic programs, namely supported model, Kripke-Kleene, and\nwell-founded. Additionally, we define a broad class of stratified higher-order\nlogic programs and demonstrate that they have a unique two-valued higher-order\nstable model which coincides with the well-founded semantics of such programs.\nWe provide a number of examples in different application domains, which\ndemonstrate that higher-order logic programming under the stable model\nsemantics is a powerful and versatile formalism, which can potentially form the\nbasis of novel ASP systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
