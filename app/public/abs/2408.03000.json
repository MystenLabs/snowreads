Implicit models often\nhave lower training errors but face issues such as overfitting and high\nprediction costs, while explicit models can struggle with complex training and\nbarren plateaus. We propose a quantum-classical hybrid algorithm to create an\nexplicit quantum surrogate (EQS) for trained implicit models. This involves\ndiagonalizing an observable from the implicit model and constructing a\ncorresponding quantum circuit using an extended automatic quantum circuit\nencoding (AQCE) algorithm. The EQS framework reduces prediction costs,\nmitigates barren plateau issues, and combines the strengths of both QML\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ev7HgyadtdaJrvJVOg7Sc6drYbkpXBNnwfMsigZidvA","pdfSize":"786827"}
