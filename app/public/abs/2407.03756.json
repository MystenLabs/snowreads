These networks may implement classic\nparallel server or work stealing load balancing policies, and may be\nasymmetric, for instance due to topological constraints. The invariant laws are\nusually not known even up to normalizing constant. We provide three perfect\nsimulation algorithms enabling Monte Carlo estimation of quantities of interest\nin equilibrium. The state space is infinite, and the algorithms use a\ndominating process provided by the network with uniform routing, in a coupling\npreserving a preorder which is related to the increasing convex order. It\nconstitutes an order up to permutation of the coordinates, strictly weaker than\nthe product order. The use of a preorder is novel in this context. The first\nalgorithm is in direct time and uses Palm theory and acceptance rejection. Its\nduration is finite, a.s., but has infinite expectation. The two other\nalgorithms use dominated coupling from the past; one achieves coalescence by\nsimulating the dominating process into the past until it reaches the empty\nstate, the other, valid for exchangeable policies, is a back-off sandwiching\nmethod. Their durations have some exponential moments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
