This streamlines research\nendeavors and simplifies deployment. However, such a highly homogenized\nframework in current design, where each element maintains uniformity, could\noverlook the inherent diversity among different tasks and lead to suboptimal\nperformance. To tackle this, GvSeg: i) provides a holistic disentanglement and\nmodeling for segment targets, thoroughly examining them from the perspective of\nappearance, position, and shape, and on this basis, ii) reformulates the query\ninitialization, matching and sampling strategies in alignment with the\ntask-specific requirement. These architecture-agnostic innovations empower\nGvSeg to effectively address each unique task by accommodating the specific\nproperties that characterize them. Extensive experiments on seven gold-standard\nbenchmark datasets demonstrate that GvSeg surpasses all existing\nspecialized/general solutions by a significant margin on four different video\nsegmentation tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
