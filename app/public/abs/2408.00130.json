The semiclassical Herman--Kluk propagator mitigates this curse by\nemploying a grid-free ansatz to evaluate the expectation values of these\nobservables. Here, we investigate quadrature techniques for this\nhigh-dimensional and highly oscillatory propagator. In particular, we analyze\nMonte Carlo quadratures using three different initial sampling approaches. The\nfirst two, based either on the Husimi density or its square root, are\nindependent of the observable whereas the third approach, which is new,\nincorporates the observable in the sampling to minimize the variance of the\nMonte Carlo integrand at the initial time. We prove sufficient conditions for\nthe convergence of the Monte Carlo estimators and provide convergence error\nestimates. The analytical results are validated by numerical experiments in\nvarious dimensions on a harmonic oscillator and on a Henon-Heiles potential\nwith an increasing degree of anharmonicity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
