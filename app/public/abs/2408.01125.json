Our analysis is\nfocused on the influence of the hyperfine- and rotational-energy-level\nstructures. These depend on the number of nuclear spins, the rotational\nconstants, and the symmetry of the tensors involved in the nuclear spin and\nexternal field interactions. Comparing the prototypical large-nuclear-spin\nmolecules iodobenzene, 1,2-diiodobenzene, 1,3-diiodobenzene, and\n2,5-diiodobenzonitrile, we demonstrate that the magnitude of the hyperfine\nsplittings compared to the rotational-energy splittings plays a crucial role in\nthe spin-rotational dynamics after the laser pulse. Moreover, we point out that\nthe impact of the quadrupole coupling on the rotational dynamics decreases when\nhighly excited rotational states dominate the dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
