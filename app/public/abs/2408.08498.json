We perform the optical\nspectroscopic observations with KOOLS-IFU on the Seimei Telescope. The black\nhole mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) based on the single-epoch method with MgII\n$\\lambda$2798 is estimated to be $M_{\\rm BH} = (6.2 \\pm 1.2) \\times 10^8$\n$M_{\\odot}$. To measure the precise infrared luminosity ($L_{\\rm IR}$), we\nobtain submillimeter data taken by SCUBA-2 on JCMT and conduct the spectral\nenergy distribution analysis with X-ray to submillimeter data. We find that\n$L_{\\rm IR}$ of eFEDSJ0828-0139 is $L_{\\rm IR} = (6.8 \\pm 1.8) \\times 10^{13}$\n$L_{\\odot}$, confirming the existence of a hypeluminous infrared galaxy\n(HyLIRG). $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$ is estimated to be $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd} = 3.6 \\pm\n0.7$, making it one of the quasars with the highest BH mass accretion rate at\ncosmic noon.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
