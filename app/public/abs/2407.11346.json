However, approximating discontinuous functions by neural networks\nposes a considerable challenge, which results in high computational demands and\nlow accuracy to solve fracture mechanics problems within standard PINNs\nframework. In this paper, we present a novel method called Discontinuity\nEmbedded Deep Energy Method (DEDEM) for modeling fracture mechanics problems.\nIn this method, interfaces and internal boundaries with weak/strong\ndiscontinuities are represented by discontinuous functions constructed by\nsigned distance functions, then the representations are embedded to the input\nof the neural network so that specific discontinuous features can be imposed to\nthe neural network solution. Results demonstrate that DEDEM can accurately\nmodel the mechanical behaviors of cracks on a large variety of fracture\nproblems. Besides, it is also found that DEDEM achieves significantly higher\ncomputational efficiency and accuracy than the existing methods based on domain\ndecomposition techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
