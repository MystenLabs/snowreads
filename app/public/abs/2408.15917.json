In general, it is very difficult to\ncompute a parametric primary decomposition of a given ideal in the polynomial\nring with rational coefficients $\\mathbb{Q}[A,X]$ where $A$ is the set of\nparameters and $X$ is the set of ordinary variables. One cause of the\ndifficulty is related to the irreducibility of the specialized polynomial.\nThus, we introduce a new notion of ``feasibility'' on the stability of the\nstructure of the ideal in terms of its primary decomposition, and we give a new\nalgorithm for computing a so-called comprehensive system consisting of pairs\n$(C, \\mathcal{Q})$, where for each parameter value in $C$, the ideal has the\nstable decomposition $\\mathcal{Q}$. We may call this comprehensive system a\nparametric primary decomposition of the ideal. Also, one can also compute a\ndense set $\\mathcal{O}$ such that $\\varphi_\\alpha(\\mathcal{Q})$ is a primary\ndecomposition for any $\\alpha\\in C\\cap \\mathcal{O}$ via irreducible\npolynomials. In addition, we give several computational examples to examine the\neffectiveness of our new decomposition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
