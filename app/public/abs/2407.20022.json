In many PDE problems, the\n$C^{2,\\alpha}$-estimates have been obtained through Schauder-type estimates.\nHowever, the Schauder-type estimates are not applicable to the porous\nmedium-type equations. We provide techniques for handling porous medium-type\nequations so that the global $C^{2,\\alpha}$-estimates can be established.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
