Birkhoff had conjectured this surface of\nsection as a tool to prove existence of a direct periodic orbit. Using\ntechniques from validated numerics we prove the existence of an approximately\ncircular direct orbit for a wide range of mass parameters and Jacobi energies.\nWe also provide methods to rigorously compute the Conley-Zehnder index of\nperiodic Hamiltonian orbits using computational tools, thus giving some initial\nsteps for developing computational Floer homology and providing the means to\nprove the Birkhoff conjecture via symplectic topology. We apply this method to\nvarious symmetric orbits in the restricted three-body problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
