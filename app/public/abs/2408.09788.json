More precisely, we propose a novel\napproach using simplicial complexes to model the desired network and the\nrespective intrusions in terms of simplicial attributes thus generalizing\nprevious graph-based approaches. Adapted network centrality measures related to\nsimplicial complexes yield so-called patterns associated to vertices, which\nthemselves contain a set of features. These are then used to describe the\nattacked or the attacker vertices, respectively. Comparing this new strategy\nwith classical concepts demonstrates the advantages of the presented approach\nusing simplicial features for detecting and characterizing intrusions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JcXAtbV7ArkoWAeMnrRdk2lMMJaP1Y8EKpgjrXZM0x4","pdfSize":"364529"}
