Spin glasses and other frustrated systems are not among them as\nthe clusters of aligned spins usually considered in this context start to\npercolate in the disordered phase and hence fail to indicate the onset of\nordering. In this mini-review we provide an overview of the state of the art in\nthis field, including recent advances, and outline the main open questions in\nthe area.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
