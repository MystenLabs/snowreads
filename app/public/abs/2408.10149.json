The Longitudinal\nRank-Sum Test (LRST), a robust U-statistics-based, non-parametric, rank-based\nmethod, effectively controls Type I error and enhances statistical power by\nleveraging the temporal structure of the data without relying on distributional\nassumptions. However, the LRST is limited to two-arm comparisons. To address\nthe need for comparing multiple doses against a control group in many RCTs, we\nextend the LRST to a multi-arm setting. This novel multi-arm LRST provides a\nflexible and powerful approach for evaluating treatment efficacy across\nmultiple arms and outcomes, with a strong capability for detecting the most\neffective dose in multi-arm trials. Extensive simulations demonstrate that this\nmethod maintains excellent Type I error control while providing greater power\ncompared to the two-arm LRST with multiplicity adjustments. Application to the\nBapineuzumab (Bapi) 301 trial further validates the multi-arm LRST's practical\nutility and robustness, confirming its efficacy in complex clinical trial\nanalyses.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
