The aim of this paper is to introduce the notion of a generalised\nBrillouin zone by allowing the quasiperiodicities to be complex in order to\nrectify this. It is proved that this shift of the Brillouin zone into the\ncomplex plane accounts for the unidirectional spatial decay of the eigenmodes\nand leads to correct spectral convergence properties. The results in this paper\nclarify and prove rigorously how the spectral properties of a finite structure\nare associated with those of the corresponding semi-infinitely or infinitely\nperiodic lattices and give explicit characterisations of how to extend the\nHermitian theory to non-reciprocal settings. Based on our theory, we\ncharacterise the generalised Brillouin zone for both open boundary conditions\nand periodic boundary conditions. Our results are consistent with the physical\nliterature and give explicit generalisations to the $k$-Toeplitz matrix cases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
