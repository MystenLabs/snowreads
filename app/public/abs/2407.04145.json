Here, we show that only very limited generalizations are\npossible when no approximations in the underlying Hamiltonian or Maxwell\nequations are allowed, as was the case for IOTA. Specifically, no such systems\nexist with invariants quadratic in the momenta, precluding straightforward\ngeneralization of the Courant-Snyder theory of linear integrable systems in\nbeam physics. We also conjecture that no such systems exist with invariants of\nhigher degree in the momenta. This leaves solenoidal magnetic fields, including\ntheir nonlinear fringe fields, as the only completely integrable static\nmagnetic fields, albeit with invariants that are linear in the momenta. The\ndifficulties come from enforcing Maxwell equations; without constraints, we\nshow that there are many solutions. In particular, we discover a previously\nunknown large family of integrable Hamiltonians.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
