This algorithmic approach recommends\nan ideal size and number of trades for each asset during the periodic\nrebalancing process, factoring in the gas fee and slippage. The essence of the\nmodel we have created gives indications regarding whether trades should be made\non individual assets depending on the uncertainty in the micro - asset level\ncharacteristics - and macro - aggregate market factors - environments. In the\nhyper-volatile crypto market, our approach to daily rebalancing will benefit\nfrom volatility. Price movements will cause our algorithm to buy assets that\ndrop in prices and sell as they soar. In fact, the buying and selling happen\nonly when certain boundaries are crossed in order to weed out any market noise\nand ensure sound trade execution. We have provided several numerical examples\nto illustrate the steps - including the calculation of several intermediate\nvariables - of our rebalancing mechanism. The Algorithm we have developed can\nbe easily applied outside blockchain to investment funds across all asset\nclasses at any trading frequency and rebalancing duration.\n  Shakespeare As A Crypto Trader:\n  To Trade Or Not To Trade, that is the Question,\n  Whether an Optimizer can Yield the Answer,\n  Against the Spikes and Crashes of Markets Gone Wild,\n  To Quench One's Thirst before Liquidity Runs Dry,\n  Or Wait till the Tide of Momentum turns Mild.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
