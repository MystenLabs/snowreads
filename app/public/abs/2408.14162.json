Here, we report the mapping of\noptical modes in a waveguide structure by illumination with femtosecond light\npulses in a continuous-beam transmission electron microscope. Multi-photon\nphotoemission results in a remanent charging pattern which we image by Lorentz\nmicroscopy. The resulting image contrast is linked to the intensity\ndistribution of the standing light wave and quantitatively described within an\nanalytical model. The robustness of the approach is showcased in a wider\nparameter range and more complex sample geometries including micro- and\nnanostructures. We discuss further applications of light-interference-based\ncharging for electron microscopy with in-situ optical excitation, laying the\nfoundation for advanced measurement schemes for the phase-resolved imaging of\npropagating light fields.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
