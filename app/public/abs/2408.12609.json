This paper introduces a novel methodology for\ntrajectory forecasting based on state-space dynamic system modeling, which\nendows agents with models that have tangible physical implications. To enhance\nthe precision of state estimations within the dynamic system, the paper also\npresents a novel modeling technique for control variables. This technique\nutilizes a newly introduced model, termed \"Mixed Mamba,\" to derive initial\ncontrol states, thereby improving the predictive accuracy of these variables.\nMoverover, the proposed approach ingeniously integrates graph neural networks\nwith state-space models, effectively capturing the complexities of multi-agent\ninteractions. This combination provides a robust and scalable framework for\nforecasting multi-agent trajectories across a range of scenarios. Comprehensive\nevaluations demonstrate that this model outperforms several established\nbenchmarks across various metrics and datasets, highlighting its significant\npotential to advance trajectory forecasting in autonomous systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
