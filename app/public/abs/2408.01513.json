We show that the Lusztig data partial order on Kostant\npictures refines the 'merge' partial order on Kostant pictures, and that the\nmerge partial order on Kostant pictures is equivalent to a partial order on\nTesler matrices. This equivalence requires integral flow graphs. Using Kostant\npictures we find logarithmic asymptotics of some families of Tesler matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
