We calculate the average degree of these graphs. For the Ammann A2\ntiling, we present a closed-form formula for the average degree. For the Kite\nand Dart Penrose tiling, the Rhomb Penrose Tiling, and the Ammann-Beenker\ntiling we present numerical calculations for the average degree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
