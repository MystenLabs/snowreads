If the accretion geometry of black holes is similar regardless of\nmass, we should expect the same to be true of their polarization properties. We\ncompare the polarimetric properties of all non-blazar black holes observed with\nIXPE. We find that their polarization properties are very similar, particularly\nin the hard state, where the corona dominates. This tentatively supports the\nidea that stellar and supermassive black holes share a common coronal geometry.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
