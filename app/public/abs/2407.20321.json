In fact, we show that this negativity must\nhappen for any effective theory of quantum gravity with an ensemble\ndescription. To do so, we identify the usual gravitational entropy as an\nannealed entropy $S_a$, and prove that this quantity gives $S_0$ at extremality\nif and only if the ground-state energy is protected by supersymmetry, and\ndiverges negatively otherwise. The actual thermodynamically-behaved quantity is\nthe average or quenched entropy $S_q$, whose calculation is poorly understood\nin gravity: it involves replica wormholes in a regime where the topological\nexpansion breaks down. Using matrix integrals we find new instanton saddles\nthat dominate gravitational correlators at $T\\sim e^{-S_0}$ and are dual to\nsemiclassical wormholes involving dynamical branes. These brane solutions give\nthe leading contribution to any black hole very near extremality, and a duality\nwith matrix ensembles would not make sense without them. In the non-BPS case,\nthey are required to make $S_q$ non-negative and also enhance the negativity of\n$S_a$, both effects consistent with matrix integrals evaluated exactly. Our\ninstanton results are tested against the on-shell action of D3-branes dual to\nmultiply wrapped Wilson loops in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ super-YM, and a precise match\nis found. Our analysis of low-energy random matrix spectra also explains the\norigin of spectral gaps in supersymmetric theories, not only when there are BPS\nstates at zero energy, but also for purely non-BPS supermultiplets. In the\nformer, our prediction for the gap in terms of the degeneracy of BPS states\nagrees with the R-charge scaling in gapped multiplets of $\\mathcal{N}=2$\nsuper-JT gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
