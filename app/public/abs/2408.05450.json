For arbitrarily prescribed divergence-free\ninitial data in $L^{2}_x$, we construct infinitely many probabilistically\nstrong and analitically weak solutions in the class\n$L^{r}_{\\Omega}L_{t}^{\\gamma}W_{x}^{s,p}$, where $r>1$ and $(s, \\gamma, p)$ lie\nin a supercritical regime with respect to the the\nLady\\v{z}henskaya-Prodi-Serrin (LPS) criteria. In particular, we get the\nnon-uniqueness of probabilistically strong solutions, which is sharp at one LPS\nendpoint space. Our proof utilizes intermittent flows which are different from\nthose of Navier-Stokes equations and derives the non-uniqueness even in the\nhigh viscous and resistive regime beyond the Lions exponent 5/4. Furthermore,\nwe prove that as the noise intensity tends to zero, the accumulation points of\nstochastic MHD solutions contain all deterministic solutions to MHD solutions,\nwhich include the recently constructed solutions in [28, 29] to deterministic\nMHD systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
