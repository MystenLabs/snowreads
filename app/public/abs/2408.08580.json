In settings where the\nfirst-stage parameters are dense, we show that Ridge lowers the implicit price\nof a bias adjustment. This comes along with improved (finite-sample) properties\nin the second stage regression. Our theoretical results nest existing results\non bias approximation and bias adjustment. Moreover, it extends them to\nsettings with more instruments than observations.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
