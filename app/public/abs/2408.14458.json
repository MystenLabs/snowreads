In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can\nprovide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined\nquark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate\ngases. Two-particle correlations in mesoscopic colliders have provided\nsmoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as\nfractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet the gap between\ntwo-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of\ninteracting particles grows is hard to address at the microscopic level. Here,\nwe demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of up to $N = 5$\nelectron droplets driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a\nsemiconductor. We show that the measured multivariate cumulants (of order $k =\n2$ to $N$) of the electron droplet are accurately described by $k$-spin\ncorrelation functions of an effective Ising model below the N\\'eel temperature\nand can be interpreted as a Coulomb liquid in the thermodynamic limit. Finite\nsize scaling of high-order correlation functions provides otherwise\ninaccessible fingerprints of emerging order. Our demonstration of emergence in\na simple correlated electron collider opens a new way to study engineered\nstates of matter.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"260HbET8Vd92RtWYVX7JQ9axXeAl6-dZFb6vdFFQjdQ","pdfSize":"6651328"}
