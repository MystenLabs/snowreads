In this paper, we rethink the\noptimization process and propose a novel sequence optimization concept, which\nis named Looking From the Future (LFF). LFF makes use of the original\noptimization process to refine the very first local optimization choice.\nAdapting the LFF concept to the adversarial attack task, we further propose an\nLFF attack as well as an MLFF attack with better generalization ability.\nFurthermore, guiding with the LFF concept, we propose an $LLF^{\\mathcal{N}}$\nattack which entends the LFF attack to a multi-order attack, further enhancing\nthe transfer attack ability. All our proposed methods can be directly applied\nto the iteration-based attack methods. We evaluate our proposed method on the\nImageNet1k dataset by applying several SOTA adversarial attack methods under\nfour kinds of tasks. Experimental results show that our proposed method can\ngreatly enhance the attack transferability. Ablation experiments are also\napplied to verify the effectiveness of each component. The source code will be\nreleased after this paper is accepted.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
