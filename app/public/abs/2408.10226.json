Here the\ndivergence of the $P_4$ bubble is not a $P_3$ polynomial, but a $P_2$\npolynomial. This nonconforming $P_3$ finite element, combined with the\ndiscontinuous $P_2$ finite element, is inf-sup stable for solving the Stokes\nequations on general tetrahedral grids. Consequently such a mixed finite\nelement method produces quasi-optimal solutions for solving the stationary\nStokes equations. With these special $P_4$ bubbles, the discrete velocity\nremains locally pointwise divergence-free. Numerical tests confirm the theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iqNa1KAcYwKqlmef-JdG-CexzYlYu7hQsL95lCDLw98","pdfSize":"193851"}
