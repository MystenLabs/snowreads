To broaden their utility, operating at room\ntemperature and emitting in the telecom wavelength range are desired,\neliminating cryogenic requirements and leveraging existing optical fiber\ninfrastructure for transmitting the quantum information. To that end, we report\nthat telecom single photon emitters (SPEs) in gallium nitride (GaN) exhibit\noptically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) at room temperature. The analysis\nof ODMR as a function of magnetic field orientation enables the determination\nof the orientation of the spin quantization axis with respect to the GaN\ncrystalline lattice. The optical transitions dynamics are analyzed to gain\nfurther insight into the transition rates dominating ODMR. Our findings,\ncoupled with GaN's mature fabrication technology, could facilitate the\nrealization of scalable quantum technology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wa7MUTol3obceUM7PdHTssj0WzOcPD1KDPV7loatwGI","pdfSize":"2356549"}
