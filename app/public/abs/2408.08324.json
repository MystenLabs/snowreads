It starts by asking\nwhether quantum physics is important, or weird, or incomprehensible. It\nexplains why particles sometimes behave like waves, and how uncertainty and\nrandomness enter physics, before explaining a number of historically important\nexperiments. Modern topics, like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and quantum\ncomputing are also covered. Essential concepts, such as the uncertainty\nprinciple, are analyzed in depth, employing a slightly increased dose of\nmathematics.\n  This is the English version of the first part of a manual intended as a\ncompanion to the \"Treffpunkt Quantenmechanik\" (meeting point quantum\nmechanics), a laboratory at TU Dortmund University, where high-school students\ncan get acquainted with the wonderful world of quantum physics. The second part\nof the manual contains detailed instructions for the individual experiments\navailable in the lab and is not available on the Internet.\n","subjects":["Physics/Popular Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
