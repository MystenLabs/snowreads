Can\n$\\mathcal{H}_q$ and $\\mathcal{C}_d$ intersect in exactly $d(q+1)$ distinct\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-rational points? B\\'ezout's theorem immediately implies that\n$\\mathcal{H}_q$ and $\\mathcal{C}_d$ intersect in at most $d(q+1)$ points, but\nequality is not guaranteed over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. In this paper we prove that\nfor many $d \\le q^2-q+1$, the answer to this question is affirmative. The case\n$d=1$ is trivial: it is well known that any secant line of $\\mathcal{H}_q$\ndefined over $\\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ intersects $\\mathcal{H}_q$ in $q+1$ rational\npoints. Moreover, all possible intersections of conics and $\\mathcal{H}_q$ were\nclassified by Donati et al. in 2009 and their results imply that the answer to\nthe question above is affirmative for $d=2$ and $q \\ge 4$, as well. However, an\nexhaustive computer search quickly reveals that for $(q,d) \\in\n\\{(2,2),(3,2),(2,3)\\}$, the answer is instead negative. We show that for $q \\le\nd \\le q^2-q+1$, $d=\\lfloor(q+1)/2\\rfloor$ and $d=3$, $q \\geq 3$ the answer is\nagain affirmative. Various partial results for the case $d$ small compared to\n$q$ are also provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
