Nearly 50 years\nago, Arimoto and Blahut independently proposed identical algorithms to solve\nthis problem in their seminal papers \\cite{Arimoto1972AnAF,\nBlahut1972ComputationOC}. The Arimoto-Blahut algorithm was proven to converge\nto the capacity of the channel as $t \\to \\infty$ with the convergence rate\nupper bounded by $O\\left(\\log(m)/t\\right)$, where $m$ is the size of the input\ndistribution, and being inverse exponential when there is a unique solution in\nthe interior of the input probability simplex \\cite{Arimoto1972AnAF}. Recently\nit was proved, in \\cite{Nakagawa2020AnalysisOT}, that the convergence rate is\nat worst inverse linear $O(1/t)$ in some specific cases.\n  In this paper, we revisit this fundamental algorithm looking at the rate of\nconvergence to the capacity and the time complexity, given $m,n$, where $n$ is\nsize of the output of the channel, focusing on the approximation of the\ncapacity. We prove that the rate of convergence to an $\\varepsilon$-optimal\nsolution, for any constant $\\varepsilon > 0$, is inverse exponential\n$O\\left(\\log(m)/c^t\\right)$, for a constant $c > 1$ and $O\\left(\\log \\left(\\log\n(m)/\\varepsilon\\right)\\right)$ at most iterations, implying $O\\left(m n\\log\n\\left(\\log (m)/\\varepsilon\\right)\\right)$ total complexity of the algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
