Since\nthen, many beautiful questions and conjectures about these objects have been\nposed. Most famously, Erd\\H{o}s asked whether the minimum modulus of a covering\nsystem with distinct moduli is arbitrarily large. This problem was resolved in\n2015 by Hough, who proved that the minimum modulus is bounded. In 2022,\nBalister et al. developed Hough's method and gave a simpler but more versatile\nproof of Hough's result. Their technique has many applications in a number of\nvariants on Erd\\H{o}s' minimum modulus problem. In this paper, we show that\nthere is no covering system of multiplicity $s$ in any global function field of\ngenus $g$ over $\\mathbb{F}_q$ for $q\\geq(82.26+18.88g)e^{0.95g}s^2$. Moreover,\nwe obtain that there is no covering system of $\\mathbb{F}_q[x]$ with distinct\nmoduli for $q>73$. This improves the results in the previous work of the author\njoint with Li, Wang and Yi.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
