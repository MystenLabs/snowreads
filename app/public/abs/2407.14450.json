This extends, in\nseveral ways, a recent observation due to Galbraith, Perrin and Voloch for the\nray class group. We show that this leads to a reinterpretation of the action of\nthe class group of a suborder $O' \\subseteq O$ on the set of $O'$-oriented\nelliptic curves, discuss several other examples, and briefly comment on the\nhardness of the corresponding vectorization problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
