LuInCo$_4$ undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at 306 K and\nhas a saturation moment of 3.43 $\\mu_{\\rm{B}}$/f.u. at 5 K. The strongly\nferromagnetic nature was verified by DFT calculations, suggesting that Co-3$d$\nflat bands near the Fermi level induce the spin polarization. The magnetization\nis isotropic above $\\sim$100 K, saturates most easily in the [100] direction at\nlow temperatures. In this anisotropic ferromagnetic state, the magnetization\nundergoes a metamagnetic transition in the [111] direction. Our results suggest\nthat LuInCo$_4$ is a new strong but unusual itinerant electron ferromagnet,\nwhich deserves further study as a pyrochlore metal.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
