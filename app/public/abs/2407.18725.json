To overcome difficulties\nrelated to huge amount of necessary computations and low efficiency of\ntraditional numerical methods in modeling the evolution of non-stationary\nsolitons, we propose a two-parallel bidirectional long short-term memory\nrecurrent neural network, with the main objective to predict dynamics of\nvector-soliton pulsations in various complex states, whose real-time dynamics\nis verified by experiments. Besides, the scheme of coded information storage\nbased on the TP-Bi_LSTM RNN, instead of actual pulse signals, is realized too.\nThe findings offer new applications of deep learning to ultrafast optics and\ninformation storage.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
