Previous work has demonstrated that a class of hybrid state-space\nmodel known as recurrent switching linear dynamical systems (rSLDS) discover\nmeaningful behavioural units via the piecewise linear decomposition of complex\ncontinuous dynamics (Linderman et al., 2016). Furthermore, they model how the\nunderlying continuous states drive these discrete mode switches. We propose\nthat the rich representations formed by an rSLDS can provide useful\nabstractions for planning and control. We present a novel hierarchical\nmodel-based algorithm inspired by Active Inference in which a discrete MDP sits\nabove a low-level linear-quadratic controller. The recurrent transition\ndynamics learned by the rSLDS allow us to (1) specify temporally-abstracted\nsub-goals in a method reminiscent of the options framework, (2) lift the\nexploration into discrete space allowing us to exploit information-theoretic\nexploration bonuses and (3) `cache' the approximate solutions to low-level\nproblems in the discrete planner. We successfully apply our model to the sparse\nContinuous Mountain Car task, demonstrating fast system identification via\nenhanced exploration and non-trivial planning through the delineation of\nabstract sub-goals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
