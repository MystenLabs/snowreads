Each edge $e$ of the graph is assigned an independent copy of a\nnon-negative random variable $\\tau$. We only assume $\\P[\\tau=0]0$ is explicit)\nfor the probability of having two disjoint geodesics between two pairs of\nneighbouring vertices at distance $n$. Additionally, under more specific\nassumptions on the distribution of $\\tau$, we obtain similar lower bounds for\nthe probability of having two disjoint geodesics (except for their starting and\nending points) between the same two vertices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
