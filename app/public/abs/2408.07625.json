However, their largest achievements to date mostly concern interacting\nspin systems, while their utility for quantum chemistry remains yet to be\ndemonstrated. Two main complications are the peaked structure of the molecular\nwave functions, which impedes sampling, and large number of terms in second\nquantised Hamiltonians, which hinders scaling to larger molecule sizes. In this\npaper we address these issues jointly and argue that the peaked structure might\nactually be key to drastically more efficient calculations. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel algorithm for autoregressive sampling without replacement and\na procedure to calculate a computationally cheaper surrogate for the local\nenergy. We complement them with a custom modification of the stochastic\nreconfiguration optimisation technique and a highly optimised GPU\nimplementation. As a result, our calculations require substantially less\nresources and exhibit more than order of magnitude speedup compared to the\nprevious works. On a single GPU we study molecules comprising up to 118 qubits\nand outperform the ``golden standard'' CCSD(T) benchmark in Hilbert spaces of\n$\\sim 10^{15}$ Slater determinants, which is orders of magnitude larger than\nwhat was previously achieved. We believe that our work underscores the prospect\nof NQS for challenging quantum chemistry calculations and serves as a\nfavourable ground for the future method development.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
