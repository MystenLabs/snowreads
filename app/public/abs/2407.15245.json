Viewed as a stochastic control\nproblem, the Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge finds an optimal control policy that steers\na given joint state statistics to another while minimizing the total control\neffort subject to controlled diffusion and deadline constraints. Viewed as a\nstochastic learning problem, the Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge finds the most-likely\ndistribution-valued trajectory connecting endpoint distributional observations,\ni.e., solves the two point boundary-constrained maximum likelihood problem over\nthe manifold of probability distributions. Recent works have shown that solving\nthe Schr\\\"{o}dinger bridge problem with state cost requires finding the Markov\nkernel associated with a reaction-diffusion PDE where the state cost appears as\na state-dependent reaction rate. We explain how ideas from Weyl calculus in\nquantum mechanics, specifically the Weyl operator and the Weyl symbol, can help\ndetermine such Markov kernels. We illustrate these ideas by explicitly finding\nthe Markov kernel for the case of quadratic state cost via Weyl calculus,\nrecovering our earlier results but avoiding tedious computation with Hermite\npolynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
