Furthermore,\nsequential acquisition solutions are incompatible with the monitoring of\nultra-fast processes. As a possible solution for single-shot wavefront and\nfull-Stokes polarimetric imaging, we propose here a vector-beam lateral\nshearing interferometer. The device, composed of a patterned\npolarization-modulating Hartmann mask placed in the close vicinity of a camera,\nencodes all the information in the fringe pattern of a single image\nacquisition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a7WACPF9UxM8IR0NFTP_T-GCtXgp20RQLIlh203EkHg","pdfSize":"3926721"}
