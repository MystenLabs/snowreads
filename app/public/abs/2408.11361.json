Our\nsystem handles false alarms and detections with false range information through\nmultiple hypothesis tracking (MHT) to resolve data association uncertainties.\nWe focus on range gate pull-off (RGPO) attacks, where the attacker adds\npositive delays to the radar pulse, thereby mimicking the target trajectory\nwhile appearing at a larger distance from the radar. The proposed framework\nincorporates knowledge about the spatial behavior of the attack into the\nassumed RFS clutter model and uses only position information without relying on\nadditional signal features. We present an adaptive solution that estimates the\njammer-induced biases to improve tracking accuracy as well as a simpler\nnon-adaptive version that performs well when accurate priors on the jamming\nrange are available. Furthermore, an expression for RGPO attack detection is\nderived, where the adaptive solution offers superior performance. The presented\nstrategies provide tracking resilience against multiple RGPO attacks in terms\nof position estimation accuracy and jamming detection without degrading\ntracking performance in the absence of jamming.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
