Motivated by the famous Krein-Milman Theorem, we prove that a\n\\emph{rank one} norm one linear operator between such spaces can be expressed\nas a convex combination of \\emph{rank one} extreme contractions, whenever the\ndomain is two-dimensional. We establish that the same result holds true in the\nspace of all linear operators from $\\ell_{\\infty}^n(\\mathbb{C}) $ to $ \\ell_1^n\n(\\mathbb{C}). $ Furthermore, we present a geometric characterization of extreme\ncontractions between finite-dimensional polyhedral Banach spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
