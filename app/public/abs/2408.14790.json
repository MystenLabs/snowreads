In this paper, we construct the wave\nfunction and probability distribution by adopting the quantum version of the\nBPS equation instead of the usual Wheeler-DeWitt equation in a minisuperspace\nquantum cosmology with spatially uniform scalar fields. Although the model\ntreated in this study is technically valid for a limited form of scalar\npotential, we show that it is possible to construct a conserved probability\ncurrent in our model. We also examine classical and quantum aspects of models\nwith the Dirac-Born-Infeld type scalar fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
