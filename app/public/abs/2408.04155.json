We\nprovide a full proof of the formula for the asymptotic variance for real-valued\nfunctionals on $\\phi$-irreducible reversible Markov chains, first introduced by\nKipnis and Varadhan. Given two Markov kernels $P$ and $Q$ with stationary\nmeasure $\\pi$, we say that the Markov kernel $P$ efficiency dominates the\nMarkov kernel $Q$ if the asymptotic variance with respect to $P$ is at most the\nasymptotic variance with respect to $Q$ for every real-valued functional $f\\in\nL^2(\\pi)$. Assuming only a basic background in functional analysis, we prove\nthat for two $\\phi$-irreducible reversible Markov kernels $P$ and $Q$, $P$\nefficiency dominates $Q$ if and only if the operator $Q-P$, where $P$ is the\noperator on $L^2(\\pi)$ that maps $f\\mapsto\\int f(y)P(\\cdot,dy)$ and similarly\nfor $Q$, is positive on $L^2(\\pi)$, i.e. $\\langle f,(Q-P)f\\rangle\\geq0$ for\nevery $f\\in L^2(\\pi)$. We use this result to show that reversible antithetic\nkernels are more efficient than i.i.d. sampling, and that efficiency dominance\nis a partial ordering on $\\phi$-irreducible reversible Markov kernels. We also\nprovide a proof based on that of Tierney that Peskun dominance is a sufficient\ncondition for efficiency dominance for reversible kernels. Using these results,\nwe show that Markov kernels formed by randomly selecting other \"component\"\nMarkov kernels will always efficiency dominate another Markov kernel formed in\nthis way, as long as the component kernels of the former efficiency dominate\nthose of the latter. These results on the efficiency dominance of combining\ncomponent kernels generalises the results on the efficiency dominance of\ncombined chains introduced by Neal and Rosenthal from finite state spaces to\ngeneral state spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
