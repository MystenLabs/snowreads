We also develop a synthesis\nalgorithm that given a program with holes in conditions and assignments, fills\nthe holes so that the synthesized program satisfies the given $CTL^*$\nspecification.\n  We prove that our verification and synthesis algorithms are both sound and\nrelative complete. Finally, we present case studies to demonstrate the\napplicability of our algorithms for $CTL^*$ verification and synthesis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
