We show\nthat this problem is NP-hard to approximate beyond a factor of $\\frac{e}{e-1}$,\nand provide a $\\frac{4e}{e-1}$-approximate offline algorithm. For the online\nsetting, we show that no non-trivial approximations are achievable under\nadversarial arrivals. Under i.i.d. arrivals, we present a polytime online\nalgorithm that provides a constant approximation of the optimal\n(computationally-unbounded) online algorithm. In contrast, we show that no\nconstant approximation of the ex-post optimum is achievable by an online\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
