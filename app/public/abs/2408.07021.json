Given a stream of updates $x_1,x_2,\\dots,x_T \\in \\{0,1\\}$\nthe problem is to continuously release estimates of the prefix sums\n$\\sum_{i=1}^t x_i$ for $t=1,\\dots,T$ while protecting each input $x_i$ in the\nstream with differential privacy. Recently, significant leaps have been made in\nour understanding of this problem under $\\textit{approximate}$ differential\nprivacy, aka. $(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$$\\textit{-differential privacy}$. However,\nfor the classical case of $\\varepsilon$-differential privacy, we are not aware\nof any improvement in mean squared error since the work of Honaker (TPDP 2015).\nIn this paper we present such an improvement, reducing the mean squared error\nby a factor of about 4, asymptotically. The key technique is a new\ngeneralization of the binary tree mechanism that uses a $k$-ary number system\nwith $\\textit{negative digits}$ to improve the privacy-accuracy trade-off. Our\nmechanism improves the mean squared error over all 'optimal'\n$(\\varepsilon,\\delta)$-differentially private factorization mechanisms based on\nGaussian noise whenever $\\delta$ is sufficiently small. Specifically, using\n$k=19$ we get an asymptotic improvement over the bound given in the work by\nHenzinger, Upadhyay and Upadhyay (SODA 2023) when $\\delta = O(T^{-0.92})$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
