Firstly, we complete and expand the\ncharacterisation of isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of genus\nup to $2$ initiated by the first author et al. in previous work. Secondly, we\nshow that, for simple abelian surfaces, containing a curve of genus $3$ is\nequivalent to admitting a polarisation of degree $4$. Thanks to this result, we\ncan use existing algorithms to check which isomorphism classes in the isogeny\nclasses containing no genus $2$ curves have a polarisation of degree $4$.\nThirdly, we characterise isogeny classes of abelian surfaces with no curves of\ngenus $\\leq 2$, containing no abelian surface with a polarisation of degree\n$4$. Finally, we describe absolutely irreducible genus $3$ curves lying on\nabelian surfaces containing no curves of genus less than or equal to $2$, and\nshow that their number of rational points is far from the Serre-Weil bound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"PeEJXND-xcMiT7rQvdEfvF4LxlGnKDaCl5elDcQ7nWY","pdfSize":"406607"}
