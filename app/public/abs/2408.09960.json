To the best of\nour knowledge, this is the first study to conduct a comprehensive comparative\nanalysis among state-of-the-art causal discovery algorithms, benchmarked\nagainst non-causal feature selection techniques, in the application of\nforecasting asset returns. Empirical evaluations demonstrate the efficacy of\nour approach in yielding stable and accurate predictions, outperforming\nbaseline models, particularly in tumultuous market conditions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aZW-LWPuLuFxMA7P3l0yA5OCTWe-9JJ8oWNcOtsJFDg","pdfSize":"682991"}
