First, existing network anomaly detection and log\nanalysis methods are often challenged by high-dimensional data and complex\nnetwork topologies, resulting in unstable performance and high false-positive\nrates. In addition, traditional methods are usually difficult to handle\ntime-series data, which is crucial for anomaly detection and log analysis.\nTherefore, we need a more efficient and accurate method to cope with these\nproblems. To compensate for the shortcomings of current methods, we propose an\ninnovative fusion model that integrates Isolation Forest, GAN (Generative\nAdversarial Network), and Transformer with each other, and each of them plays a\nunique role. Isolation Forest is used to quickly identify anomalous data\npoints, and GAN is used to generate synthetic data with the real data\ndistribution characteristics to augment the training dataset, while the\nTransformer is used for modeling and context extraction on time series data.\nThe synergy of these three components makes our model more accurate and robust\nin anomaly detection and log analysis tasks. We validate the effectiveness of\nthis fusion model in an extensive experimental evaluation. Experimental results\nshow that our model significantly improves the accuracy of anomaly detection\nwhile reducing the false alarm rate, which helps to detect potential network\nproblems in advance. The model also performs well in the log analysis task and\nis able to quickly identify anomalous behaviors, which helps to improve the\nstability of the system. The significance of this study is that it introduces\nadvanced deep learning techniques, which work anomaly detection and log\nanalysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
