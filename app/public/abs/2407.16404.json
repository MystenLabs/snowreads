Traditional Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method\ncan model decision-making of generation companies (GENCOs), but faces\nchallenges due to uncertainties in policy functions, reward functions, and\ninter-agent interactions. Quantum computing offers a promising solution to\nresolve these uncertainties, and this paper introduces the Quantum Multi-Agent\nDeep Q-Network (Q-MADQN) method, which integrates variational quantum circuits\ninto the traditional MARL framework. The main contributions of the paper are:\nidentifying the correspondence between market uncertainties and quantum\nproperties, proposing the Q-MADQN algorithm for simulating electricity market\nbidding, and demonstrating that Q-MADQN allows for a more thorough exploration\nand simulates more potential bidding strategies of profit-oriented GENCOs,\ncompared to conventional methods, without compromising computational\nefficiency. The proposed method is illustrated on IEEE 30-bus test network,\nconfirming that it offers a more accurate model for simulating complex market\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
