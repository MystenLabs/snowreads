Analysts can use it to capture heterogeneity\nacross the unconditional distribution of $Y$ as well as obtain accurate\nestimation of the aggregated effect at the upper and lower tails of $Y$. (ii)\nThe semiparametric efficiency bound for an OCPPE is explicitly derived. (iii)\nWe propose an efficient debiased estimator for OCPPE, and provide feasible\nuniform inference procedures for the OCPPE process. (iv) The efficient doubly\nrobust score for an OCPPE can be used to optimize infinitesimal nudges to a\ncontinuous treatment by maximizing a quantile specific Empirical Welfare\nfunction. We illustrate the method by analyzing how anti-smoking policies\nimpact low percentiles of live infants' birthweights.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
