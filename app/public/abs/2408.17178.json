The\nmodel-independent grid dataset is published under the Open Data Commons Open\nDatabase (ODbL 1.0) licence and can be used for large-scale electricity as well\nas energy system modelling. The dataset and workflow are provided as part of\nPyPSA-Eur -- an open-source, sector-coupled optimisation model of the European\nenergy system. By integrating with the codebase for initiatives such as\nPyPSA-Earth, the value of open and maintainable high-voltage grid data extends\nto the global context. By accessing the latest data through the the Overpass\nturbo API, the dataset can be easily reconstructed and updated within minutes.\nTo assess the data quality, this paper further compares the dataset with\nofficial statistics and representative model runs using PyPSA-Eur based on\ndifferent electricity grid representations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Hr_fDyctkjAlPthLLRqhy8lOQ5S3olqHVUIy86BvWtE","pdfSize":"29406409"}
