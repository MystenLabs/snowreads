Specifically, we consider\ntruthful mechanisms outputting allocations that satisfy EF$^{+u}_{-v}$, where,\nin an EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ allocation, for any pair of agents $i$ and $j$, agent $i$\nwill not envy agent $j$ if $u$ items were added to $i$'s bundle and $v$ items\nwere removed from $j$'s bundle. Previous work easily indicates that, when\nrestricted to deterministic mechanisms, truthfulness will lead to a poor\nguarantee of fairness: even with two agents, for any $u$ and $v$,\nEF$^{+u}_{-v}$ cannot be guaranteed by truthful mechanisms when the number of\nitems is large enough. In this work, we focus on randomized mechanisms, where\nwe consider ex-ante truthfulness and ex-post fairness. For two agents, we\npresent a truthful mechanism that achieves EF$^{+0}_{-1}$ (i.e., the\nwell-studied fairness notion EF$1$). For three agents, we present a truthful\nmechanism that achieves EF$^{+1}_{-1}$. For $n$ agents in general, we show that\nthere exist truthful mechanisms that achieve EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ for some $u$ and\n$v$ that depend only on $n$ (not $m$).\n  We further consider fair and truthful mechanisms that also satisfy the\nstandard efficiency guarantee: Pareto-optimality. We provide a mechanism that\nsimultaneously achieves truthfulness, EF$1$, and Pareto-optimality for\nbi-valued utilities (where agents' valuation on each item is either $p$ or $q$\nfor some $p>q\\geq0$). For tri-valued utilities (where agents' valuations on\neach item belong to $\\{p,q,r\\}$ for some $p>q>r\\geq0$) and any $u,v$, we show\nthat truthfulness is incompatible with EF$^{+u}_{-v}$ and Pareto-optimality\neven for two agents.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
