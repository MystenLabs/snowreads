By considering slow rotation we are\nable to reduce the number of equations yielding a system of ordinary\ndifferential equations that is conveniently solved numerically without the need\nof expensive computational resources. We find sequences of solutions and\ndescribe some of their physical properties such as, total mass, angular\nmomentum and compactness. We also consider the dynamics of particles\n(geodesics) in the resulting spacetime. A detailed comparison with fully\nrotating boson stars (non-linear treatment) is performed by showing the region\nof validity of the slow-rotation approximation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
