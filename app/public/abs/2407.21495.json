These non-degeneracy conditions are,\nin many applications, difficult to check. We propose here a setting in which\nthese are automatic. Rather than functions, we consider correspondences which\nhave a better behaviour.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"pcLtKwU-aAj-jxX_d2Ykv3uIHhcKRDca2iUZJYpUhlY","pdfSize":"554660"}
