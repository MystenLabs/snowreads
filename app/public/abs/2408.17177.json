This paper explores the optimal strategies\nof the werewolf game from the perspective of game theory, focusing on cases\nboth with and without prophet. First we examine the existing strategy in game\nwithout prophet and propose ``random strategy +\", which provides an improved\nwinning probability for the werewolve group. Then we further study the game\nwith prophet, and find the game with prophet can be transformed into a\nextensive game with complete but imperfect information under a specific rule.\nWe construct a model and design an algorithm to achieve PBE and maximize the\ncitizen group's winning probability. In the end, we examine a property of PBE\nin game without any restriction.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
