This is motivated by the presence of a 2170-day Long Secondary\nPeriod (LSP) in Betelgeuse's lightcurve, a periodicity $\\approx5$ times longer\nthan the star's 416 day fundamental radial pulsation mode. While binarity is\ncurrently the leading hypothesis for LSPs in general, the LSP and the radial\nvelocity variation observed in Betelgeuse, taken together, necessitate a\nrevision of the prevailing physical picture. The lightcurve-RV phase difference\nrequires a companion to be behind Betelgeuse at the LSP luminosity minimum, 180\ndegrees out of phase with the system orientation associated with occultation.\nWe demonstrate the consistency of this model with available observational\nconstraints and identify tensions in all other proposed LSP hypotheses. Within\nthis framework, we calculate a mass for $\\alpha$ Ori B of $1.17\\pm0.7\\,M_\\odot$\nand an orbital separation of $1850\\pm70\\,R_\\odot$, or $2.43^{+0.21}_{-0.32}$\ntimes the radius of Betelgeuse. We then describe the features of the companion\nas constrained by the fundamental parameters of Betelgeuse and its orbital\nsystem, and discuss what would be required to confirm the companion's existence\nobservationally.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
