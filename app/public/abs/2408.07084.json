The DHCE model innovates by identifying and\ndifferentiating acute and chronic diseases within a patient's visit history,\nconstructing dynamic hypergraphs that capture the complex, high-order\ninteractions between diseases. It surpasses traditional recurrent neural\nnetworks and graph neural networks by effectively integrating clinical event\ndata, reflected through medical language model-assisted encoding, into a robust\npatient representation. Through extensive experiments on two benchmark\ndatasets, MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV, the DHCE model exhibits superior performance,\nsignificantly outpacing established baseline models in the precision of\nsequential diagnosis prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
