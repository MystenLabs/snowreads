This allows\nus to have an entropy estimate, a criterion for the finiteness of it and a\nbound on the difference of entropy, additionally, we did some numerical tests\nthat show the efficiency of our approximations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
