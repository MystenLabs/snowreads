However, currently available quantum devices suffer from noisy\nquantum gates, which degrade the fidelity of executed quantum circuits.\nTherefore, quantum circuit optimization is crucial for obtaining useful\nresults. In this paper, we present QuCLEAR, a compilation framework designed to\noptimize quantum circuits. QuCLEAR significantly reduces both the two-qubit\ngate count and the circuit depth through two novel optimization steps. First,\nwe introduce the concept of Clifford Extraction, which extracts Clifford\nsubcircuits to the end of the circuit while optimizing the gates. Second, since\nClifford circuits are classically simulatable, we propose Clifford Absorption,\nwhich efficiently processes the extracted Clifford subcircuits classically. We\ndemonstrate our framework on quantum simulation circuits, which have\nwide-ranging applications in quantum chemistry simulation, many-body physics,\nand combinatorial optimization problems. Near-term algorithms such as VQE and\nQAOA also fall within this category. Experimental results across various\nbenchmarks show that QuCLEAR achieves up to a $77.7\\%$ reduction in CNOT gate\ncount and up to an $84.1\\%$ reduction in entangling depth compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
