LiFCal accurately determines model parameters\nfrom a moving camera sequence without precise calibration targets, integrating\narbitrary metric scaling constraints. It optimizes intrinsic parameters of the\nlight field camera model, the 3D coordinates of a sparse set of scene points\nand camera poses in a single bundle adjustment defined directly on micro image\npoints.\n  We show that LiFCal can reliably and repeatably calibrate a focused plenoptic\ncamera using different input sequences, providing intrinsic camera parameters\nextremely close to state-of-the-art methods, while offering two main\nadvantages: it can be applied in a target-free scene, and it is implemented\nonline in a complete and continuous pipeline.\n  Furthermore, we demonstrate the quality of the obtained camera parameters in\ndownstream tasks like depth estimation and SLAM.\n  Webpage: https://lifcal.github.io/\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
