Our analysis covers the case of\nnonlinear autonomous functionals depending on the gradient, as well as more\ngeneral double phase and multiphase functionals with $(2,q)$-growth in the\ngradient. We show that all these cases fall in a class of nonlinear functionals\nfor which we are able to prove weak and strong unique continuation via the\nalmost-monotonicity of Almgren's frequency formula. As a consequence, we obtain\nestimates on the dimension of the set of points at which both the solution and\nits gradient vanish.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
