This paper addresses this challenge with\na deadlock recovery strategy. In particular, the proposed algorithm integrates\nhybrid-A$^\\star$, STL, and MPPI frameworks. Specifically, hybrid-A$^\\star$\ngenerates a reference path, STL defines a goal (deadlock avoidance) and\nassociated constraints (w.r.t. traffic rules), and MPPI refines the path and\nspeed accordingly. This STL-MPPI framework ensures system compliance to\nspecifications and dynamics while ensuring the safety of the resulting\nmaneuvers, indicating a strong potential for application to complex traffic\nscenarios (and rules) in practice. Validation studies are conducted in\nsimulations and on scaled cars, respectively, to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
