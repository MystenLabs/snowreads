With that aim, we\nsimulated the profiles of optical spectral lines emitted from the broad line\nregion (BLR) as well as X-ray spectral lines emitted from the relativistic\naccretion disks around both black holes and compared them with each other. The\nobtained results showed that SMBHBs could cause a specific, but different\nvariability of the lines from the optical part and Fe K$\\alpha$ line, leaving\npotentially detectable imprints in their profiles. Since these imprints depend\non the orbital phase of the system, they could be used for reconstructing the\nKeplerian orbits of the components in the observed SMBHBs. Moreover, such\nsignatures in the optical and X-ray line profiles of the observed SMBHBs could\nbe used as a tool for the detection of these objects as well as for studying\ntheir properties.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
