The\ndeterministic declination of our pattern has no empirical power, but it allows\nto define a degree of self-punishment, which measures the extent of the denial\nof pleasure adopted by the DM in her decision. We analyze irrational choices\nthat display the lowest degree of self-punishment, and a characterization of\nthem is provided. Moreover, we characterize the choice behavior that exhibits\nthe highest degree of self-punishment, and we show that it comprises almost all\nchoices. We also characterize stochastic self-punishment, which collects all\nthe Random Utility Models (RUMs) whose support is restricted to the harmful\ndistortions of some preference. Full identification of the DM's preference and\nrandomization over its harmful distortions is allowed if each alternative is\nselected from the ground set with probability greater than zero. Finally, the\ndegree of self-punishment of harmful stochastic choices is characterized.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
