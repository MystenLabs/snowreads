Even though they can be helpful in the proper situations, they\nare limited in the sense that they work just by looking at past, as if we were\ndriving with our focus on the rearview mirror. In this paper, we advocate for\nthe use of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning techniques to predict\nfuture market trends. These predictions, when done properly, can improve the\nperformance of asset managers by increasing returns and reducing drawdowns.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
