However, there is a lack of comprehensive summaries that\nconsolidate these advancements. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the\nfirst to provide a comprehensive review of time series analysis techniques\nspecifically within the educational context. We begin by exploring the\nlandscape of educational data analytics, categorizing various data sources and\ntypes relevant to education. We then review four prominent time series\nmethods-forecasting, classification, clustering, and anomaly\ndetection-illustrating their specific application points in educational\nsettings. Subsequently, we present a range of educational scenarios and\napplications, focusing on how these methods are employed to address diverse\neducational tasks, which highlights the practical integration of multiple time\nseries methods to solve complex educational problems. Finally, we conclude with\na discussion on future directions, including personalized learning analytics,\nmultimodal data fusion, and the role of large language models (LLMs) in\neducational time series. The contributions of this paper include a detailed\ntaxonomy of educational data, a synthesis of time series techniques with\nspecific educational applications, and a forward-looking perspective on\nemerging trends and future research opportunities in educational analysis.
