A closed mathematical model of linear spherical perturbations in a\ncosmological medium of a scalar-charged ideal fluid with scalar Higgs\ninteraction is formulated. It is shown that spherical perturbations of the\nFriedmann metric are possible only in the presence of an isotropic fluid. At\nsingular points of the background cosmological model, perturbations of the\nmetric do not occur and perturbations are described by a vacuum-field model.\nExact ones at singular points of the cosmological system are obtained and it is\nshown that in the case of a stable singular point of the cosmological system,\nperturbations of the scalar field represent traveling waves, and in the case of\nan unstable singular point, perturbations represent exponentially growing\nstanding waves. Using numerical modeling, the formation of a stratified halo in\nthe form of growing standing waves is shown.\n  Key words: scalar charged plasma, cosmological model, scalar Higgs field,\ngravitational stability, spherical perturbations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
