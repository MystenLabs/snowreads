However, under the two foremost models, Deutsch's prescription (D-CTCs)\nand postselected teleportation (P-CTCs), the CV system is treated very\ndifferently: D-CTCs assign a definite form to the state on this system, while\nP-CTCs do not. To further explore this distinction, we present a methodology by\nwhich an operational notion of state may be assigned to their respective CV\nsystems. This is accomplished via a conjunction of state tomography and weak\nmeasurements, with the latter being essential in leaving any notions of\nself-consistency intact. With this technique, we are able to verify the\npredictions of D-CTCs and, perhaps more significantly, operationally assign a\nstate to the system on the P-CTC. We show that, for any given combination of\nchronology-respecting input and unitary interaction, it is always possible to\nrecover the unique state on the P-CTC, and we provide a few specific examples\nin the context of select archetypal temporal paradoxes. We also demonstrate how\nthis state may be derived from analysis of the P-CTC prescription itself, and\nwe explore how it compares to its counterpart in the CV state predicted by\nD-CTCs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
