This study addresses the need for\naccurate ice sheet data interpretation by introducing a suite of quantitative\nmetrics designed to validate ice sheet annotation techniques. Focusing on both\nmanual and automated methods, including ARESELP and its modified version,\nMARESELP, we assess their accuracy against expert annotations. Our methodology\nincorporates several computer vision metrics, traditionally underutilized in\nglaciological research, to evaluate the continuity and connectivity of ice\nlayer annotations. The results demonstrate that while manual annotations\nprovide invaluable expert insights, automated methods, particularly MARESELP,\nimprove layer continuity and alignment with expert labels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
