We find non-decoupling of the\nFaddeev-Popov ghosts and non-conventional UV singularities in dimensional\nregularization. The known QCD amplitudes with asymptotic freedom are reproduced\nonly after summing propagator and vertex corrections. By quantizing gluons in\nthe Feynman gauge on the FD gauge background, we obtain the one-loop improved\nFD gauge amplitudes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
