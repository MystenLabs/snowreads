Lie groups are\nabstract structures that are composable, invertible and differentiable. They\nare pervasive as models of continuous transformations and symmetries in areas\nfrom theoretical particle physics, where they underpin gauge theories such as\nthe Standard Model, to the study of differential equations and robotics.\nFormalisation of mathematics in an interactive theorem prover, such as\nIsabelle, provides strong correctness guarantees by expressing definitions and\ntheorems in a logic that can be checked by a computer. Many libraries of\nformalised mathematics lack significant development of textbook material beyond\nundergraduate level, and this contribution to mathematics in Isabelle aims to\nreduce that gap, particularly in differential geometry. We comment on\nrepresentational choices and challenges faced when integrating complex\nformalisations, such as smoothness of vector fields, with the restrictions of\nthe simple type theory of HOL. This contribution paves the way for extensions\nboth in advanced mathematics, and in formalisations in natural science.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
