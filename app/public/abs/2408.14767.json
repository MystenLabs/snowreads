Combining the quantum mean-field, semiclassical, and\nDebye length limits, we prove the global derivation of the 1D Vlasov-Poisson\nequation. We tackle the difficulties brought by the pure state data, whose\nWigner transforms converge to Wigner measures. We find new weighted uniform\nestimates around which we build the proof. As a result, we obtain, globally,\nstronger limits, and hence the global existence of solutions to the 1D\nVlasov-Poisson equation subject to such Wigner measure data, which satisfy\nconservation laws of mass, momentum, and energy, despite being measure\nsolutions. This happens to solve the 1D case of an open problem regarding the\nconservation law of the Vlasov-Poisson equation raised in [18] by Diperna and\nLions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
