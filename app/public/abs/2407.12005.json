In this work,\nwe focus on the task of automatically evaluating the quality of video course\ncontent. We have constructed a dataset with a substantial collection of video\ncourses and teaching materials. We propose three evaluation principles and\ndesign a new evaluation framework, \\textit{VCEval}, based on these principles.\nThe task is modeled as a multiple-choice question-answering task, with a\nlanguage model serving as the evaluator. Our method effectively distinguishes\nvideo courses of different content quality and produces a range of\ninterpretable results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l47m_g6xna0cBDWNDx-YlNfn4k_vYdMO7-7PZbxoU1Q","pdfSize":"1214921"}
