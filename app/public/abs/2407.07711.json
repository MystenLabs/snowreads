The problem is relevant not only\nfrom the foundational perspective but also has direct applications in quantum\ncorrelation problems fueled by incompatible measurements. Although central,\nonly a few analytical criteria exist for deciding the incompatibility of\ngeneral sets of measurements. This work approaches the problem through\nfunctions defined on the Boolean hypercube and their Fourier transformations.\nWe show that this reformulation of the problem leads to a complete geometric\ncharacterisation of joint measurability of any finite set of unbiased binary\nqubit measurements and gives a necessary condition for the biased case. We\ndiscuss our results in the realm of quantum steering, where they translate into\na family of steering inequalities. When certain unbiasedness conditions are\nfulfilled, these criteria are tight, hence fully characterizing the steering\nproblem when the trusted party holds a qubit, and the untrusted party performs\nany finite number of binary measurements. We further discuss how our results\npoint towards a second-order cone programming approach to measurement\nincompatibility and compare this to the predominantly used semi-definite\nprogramming-based techniques. We use our approach to falsify an existing\nconjecture on measurement incompatibility of special sets of measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
