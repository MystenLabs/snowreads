In agricultural\nsettings, conventional serial or parallel robotic arms often fall short in\nmeeting the demands for a large workspace, rapid movement, enhanced capability\nof obstacle avoidance and affordability. This study proposes a novel hybrid\nsix-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic arm that combines the advantages of\nparallel and serial mechanisms. Inspired by yoga, we designed two sliders\ncapable of moving independently along a single rail, acting as two feet. These\nsliders are interconnected with linkages and a meshed-gear set, allowing the\nparallel mechanism to lower itself and perform a split to pass under obstacles.\nThis unique feature allows the arm to avoid obstacles such as pipes, tables and\nbeams typically found in greenhouses. Integrated with serially mounted joints,\nthe patented hybrid arm is able to maintain the end's pose even when it moves\nwith a mobile platform, facilitating fruit picking with the optimal pose in\ndynamic conditions. Moreover, the hybrid arm's workspace is substantially\nlarger, being almost three times the volume of UR3 serial arms and fourteen\ntimes that of the ABB IRB parallel arms. Experiments show that the\nrepeatability errors are 0.017 mm, 0.03 mm and 0.109 mm for the two sliders and\nthe arm's end, respectively, providing sufficient precision for agricultural\nrobots.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
