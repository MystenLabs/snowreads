The project aims to promote ecological\nconsciousness by creating a balance in digital seaweed ecologies. Inspired by\nthe real species \"Laminaria saccharina\", the author employs Procedural Content\nGeneration via Machine Learning technology to generate variations of virtual\nseaweeds and symbiotic fungi. The audience can explore the consequences of\nhuman activities through gameplay and observe the ecosystem's feedback on the\nbenefits and risks of seaweed aquaculture. This Benefit Game offers dynamic and\nreal-time responsive artificial seaweed ecosystems for an interactive\nexperience that enhances ecological consciousness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
