This rise\nreflects their ability to meet users' convenience, efficiency, and\naffordability needs. However, in busy areas and surge zones, the benefits of\nthese platforms can diminish, prompting riders to relocate to cheaper, more\nconvenient locations or seek alternative transportation.\n  While much research has focused on the strategic behavior of drivers, the\nstrategic actions of riders, especially when it comes to riders walking outside\nof surge zones, remain under-explored. This paper examines the impact of\nrider-side strategic behavior on surge dynamics. We investigate how riders'\nactions influence market dynamics, including supply, demand, and pricing. We\nshow significant impacts, such as spillover effects where demand increases in\nareas adjacent to surge zones and prices surge in nearby areas. Our theoretical\ninsights and experimental results highlight that rider strategic behavior helps\nredistribute demand, reduce surge prices, and clear demand in a more balanced\nway across zones.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
