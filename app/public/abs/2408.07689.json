Consequently, a deluge of near-duplicates can be circulated\nonline posing copyright infringement concerns. The concerns are more severe\nwhen biometric data is altered through such nuanced transformations. In this\nwork, we address the challenge of near-duplicate detection in face images by,\nfirstly, identifying the original image from a set of near-duplicates and,\nsecondly, deducing the relationship between the original image and the\nnear-duplicates. We construct a tree-like structure, called an Image Phylogeny\nTree (IPT) using a graph-theoretic approach to estimate the relationship, i.e.,\ndetermine the sequence in which they have been generated. We further extend our\nmethod to create an ensemble of IPTs known as Image Phylogeny Forests (IPFs).\nWe rigorously evaluate our method to demonstrate robustness across other\nmodalities, unseen transformations by latest generative models and IPT\nconfigurations, thereby significantly advancing the state-of-the-art\nperformance by 42% on IPF reconstruction accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"IedLsyLompkGYHZ1Czz2r52zmgy-ZMKi52T7Tmqq_pU","pdfSize":"5325653"}
