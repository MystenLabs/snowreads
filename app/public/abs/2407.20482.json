In particular, we discuss two\nconfigurations for distinct frequency ranges of HFGWs: Cavity 1, mostly\nsensitive at a frequency range of 252.8 - 333.2 MHz, and Cavity 2, at 2.504 -\n3.402 GHz, which is a scaled down version of Cavity 1. We find that Cavity 1\nwill reach sensitivity to strains of the HFGWs of order $h_1\\sim 10^{-21}$,\nwhile Cavity 2 will reach $h_2\\sim 10^{-20}$. These represent the best\nestimations of the RADES-BabyIAXO cavities as HFGWs detectors, showing how this\nset-up can produce groundbreaking results in axion physics and HFGWs\nsimultaneously.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HYeow7BVGayKU2vHl14bIJppmLEw-97ap_I4a6Lout8","pdfSize":"1845431"}
