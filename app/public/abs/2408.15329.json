Using\nlocally addressed excited-state Stark shifts to tune atoms out of resonance, we\nrealize site-selective hyperfine-state cavity readout across a 10-site array.\nThe state discrimination fidelity is 0.994(1) for one atom and 0.989(2)\naveraged over the entire array at a survival probability of 0.975(1). To\nfurther speed up array readout, we demonstrate adaptive search strategies\nutilizing global/subset checks. Finally, we demonstrate repeated rounds of\nclassical error correction, showing exponential suppression of logical error\nand extending logical memory fivefold beyond the single-bit idling lifetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JOY_vF4mWEkn8akXaCB7V1spiZ0a8ynCezfyUrk7qLs","pdfSize":"1271403"}
