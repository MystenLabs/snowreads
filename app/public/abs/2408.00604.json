Each layer consists of a composite material, typically a\ndielectric matrix filled with magnetic entities (powder or wires). Combining\nthe two types of materials into a bilayer structure has shown unprecedented\nimprovements in microwave absorption capacities compared to the former\nabsorption of each layer. The potential of random magnets to create thin\nbroadband absorbers is also demonstrated. The capacity to improve the shielding\nbehavior is strongly related to each layer's permittivity, permeability, and\nthickness. This provides strong control over the design of novel materials for\nstealth applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ofX5yTH52YW02HraErR0Qfx2IxLLfw_nbljLU7NqTtk","pdfSize":"829278"}
