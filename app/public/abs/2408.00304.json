For time independent problems, boundary\ncorrectors $\\mathcal{D}^m$ and $\\mathcal{N}^{m}$ for Dirichlet, Neumann, and\nRobin conditions are designed. For time dependent problems, a scheme to update\nthe boundary correctors is formulated. Error analysis in both cases is given to\nshow the first-order convergence in energy norm with respect to the coarse mesh\nsize $H$ and second-order convergence in $L^2-$norm, as verified by numerical\nexamples, with which different finite difference schemes are compared for\ntemporal discretization. Nonlinear problems are also demonstrated in\ncombination with Strang splitting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
