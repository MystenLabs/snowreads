{"id":"2408.00156","title":"Measuring Falseness in News Articles based on Concealment and\n  Overstatement","authors":"Jiyoung Lee, Keeheon Lee","authorsParsed":[["Lee","Jiyoung",""],["Lee","Keeheon",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 31 Jul 2024 20:45:56 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-02","timestamp":1722458756000,"abstract":"  This research investigates the extent of misinformation in certain\njournalistic articles by introducing a novel measurement tool to assess the\ndegrees of falsity. It aims to measure misinformation using two metrics\n(concealment and overstatement) to explore how information is interpreted as\nfalse. This should help examine how articles containing partly true and partly\nfalse information can potentially harm readers, as they are more challenging to\nidentify than completely fabricated information. In this study, the full story\nprovided by the fact-checking website serves as a standardized source of\ninformation for comparing differences between fake and real news. The result\nsuggests that false news has greater concealment and overstatement, due to\nlonger and more complex new stories being shortened and ambiguously phrased.\nWhile there are no major distinctions among categories of politics science and\ncivics, it demonstrates that misinformation lacks crucial details while\nsimultaneously containing more redundant words. Hence, news articles containing\npartial falsity, categorized as misinformation, can deceive inattentive readers\nwho lack background knowledge. Hopefully, this approach instigates future\nfact-checkers, journalists, and the readers to secure high quality articles for\na resilient information environment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
