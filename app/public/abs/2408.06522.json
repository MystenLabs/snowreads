We\nbuilt DriveStats: a reusable library (and encompassing an mobile app) to\nmonitor driving trips and display related information. By providing estimated\ncost/emission reductions in a goal directed framework, we demonstrate how\ninformation utility can increase over the course of a 10 day diary study with a\ngroup of North American participants. Participants were initially interested in\nmonetary savings reported increased utility for emissions-related information\nwith increased app usage and resulted in self-reported sustainable behavior\nchange. The DriveStats package can be used as a research probe for a plurality\nof mobility studies (driving, cycling, walking, etc.) for supporting mobile\ntransportation research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
