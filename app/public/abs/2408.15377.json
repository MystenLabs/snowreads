This framework extends the work\nof Raghavendra [STOC, 2008], who showed a similar result for almost satisfiable\nMax-CSPs.\n  Our framework is based on a new hybrid approximation algorithm, which uses a\ncombination of the Gaussian elimination technique (i.e., solving a system of\nlinear equations over an Abelian group) and the semidefinite programming\nrelaxation. We complement our algorithm with a matching dictator vs.\nquasirandom test that has perfect completeness.\n  The analysis of our dictator vs. quasirandom test is based on a novel\ninvariance principle, which we call the mixed invariance principle. Our mixed\ninvariance principle is an extension of the invariance principle of Mossel,\nO'Donnell and Oleszkiewicz [Annals of Mathematics, 2010] which plays a crucial\nrole in Raghavendra's work. The mixed invariance principle allows one to relate\n3-wise correlations over discrete probability spaces with expectations over\nspaces that are a mixture of Guassian spaces and Abelian groups, and may be of\nindependent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
