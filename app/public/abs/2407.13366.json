We assume\nthe CBD to be a standard disk and adopt the orbit-averaged irradiation flux\nbecause the viscous timescale is much longer than the orbital period. We then\nsolve the energy equation both analytically and numerically to compute the CBD\ntemperature distribution and the corresponding disk spectrum. We find that the\nanalytically calculated spectra are in good agreement with the numerical ones.\nThe CBD spectrum is almost independent of the binary mass ratio. We also find\nthat the combined spectra of two minidisks and the CBD have double peaks, one\npeak in the soft X-ray band and the other in the infrared (IR) band. The former\npeak comes from the two minidisks, while the latter peak from the CBD. The\nobserved flux density increases with frequency as $\\nu^{1/3}$ towards the soft\nX-ray peak, while it decreases with frequency away from the IR peak as\n$\\nu^{-5/3}$. The latter feature is testable with near-IR observations with\nSubaru and JWST.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
