It was conjectured in 2004 by Dyn and Farkhi\nthat $d^2$ is subadditive on compact sets in $\\mathbb{R}^n$. In 2018 this\nconjecture was proved false by Fradelizi et al. when $n\\geq3$. The conjecture\ncan also be verified when $n=1$. In this paper we prove the conjecture when\n$n=2$ and in doing so we prove an interesting representation of the sumset\n$\\text{conv}(A)+\\text{conv}(B)$ for full dimensional compact sets $A,B$ in\n$\\mathbb{R}^2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
