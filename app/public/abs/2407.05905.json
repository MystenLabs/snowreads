However, the feedback\noverhead associated with CSI significantly hampers the throughput improvements.\nRecent advancements in deep learning (DL) have transformed the approach to CSI\nfeedback in cellular systems. Drawing inspiration from the successes witnessed\nin the realm of mobile communications, this paper introduces a DL-based CSI\nfeedback framework, named EFNet, tailored for Wi-Fi systems. The proposed\nframework leverages an autoencoder to achieve precise feedback with minimal\noverhead. The process involves the station utilizing the encoder to compress\nand quantize a series of matrices into codeword bit streams, which are then fed\nback to the access point. Subsequently, the decoder installed at the AP\nreconstructs beamforming matrices from these bit streams. We implement the\nEFNet system using standard Wi-Fi equipment operating in the 2.4 GHz band.\nExperimental findings in an office environment reveal a remarkable 80.77%\nreduction in feedback overhead compared to the 802.11ac standard, alongside a\nsignificant boost in net throughput of up to 30.72%.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
