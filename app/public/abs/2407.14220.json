Stochastic model predictive control (MPC) can\naccount for such uncertainties and approximately bound the probability of a\ncollision to take place. In this paper, to counteract the rapidly growing human\nmotion uncertainty over time, we incorporate state feedback in the stochastic\nMPC. This allows the robot to more closely track reference trajectories. To\nthis end the feedback policy is left as a degree of freedom in the optimal\ncontrol problem. The stochastic MPC with feedback is validated in simulation\nexperiments and is compared against nominal MPC and stochastic MPC without\nfeedback. The added computation time can be limited by reducing the number of\nadditional variables for the feedback law with a small compromise in control\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
