While tasks like arithmetic reasoning involve\nclear, definitive answers and logical chains of thought, the application of LLM\nreasoning in recommendation systems (RecSys) presents a distinct challenge.\nRecSys tasks revolve around subjectivity and personalized preferences, an\nunder-explored domain in utilizing LLMs' reasoning capabilities. Our study\nexplores several aspects to better understand reasoning for RecSys and\ndemonstrate how task quality improves by utilizing LLM reasoning in both\nzero-shot and finetuning settings. Additionally, we propose RecSAVER\n(Recommender Systems Automatic Verification and Evaluation of Reasoning) to\nautomatically assess the quality of LLM reasoning responses without the\nrequirement of curated gold references or human raters. We show that our\nframework aligns with real human judgment on the coherence and faithfulness of\nreasoning responses. Overall, our work shows that incorporating reasoning into\nRecSys can improve personalized tasks, paving the way for further advancements\nin recommender system methodologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FV8_t_TxLD6oWfCEBBrP6mrY9wlLOcpKD2CDokYCsOA","pdfSize":"986890"}
