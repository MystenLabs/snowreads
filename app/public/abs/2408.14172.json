The 2.5 $\\mu$m Py square of 160 nm thickness forms\na vortex flux-closure pattern with domain walls that fall into alternating\nout-of-plane magnetization states due to the interplay of in-plane shape and\ngrowth-induced perpendicular anisotropies. Dynamic modes of the domain wall\nstructure were excitable along with the vortex core gyration with frequencies\nof 500 MHz and 1 GHz. Micromagnetic simulations served to corroborate the\nimaged domain wall motion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
