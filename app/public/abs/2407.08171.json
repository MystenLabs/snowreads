Employing a\nnovel data donation model, we developed a tool that allows users to voluntarily\nshare their interactions with public Facebook groups and pages, which we\nsubsequently enrich using CrowdTangle. This approach enabled the collection and\nanalysis of a dataset comprising over 1,200 American users. Our findings\nindicate that political content consumption on Facebook is relatively low,\naveraging around 17%, and exhibits significant demographic variations.\nAdditionally, we provide insights into the temporal trends of these\ninteractions. The main contributions of this research include a methodological\nframework for studying social media usage in a privacy-preserving manner, a\ncomprehensive dataset reflective of current engagement patterns, and\ndescriptive insights that highlight demographic disparities and trends over\ntime. This study enhances our understanding of social media's role in\ninformation dissemination and its implications for political engagement,\noffering a valuable resource for researchers and policymakers in a landscape\nwhere direct data access is diminishing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YukNty2mYGdG986BLqpG4Jwahr-65XWwK73yK9OVfAE","pdfSize":"1471963"}
