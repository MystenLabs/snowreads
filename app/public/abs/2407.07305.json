This includes cooling or heating the electrons\nin electrodes and absorbing or emitting photons in the resonator mode. Such\nsystems can be driven into a nonequilibrium state by applying either a voltage\nbias or a temperature gradient across the electrodes coupled to the quantum\ndot, or by employing an external coherent pump to excite the resonator. In this\nstudy, we present a semiclassical theory to describe the steady state of these\nstructures. We employ a combination of the Floquet-nonequilibrium Green's\nfunctions method and semiclassical laser theory to analyze a normal\nmetal-quantum dot-superconductor junction coupled to a resonator. Our\ninvestigation focuses on key parameters such as the average photon number and\nphase shift in the resonator, the charge current in the quantum dot, and the\nheat fluxes among different components of the system. We explore how\nphoton-assisted Andreev reflection and quasiparticle tunneling in the quantum\ndot can refrigerate the resonator mode and the normal metal electrode. We also\nexamine the influence of finite voltage and thermal biases on these processes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
