Using a Langmuir analysis and measurements\nat multiple concentrations, we extract the Gibbs free energy of adsorption,\nfinding it larger than typical thermal energies. Molecular simulations clarify\nthe role of polarizability in tuning the thermodynamics of adsorption, and\nestablish the preferential parallel alignment of guanidinium at the air-water\ninterface. Guanidinium is the first polyatomic cation proven to exhibit a\npropensity for the air-water interface. As such, these results expand on the\ngrowing body of work on specific ion adsorption.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FCOfE8zJ1GmfKQoENkGe9jjXoXnIJLfxk-YVV7EpiXQ","pdfSize":"9654862"}
