In this\npaper we introduce the Darboux stack of $X$, parametrizing local presentations\nof $X$ as a derived critical locus of a function $f$ on a smooth formal scheme\n$U$. Local invariants such as the Milnor number $\\mu_f$, the perverse sheaf of\nvanishing cycles $\\mathsf{P}_{U,f}$ and the category of matrix factorizations\n$\\mathsf{MF}(U,f)$ are naturally defined on the Darboux stack, without\nambiguity. The stack of non-degenerate flat quadratic bundles acts on the\nDarboux stack and our main theorem is the contractibility of the quotient stack\nwhen taking a further homotopy quotient identifying isotopic automorphisms. As\na corollary we recover the gluing results for vanishing cycles by\nBrav--Bussi--Dupont--Joyce--Szendr\\H oi. In a second part (to appear), we will\napply this general mechanism to glue the motives of the locally defined\ncategories of matrix factorizations $\\mathsf{MF}(U,f)$ under the prescription\nof additional orientation data, thus answering positively conjectures by\nKontsevich--Soibelman and Toda in motivic Donaldson--Thomas theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
