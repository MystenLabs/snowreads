In particular, the\ndescription of exceptional points (EPs) with coupled resonators have become\nwidespread. The on-chip realization of these functionalities is highly\nsignificant for integrated nanophotonics, but requires fine control techniques\nof the nanodevice properties. Here, we demonstrate pump-controlled directional\nemission of two coupled nanolasers that distantly interact via an integrated\nwaveguide. This coupling scheme unusually enables both frequency- and\nloss-couplings between two cavities, which can be advantageously exploited to\nreach EPs by either detuning the cavities or controlling the gain of\nnanolasers. The system can be readily reconfigured from bidirectional to\nunidirectional emission by adjusting the pump power.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0U16XCaDcK5Lg_VfAZuNDenA6SPWvfWj3M9s-Spxgqk","pdfSize":"763257"}
