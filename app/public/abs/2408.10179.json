Post-glacial surface\nenvironments during this time are recorded in cap carbonates: layers of\nlimestone or dolostone that directly overlie glacial deposits. Postulated\nenvironmental conditions that created the cap carbonates lack consensus largely\nbecause single hypotheses fail to explain the cap carbonates' global mass,\ndepositional timescales, and geochemistry of parent waters. Here, we present a\nglobal geologic carbon cycle model before, during, and after the second\nglaciation (i.e. the Marinoan) that explains cap carbonate characteristics. We\nfind a three-stage process for cap carbonate formation: (1) low-temperature\nseafloor weathering during glaciation generates deep-sea alkalinity; (2)\nvigorous post-glacial continental weathering supplies alkalinity to a\ncarbonate-saturated freshwater layer, rapidly precipitating cap carbonates; (3)\nmixing of post-glacial meltwater with deep-sea alkalinity prolongs cap\ncarbonate deposition. We suggest how future geochemical data and modeling\nrefinements could further assess our hypothesis.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
