Gaussian process regression stands out as a Bayesian machine\nlearning technique adept at addressing this multifaceted challenge. This paper\nintroduces a novel approach that blends the robustness of this Bayesian\ntechnique with the nuanced insights provided by the kernel perspective on\nquantum models, aimed at advancing quantum kernelized probabilistic\nforecasting. We incorporate a quantum feature map inspired by Ising\ninteractions and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing the temporal\ndependencies critical for precise forecasting. The optimization of our model's\nhyperparameters circumvents the need for computationally intensive gradient\ndescent by employing gradient-free Bayesian optimization. Comparative\nbenchmarks against established classical kernel models are provided, affirming\nthat our quantum-enhanced approach achieves competitive performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
