We study random walks within overlapping hyperspheres in\n12 to 45 dimensions, utilizing an algorithm for on-the-fly placement of the\nhyperspheres in conjunction with the kinetic Monte Carlo method. We find\nbehavior typical of viscous liquids; thus decreasing the hypersphere density\n(corresponding to decreasing the temperature) leads to a slowing down of the\ndynamics by many orders of magnitude. The shape of the mean-square displacement\nas a function of time is found to be very similar to that of the Kob-Andersen\nbinary Lennard-Jones mixture and the Random Barrier Model, which predicts well\nthe frequency-dependent fluidity of nine glass-forming liquids of different\nchemistry [Bierwirth et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 248001 (2017)].\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wOpAzQaScnrW4ry2Pas9M6xPCH2-56xx-dSpeIdixlY","pdfSize":"950165"}
