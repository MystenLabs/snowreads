Moreover, we show that both the finite-gap and multisoliton solutions\nare approximated in the thermodynamic limit by a generalization of the\nprimitive potentials introduced by V. Zakharov and his collaborators in the KdV\ncontext. Under certain assumptions on the spectral data for the finite gap\npotentials, we provide error estimates for the approximation on compact subsets\nof the $(x,t)$-plane.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
