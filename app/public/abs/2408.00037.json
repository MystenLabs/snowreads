This paper presents\nthe Hosting the Olympics Influence Evaluation Model (HOIEM) to assess these\nimpacts and propose sustainable solutions.We select indicators (economic,\nsocio-cultural, human, environmental and political) based on literature review\nand construct HOIEM. We use AHP and TOPSIS-EWM to determine the final weights\nfor these indicators. We identify 45 potential host cities based on IOC\nrequirements. For the Winter Olympics, secondary screening and the GM(1,1)\nmodel highlight Calgary, Canada as the top city. For the Summer Olympics, the\nSWOT analysis identifies Beijing, China. We propose to hold Spring, Summer,\nAutumn and Winter Olympics every 4 years, with fixed cities for Summer and\nWinter and bidding for Spring and Autumn.Finally, we conduct sensitivity\nanalysis for HOIEM, demonstrating the independence and relevance of selected\nindicators through semi-quantitative visual analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
