We derive the spin Boltzmann equation incorporating\nM{\\o}ller scattering process. We further consider two distinct scenarios using\nhard thermal loop approximations for simplification. In scenario (I), the\nvector charge distribution function is treated as off-equilibrium under the\nvalidity domain of gradient expansion. Remarkably, the polarization induced by\ngradients of thermal chemical potential and shear viscous tensors are modified,\nbut $\\delta\\mathcal{P}_{\\textrm{ }}^{\\mu}$ in this scenario does not depend on\nthe coupling constant. In scenario (II), the vector charge distribution\nfunction is assumed to be in local thermal equilibrium. Then collisional\ncorrections $\\delta\\mathcal{P}_{\\textrm{ }}^{\\mu}$ in this scenario are at\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\hbar^{2}\\partial^{2})$. Additionally, we evaluate the\n$\\delta\\mathcal{P}^{\\mu}$ using relaxation time approach for comparative\nanalysis. Our results establish the theoretical framework necessary for the\nfuture numerical investigations on the interaction corrections to spin\npolarization.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
