While we\nconcentrate on a given end-time target function the results hold also when the\ntarget function is given over the whole time horizon. When implicit time\ndiscretization and conforming finite elements in space are employed we show\nthat the reduced problem formulation has condition numbers which are bounded\nindependently of the discretization level in arbitrary space dimension. In\naddition we propose for the all-at-once approach, i.e. for the first order\nconditions of the unreduced system a preconditioner based on work by Greif and\nSch\\\"otzau, which provides also bounds on the eigenvalue distribution\nindependently of the discretization level. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthe obtained results and the efficiency of the suggested preconditioners.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
