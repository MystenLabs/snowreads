We show that rhombohedral trilayer\ngraphene exhibits a large bulk photovoltaic effect arising from a DC shift\ncurrent response. The conductivity of the trilayer contains features similar to\nAB bilayer graphene as well as features distinct from AB bilayer graphene. The\nnew features of ABC trilayer graphene relative to AB bilayer graphene arise\nfrom the quantum geometric features of the electronic band structure and can be\ntuned by varying the displacement field. We focus on a regime of displacement\nfield where certain band gaps close and reopen away from the charge neutrality\npoint leading to drastic changes in the quantum geometric structure in momentum\nspace, a feature characteristic of the trilayer graphene band structure. These\nfeatures manifest as a sign change in shift current conductivity in a certain\nfrequency window and can thus serve as a probe of quantum geometry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
