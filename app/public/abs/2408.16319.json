Based on detailed simulations of ab\ninitio star formation by core collapse, we predict that early discs must be\neccentric. In this letter, we study the morphology and, in particular, the\neccentricity of discs formed in non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) collapse\nsimulations. We attempt to show that discs formed by cloud collapse are likely\nto be eccentric. We ran non-ideal MHD collapse simulations in the adaptive mesh\nrefinement code RAMSES with radiative transfer. We used state-of-the-art\nanalysis methods to measure the disc eccentricity. We find that despite no\nasymmetry in the initial conditions, the discs formed are eccentric, with\neccentricities on the order of 0.1. These results may have important\nimplications for protoplanetary disc dynamics and planet formation. The\npresence of eccentricity in young discs that is not seen at later stages of\ndisc evolution is in tension with current viscous eccentricity damping models.\nThis implies that there may be an as-yet undiscovered circularisation mechanism\nin circumstellar discs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9hpZnGR5XeD5a__EB7JWkINWTCMi9d_sGqLHV8QUeYk","pdfSize":"1723312"}
