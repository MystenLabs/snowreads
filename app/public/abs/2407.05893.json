The latter is a method that\nallows inexact proximal (or resolvent) steps where the error is controlled by a\nrelative-error criterion. Recently the HPE framework has been extended to the\nDouglas-Rachford method by Eckstein and Yao. In this paper we further extend\nthe applicability of the HPE framework to splitting methods. To that end we use\nthe framework of degenerate preconditioners that allows to write a large class\nof splitting methods as preconditioned proximal point algorithms. In this way\nwe modify many splitting methods such that one or more of the resolvents can be\ncomputed inexactly with an error that is controlled by an adaptive criterion.\nFurther, we illustrate the algorithmic framework in the case of\nChambolle-Pock's primal dual hybrid gradient method and the Davis-Yin's forward\nDouglas-Rachford method. In both cases, the inexact computation of the\nresolvent shows clear advantages in computing time and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
