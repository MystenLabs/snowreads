Our\ndefinition makes use of entropy formulas for quasi-free fermionic states in\nterms of the reduced one-particle density operator. Our definitions are\nillustrated in various examples for Dirac spinors in two- and four-dimensional\nMinkowski space, in the Schwarzschild black hole geometry and for fermionic\nlattices. We review area laws for the two-dimensional diamond and a\nthree-dimensional spatial region in Minkowski space. The connection is made to\nthe computation of the relative entropy using modular theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
