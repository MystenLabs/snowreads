Our aim in this note is to\nexplore the relations between this and the notion of order idempotent (those\nelements $a$ in a Banach lattice algebra $A$ with identity $e$ such that $0\\leq\na\\leq e$ and $a^2=a$). We also revisit the properties of the ideal generated by\nthe identity on a Banach lattice algebra, motivated by those of the centre of a\nBanach lattice.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PWQdm4SaMyT_-05ByyDQ32RSckpJN_edeFW3R3Jz9Nw","pdfSize":"316127","objectId":"0x7c6b0174e724e8c66296fb7e3e73c201264403d890e79b1eb988cf355da397ea","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
