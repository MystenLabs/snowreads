Most existing methods primarily focus on\neither data generation or the pretraining paradigms of world models. Unlike the\naforementioned prior works, we propose Drive-OccWorld, which adapts a\nvision-centric 4D forecasting world model to end-to-end planning for autonomous\ndriving. Specifically, we first introduce a semantic and motion-conditional\nnormalization in the memory module, which accumulates semantic and dynamic\ninformation from historical BEV embeddings. These BEV features are then\nconveyed to the world decoder for future occupancy and flow forecasting,\nconsidering both geometry and spatiotemporal modeling. Additionally, we propose\ninjecting flexible action conditions, such as velocity, steering angle,\ntrajectory, and commands, into the world model to enable controllable\ngeneration and facilitate a broader range of downstream applications.\nFurthermore, we explore integrating the generative capabilities of the 4D world\nmodel with end-to-end planning, enabling continuous forecasting of future\nstates and the selection of optimal trajectories using an occupancy-based cost\nfunction. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that our\nmethod can generate plausible and controllable 4D occupancy, opening new\navenues for driving world generation and end-to-end planning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
