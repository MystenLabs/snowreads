The proof is\nintuitive and elegant, accessible to anyone with basic knowledge of calculus,\nrevealing that the law originates from the basic property of the human number\nsystem. The criterion can bring great convenience to the field of fraud\ndetection.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Other Statistics","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
