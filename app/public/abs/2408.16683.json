The software\nengineering community has responded by developing fairness-oriented metrics,\nempirical studies, and approaches. However, there remains a gap in\nunderstanding and categorizing practices for engineering fairness throughout\nthe machine learning lifecycle. This paper presents a novel catalog of\npractices for addressing fairness in machine learning derived from a systematic\nmapping study. The study identifies and categorizes 28 practices from existing\nliterature, mapping them onto different stages of the machine learning\nlifecycle. From this catalog, the authors extract actionable items and\nimplications for both researchers and practitioners in software engineering.\nThis work aims to provide a comprehensive resource for integrating fairness\nconsiderations into the development and deployment of machine learning systems,\nenhancing their reliability, accountability, and credibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
