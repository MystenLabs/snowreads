It introduces and\ndiscusses indicators that can support research evaluation and analyses their\nstrengths and weaknesses as well as the generic strengths and weaknesses of the\nuse of indicators for research assessment. The book includes evidence of the\ncomparative value of citations and altmetrics in all broad academic fields\nprimarily through comparisons against article level human expert judgements\nfrom the UK Research Excellence Framework 2021. It also discusses the potential\napplications of traditional artificial intelligence and large language models\nfor research evaluation, with large scale evidence for the former. The book\nconcludes that citation data can be informative and helpful in some research\nfields for some research evaluation purposes but that indicators are never\naccurate enough to be described as research quality measures. It also argues\nthat AI may be helpful in limited circumstances for some types of research\nevaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZiHvOcQs_KgY6v3qM7BGDbK-SvIaZ2C1qmwpQuDCdI0","pdfSize":"3969474"}
