Understanding the\nphysical mechanisms responsible for extreme wave focusing is crucial in order\nto predict and prevent their formation and impact. Two intensively discussed\nwave amplification frameworks are the linear and nonlinear focusing mechanisms.\nThese are also known as superposition principle and modulation instability,\nrespectively. We report an experimental study investigating the formation\nmechanism in a unidirectional representative JONSWAP-type sea state and show\nthat the nonlinear focusing mechanism can be sub-categorized into either a\nlocalized amplitude or a so far less-studied phase-related frequency\nmodulation, or both being at play. The frequency modulation-type mechanism\noccurs at a lower probability, as suggested from the distribution of more than\n200 extreme events, however, it cannot be underrated or disregarded.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UzwBkiX05_z6vXPeKtBWKmO6ldVtW7eJC7MNvDtmYWQ","pdfSize":"953918"}
