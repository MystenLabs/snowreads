Waveguide-integrated sensors\nprovide a particularly compact solution operating with reduced sample volumes\nwhile exhibiting exquisite molecular selectivity, sensitivity, and ultra-low\nlimits of detection. Recent advances in mid-infrared technologies along with\nthe integration of on-chip sources, detectors and microfluidics, have brought\nmid-infrared lab-on-chip systems closer to reality. A variety of material\nplatforms has been proposed for the implementation of such systems. However,\nthe lack of a consistent waveguide design approach renders a fair comparison\nbetween different alternatives - and a deliberate material selection -\nchallenging, limiting the development of optimized on-chip spectroscopic\ndevices. In the present study, a systematic waveguide design approach has been\ndeveloped, facilitating evanescent field absorption-based sensing, in\nparticular for aqueous analytes. Our strategy enables a rigorous comparison of\nseveral state-of-the-art thin-film waveguides using parametric expressions to\npredict the achievable limits of detection of the sensing system, while\nindicating optimum waveguide dimensions and absorption pathlengths, pivotal for\nthe development of next-generation mid-infrared lab-on-chip devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
