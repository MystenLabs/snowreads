To calculate the optical potentials of these\nmesons in different nuclei under study, we shall use the chiral SU(3) hadronic\nmean field model, in which the properties of nucleons in the medium are\nmodified through the scalar isoscalar fields $\\sigma$ and $\\zeta$ and the\nscalar-isovector field $\\delta$. The scalar-isovector field $\\delta$ account\nfor the finite isospin asymmetry of different nuclei having asymmetry in number\nof protons and neutrons. The binding energy and absorption decay width of\nmesons are calculated for the ground state and some of possible excited states\nof the nuclei. In the chiral SU(3) model, the mesons $ \\eta, D^{0}$,\n$\\bar{D^{0}}, B^{0}, \\bar{B^{0}}$ and $\\bar{K^{0}}$ are observed to have\nsignificant negative mass shift upto nuclear saturation density which lead to\nthe possibility of the bound states at least for ground states and some of\nexcited states in case of heavy nuclei. For the pseudoscalar singlet $\\eta^{'}$\nand the vector meson $\\phi$ the mass shift obtained are found to be small and\nbound states are not formed. The present calculations are compared with\ndifferent studies available in the field and will be useful in understanding\nthe outcomes from different experimental facilities focusing on this area of\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9P1naS2o4Mpm3UTl4bX-cEyvYj3ZlzmyzPxHyi7qgjc","pdfSize":"411981"}
