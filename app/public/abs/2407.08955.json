We partition the strength of velocity gradient fluctuations based\non the relative contributions of these constituents in several turbulent flows.\nThese flows include forced isotropic turbulence, channels and boundary layers,\nand subsonic and transonic jets. For forced isotropic turbulence, the\npartitioning is in excellent agreement with previous results. For wall-bounded\nturbulence, the partitioning collapses onto the isotropic partitioning far from\nthe wall, where the mean shearing is relatively weak. By contrast, the\nnear-wall partitioning is dominated by shearing. Between these two regimes, the\npartitioning collapses well at sufficiently high friction Reynolds numbers and\nits variations in the buffer layer and the log-law region can be reasonably\nmodeled as a function of the mean shearing strength. The isotropic partitioning\nalso applies throughout much of the turbulent jets due to the rapid decay of\nthe mean flow shear layer near the nozzle lip. Before reaching the exterior\npotential flow regime, the relative contribution of rigid rotation around the\nturbulent/non-turbulent interface is enhanced with respect to the isotropic\npartitioning. Altogether, our results highlight the broad applicability of the\nvelocity gradient partitioning to turbulence modeling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
