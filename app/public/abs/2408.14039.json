By aggregating\ndata from various sensors and utilizing advanced algorithms, the collaborative\nperception framework improves task efficiency, coverage, and safety. Two case\nstudies are presented to showcase the benefits of collaborative perception in\nmulti-robot systems. The first case study illustrates the benefits and\nadvantages of using CP for the task of household cleaning with a team of\ncleaning robots. The second case study performs a comparative analysis of the\nperformance of CP versus Standalone Perception (SP) for Autonomous Mobile\nRobots operating in a warehouse environment. The case studies validate the\neffectiveness of CP in enhancing multi-robot coordination, task completion, and\noverall system performance and its potential to impact operations in other\napplications as well. Future investigations will focus on optimizing the\nframework and validating its performance through empirical testing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
