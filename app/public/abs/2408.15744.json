Under such curvature bounds, we prove a\nfirst Steklov eigenvalue estimate of Wang-Xia type on compact weighted\nmanifolds with boundary, and a first eigenvalue estimate of Choi-Wang type on\nclosed weighted minimal hypersurfaces. We also produce an ABP estimate and a\nSobolev inequality of Brendle type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
