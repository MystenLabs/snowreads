Typically, fluid dynamics are described by the\nNavier-Stokes equations, and when integrated with a swimming body, it results\nin a highly intricate model. This paper introduces a computational framework\nfor simulating the movement of multiple swimmers with various geometries\nimmersed in a Navier-Stokes fluid. The approach relies on the finite element\nmethod with an Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework to handle swimmer\ndisplacements. Numerous numerical experiments demonstrate the adaptability of\nthe computational framework across various scenarios.All the implementations\nare made using the Feel++ finite element library.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
