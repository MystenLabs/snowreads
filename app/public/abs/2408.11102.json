However, whether such a droplet\ngrows or shrinks relies on a competition between the surface tension and bulk\nenergy density. We study the role of coupling a topological fermionic field to\na scalar field undergoing such nucleation processes. We find that existence of\nnon-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets leads to\nsubstantial quantum corrections to the surface tension thereby modifying the\nsize of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens.\nTo illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern\ninsulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions.\nUsing a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively show that\ntopological phases can lead to characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart\nfrom material systems, our work has implications on the interplay of physics of\nstatistical classical fields and quantum topological order.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wBcqFnzGl8rKMtAOoqNAAuTXU0dNJivvqLkW1WELbYQ","pdfSize":"3363920"}
