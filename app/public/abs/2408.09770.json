We propose decompositions of Wasserstein and Cram\\'er\ndistances$-$which compare two distributions by integrating over their\ndifferences in distribution or quantile functions$-$into directed shift and\ndispersion components. These components are obtained by dividing the\ndifferences between the quantile functions into contributions arising from\nshift and dispersion, respectively. Our decompositions add information on how\nthe distributions differ in a condensed form and consequently enhance the\ninterpretability of the underlying divergences. We show that our decompositions\nsatisfy a number of natural properties and are unique in doing so in\nlocation-scale families. The decompositions allow to derive sensitivities of\nthe divergence measures to changes in location and dispersion, and they give\nrise to weak stochastic order relations that are linked to the usual stochastic\nand the dispersive order. Our theoretical developments are illustrated in two\napplications, where we focus on forecast evaluation of temperature extremes and\non the design of probabilistic surveys in economics.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
