However, occlusion, sensor range, and\nenvironmental factors limit their perception capabilities. To overcome these\nlimitations, collective perception enables vehicles to exchange information.\nHowever, fusing this exchanged information is a challenging task. Early fusion\napproaches require large amounts of bandwidth, while intermediate fusion\napproaches face interchangeability issues. Late fusion of shared detections is\ncurrently the only feasible approach. However, it often results in inferior\nperformance due to information loss. To address this issue, we propose\nMR3D-Net, a dynamic multi-resolution 3D sparse voxel grid fusion backbone\narchitecture for LiDAR-based collective perception. We show that sparse voxel\ngrids at varying resolutions provide a meaningful and compact environment\nrepresentation that can adapt to the communication bandwidth. MR3D-Net achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on the OPV2V 3D object detection benchmark while\nreducing the required bandwidth by up to 94% compared to early fusion.
