It was collected and prepared to comply with privacy standards and\nbusiness confidentiality. An additional challenge is the lack of access to\nprotected user attributes such as gender, for which we propose a solution to\nobtain a proxy estimate. Despite being anonymized and including a proxy for a\nsensitive attribute, our dataset preserves predictive power and maintains a\nrealistic and challenging benchmark. This dataset addresses a significant gap\nin the availability of fairness-focused resources for high-impact domains like\nadvertising -- the actual impact being having access or not to precious\nemployment opportunities, where balancing fairness and utility is a common\nindustrial challenge. We also explore various stages in the advertising process\nwhere unfairness can occur and introduce a method to compute a fair utility\nmetric for the job recommendations in online systems case from a biased\ndataset. Experimental evaluations of bias mitigation techniques on the released\ndataset demonstrate potential improvements in fairness and the associated\ntrade-offs with utility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
