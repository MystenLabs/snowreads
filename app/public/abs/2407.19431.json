In this paper, we associate to G a new\nfamily of algebras, which we call bizonotopal, because their definition\ninvolves doubling the set of edges of G. These algebras are monomial and have\nintricate properties related, among other things, to the combinatorics of\ngraphical parking functions and their polytopes.\n  Unlike the case of usual zonotopal algebras, the Hilbert series of\nbizonotopal algebras are not specializations of the Tutte polynomial of G.\nStill, we show that in the external and central cases these Hilbert series\nsatisfy a modified deletion-contraction relation. In addition, we prove that\nthe external bizonotopal algebra is a complete graph invariant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"81uMtQKyYdkm3EaP2C2wuBqysvSI2p8ImLZS02rBQrQ","pdfSize":"373723"}
