By way of example, the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill (CPMG)\nsequence is analyzed in a numerically rigorous manner accounting also for\ncorrelations between qubit and environment. Since experimentally noise sources\nare characterized through spectral densities, we adopt the spin-boson model as\na suitable platform to describe the qubit dynamics under DD for a given\nspectral density $J(\\omega) \\propto \\omega^s$. To cover a broad range of noise\nsources, the spectral exponent $s$ is varied from $s=1$ (Ohmic bath) to a\nsubstantially small value $0 < s \\ll 1$ (deep sub-Ohmic bath), in order to\ninvestigate the impact of time-nonlocal back action on DD performances for\nenhanced coherence times. As reference to the DD schemes, dynamics of a single\nqubit subject to Ramsey sequences without any pules and Hahn echo (HE)\nsequences are also investigated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
