We propose a semigroup approach, based on resolvent\nand the Feynman--Kac formula, which leads to a new, rather short and direct\nproof. Our results take the sharpest form for slowly varying, radial and\nincreasing potentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
