This is the family of\ncommutative subalgebras of maximal possible transcendence degree that serve as\na universal source for higher integrals of the trigonometric Gaudin quantum\nspin chain attached to $g$. We study the parameter space that indexes all\npossible degenerations of subalgebras from this family. In particular, we show\nthat (rational) inhomogeneous Gaudin subalgebras of $ U g^{\\otimes n}$\npreviously studied in \\cite{ffry} arise as certain limits of trigonometric\nGaudin subalgebras. Moreover, we show that both families of commutative\nsubalgebras glue together into the one parameterized by the space\n$\\overline{\\mathcal F}_n$, which is the total space of degeneration of the\nDeligne-Mumford space of stable rational curves $ \\overline M_{n+2} $ to the\nmoduli space of cactus flower curves $ \\overline F_n $ recently introduced in\n\\cite{iklpr}. As an application, we show that trigonometric Gaudin subalgebras\nact on tensor products of irreducible finite-dimensional $g$-modules without\nmultiplicities, under some explicit assumptions on the parameters in terms of\ntwo different real forms of $\\overline M_{n+2}$. This gives rise to a monodromy\naction of the affine cactus group on the set of eigenstates for the\ntrigonometric Gaudin model. We also explain the relation between the\ntrigonometric Gaudin model and the quantum cohomology of affine Grassmannians\nslices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
