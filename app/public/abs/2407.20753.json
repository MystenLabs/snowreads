However, their quadratic\ntime complexity with respect to data size poses challenges when dealing with\nlarge datasets. In recent work, quantum randomized measurements kernels and\nvariable subsampling were proposed, as two independent methods to address this\nproblem. The former achieves higher average precision, but suffers from\nvariance, while the latter achieves linear complexity to data size and has\nlower variance. The current work focuses instead on combining these two\nmethods, along with rotated feature bagging, to achieve linear time complexity\nboth to data size and to number of features. Despite their instability, the\nresulting models exhibit considerably higher performance and faster training\nand testing times.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
