However, many real-life tasks involve generating a\nseries of actions to achieve specific goals, such as workflows, recipes,\ndialogs, and travel plans. We refer to them as planning-like (PL) tasks noting\nthat the main commonality they share is control flow information. which may be\npartially specified. Their structure presents an opportunity to create more\npractical summaries to help users make quick decisions. We investigate this\nobservation by introducing a novel plan summarization problem, presenting a\ndataset, and providing a baseline method for generating PL summaries. Using\nquantitative metrics and qualitative user studies to establish baselines, we\nevaluate the plan summaries from our method and large language models. We\nbelieve the novel problem and dataset can reinvigorate research in\nsummarization, which some consider as a solved problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZjCK11NyruGo7rSW28o5RWwh5j0ru1-lpcS3-Finf64","pdfSize":"1362202"}
