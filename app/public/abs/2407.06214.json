Among those, it allows infinitely many\ndata values that come not only with equality but with a somehow rich theory\ntoo: the first-order theory of atomless Boolean algebras. The language also\ndistinguishes between inputs and outputs, and has a decision procedure for\ndetermining whether for all inputs exist outputs, at each point of time.\nMoreover, and maybe most surprisingly, the data values can be nothing but\nsentences in GS itself. We also present a non-temporal fragment called NSO\n(Nullary Second Order) that enjoys merely this last property. These results are\ncrucial necessary ingredients in any meaningful design of safe AI. Finally, all\nthose results are obtained from a novel treatment of the first-order theory of\natomless Boolean algebras.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
