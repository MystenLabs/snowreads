The first problem consists of sampling worlds with a probability\nproportional to their weight given that the formula is satisfied. The latter is\nthe problem of computing the sum of the weights of the models of the formula.\nBoth have applications in many fields such as probabilistic reasoning,\ngraphical models, statistical physics, statistics and hardware verification. In\nthis article, we propose QWCS and QWMC, quantum algorithms for performing\nweighted constrained sampling and weighted model counting, respectively. Both\nare based on the quantum search/quantum model counting algorithms that are\nmodified to take into account the weights. In the black box model of\ncomputation, where we can only query an oracle for evaluating the Boolean\nfunction given an assignment, QWCS requires\n$O(2^{\\frac{n}{2}}+1/\\sqrt{\\text{WMC}})$ oracle calls, where where $n$ is the\nnumber of Boolean variables and $\\text{WMC}$ is the normalized between 0 and 1\nweighted model count of the formula, while a classical algorithm has a\ncomplexity of $\\Omega(1/\\text{WMC})$. QWMC takes $\\Theta(2^{\\frac{n}{2}})$\noracle calss, while classically the best complexity is $\\Theta(2^n)$, thus\nachieving a quadratic speedup.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YKlQcqfBxe1g-qRbbCs2VCfX_8yEeyxNs2-DzXGXs2M","pdfSize":"903499"}
