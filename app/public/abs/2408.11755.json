Each voter's cardinal preferences over candidates correspond\nto her distance to the candidate locations, and each voter's cardinal\npreferences over committees is defined as her distance to the nearest candidate\nelected in the committee. We consider a setting where the true distances and\nthe locations are unknown. We can nevertheless have access to degraded\ninformation which consists of an order of candidates for each voter. We\ninvestigate the best possible distortion (a worst-case performance criterion)\nwrt. the social cost achieved by deterministic committee election rules based\non ordinal preferences submitted by $n$ voters and few additional distance\nqueries. For $k = 2$, we achieve bounded distortion without any distance\nqueries; we show that the distortion is $3$ for $m = 3$, and that the best\npossible distortion achieved by deterministic algorithms is at least $n-1$ and\nat most $n+1$, for any $m \\geq 4$. For any $k \\geq 3$, we show that the best\npossible distortion of any deterministic algorithm that uses at most $k-3$\ndistance queries cannot be bounded by any function of $n$, $m$ and $k$. We\npresent deterministic algorithms for $k$-committee election with distortion of\n$O(n)$ with $O(k)$ distance queries and $O(1)$ with $O(k \\log n)$ distance\nqueries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5cmAR6waqJ-0W0b7FSqK9D2fhVHz8jWHtGHpY4sD1Qs","pdfSize":"405987"}
