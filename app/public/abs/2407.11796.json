Recent advances in compressive multimode fiber sensing\nallow for imaging with sub-diffraction spatial resolution and sub-Nyquist\nspeed. At present, the technology is limited to imaging in a two-dimensional\n(2D) plane near the fiber distal facet while in real applications it is very\nimportant to visualize three-dimensional (3D) structures. Here we propose a new\napproach for fast sub-diffraction 3D imaging through a multimode fiber by using\na single 2D scan, speckle illumination, and bucket detection. We experimentally\ndemonstrate precise image plane location as well as 3D imaging of samples with\nvarious scattering coefficients. The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the\npoint spread function along the axial direction is 3 times smaller than the\ndiffraction limit. Our study grants depth-resolving capacity to ultra-thin\nsuper-resolution fiber endoscopes for life science and medical applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
