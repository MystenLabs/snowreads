This implies existence of simultaneous maxima on the modal ridge\nof the family. The paper explores the property for extended Bernoulli sums,\nwhich are random variables representable as a sum of independent Poisson and\nany number (finite or infinite) of Bernoulli random variables with variable\nsuccess probabilities. We show that the cross modality holds for many\nsubfamilies of the class, including power series distributions derived from\nentire functions with totally positive series expansion. A central role in the\nstudy is played by the extended Darroch's rule \\cite{Darroch, Pitman}, which\noriginally localised the mode of Poisson-binomial distribution in terms of the\nmean. We give different proofs and geometric interpretation to the extended\nrule and point at other modal properties of extended Bernoulli sums, in\nparticular discuss stability of the mode in the context of a transport problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
