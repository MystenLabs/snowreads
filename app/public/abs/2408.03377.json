In this work, we consider a lattice of $d=6$ qudits that give rise\nto $\\mathbf{D}(\\mathbf{S}_3)$ non-Abelian anyons. We present a method that\ndemonstrates the non-commutativity of the braiding and fusion evolutions solely\nby utilising the operators that create and measure anyons. Furthermore, we\nprovide a dense coding scheme where only two qudits are sufficient to determine\nthe anyonic braiding and fusion matrices. The minimal resource requirement of\nour approach offers a viable blueprint for demonstrating the non-Abelian nature\nof anyons in various quantum platforms, including optical, atomic, and\nsolid-state systems, where higher-spin states can be effectively encoded. This\nwork represents a foundational step towards the realisation of non-Abelian\nquantum error-correcting codes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
