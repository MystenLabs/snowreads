We design a\npreprocessing pipeline for the filtration of unwanted text from crawled data.\nAfterwards, the cleaned vocabulary is fed to state-of-the-art\ncontinuous-bag-of-words, skip-gram, and GloVe word embedding algorithms. For\nthe evaluation of pretrained embeddings, we use popular intrinsic and extrinsic\nevaluation approaches. The evaluation results reveal that\ncontinuous-bag-of-words and skip-gram perform better than GloVe and existing\nSindhi fastText word embedding on both intrinsic and extrinsic evaluation\napproaches\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DpmpUGDbx6pxWdsYekEGtIM1GFMPsyYfSy2CPIVmCDE","pdfSize":"4323918"}
