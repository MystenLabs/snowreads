Traditional methods use Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) or\nTransformers to analyze spatial while RNNs to model temporal dependencies.\nThese methods focus narrowly on one dimension or engage in coarse-grained\nfeature extraction, which can be inadequate for large datasets characterized by\nintricate relationships and dynamic changes. This paper introduces a novel\ntemporal model built on an enhanced Graph Attention Network (GAT) for\nmultivariate time series anomaly detection called TopoGDN. Our model analyzes\nboth time and feature dimensions from a fine-grained perspective. First, we\nintroduce a multi-scale temporal convolution module to extract detailed\ntemporal features. Additionally, we present an augmented GAT to manage complex\ninter-feature dependencies, which incorporates graph topology into node\nfeatures across multiple scales, a versatile, plug-and-play enhancement that\nsignificantly boosts the performance of GAT. Our experimental results confirm\nthat our approach surpasses the baseline models on four datasets, demonstrating\nits potential for widespread application in fields requiring robust anomaly\ndetection.
