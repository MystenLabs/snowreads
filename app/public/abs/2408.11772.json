This agent-based\nsimulator combines people movement in an indoor space, viral transmission\nmodelling and detailed architectural design, and it is powered by topologicpy,\nan open-source Python library. VIRIS generates very fast predictions of the\nviral concentration and the spatiotemporal infection risk for individuals as\nthey move through a given space. The simulator is validated with data from a\ncourtroom superspreader event. A sensitivity study for unknown parameter values\nis also performed. We compare several non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs)\nissued in UK government guidance, for two indoor settings: a care home and a\nsupermarket. Additionally, we have developed the user-friendly VIRIS web app\nthat allows quick exploration of diverse scenarios of interest and\nvisualisation, allowing policymakers, architects and space managers to easily\ndesign or assess infection risk in an indoor space.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
