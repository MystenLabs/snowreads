Post-hoc\nmethods modify softmax scores fine-tuned on outlier data or leverage\nintermediate feature layers to identify distinctive patterns between\nIn-Distribution (ID) and OOD samples. Other methods focus on employing diverse\nOOD samples to learn discrepancies between ID and OOD. These techniques,\nhowever, are typically dependent on the quality of the outlier samples assumed.\nDensity-based methods explicitly model class-conditioned distributions but this\nrequires long training time or retraining the classifier. To tackle these\nissues, we introduce \\textit{FlowCon}, a new density-based OOD detection\ntechnique. Our main innovation lies in efficiently combining the properties of\nnormalizing flow with supervised contrastive learning, ensuring robust\nrepresentation learning with tractable density estimation. Empirical evaluation\nshows the enhanced performance of our method across common vision datasets such\nas CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 pretrained on ResNet18 and WideResNet classifiers. We\nalso perform quantitative analysis using likelihood plots and qualitative\nvisualization using UMAP embeddings and demonstrate the robustness of the\nproposed method under various OOD contexts. Code will be open-sourced post\ndecision.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
