We first find some general obstructions, for\ninstance that a Hodge-Riemann balanced manifold of complex dimension $n$ has to\nbe $(n - 2)$-K\\\"ahler. Then, we focus on the case of compact quotients of Lie\ngroups by lattices, endowed with an invariant complex structure. In particular,\nwe prove non existence results on non-K\\\"ahler complex parallelizable manifolds\nand some classes of solvmanifolds, and we show that the only nilmanifolds\nadmitting invariant structures of this type are tori. Finally, we construct the\nfirst non-K\\\"ahler example of a Hodge-Riemann balanced structure, on a\nnon-compact complex manifold obtained as the product of the Iwasawa manifold by\n$\\C$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
