We propose a novel data augmentation framework to enhance SDS\nperformance for user groups with limited resources. Our approach leverages a\nlarge language model (LLM) to extract speaker styles and a pre-trained language\nmodel (PLM) to simulate dialogue act history. This method generates enriched\nand personalized dialogue data, facilitating improved interactions with unique\nuser demographics. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our\nmethodology, highlighting its potential to foster the development of more\nadaptive and inclusive dialogue systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
