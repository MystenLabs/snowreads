Despite\nsignificant advancements in climate modeling over the past few decades, overall\nprojection certainty has not commensurately decreased with steadily improving\nmodel skill. We introduce conformal ensembling, a new approach to uncertainty\nquantification in climate projections based on conformal inference to reduce\nprojection uncertainty. Unlike traditional methods, conformal ensembling\nseamlessly integrates climate model ensembles and observational data across a\nrange of scales to generate statistically rigorous, easy-to-interpret\nuncertainty estimates. It can be applied to any climatic variable using any\nensemble analysis method and outperforms existing inter-model variability\nmethods in uncertainty quantification across all time horizons and most spatial\nlocations under SSP2-4.5. Conformal ensembling is also computationally\nefficient, requires minimal assumptions, and is highly robust to the conformity\nmeasure. Experiments show that it is effective when conditioning future\nprojections on historical reanalysis data compared with standard ensemble\naveraging approaches, yielding more physically consistent projections.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LlLIS1WEv4NFtTTvtO2VuHbm9vjFYvAmAsbQ79lZjhI","pdfSize":"3112200"}
