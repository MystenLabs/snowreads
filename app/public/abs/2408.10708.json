That is, the different\nprocesses can connect and disconnect from channels at run time. We restrict\nattention to communication via tree-like communication architectures. These\nallow channels to connect more than two processes in a way that maintains an\nunderlying spanning tree and keeps communication continuous on the tree. We\nmake the reconfiguration explicit in the language allowing both a centralized\nautomaton as well as the distributed processes to share relevant information\nabout the current communication configuration. We show that Zielonka's seminal\nresult regarding distribution of regular languages for asynchronous automata\ncan be generalized in this setting, incorporating both reconfiguration and more\nthan binary tree architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
