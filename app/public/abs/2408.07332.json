We provide a detailed analysis of the twist-$3$\nchiral-even GPD's dependence on the longitudinal momentum fraction ($x$) and\nthe momentum transfer ($t$) by illustrating their behavior through extensive\ntwo-dimensional ($2$-D) and three-dimensional ($3$-D) visualizations. Our\ninvestigation also reveals the intricate relationships between these GPDs and\nother distribution functions (DFs) such as generalized transverse-momentum\ndependent distributions (GTMDs), transverse momentum-dependent parton\ndistributions (TMDs), and parton distribution functions (PDFs). Our study also\nincludes the connected form factors (FFs) which are crucial in understanding\nthe internal structure of hadrons. Additionally, we provide impact parameter\nGPD plots to offer insights into the spatial distribution of partons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
