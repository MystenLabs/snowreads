In this sense, Causal Discovery is a technique that tackles this\nchallenge by analyzing the statistical properties of the constituent variables.\nIn this work, we target the generalizability of the discovery method by\nfollowing a reductionist approach that only involves two variables, i.e., the\npairwise or bi-variate setting. We question the current (possibly misleading)\nbaseline results on the basis that they were obtained through supervised\nlearning, which is arguably contrary to this genuinely exploratory endeavor. In\nconsequence, we approach this problem in an unsupervised way, using robust\nMutual Information measures, and observing the impact of the different variable\ntypes, which is oftentimes ignored in the design of solutions. Thus, we provide\na novel set of standard unbiased results that can serve as a reference to guide\nfuture discovery tasks in completely unknown environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KPp9PhWaGzo0lu0vG-E-lZ2I2LpVtkr3xb5NiV8skcg","pdfSize":"207114"}
