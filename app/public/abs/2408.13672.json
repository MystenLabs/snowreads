Prior work shows [MASK] tokens weighting\nnon-[MASK] query terms, emphasizing certain tokens over others , rather than\nintroducing whole new terms as initially proposed. We begin by demonstrating\nthat a term weighting behavior previously reported for [MASK] tokens in\nColBERTv1 holds for ColBERTv2. We then examine the effect of changing the\nnumber of [MASK] tokens from zero to up to four times past the query input\nlength used in training, both for first stage retrieval, and for scoring\ncandidates, observing an initial decrease in performance with few [MASK]s, a\nlarge increase when enough [MASK]s are added to pad queries to an average\nlength of 32, then a plateau in performance afterwards. Additionally, we\ncompare baseline performance to performance when the query length is extended\nto 128 tokens, and find that differences are small (e.g., within 1% on various\nmetrics) and generally statistically insignificant, indicating performance does\nnot collapse if ColBERT is presented with more [MASK] tokens than expected.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TnQoO6a7c4jUXz1mfyJmHoBbCHkjHcYwFHkUqnXd0Ic","pdfSize":"673501"}
