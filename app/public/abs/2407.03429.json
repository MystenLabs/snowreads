Variable speed WECS such as a doubly-fed\ninduction generators (DFIG) are well known to reach steady state quickly after\nfault occurrence without the need for an external reactive power source because\nof the presence of a back-to-back converter that provides independent control\nof the active and reactive power unlike in the fixed-speed squirrel cage\ninduction generator (SCIG) counterpart that cant be stabilized unless ab\nexternal source of reactive power support is present. However, controlling DFIG\nis complicated and costly due to complete tripping unlike the fixed-speed\ngenerators which doesnt trip completely when fault occurs. Hence, in this work,\na 48-pulse, 3-phase static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is used to ensure\nreactive power compensation and fault-ride through (FRT) control of the SCIG\nagainst over-voltage emanating from fault occurrence in a grid-connected power\nsystem. The goal here is to guarantee voltage stability and fault-ride through\ncontrol against injected faults within certain time ranges at the point of\ncommon coupling (PCC) between the AC sources, the load, and the fixed-speed\nWECS.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
