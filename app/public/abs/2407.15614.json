Adaptive BitRate (ABR) algorithms dynamically\nadjust the video encoding bitrate based on the available network capacity,\naiming to maximize image quality while mitigating congestion and preserving the\nuser's Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we experiment with ABR\nalgorithms for VR streaming using Air Light VR (ALVR), an open-source VR\nstreaming solution. We extend ALVR with a comprehensive set of metrics that\nprovide a robust characterization of the network's state, enabling more\ninformed bitrate adjustments. To demonstrate the utility of these performance\nindicators, we develop and test the Network-aware Step-wise ABR algorithm for\nVR streaming (NeSt-VR). Results validate the accuracy of the newly implemented\nnetwork performance metrics and demonstrate NeSt-VR's video bitrate adaptation\ncapabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
