This would allow\nfor applications in the investigation of activity propagation, and for\ndiagnosis and treatment of pathological behaviour. Due to the partially\nobservable characteristics of activity propagation, through networks in which\nedges can not be observed, and the dynamic nature of neuronal systems, there is\na need for adaptive, generalisable control. In this paper, we introduce an\nenvironment that procedurally generates neuronal networks with different\ntopologies to investigate this generalisation problem. Additionally, an\nexisting transformer-based architecture is adjusted to evaluate the\ngeneralisation performance of a deep RL agent in the presented partially\nobservable environment. The agent demonstrates the capability to generalise\ncontrol from a limited number of training networks to unseen test networks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
