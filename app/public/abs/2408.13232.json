Such effects could represent a sign of new physics beyond the Standard\nModel, leading to observable deviations in neutrino oscillation experiments,\nlepton flavor violation, and other precision measurements. This work explores\nthe parameter space of the linear and inverse low-scale seesaw models based on\nflavor symmetries consistent with neutrino oscillation experiments. In\nparticular, we investigated the violation of unitarity when the lepton flavor\nviolation is absent and when only one lepton flavor-violating channel is\npresent.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
