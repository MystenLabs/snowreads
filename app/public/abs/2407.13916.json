The leading\norder rise speed $v_b$ follows the Taylor-Saffman limit which is inversely\nproportional to the viscosity $\\eta$, but directly proportional to the square\nof the cell gap $h$ and the effective gravity, accounting for cell tilt angle\n$\\theta$. However, when the cell is inclined more and more, the bubble buoyancy\nin the cell gap leads to a substantial decrease in the rise speed, as compared\nto the Taylor-Saffman speed. Buoyancy pushes the bubble towards the top channel\nwall, whereby a difference between the lubrication film thickness on top of and\nunderneath the rising bubble occurs. We attribute these observations to the\nloss of symmetry in the channel gap, due to cell inclination. Nonetheless, the\ntop lubrication film is observed to follow the Bretherton scaling, namely,\n$(\\eta v_b/\\sigma)^{2/3}$, where $\\sigma$ is the liquid surface tension while\nthe bottom film does not exhibit such a scaling. Finally, we illustrate that a\nmodel incorporating a friction term to the power balance between buoyancy and\nviscous dissipation matches well with all experimental data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
