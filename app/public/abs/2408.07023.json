However, the assurance of data permanency in IPFS relies on the\npinning of data, which comes with trust issues and potential single points of\nfailure. This paper introduces Verifiable Decentralized IPFS Clusters (VDICs)\nto enhance off-chain storage reliability with verifiable data permanency\nguarantees. VDICs leverage Decentralized Identifier, Verifiable Credentials,\nand IPFS Clusters to create a trustworthy ecosystem where the storage of pinned\ndata is transparent and verifiable. Performance evaluations demonstrate that\nVDICs are competitive with traditional pinning services. Real-life use cases\nvalidate their feasibility and practicality for providers of Decentralized\nApplications focused on ensuring data permanency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Qiyg8txv-PPg047pU9gIuvTcLckvi1mCtv53FI6OaRs","pdfSize":"1168352"}
