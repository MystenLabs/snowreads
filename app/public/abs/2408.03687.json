{"id":"2408.03687","title":"Formation of WNL stars for the MW and LMC based on the k-omega model","authors":"Jijuan Si, Zhi Li, and Yan Li","authorsParsed":[["Si","Jijuan",""],["Li","Zhi",""],["Li","Yan",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2024 11:03:38 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-08","timestamp":1723028618000,"abstract":"  We adopt a set of second-order differential equations ($k-\\omega$ model) to\nhandle core convective overshooting in massive stars, simulate the evolution of\nWNL stars with different metallicities and initial masses, both rotating and\nnon-rotating models, and compare the results with the classical overshooting\nmodel. The results indicate that under the same initial conditions, the\n$k-\\omega$ model generally produces larger convective cores and wider\novershooting regions, thereby increasing the mass ranges and extending the\nlifetimes of WNL stars, as well as the likelihood of forming WNL stars. The\nmasses and lifetimes of WNL stars both increase with higher metallicities and\ninitial masses. Under higher-metallicity conditions, the two overshooting\nschemes significantly differ in their impacts on lifetimes of the WNL stars,\nbut insignificant in the mass ranges of the WNL stars. Rotation may drive the\nformation of WNL stars in low-mass, metal-poor counterparts, with this effect\nbeing more pronounced in the OV model. The surface nitrogen of metal-rich WNL\nstars formed during the MS phase is likely primarily from the CN-cycle, while\nit may come from both the CN- and NO-cycles for relatively metal-poor\ncounterparts. Our model can effectively explain the distribution of WNL stars\nin the Milky Way, but appears to have inadequacies in explaining the WNL stars\nin the LMC.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
