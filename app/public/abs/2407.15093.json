These variations offer valuable insights into the\ncomposition, size distribution, and processing of interstellar dust grains\nalong different sightlines. This paper introduces a mission concept called\nUVESS (Ultraviolet Extinction Sky Survey) aimed at exploring the composition of\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) within both the Milky Way and nearby Local Group\nGalaxies by mapping the variation of UV extinction curve slopes and the 2175\n{\\AA} feature across a majority of the sky to gain insights into the makeup of\nthe ISM. Recent advancements in UV instrumentation and technologies pave the\nway for the development of high-throughput instruments in compact form factors.\nIn this paper, we outline mission science goals and instrument concept tailored\nfor a small satellite-based platform dedicated to the study of UV extinction.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
