We verify our condition for a class of Gaussian processes, including\nfractional Brownian motion with Hurst index $H\\in (\\frac13, \\frac12]$ in one\nand two dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
