However, noise\nand outliers generated in robotic scanned data can compromise registration\naccuracy. To mitigate this challenge, this article proposes a probability-based\nregistration method utilizing Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with local\nconsistency constraint. This method converts the registration problem into a\nmodel fitting one, constraining the similarity of posterior distributions\nbetween neighboring points to enhance correspondence robustness. We employ the\nExpectation Maximization algorithm iteratively to find optimal rotation matrix\nand translation vector while obtaining GMM parameters. Both E-step and M-step\nhave closed-form solutions. Simulation and actual experiments confirm the\nmethod's effectiveness, reducing root mean square error by 20% despite the\npresence of noise and outliers. The proposed method excels in robustness and\naccuracy compared to existing methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
