The former approach, while mathematically appealing,\nprecludes the construction of critical exotic models where the central charges\nvanish. In contrast, the latter approach has a wider parameter space and allows\nfor the construction of critical models. An explicit example of an exotic\ngeneral model is provided to illustrate both methods. Our methodology\nrepresents the first step towards establishing the most general\nChern-Simons-like formulation of third-way to three-dimensional gravity, which\nwould enable the study of identifying its bulk/boundary unitary sector.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZUJ1iRBjxUKqH3jqp7DvaZ_qUQHWNYQLaqQvTBYgM94","pdfSize":"208703"}
