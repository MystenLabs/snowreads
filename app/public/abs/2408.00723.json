This includes effective descriptions of inhomogeneous spin chains, for\nwhich the notion of perfect state transfer in quantum information was\nintroduced, and here phrased in terms of waves. We show that reflection\nsymmetry is necessary for perfect wave transfer (PWT) in any inhomogeneous\nconformal field theory, and even sufficient when restricted to one-particle\nexcitations. To determine if or when it is sufficient more generally, we first\nbreak conformal invariance and study a broad class of 1+1D bosonic theories. We\nshow that the question can then be posed as an inverse Sturm-Liouville problem\nthat determines when the bosonic theory exhibits PWT. We demonstrate how to\nuniquely solve this problem, which also shows that reflection symmetry is\nsufficient for the special case with conformal invariance. Using bosonization,\nour continuum results extend these notions to interacting quantum field\ntheories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
