Imperceptible image watermarking is one\nviable solution towards such concerns. Prior watermarking methods map the image\nto a latent space for adding the watermark. Moreover, Latent Diffusion Models\n(LDM) generate the image in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder. We\nargue that this latent space can be used to integrate watermarking into the\ngeneration process. To this end, we present LaWa, an in-generation image\nwatermarking method designed for LDMs. By using coarse-to-fine watermark\nembedding modules, LaWa modifies the latent space of pre-trained autoencoders\nand achieves high robustness against a wide range of image transformations\nwhile preserving perceptual quality of the image. We show that LaWa can also be\nused as a general image watermarking method. Through extensive experiments, we\ndemonstrate that LaWa outperforms previous works in perceptual quality,\nrobustness against attacks, and computational complexity, while having very low\nfalse positive rate.
