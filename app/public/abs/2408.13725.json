The magnetization\noscillations are found to be explained by the contributions from different\nparticle excitations in the quantum $E_8$ model. We study the magnetization in\nthe frequency domain in detail, uncovering a series of singular peaks for the\n$z$ (Ising) component. These singular peaks are split into two sets for the\nmagnetization along $x$ and $y$ directions with frequency shifts set by the\nrotational-field frequency. The peaks include both $\\delta$-function type and\nedge-singularity type peaks. The $\\delta$-function peaks can be attributed to\nparticle excitations involving an $E_8$ particle with either the vacuum or a\ndifferent particle. The edge-singularity peaks are contributed by particle\nexcitations of two $E_8$ particles with either the vacuum or another particle,\nor by particle excitations that contain two sets of two particles with each set\nincluding at least a particle of the same type. We propose a Rydberg qubit\narray for possible experimental investigation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lsr1_4yuttgsNaoZQXfXNnxoTjP6mPd-lNTDQHqhZ2o","pdfSize":"854350"}
