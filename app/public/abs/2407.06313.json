Assuming availability of historical\ndata, our goal is to design a data-driven control policy for the multi-modal\nsystem where the current mode is unknown. First, we propose a novel method to\nselect local data for constructing affine time-varying (ATV) models of a\nmulti-modal system in the context of LMPC. Then we present how to build a\nsampled safe set from multi-modal historical data. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our method through simulation results of automated driving on\na friction-varying track.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
