We consider a\nspecific model of this theory to obtain explicit expressions for the field\nequations governing the behavior of matter and geometry in this context.\nFurthermore, the Karmarkar condition is employed to assess the configuration of\nstatic spherically symmetric structures. The values of unknown constants in the\nmetric potentials are determined through matching conditions of the interior\nand exterior spacetimes. Various physical quantities such as fluid parameters,\nenergy constraints, equation of state parameters, mass, compactness and\nredshift are graphically analyzed to evaluate the viability of the considered\ncompact stars. The Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation is used to examine the\nequilibrium state of the stellar models. Moreover, the stability of the\nproposed compact stars is investigated through sound speed and adiabatic index\nmethods. This study concludes that the proposed compact stars analyzed in this\ntheoretical framework are viable and stable, as all the required conditions are\nsatisfied.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
