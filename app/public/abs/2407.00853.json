In this\npaper, this region is studied for infinitely many cycles about the secondary\nmass point, instead of a finite number studied previously. It is shown that in\nthis case the boundary consists of a family of infinitely many Cantor sets and\nis thus fractal in nature. It is also shown that on two-dimensional surfaces of\nsection, it is the boundary of a region only having bounded cycling motion for\ninfinitely many cycles, while the complement of this region generally has\nunbounded motion. It is shown that that this shares many properties of a\nMandelbrot set. Its relationship to the non-existence of KAM tori is described,\namong many other properties. Applications are discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"biHMwfSSAfifsjqyATsYq7XZUnb_THt8XbVSE3HfmEY","pdfSize":"5523139"}
