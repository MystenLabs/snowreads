For a $\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}$-isogeny class\n$\\mathcal{E}$ of elliptic curves and $N \\in \\mathbb{Z}^+$, we wish to determine\nthe least degree of a point on the modular curve $X_1(N)$ associated to any $E\n\\in \\mathcal{E}$. In the present work, we consider the cases where\n$\\mathcal{E}$ is rational, i.e., contains an elliptic curve with rational\n$j$-invariant, or where $\\mathcal{E}$ consists of elliptic curves with complex\nmultiplication (CM). If $N=\\ell^k$ is a power of a single prime, we give a\ncomplete characterization upon restricting to points of odd degree, and also in\nthe case where $\\mathcal{E}$ is CM. We include various partial results in the\nmore general setting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
