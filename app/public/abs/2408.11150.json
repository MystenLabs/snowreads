However, existing\ntypologies often encounter methodological challenges, such as descriptive\nlimitations and subjective criteria. We propose an interpretable deep\nlearning-based approach to morphological script type analysis, which enables\nsystematic and objective analysis and contributes to bridging the gap between\nqualitative observations and quantitative measurements. More precisely, we\nadapt a deep instance segmentation method to learn comparable character\nprototypes, representative of letter morphology, and provide qualitative and\nquantitative tools for their comparison and analysis. We demonstrate our\napproach by applying it to the Textualis Formata script type and its two\nsubtypes formalized by A.
