Instead of the conventional\ntrial-and-error approach, the composition-property descriptor is established\nvia a data driven machine learning method named SISSO (sure independence\nscreening and sparsifying operator). Based on the chosen efficient and\nphysically interpretable descriptor, a series of Y-type hexaferrite\ncompositions are predicted to hold high TNC, among which the\nBaSrMg0.28Co1.72Fe10Al2O22 is then experimentally validated. Test results\nindicate that, under appropriate external magnetic field conditions, the TNC of\nthis composition reaches up to reaches up to 568 K, and its magnetic transition\ntemperature is also elevated to 735 K. This work offers a machine\nlearning-based route to develop room temperature single phase multiferroics for\ndevice applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
