Traditional search systems\noften rely on textual and metadata annotations for indexed images, while\nmulti-modal embeddings like CLIP enable direct search using text and image\nembeddings. However, embedding-based approaches face challenges in integrating\ncontextual features such as user locale and recency. Building a scalable\nmulti-modal search system requires fine-tuning several components. This paper\npresents a multi-modal search architecture and a series of AB tests that\noptimize embeddings and multi-modal technologies in Adobe Express template\nsearch. We address considerations such as embedding model selection, the roles\nof embeddings in matching and ranking, and the balance between dense and sparse\nembeddings. Our iterative approach demonstrates how utilizing sparse, dense,\nand contextual features enhances short and long query search, significantly\nreduces null rates (over 70\\%), and increases click-through rates (CTR). Our\nfindings provide insights into developing robust multi-modal search systems,\nthereby enhancing relevance for complex queries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
