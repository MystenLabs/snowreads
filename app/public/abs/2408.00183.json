We prove a function field analogue that is also a\ngeneralisation: it states that if $K$ is a perfect field and if $S\\supset K$ is\na vector space of dimension $k$ inside an extension $F/K$ in which~$K$ is\nalgebraically closed, and if the $K$-vector space generated by all products of\npairs of elements of $S$ has dimension at most $3k-4$, then $K(S)$ is a\nfunction field of small genus, and $S$ is of small codimension inside a\nRiemann-Roch space of $K(S)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jqklF8iWtohdIjjxGSpQfps4LtUOOIR0_Y4E2CA9c-o","pdfSize":"360060","txDigest":"sHQWsh3HYgKkkLvpPbAATz7bWPGRkWkWMutELwPMbNv","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
