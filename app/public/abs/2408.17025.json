Here we show\nthat optimal transport methods can generate approximate solutions to this\nproblem that serve as excellent initializations for iterative phase retrieval\nalgorithms, yielding vortex-free solutions with superior accuracy and\nefficiency. Additionally, we show that analogous algorithms can be used to\nmeasure the intensity and phase of the input beam incident upon the SLM via\nphase diversity imaging. These techniques furnish flexible and convenient\nsolutions to the computational challenges of beam shaping with an SLM.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
