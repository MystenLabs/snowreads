The presence and properties of\nthese quantum correlations depend on the relevant model parameters. Here, we\ncharacterize the steady-state entanglement in connection with the spatial\nstructure of a small chain of three ions dispersively coupled with a pumped\noptical cavity. Within a semiclassical approximation, we describe the relation\nbetween entanglement, spatial organization, and vibrational modes of the ion\nchain. Upon increasing the pumping strength, our system undergoes a transition\nfrom a sliding to a pinned configuration, in which ions are expelled from the\nmaxima of the optical potential. The features of the steady-state entanglement\nstrongly depend on the kind of pinned configuration reached. We identify\nscenarios leading to entangled steady states, analyze the effect of defect\nformation upon entanglement between different system partitions, and observe\nthe presence of multipartite quantum correlations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
