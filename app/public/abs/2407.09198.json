For mobility data, a large number of\ncorresponding models have been proposed in the last decade. This systematic\nreview provides a structured comparative overview of the current state of this\nheterogeneous, active field of research. A special focus is put on the\napplicability of the reviewed models in practice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
