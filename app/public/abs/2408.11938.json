The first one is the\nstability, under $C^0$-small perturbations of the Riemannian metric, of certain\nflat links of closed geodesics. The second one is a forced existence theorem\nfor orientable closed Riemannian surfaces of positive genus, asserting that the\nexistence of a contractible simple closed geodesic $\\gamma$ forces the\nexistence of infinitely many closed geodesics intersecting $\\gamma$ in every\nprimitive free homotopy class of loops. The third theorem asserts the existence\nof Birkhoff sections for the geodesic flow of any closed orientable Riemannian\nsurface of positive genus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
