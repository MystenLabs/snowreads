Most frauds, like phantom billing, upcoding, and\nunbundling, happen due to the lack of required entity participation. Also,\nclaim activities are not transparent and accountable. Fraud can be prevented\nand minimized by involving every entity and making actions transparent and\naccountable. This paper proposes a blockchain-powered smart contract-based\ninsurance claim processing mechanism to prevent and minimize fraud in response\nto this prevailing issue. All entities patients, providers, and insurance\ncompanies actively participate in the claim submission, approval, and\nacknowledgment process through a multi-signature technique. Also, every\nactivity is captured and recorded in the blockchain using smart contracts to\nmake every action transparent and accountable so that no entity can deny its\nactions and responsibilities. Blockchains' immutable storage property and\nstrong integrity guarantee that recorded activities are not modified. As\nhealthcare systems and insurance companies continue to deal with fraud\nchallenges, this proposed approach holds the potential to significantly reduce\nfraudulent activities, ultimately benefiting both insurers and policyholders.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JAWUL99UUPWcJJ7RroIulCiT4y8ZqljsMjz1HWVumUA","pdfSize":"993181"}
