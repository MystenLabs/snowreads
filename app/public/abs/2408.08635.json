Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\\mathcal{A}$\nand $\\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every\n$G$-subalgebra $\\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\\mathcal{A}\\subset \\mathcal{C}\\subset\n\\mathcal{A}\\otimes_{\\text{min}}\\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This\ngeneralizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras\nby Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of\nthe Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group\n$G=\\Gamma_1\\times\\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of\ncorresponding $\\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\\partial\\Gamma_i$, using the abstract\ncondition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra\n$C(X)\\subset\\mathcal{C}\\subset C(X)\\otimes_{\\text{min}}C(\\partial\\Gamma_1\\times\n\\partial\\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on\n$X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate\nFactor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot\ngenerally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action\nfor $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions\n$\\mathcal{A}\\subset \\mathcal{A}\\otimes_{\\text{min}}\\mathcal{B}$ for which every\ninvariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"u8PraF6i74wyWk1upIm9j_0ZsPP8bA4spfnr9tfh3rw","pdfSize":"456003"}
