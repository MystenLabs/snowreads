Data breaches pose significant\nfinancial and reputational risks to many healthcare organizations including\nclinics and hospitals. This study aims to propose the ideal approach to\ndeveloping a defense system that ensures that patient data is protected from\nthe insidious acts of healthcare data threat actors. Using a gradientboosting\nclassifier machine learning model, the study predicts the severity of\nhealthcare data breaches. Secondary data was collected from the U.S. Department\nof Health and Human Services Portal with key indicators. Also, the study\ngathers key cyber-security data from Kaggle, which was utilized for the study.\nThe findings revealed that hacking and IT incidents are the most common type of\nbreaches in the healthcare industry, with network servers being targeted in\nmost cases. The model evaluation showed that the gradient boosting algorithm\nperforms well. Therefore, the study recommends that organizations implement\ncomprehensive security protocols, particularly focusing on robust network\nsecurity to protect servers\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MHExc9KWhQliJ_oR5-rP83k350OWGg-HSTSb31jqHy8","pdfSize":"1063137"}
