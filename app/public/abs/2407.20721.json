In this paper we study the cyclicity of $\\Gamma^n$ in terms of the\nhyperbolicity ratios of these saddles, giving explicit conditions that ensure\nthat it is at least $k,$ for any $k\\leqslant n.$ Our result extends old results\nand also provides a more accurate proof of the known ones because we rely on\nsome recent powerful works that study in more detail the regularity with\nrespect to initial conditions and parameters of the Dulac map of hyperbolic\nsaddles for families of vector fields. We also prove that when $X$ is\npolynomial there is a polynomial perturbation (in general with degree much\nhigher that the one of $X$) that attains each of the obtained lower bounds for\nthe cyclicities. Finally, we also study some related inverse problems and\nprovide concrete examples of applications in the polynomial world.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
