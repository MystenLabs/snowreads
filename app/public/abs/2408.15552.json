Due to Eiben and Kotrbcik, any connected graph with odd order and\nindependence number $\\alpha(G)$ at most $2$ is equimatchable. Akbari et al.\nshowed that for any odd number $r$, a connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph\nmust be either the complete graph $K_{r+1}$ or the complete bipartite graph\n$K_{r,r}$. They also determined all connected equimatchable $4$-regular graphs\nand proved that for any even $r$, any connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph\nis either $K_{r,r}$ or factor-critical. In this paper, we confirm that for any\neven $r\\ge 6$, there exists a unique connected equimatchable $r$-regular graph\n$G$ with $\\alpha(G)\\geq 3$ and odd order.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
