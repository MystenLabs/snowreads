This is a consequence of a more general\nresult: Every cone system, which is contained in its dual, can be enlarged to a\nself-dual cone system. Using the setup of cone systems, we further describe how\nall functorial tensor products of finite-dimensional cones and operator systems\nexplicitly arise from the minimal and maximal tensor product.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
