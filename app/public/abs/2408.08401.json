Traditionally, students relied heavily\non web search for coding assistance, but this has shifted with the adoption of\nLLMs like ChatGPT. However, the comparative process and outcomes of using web\nsearch versus LLMs for coding help remain underexplored. To address this, we\nconducted a randomized interview study in a database classroom to compare web\nsearch and LLMs, including a publicly available LLM (ChatGPT) and an\ninstructor-tuned LLM, for writing SQL queries. Our findings indicate that using\nan instructor-tuned LLM required significantly more interactions than both\nChatGPT and web search, but resulted in a similar number of edits to the final\nSQL query. No significant differences were found in the quality of the final\nSQL queries between conditions, although the LLM conditions directionally\nshowed higher query quality. Furthermore, students using instructor-tuned LLM\nreported a lower mental demand. These results have implications for learning\nand productivity in programming education.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
