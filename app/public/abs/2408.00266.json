Yet, the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductor-based single\nphotoelectrode, such as hematite, remains low due to the trade-off between fast\nelectron hole recombination and insufficient light utilization, as well as\ninferior reaction kinetics at the solid/liquid interface. Herein, we present an\n{\\alpha}-Fe2O3/CuxO p-n junction, coupled with a readily scalable\nnanostructure, that increases the electrochemically active sites and improves\ncharge separation. Thanks to light-assisted scanning electrochemical microscopy\n(Photo-SECM), we elucidate the morphology-dependent carrier transfer process\ninvolved in the photo-oxidation reaction at a {\\alpha}-Fe2O3 photoanode. The\noptimized nanostructured is then exploited in the {\\alpha}-Fe2O3/CuxO p-n\njunction, achieving an outstanding unbiased photocurrent density of 0.46\nmA/cm2, solar-to-chemical (STC) efficiency over 0.35% and a stable\nphotocharge-discharge cycling. The average solar-to-output energy efficiency\n(SOEE) for this unassisted {\\alpha}-Fe2O3-based SRFB system reaches 0.18%,\ncomparable to previously reported DSSC-assisted hematite SRFBs. The use of\nearth-abundant materials and the compatibility with scalable nanostructuring\nand heterojunction preparation techniques, offer promising opportunities for\ncost-effective device deployment in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
