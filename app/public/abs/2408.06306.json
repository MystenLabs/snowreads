The $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$\ndecay amplitude receives additional contributions from right-handed sterile\nneutrinos. The half-life, calculated in the effective field theory (EFT)\nframework, allows for an improved description of the contributions involving\nnon-zero mixing between left- and right-handed $W$ bosons and those arising\nfrom exchanging a light right-handed neutrino. We find that the relative\nsensitivities between the low-energy (or high-precision) and high-energy\nexperiments are affected by the left-right mixing. On the other hand, our\nresults show how the interplay of collider and low-energy searches provides a\nmanner to explore regions that are inaccessible to $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
