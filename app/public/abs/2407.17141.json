Extending\nbeyond conventional square and hexagonal periodic arrays, transformation optics\nhas opened up entirely new opportunities to investigate water wave propagation\nthrough arrays based on quasiperiodic lattices, and quasiperiodically arranged\nvacancy defects. Using the linear potential flow open-source code Capytaine,\nmissing element and $\\tau$-scaled Fibonacci square lattices, the Penrose\nlattice, hexagonal $H_{00}$ lattice and Amman-Beenker lattice are investigated.\nThe existence of band gaps for all arrays is observed. An hexagonal lattice\nwith vacancy defects transmits the least energy. Bragg diffraction consistent\nwith rotational symmetry is observed from all arrays. Waves will distort\nsignificantly to achieve resonance with arrays, supporting transformation-based\nwaveguides. The possible uses include adaptation to more versatile waveguides\nwith applications such as offshore renewable energy and coastal defence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
