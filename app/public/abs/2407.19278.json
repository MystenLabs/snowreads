Therefore, reconstructing the expansion history by Gaussian Process\n(GP) can be used to probe the cosmic anisotropy model-independently. In this\npaper, for the luminosity distance $d_L(z)$ reconstruction, we turn to the\ninverse distance ladder where the type Ia supernova (SNIa) from the Pantheon+\nsample determine the relative distances and the strongly gravitationally lensed\nquasars from H0LiCOW sample anchor these relative distances with some absolute\ndistance measurements. By isolating the anisotropic information maybe carried\nby the Hubble constant $H_0$ and obtaining the constraint on the intrinsic\nparameter of SNIa, the absolute magnitude $M=-19.2522^{+0.0270}_{-0.0279}$ (at\n$68\\%$ CL), we find that $d_L(z)$ reconstructions from samples located in\ndifferent region of the Galactic coordinate system are almost consistent with\neach other and only a very weak preference for the cosmic anisotropy is found.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
