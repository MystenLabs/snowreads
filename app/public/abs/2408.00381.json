We\nincorporate channel evaluation and retransmission mechanisms for real-time\nreliability enhancement. Using stochastic network calculus (SNC), we establish\na theoretical framework to derive upper bounds for the peak age of information\nviolation probability (PAVP) via characterized sensing and communication moment\ngeneration functions (MGFs). By optimizing these bounds, we develop power\nallocation schemes that significantly reduce the statistical PAVP of sensory\npackets in such networks. Simulations validate our theoretical derivations and\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed schemes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
