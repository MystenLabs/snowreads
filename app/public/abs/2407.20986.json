Within our\napproach, based on the Gaussian integral transform, we consistently treat the\ngroundstate and the excited spectrum. Crucially, the method allows for a robust\nuncertainty estimation of the spectral reconstruction. We showcase it for the\nspin response in neutron matter. Our calculations are performed using\nstate-of-the-art many-body coupled-cluster method and Hamiltonians derived in\nthe chiral effective field theory, emphasizing the analysis of finite-size\neffects. This work serves as a stepping stone towards further studies of\nneutrino interactions in astrophysical environments from first principles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8EaE7Wdkg4YSEZgS1uIxwwqy74zLdcZxZU9krydiRTA","pdfSize":"564580"}
