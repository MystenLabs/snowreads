Turbulent-like active flows power\ngiant interfacial fluctuations, which exhibit pronounced asymmetry between\nregions of positive and negative curvature. Experiments, numerical simulations,\nand theoretical arguments reveal how the interface breaks up the spatial\nsymmetry of the fundamental bend instability to generate local vortical flows\nthat lead to asymmetric interface fluctuations. The magnitude of interface\ndeformations increases with activity: In the high activity limit, the interface\nself-folds invaginating passive droplets and generating a foam-like phase,\nwhere active fluid is perforated with passive droplets. These results\ndemonstrate how active stresses control the structure, dynamics, and break-up\nof soft, deformable, and reconfigurable liquid-liquid interfaces.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
