While numerical-relativity simulations that\ncorrectly describe the physics are essential to model their rich phenomenology,\nthe inclusion of magnetic fields is crucial for realistic simulations. For this\nreason, we have extended the BAM code to enable general relativistic\nmagneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations employing a hyperbolic `divergence\ncleaning' scheme. We present a large set of standard GRMHD tests and compare\nthe BAM code to other GRMHD codes, SPRITZ, GRaM-X, and SACRA$_{\\rm KK22}$,\nwhich employ different schemes for the evolution of the magnetic fields.\nOverall, we find that the BAM code shows a good performance in simple\nspecial-relativistic tests. In addition, we find good agreement and consistent\nresults when comparing GRMHD simulation results between BAM and SACRA$_{\\rm\nKK22}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
