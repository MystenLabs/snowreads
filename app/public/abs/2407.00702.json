Traditional surveys, often expensive and cumbersome, are\ncommonly used for this assessment. As an alternative to surveys, we explore the\nuse of large language models for annotating online user-generated content, like\ndigital reviews and comments. Our research involved designing an LLM annotation\nsystem that transform reviews into structured data based on the Unified Theory\nof Acceptance and Use of Technology model. We conducted two studies to validate\nthe consistency and accuracy of the annotations. Results showed\nmoderate-to-strong consistency of LLM annotation systems, improving further by\nlowering the model temperature. LLM annotations achieved close agreement with\nhuman expert annotations and outperformed the agreement between experts for\nUTAUT variables. These results suggest that LLMs can be an effective tool for\nanalyzing user sentiment, offering a practical alternative to traditional\nsurvey methods and enabling deeper insights into technology design and\nadoption.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
