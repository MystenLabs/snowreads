In the\nRiemannian setting, we restrict ourselves to starshaped rings in a warped\nproduct of an open interval and the unit sphere. We also extend the result by\nreplacing the Laplacian with the $q$-Laplacian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
