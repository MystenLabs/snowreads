Given an image, a target area,\nand target text, the task produces an output image with the target text in the\nselected area, replacing the original. This task has been studied extensively,\nwith initial success using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to balance\ntext fidelity and style similarity. However, GAN-based methods struggled with\ncomplex backgrounds or text styles. Recent works leverage diffusion models,\nshowing improved results, yet still face challenges, especially with non-Latin\nlanguages like CJK characters (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) that have complex\nglyphs, often producing inaccurate or unrecognizable characters. To address\nthese issues, we present \\emph{TextMastero} - a carefully designed multilingual\nscene text editing architecture based on latent diffusion models (LDMs).\nTextMastero introduces two key modules: a glyph conditioning module for\nfine-grained content control in generating accurate texts, and a latent\nguidance module for providing comprehensive style information to ensure\nsimilarity before and after editing. Both qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments demonstrate that our method surpasses all known existing works in\ntext fidelity and style similarity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
