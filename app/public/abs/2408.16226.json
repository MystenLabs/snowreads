Generating such light beams via a chip-based\napproach will vastly broaden their applications and promote the advancement of\nuntapped fundamental science. Here, we present a breakthrough in chip-based\ntechnology by experimentally demonstrating on-chip devices capable of\ngenerating optical skyrmions with tailored topological invariants. These\ndevices, fabricated with high precision, exhibit behavior that closely aligns\nwith theoretical predictions and numerical simulations. The realization of\non-chip optical skyrmion beam generators ushers a new dawn in optical and\nmaterial science.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vQ9sGpTr0oA4g_jlc20mOwfzTA8_OiWLgfjThrfO40Q","pdfSize":"14979323"}
