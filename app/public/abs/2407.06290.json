Specifically, we encode the initial bosonic state's expectation values\nover quadrature operators (and their covariance matrix) as an input\nqubit-state. This is then evolved by a quantum circuit that effectively\nimplements the symplectic propagators induced by the GB gates. We find families\nof GB circuits and initial states leading to efficient quantum simulations. For\nthis purpose, we introduce a dictionary that maps between GB and qubit gates\nsuch that particle- (non-particle-) preserving GB gates lead to real\n(imaginary) time evolutions at the qubit level. For the special case of\nparticle-preserving circuits, we present a BQP-complete GB decision problem,\nindicating that GB evolutions of Gaussian states on exponentially many modes\nare as powerful as universal quantum computers. We also perform numerical\nsimulations of an interferometer on $\\sim8$ billion modes, illustrating the\npower of our framework.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
