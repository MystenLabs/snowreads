We mainly suggest\nto exploit derivative information when possible in these scenarios: concretely,\nwe propose an algorithmic framework that carries out local optimization steps,\nalternating searches along gradient-based and primitive directions. The\nalgorithm is shown to match the convergence properties of a derivative-free\ncounterpart. Most importantly, the results of thorough computational\nexperiments show that the proposed method clearly outperforms not only the\nderivative-free approach but also a state-of-the-art solver both in terms of\nefficiency and effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
