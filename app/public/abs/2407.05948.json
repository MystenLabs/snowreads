However, the immutable nature of blockchain technology\nconflicts with data redaction requirements mandated by data protection laws.\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of redactable\nblockchains and redaction mechanisms, particularly focusing on their\napplication within IoT contexts. Through an extensive review of existing\nliterature, this paper identifies key challenges and opportunities in\nimplementing redactable blockchains for IoT data management. Various redaction\nmechanisms are explored, and the paper examines IoT implementations and use\ncases where redactable blockchains are employed to address data protection\nconcerns.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
