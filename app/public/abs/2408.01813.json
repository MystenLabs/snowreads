In his memory, Ingo Alth\\\"ofer, Holger Boche, Christian Deppe, Jens\nStoye, Ulrich Tamm, Andreas Winter, and Raymond Yeung have organized the\n\"Workshop on Information Theory and Related Fields\" at the Bielefeld ZiF\n(Center for Interdisciplinary Research). This special event will be held from\n24th November to 26th November, 2023. The workshop aims to celebrate Ning Cai's\nremarkable contributions to the field of information theory and to provide a\nplatform for discussing current research in related areas. Ning Cai's work has\nhad a significant impact on many domains, and this gathering will bring\ntogether colleagues, collaborators, and young researchers who have been\ninfluenced by his pioneering efforts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
