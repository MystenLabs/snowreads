In this study, we propose that differences in the dust-to-gas ratio\nnear stars during their formation can produce similar observational signals. We\ninvestigate this hypothesis using a suite of radiation-dust-magnetohydrodynamic\nSTARFORGE simulations of star formation. Our results show that the distribution\nof refractory abundance variations ($\\rm \\Delta [X/H]$) has extended tails,\nwith about 10-30% of all stars displaying variations around $\\sim$0.1 dex.\nThese variations are comparable to the accretion of $2-5 \\rm M_\\oplus$ of\nplanetary material into the convective zones of Sun-like stars. The width of\nthe distributions increases with the incorporation of more detailed dust\nphysics, such as radiation pressure and back-reaction forces, as well as with\nlarger dust grain sizes and finer resolutions. Furthermore, our simulations\nreveal no correlation between $\\rm \\Delta [X/H]$ and stellar separations,\nsuggesting that dust-to-gas fluctuations likely occur on scales smaller than\nthose of wide binaries. These findings highlight the importance of considering\ndust dynamics as a potential source of the observed chemical enrichment in\nstars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"10484_MJZmTX-D5-QYvV100BPpDL5-Isy0gg-mUCxRk","pdfSize":"997933"}
