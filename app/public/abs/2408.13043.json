Lie group\nnumerical integrators preserve the constants of motions defining the Lie group.\nThus, they respect important physical laws of the dynamical system, such as\nunitarity and energy conservation in the context of quantum dynamical systems,\nfor instance. In this article we develop a high-order commutator free Lie group\nintegrator for non-autonomous differential equations evolving on quadratic Lie\ngroups. Instead of matrix exponentials, which are expensive to evaluate and\nneed to be approximated by appropriate rational functions in order to preserve\nthe Lie group structure, the proposed method is obtained as a composition of\nCayley transforms which naturally respect the structure of quadratic Lie groups\nwhile being computationally efficient to evaluate. Unlike Cayley-Magnus methods\nthe method is also free from nested matrix commutators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"beEkMeh7IT5mYotjqdeAdy4b4XtGVco-iklHOckxctc","pdfSize":"682989"}
