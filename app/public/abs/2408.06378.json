This model, after calibration, successfully\nhindcasts hydrodynamics and salinity dynamics in three estuaries that have\nstrongly different characteristics. We find, from analyzing the model results\nfor these three estuaries, that salt transport processes by exchange flow and\ntidal flow interact through the subtidal stratification. Transport by exchange\nflow creates stratification, thereby generating a phase shift of tidal salinity\nwith respect to the tidal flow, which is important for the magnitude of the\ntidal salt transport. Conversely, the strength of tidal currents determines the\nvertical mixing that breaks down stratification. A new analytical formulation\nis presented for the component of the salt transport driven by the\ndepth-averaged tidal flow. This salt transport is larger than the component\nassociated with the vertical shear of the tidal current. Finally, a method that\nyields analytical equations that quantify the importance of different\ncontributions to the salt transport using only primary information is developed\nusing approximate solutions for the subtidal stratification. This method\nperforms well for the estuaries considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"53gVUC-VytGBt8hm3F-oI1Qa0RNEV3zdlm1GwluVfG0","pdfSize":"2104250"}
