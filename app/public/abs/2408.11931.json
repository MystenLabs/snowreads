We\nsay a graph is antimagic if it has an antimagic labelling. In 2023, it has been\nproven that connected $(k, l)$-bipartite graphs are antimagic if $k \\geq l + 2$\nand one of k or l is odd. In this paper, we extend those results to connected\n(3, 2)-bipartite graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
