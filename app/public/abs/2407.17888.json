The power enhancement principle of\nFan et al. (2015) combines these two norms to construct tests that are powerful\nagainst both types of alternatives. Nevertheless, the $2$- and $\\infty$-norm\nare just two out of the whole spectrum of $p$-norms that one can base a test\non. In the context of testing whether a candidate parameter satisfies a large\nnumber of moment equalities, we construct a test that harnesses the strength of\nall $p$-norms with $p\\in[2, \\infty]$. As a result, this test consistent against\nstrictly more alternatives than any test based on a single $p$-norm. In\nparticular, our test is consistent against more alternatives than tests based\non the $2$- and $\\infty$-norm, which is what most implementations of the power\nenhancement principle target.\n  We illustrate the scope of our general results by using them to construct a\ntest that simultaneously dominates the Anderson-Rubin test (based on $p=2$) and\ntests based on the $\\infty$-norm in terms of consistency in the linear\ninstrumental variable model with many (weak) instruments.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
