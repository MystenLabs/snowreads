However there are many additional phenomena that arise when\ntraining a RC to reconstruct more than one attractor. Previous studies have\nfound that, in certain cases, if the RC fails to reconstruct a coexistence of\nattractors then it exhibits a form of metastability whereby, without any\nexternal input, the state of the RC switches between different modes of\nbehaviour that resemble properties of the attractors it failed to reconstruct.\nIn this paper we explore the origins of these switching dynamics in a\nparadigmatic setting via the `seeing double' problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
