We show that the new lower bound quantum cluster algebra\ncoincides with the corresponding acyclic quantum cluster algebra. Moreover, we\nestablish a class of formulas between these generators, and obtain the dual PBW\nbasis of this algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
