The system incorporates two magnons, which are\ncollective magnetic excitations, placed alongside a degenerate optical\nparametric amplifier (OPA) within a cavity. The interaction between phonons,\nmagnons, and light inside the cavity leads to two phenomena: magnomechanically\ninduced transparency (MMIT) and magnon induced transparency (MIT). We show how\nan OPA alters the absorption and dispersion characteristics of the light\nspectrum. The observation of the Fano resonance through magnon-mechanical\ncoupling with the degenerate OPA is discussed. Through tuning vibration\ninteractions and the OPA, we achieve the improvement of slow light. We hope our\nfindings could pave the way for advancements in quantum information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
