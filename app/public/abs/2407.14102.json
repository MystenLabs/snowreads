This model is equipped with\nvarious types of LIDAR and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), providing ground\ntruth information with absolute accuracy. (2 The platform provides a collection\nof simulation environments with diverse characteristic information and supports\ndevelopers in customizing and modifying environments according to their needs.\n(3 The platform supports evaluation of localization performance for SLAM\nframeworks. Ground truth with absolute accuracy eliminates the inherent errors\nof global positioning sensors present in real experiments, facilitating\ndetailed analysis and evaluation of the algorithms. By utilizing the simulation\nplatform, developers can overcome the limitations of real environments and\ndatasets, enabling fine-grained analysis and evaluation of mainstream SLAM\nalgorithms in various environments. Experiments conducted in different\nenvironments and with different LIDARs demonstrate the wide applicability and\npracticality of our simulation platform. The implementation of the simulation\nplatform is open-sourced on Github.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
