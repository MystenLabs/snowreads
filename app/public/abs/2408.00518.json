Using techniques from\nalgebraic quantum field theory, we express the quantum capacity of the quantum\ncommunication channel purely in terms of the correlation functions of the field\nand the causal propagator for the wave equation. Consequently, the resulting\nquantum channel, and hence the quantum capacity, are by construction manifestly\ndiffeomorphism-invariant, respect the causal structure of spacetime, and are\nindependent of the details of the background geometry, topology, and the choice\nof Hilbert space (quasifree) representations of the field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
