While edge localized modes (ELMs) are eventually\nsuppressed as the triangularity is decreased below $\\delta$ < -0.06, an\nextended period of H-mode operation with Type-III ELMs is sustained at less\nnegative $\\delta$ even through access to the second stability region for ideal\nballooning modes is closed. This documents a qualitative difference from the\nELM-free access conditions documented in NT scenarios on conventional aspect\nratio machines. The electron temperature at the pedestal top drops across the\ntransition to ELM-free operation, but a steady rise in core temperature as\n$\\delta$ is decreased allows for similar normalized beta in the ELM-free NT and\nH-mode positive triangularity shapes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
