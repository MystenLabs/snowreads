We show that this\nconnection is, in fact, an instance of the L\\'evy-Khintchine formula from\nprobability theory, and highlight how such formulas can be useful in\nenumerative combinatorics. Our proof combines renewal theory with the\nrepresentation of score sequences as lattice paths, due to Erd\\H{o}s and Moser\nin the 1960s. These probabilistic and geometric points of view lead to a\nsimpler proof. A key idea in the original proof and ours is to consider cyclic\nshifts of score sequences. We observe, however, that this idea is already\npresent in Kleitman's remarks added to one of Moser's final articles in 1968,\nand in subsequent works by Kleitman. In the same article, Moser conjectured\nthat there are asymptotically $C4^n/n^{5/2}$ many score sequences of length\n$n$. Combining the arguments in the current work with those in a recent work by\nthe third author, we demonstrate the utility of the L\\'evy-Khintchine method,\nby giving a short proof of Moser's conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
