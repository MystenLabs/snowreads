Such results are quite remarkable, as completely\ndepolarizing channels taken in isolation and in a definite order can only\noutput white noise. For general channels however, little is known about the\npotential communication enhancement provided by the quantum $\\tt SWITCH$. In\nthis Letter, we define an easily computable quantity $\\mathcal{P}_n$ associated\nwith the quantum ${\\tt SWITCH}$ of $n$ copies of a fixed channel, and we\nconjecture that $\\mathcal{P}_n>0$ is both a necessary and sufficient condition\nfor communication enhancement via the quantum $\\tt SWITCH$. In support of our\nconjecture, we derive a simple analytic expression for the classical capacity\nof the quantum $\\tt SWITCH$ of $n$ copies of an arbitrary Pauli channel in\nterms of the quantity $\\mathcal{P}_n$, which we then use to show that our\nconjecture indeed holds in the space of all Pauli channels. Utilizing such\nresults, we then formulate a communication protocol involving the quantum $\\tt\nSWITCH$ which enhances the private capacity of the BB84 channel.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
