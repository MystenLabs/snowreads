This task is even more challenging\nwhen the two documents are written about different topics (e.g. baseball vs.\npolitics) or in different genres (e.g. a blog post vs. an academic article).\nFor machines, the problem is complicated by the relative lack of real-world\ntraining examples that cross the topic boundary and the vanishing scarcity of\ncross-genre data. We propose targeted methods for training data selection and a\nnovel learning curriculum that are designed to discourage a model's reliance on\ntopic information for authorship attribution and correspondingly force it to\nincorporate information more robustly indicative of style no matter the topic.\nThese refinements yield a 62.7% relative improvement in average cross-genre\nauthorship attribution, as well as 16.6% in the per-genre condition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
