The minimum number\nof colors used in this coloring is called the equitable dominator chromatic\nnumber (EDCN), represented by $\\chi_{ed}(G)$. This article explores the concept\nof equitable dominator coloring for the line graph $L(G)$ of some graph\nclasses.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
