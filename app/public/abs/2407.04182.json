These enhancements include 1) a flexible point-to-point\ncommunication mechanism between accelerators, 2) a multicast NoC that supports\ndata forwarding to multiple accelerators simultaneously, 3) accelerator\nsynchronization leveraging the SoC's coherence protocol, 4) an accelerator\ninterface that offers fine-grained control over the communication mode used,\nand 5) an example ISA extension to support our enhancements. Our solution adds\nnegligible area to the SoC architecture and requires minimal changes to the\naccelerators themselves. We have validated most of these features in complex\nFPGA prototypes and plan to include them in the open-source release of ESP in\nthe coming months.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
