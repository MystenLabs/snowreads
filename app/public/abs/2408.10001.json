The proposed acceleration\nsearch algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes\nfrom the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an\nearly stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The\nproposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via\npolynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB\ncodes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where\nparameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed\ncode can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input\nto the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found\na number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously\nunknown.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9193sS3AtOc8_G5EVHexy2WQ4upxumtdrO9VxciR6Ws","pdfSize":"759732"}
