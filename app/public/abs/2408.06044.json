While extensive research has been\nconducted to deliver adequate emotional support, existing studies cannot\nidentify individuals who require professional medical intervention and cannot\noffer suitable guidance. We introduce the Diagnostic Emotional Support\nConversation task for an advanced mental health management system. We develop\nthe DESC dataset to assess depression symptoms while maintaining user\nexperience by utilizing task-specific utterance generation prompts and a strict\nfiltering algorithm. Evaluations by professional psychological counselors\nindicate that DESC has a superior ability to diagnose depression than existing\ndata. Additionally, conversational quality evaluation reveals that DESC\nmaintains fluent, consistent, and coherent dialogues.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
