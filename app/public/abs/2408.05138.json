A class of density-dependent\nviscosity is considered. By introducing the modified effective viscous flux and\nusing the bootstrap argument, we establish the global existence of large strong\nsolutions when the initial density is linearly equivalent to a large constant\nstate. It should be mentioned that this result is obtained without any\nrestrictions on the size of initial velocity and initial temperature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
