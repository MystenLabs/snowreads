Most previous simulations\nmainly focused on the steady-state problem with continuous heating, and the\neffective Fourier's law (EFL) is widely used for practical multiscale thermal\nengineering due to its simplicity and efficiency although it still follows the\ndiffusive rule. However, non-continuous heating is more common in the\nelectronic devices, and few comparative study is conducted to estimate how much\ndeviation the EFL would produce. To answer above questions, the heat conduction\nin nanoscale bulk or silicon-on-insulator (SOI) transistors is investigated by\nthe phonon Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under three heating strategies,\nnamely, `Continuous', `Intermittent' and `Alternating' heating. Numerical\nresults in the quasi-2D or 3D hotspot systems show that it is not easy to\naccurately capture the micro/nano scale heat conduction by the EFL, especially\nnear the hotspot regions. Different heating strategies have great influence on\nthe temperature rise and transient thermal dissipation process. Compared to\n`Intermittent' heating, the temperature variance of `Alternating' heating is\nsmaller.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
