Despite great\nefforts to achieve the closest possible resemblance in terms of probability\ndistribution and correlation, subtle differences remain. The differences reveal\nand illustrate a fundamental characteristic that distinguishes quantum\nentanglement from classical correlation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
