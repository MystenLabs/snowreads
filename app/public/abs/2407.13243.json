In this model, structure forms rapidly, shortly\nafter the hot big bang plasma de-ionises. The model also produces modifications\nto the expansion rate before droplet formation that affect the measurement of\ncosmological parameters from Cosmic Microwave Background data. The model could\ncontribute to explaining why observations at high redshift see anomalously high\nstructure formation and predict low values for the Hubble constant.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
