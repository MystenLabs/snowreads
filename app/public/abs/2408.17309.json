Understanding, reproducing, and exploring the results of simulations\nrelies on tracking and organizing metadata describing numerical experiments.\nHowever, the models used to understand real-world systems, and the\ncomputational machinery required to simulate them, are typically complex, and\nproduce large amounts of heterogeneous metadata. Here, we present general\npractices for acquiring and handling metadata that are agnostic to software and\nhardware, and highly flexible for the user. These consist of two steps: 1)\nrecording and storing raw metadata, and 2) selecting and structuring metadata.\nAs a proof of concept, we develop the Archivist, a Python tool to help with the\nsecond step, and use it to apply our practices to distinct high-performance\ncomputing use cases from neuroscience and hydrology. Our practices and the\nArchivist can readily be applied to existing workflows without the need for\nsubstantial restructuring. They support sustainable numerical workflows,\nfacilitating reproducibility and data reuse in generic simulation-based\nresearch.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
