We combine the\n[OIII]52{\\mu}m map with Herschel and Spitzer observations, to estimate the\nelectron density distribution of the brightest HII regions of IC10. We find\nthat the line ratio [OIII]88{\\mu}m/[OIII]52{\\mu}m gives electron density (n_e)\nvalues (n_e_OIII) that cover a broad range, while the n_e values obtained using\nthe line ratio [SIII]33{\\mu}m/[SIII]18{\\mu}m (n_e_SIII) are all similar within\nthe uncertainties. n_e_OIII is similar to n_e_SIII for the M1, M2 and A1\nregions, and it is higher than n_e_SIII for the two regions, A2 and M1b, which\nare the brightest in the 24{\\mu}m continuum emission. These results suggest\nthat for these regions the two ions, O++ and S++, trace two different ionised\ngas components, and that the properties of the ionised gas component traced by\nthe O++ ion are more sensitive to the local physical conditions. In fact, while\nthe gas layer traced by [SIII] does not keep track of the characteristics of\nthe radiation field, the n_e_OIII, correlates with the star formation rate\n(SFR), the dust temperature and the 24{\\mu}m. Therefore, n_e_OIII is an\nindicator of the evolutionary stage of the HII region and the radiation field,\nwith higher n_e_OIII, found in younger SF regions and in more energetic\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JPc6F7nhQRVA8pnF9BmiW7zuVKx7Gx_PMUf9l0s3h2c","pdfSize":"2157505"}
