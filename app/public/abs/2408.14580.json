Time-resolved\nscanning transmission X-ray (TR-STXM) microscopy was used to image the spin\nwaves in irradiated regions and deduce corresponding changes in the magnetic\nparameters of the film. We find that the changes of Ga$^+$ irradiation can be\nunderstood by assuming a few percent change in the effective magnetization\n$M_\\mathrm{eff}$ of the film due to a trade-off between changes in anisotropy\nand effective film thickness. Our results demonstrate that FIB irradiation can\nbe used to locally alter the dispersion relation and the effective refractive\nindex $n_\\textrm{eff}$ of the film, even for submicron wavelengths. To achieve\nthe same change in $n_\\textrm{eff}$ for shorter wavelengths, a higher dose is\nrequired, but no significant deterioration of spin wave propagation length in\nthe irradiated regions was observed, even at the highest applied doses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
