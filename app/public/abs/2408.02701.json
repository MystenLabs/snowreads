It replaces -- but specializes to -- the\ndeterministic, regularized optimal transport (OT) strategy, which yields only a\ncertainty-equivalent plan. The incompletely specified -- and therefore\nuncertain -- transport plan is acknowledged to be a random process. Therefore,\nhierarchical fully probabilistic design (HFPD) is adopted, yielding an optimal\nhyperprior supported on the set of possible transport plans, and consistent\nwith prior mean constraints on the marginals of the uncertain plan. This\nBayesian resetting of the design problem for transport plans -- which we call\nHFPD-OT -- confers new opportunities. These include (i) a strategy for the\ngeneration of a random sample of joint transport plans; (ii) randomized\nmarginal contracts for individual source-target pairs; and (iii) consistent\nmeasures of uncertainty in the plan and its contracts. An application in\nalgorithmic fairness is outlined, where HFPD-OT enables the recruitment of a\nmore diverse subset of contracts -- than is possible in classical OT -- into\nthe delivery of an expected plan. Also, it permits fairness proxies to be\nendowed with uncertainty quantifiers.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
