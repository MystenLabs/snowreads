Its potential in healthcare is significant, but\nchallenges arise due to cross-client variations in medical image data,\nexacerbated by limited annotations. This paper introduces Cross-Client\nVariations Adaptive Federated Learning (CCVA-FL) to address these issues.\nCCVA-FL aims to minimize cross-client variations by transforming images into a\ncommon feature space. It involves expert annotation of a subset of images from\neach client, followed by the selection of a client with the least data\ncomplexity as the target. Synthetic medical images are then generated using\nScalable Diffusion Models with Transformers (DiT) based on the target client's\nannotated images. These synthetic images, capturing diversity and representing\nthe original data, are shared with other clients. Each client then translates\nits local images into the target image space using image-to-image translation.\nThe translated images are subsequently used in a federated learning setting to\ndevelop a server model. Our results demonstrate that CCVA-FL outperforms\nVanilla Federated Averaging by effectively addressing data distribution\ndifferences across clients without compromising privacy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
