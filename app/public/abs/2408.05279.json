In their original formulation, they come with optimal (or\nclose to) sampling complexity guarantees for generic states and generic\nobservables. Still, it is natural to expect to even further lower sampling\nrequirements when equipped with a priori knowledge regarding either the\nunderlying state or the observables. Here, we consider the case where such\nknowledge is provided in terms of symmetries of the unknown state or of the\nobservables. Criterion and guidelines for symmetric shadows are provided. As a\nconcrete example we focus on the case of permutation invariance (PI), and\ndetail constructions of several families of PI-CSs. In particular, building on\nresults obtained in the field of PI quantum tomography, we develop and study\nshallow PI-CS protocol. Benefits of these symmetric CS are demonstrated\ncompared to established CS protocols showcasing vastly improved performances.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
