Starting from a max-cut--like combinatorial problem,\nfor integer parameter $r \\geq 2$, the nonconvex problem we study can be viewed\nboth as a rank-$r$ Burer--Monteiro factorization of the standard max-cut\nsemidefinite relaxation and as a relaxation of $\\{ \\pm 1 \\}$ to the unit sphere\nin $\\mathbf{R}^r$. First, we present deterministic, non-asymptotic conditions\non the measurement graph and noise under which every second-order critical\npoint of the nonconvex problem yields exact recovery of the ground truth. Then,\nvia probabilistic analysis, we obtain asymptotic guarantees for three benchmark\nproblems: (1) synchronization with a complete graph and Gaussian noise, (2)\nsynchronization with an Erd\\H{o}s--R\\'enyi random graph and Bernoulli noise,\nand (3) graph clustering under the binary symmetric stochastic block model. In\neach case, we have, asymptotically as the problem size goes to infinity, a\nbenign nonconvex landscape near a previously-established optimal threshold for\nexact recovery; we can approach this threshold to arbitrary precision with\nlarge enough (but finite) rank parameter $r$. In addition, our results are\nrobust to monotone adversaries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
