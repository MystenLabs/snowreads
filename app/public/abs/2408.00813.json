Because of this\nfact, the fundamental understanding of thermal conductivity in glasses remain\nextremely poor when moving beyond the case of simple glasses, e.g., glassy\nSiO$_2$, and into so-called 'modified' oxide glasses, that is, glasses where\nother oxides (e.g. alkali oxides) have been added to break up the network and\nalter e.g. elastic and thermal properties. This lack of knowledge is apparent\ndespite how modified glasses comprise the far majority of known glasses. In the\npresent work we study an archetypical series of sodium silicate\n($x\\text{Na}_2\\text{O}\\text{-}(100\\text{-}x)\\text{SiO}_2$) glasses. Analyses of\nmodal contributions reveal how increasing Na$_2$O content induces increasing\nvibrational localization with a change of vibrations to be less ordered, and a\nrelated general decrease in modal contributions to thermal conductivity. We\nfind the vibrational phases (acoustic vs. optical) of sodium vibrations to be\nrelatively disordered compared to the network-forming silicon and oxygen\nspecies, explaining how increasing Na$_2$O content decreases thermal\nconductivity. Our work sheds new light on the fundamentals of glassy heat\ntransfer as well as the interplay between thermal conduction and modal\ncharacteristics in glasses.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
