The goal of the allocator consists in\nredistributing the desired control effort within the multiple actuators by\npenalizing each actuator to be more or less used, while also taking into\naccount a criterion for minimization of their total energy consumption over\ntime. Anti-windup gains are added to both the controller and the dynamic\nallocator to deal with the saturation condition. Two cases are considered: the\nplant is affected by bounded disturbance and the influence matrix is supposed\nto be affected by uncertainty. Convex conditions for the co-design of both the\ndynamic allocator and anti-windup gains are then expressed in the form of\nlinear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Such conditions allow to deal with the\nmultiple objective problems of enlarging the estimates of the basin of\nattraction, minimizing the total energy consumption of the actuators and\nmaximizing the size of the admissible disturbance. The satellite formation\nproblem borrowed from the literature is revised to illustrate the proposed\ntechnique and show its effectiveness in both cases (perturbed system and robust\ncase).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
