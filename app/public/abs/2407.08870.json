The maximum cardinality of a set $M_k\n\\subseteq E(G)$ such that $M_k$ contains exactly $k$-pairs of adjacent edges of\n$G$ is called the $k$-nearly edge independence number of $G$, and is denoted by\n$\\alpha'_k(G)$. In this paper we study $\\alpha_1'(G)$. In particular, we prove\na tight lower (resp. upper) bound on $\\alpha_1(G)$ if $G$ is a graph with given\nnumber of vertices. Furthermore, we present a characterisation of the general\n(resp. connected) graphs with given number of vertices and smallest $1$-nearly\nedge independence number. Lastly, we pose an open problem for further\nexploration of this study.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
