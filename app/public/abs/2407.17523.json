By collecting input and\noutput data from 20 prefectural-level cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui\nprovinces from 1995 to 2015, we estimate the economic efficiency of these\ncities using data envelopment analysis. Subsequently, we construct\ncounterfactuals for Zhoushan by selecting comparable cities from the dataset,\nexcluding Zhoushan, and applying a panel data approach. The difference between\nthe actual and counterfactual values for GDP growth rate and economic\nefficiency in Zhoushan is analyzed to determine the treatment effect of the\nNational New Area policy. The research reveals that in the initial four years,\nthe New Area policy enhanced Zhoushan's economic efficiency but negatively\naffected its GDP growth rate. This influence gradually disappeared after four\nyears. Further analysis suggests that the policy's effect on GDP growth rate\nvaries with the level of economic development in different regions, having a\nmore substantial impact in less developed areas. Therefore, we conclude that\nestablishing a New Area in relatively undeveloped zones is more advantageous.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
