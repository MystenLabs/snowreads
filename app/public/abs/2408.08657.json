Despite pioneering demonstrations\nof satellite quantum key distribution, considerable challenges remain for wide\ndeployment such as the local effects of the atmosphere on the transmission of\nsingle-photon level quantum signals. As part of Ireland's efforts to establish\nquantum links with the rest of Europe and further afield, we present a\npreliminary study of the feasibility of satellite quantum key distribution\ntaking into account geographic and weather effects on the space-Earth channel.\nWeather data over 5 years covering 4 locations across Ireland were used to\nassess performance and the prospects of optical ground station (OGS) geographic\ndiversity to improve service availability. Despite significant cloud cover that\nmay reduce the performance of a single OGS location, the use of a 4-OGS network\ncan provide up to 45% improvement for a single satellite exploiting\nanti-correlation in cloud cover, though most gains are achieved with 2 or 3\nOGSs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9iLV_Svwku5FDx7W68BYmnU_aowmGdINATOcWxTpqgY","pdfSize":"5820851"}
