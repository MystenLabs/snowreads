Two graphs\nsuch that the absolute values of their nonzero eigenvalues coincide are\nsingularly cospectral graphs. Cospectrality implies singular cospectrality, but\nthe converse may be false. In this paper, we present sufficient conditions for\ntwo circulant graphs, with an even number of vertices, to be noncospectral\nsingularly cospectral graphs. In this analysis, we study when a pair of these\ngraphs have the same or distinct inertia. In addition, we show that two\nsingularly cospectral circulant graphs with an odd prime number of vertices are\nisomorphic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
