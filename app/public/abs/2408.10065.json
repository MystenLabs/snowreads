Significant deviations from the calculated SP values were\nfound for fission fragments and lighter HIs at E/A < 1 MeV/nucleon. A new model\nparameterization for Mylar SP has been proposed. Range estimates obtained with\nany SP model calculation show a critical dependence of their mean values on the\napproximated electronic stopping powers and the nuclear (collisional) SP\ncomponent. The last plays a crucial role at the end of the range and could only\nbe obtained by calculations. Practical applicability of the results of\ninvestigation for very heavy evaporation residues (products of complete fusion\nreactions induced by HIs) implies the use of a thick catcher foil corresponding\nto the largest ranges derived in the estimates or the range measurements for\nthese products.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
