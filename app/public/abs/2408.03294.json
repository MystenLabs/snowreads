When this set is taken to consist of\nonly products of Pauli operators, we show that the minimal such set generating\n$\\mathfrak{su}(2^{N})$ contains $2N+1$ elements. We provide a number of\nexamples of such generating sets and furthermore provide an algorithm for\nproducing a sequence of rotations corresponding to any given Pauli rotation,\nwhich is shown to have optimal complexity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HuuKhkg0q2oz5vVBjwQjl2RRXrnrGYHarnn6BhnBksg","pdfSize":"745460"}
