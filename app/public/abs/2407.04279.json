Therefore, this work introduces\na novel framework named BiosERC, which investigates speaker characteristics in\na conversation. By employing Large Language Models (LLMs), we extract the\n\"biographical information\" of the speaker within a conversation as\nsupplementary knowledge injected into the model to classify emotional labels\nfor each utterance. Our proposed method achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nresults on three famous benchmark datasets: IEMOCAP, MELD, and EmoryNLP,\ndemonstrating the effectiveness and generalization of our model and showcasing\nits potential for adaptation to various conversation analysis tasks.
