We achieve consistency with experimental electron mobility data\nfor bulk KTaO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ above 150 K by refining the Boltzmann transport\nequations. This refinement includes incorporating temperature-dependent\nanharmonic phonon eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes into the electron-phonon\ninteraction tensor, while maintaining the derivatives of the Kohn-Sham\npotential as computed in density functional perturbation theory. Using\nefficient machine-learned force fields and the stochastic self-consistent\nharmonic approximation, we accurately compute the dynamical matrices. At room\ntemperature, the calculated mobility for SrTiO$_3$ exceeds experimental values\nby an order of magnitude, whereas the overestimation for KTaO$_3$ is way less\npronounced. This discrepancy is explained through the more significant electron\nmass renormalization near the conduction band bottom due to anharmonic\nelectron-phonon coupling and the presence of local disorder in SrTiO$_3$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
