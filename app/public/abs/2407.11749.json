The Casimir effect is one of the most intriguing aspects of\nmodern physics, representing a macroscopic quantum-origin force between two\nneutral conducting surfaces, and it stands as a triumph of Quantum Field\nTheory. Here, we examine the Casimir effects associated with a massive\nfermionic quantum field confined in the region between two large and parallel\nplates within the Horava-Lifshitz framework of Lorentz symmetry violation. To\ncalculate the Casimir energy and consequently the Casimir pressure, we impose a\nMIT bag boundary condition on two plates, compatible with the higher-order\nderivative term in the modified Dirac equation. Our results indicate a strong\ninfluence of Lorentz violation on the Casimir effect. We observe that the\nCasimir energy is affected, both in intensity and sign, potentially exhibiting\nrepulsive or attractive force between the plates, depending on the critical\nexponent associated with the Horava-Lifshitz formalism.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
