Yet how voltage changes at such a small scale in vivo remains\nchallenging due to the experimental diffraction limit, large signal\nfluctuations and the still limited resolution of fast voltage indicators. Here,\nwe study the voltage distribution in nano-compartments using a computational\napproach based on the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations for the electro-diffusion\nmotion of ions, where inward and outward fluxes are generated between channels.\nWe report a current-voltage (I-V) logarithmic relationship generalizing Nernst\nlaw that reveals how the local membrane curvature modulates the voltage. We\nfurther find that an influx current penetrating a cellular electrolyte can lead\nto perturbations from tens to hundreds of nanometers deep depending on the\nlocal channels organization. Finally, we show that the neck resistance of\ndendritic spines can be completely shunted by the transporters located on the\nhead boundary, facilitating ionic flow. To conclude, we propose that voltage is\nregulated at a subcellular level by channels organization, membrane curvature\nand narrow passages.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Subcellular Processes","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
