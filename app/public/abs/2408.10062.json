[Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 206701 (2023)]\nfor chiral spin waves in ferromagnets. The spin-frame field theory of a\nthree-sublattice antiferromagnet allows for a topological term in the energy\nthat modifies the boundary conditions for certain polarizations of spin waves\nand gives rise to edge modes. These edge modes are helical: modes with left and\nright circular polarizations propagate in opposite directions along the\nboundary in a way reminiscent of the electron edge modes in two-dimensional\ntopological insulators. The field-theoretic arguments are verified in a\nrealistic lattice model of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet with superexchange\ninteractions that exhibits helical edge modes. The strength of the topological\nterm is proportional to the disparity between two inequivalent superexchange\npaths. These findings suggest potential avenues for realizing magnonic edge\nstates in frustrated antiferromagnets without requiring Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteractions or nontrivial magnon band topology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
