In this work, we first prove statistically that\none-dimensional condensation exists when the spontaneously generated excitons\nare thought of as an ideal neutral Bose gas, which is quite different from the\ninability of free bosons to condense. We then derive a general expression for\nthe critical temperature in different dimensions and find that the critical\ntemperature increases with decreasing dimension. We finally predict by\nfirst-principles $GW$-BSE calculations that experimentally accessible\nsingle-chain staircase Scandocene and Chromocene wires are an antiferromagnetic\nspin-triplet excitonic insulator and a ferromagnetic half-excitonic insulator,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
