However, usual implementation\ntechniques perform program transformations that make producing the\ncorresponding tracing evaluations difficult. This paper presents a tracing\ninterpreter for a subset of Haskell based on the pattern matching calculus of\nKahl. We start from a big-step semantics in the style of Launchbury and develop\na small-step semantics in the style of Sestoft's machines. This machine is used\nin the implementation of a step-by-step educational interpreter. We also\ndiscuss some implementation decisions and present illustrative examples.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QF_No2GM2Mum2slkz6hn_mV17SYezy3tztIY-uc40rA","pdfSize":"254187"}
