But these constructions typically involve divergent quantities when\nconsidering asymptotic boundaries. Different prescriptions exist to address\nthis problem, based on ambiguities in the definition of the symplectic\npotential. We propose a method well suited to leaky boundaries, which describe\nspacetimes than can exchange matter or radiation with their environment. The\nmain advantage of this approach is that it relies only on the bulk Lagrangian\nand it is not tied to a specific choice of boundary conditions. The\nprescription is applied to four dimensional Einstein-Hilbert gravity in the\npartial Bondi gauge. This leads to a finite symplectic potential for\nunconstrained boundary data and reveals two new corner symplectic pairs\nassociated with the relaxation of the gauge.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B3jWaOOPlbiGsmgT6vlbGC_Afm2Ygh-crEJU8oYOCNM","pdfSize":"428779"}
