One common\nand extensively studied issue in the software engineering literature is the\nconcentration of a significant portion of knowledge about the source code in a\nfew developers on a team. In this scenario, the departure of one of these key\ndevelopers could make it impossible to continue the project. This work presents\nKnowledge Islands, a tool that visualizes the concentration of knowledge in a\nsoftware repository using a state-of-the-art knowledge model. Key features of\nKnowledge Islands include user authentication, cloning, and asynchronous\nanalysis of user repositories, identification of the expertise of the team's\ndevelopers, calculation of the Truck Factor for all folders and source code\nfiles, and identification of the main developers and repository files. This\nopen-source tool enables practitioners to analyze GitHub projects, determine\nwhere knowledge is concentrated within the development team, and implement\nmeasures to maintain project health. The source code of Knowledge Islands is\navailable in a public repository, and there is a presentation about the tool in\nvideo.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
