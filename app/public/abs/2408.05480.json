The characteristic -5/3 scaling of three-dimensional\nKolmogorov turbulence is universally observed in both the spatial and temporal\npower spectra. Additionally, the 2/3 scaling in the second-order structure\nfunction further confirms the presence of Kolmogorov turbulence. We also\nidentified a slight deviation in the tails of the probability distribution\nfunctions for velocity gradients. The dust cloud formed in the diffused region\naway from the electrode and above the glass device surface in the glow\ndischarge experiments. The dust rotation was observed in multiple experimental\ncampaigns under different discharge conditions at different spatial locations\nand background plasma environments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a6KQDZXALeiB6qHAjkfSzDm0NjSpLFwzHTTfj29d5nE","pdfSize":"7384749"}
