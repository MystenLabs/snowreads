This is a\ngeneralization of the interior case. If $\\Omega$ satisfies some measure\ncondition at one boundary point, the bilinear mapping $\\langle\nV\\cdot,\\cdot\\rangle$ generalized by distributional coefficient $V$ can be\ncontrolled by a constant sufficiently small, the nonhomogeneous terms satisfy\nsome Dini decay conditions, then the solution is continuous at this point in\nthe $L^{2}$ sense.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
