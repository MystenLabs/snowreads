{"id":"2408.05254","title":"Optimal Power Flow in Renewable-Integrated Power Systems: A\n  Comprehensive Review","authors":"Zigang Chen","authorsParsed":[["Chen","Zigang",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 9 Aug 2024 00:49:04 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-13","timestamp":1723164544000,"abstract":"  This paper explores the integration of renewable energy sources into power\nsystems, highlighting the resulting complexities such as variability and\nintermittency that challenge traditional power flow dynamics. We delve into\ninnovative Optimal Power Flow (OPF) strategies designed to manage the\nunpredictability of renewable sources while ensuring economically viable and\nstable grid operations. A thorough review of state-of-the-art OPF algorithms,\nparticularly those that enhance systems with substantial renewable integration,\nis presented. The discussion spans fundamental OPF principles, adaptations to\nrenewable energies, and categorization of the latest advancements in areas such\nas energy uncertainty management, energy storage integration, linearization\ntechniques application, and data-driven strategy utilization. Each sector's\napplication benefits and limitations are critically analyzed. The paper\nconcludes by pinpointing ongoing challenges and suggesting future research\ntrajectories to foster adaptable and robust power system operations in the\nrenewable-dominant energy era.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
