Understanding these patterns is crucial in\nspatial analysis, but interpreting the statistic can be difficult. To simplify\nthis process, we introduce three novel visualizations that enhance the\ninterpretation of Local Moran's I results. These visualizations can be\ninteractively linked to one another, and to established visualizations, to\noffer a more holistic exploration of the results. We provide a JavaScript\nlibrary with implementations of these new visual elements, along with a web\ndashboard that demonstrates their integrated use.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
