Usually, every single numerical\nsimulation takes hours or even days. Although the progresses in numerical\nmethods and high performance computing, in such cases, it is not possible to\nexplore various model configurations, hence efficient surrogate models are\nrequired. Generally the available meta-model techniques show several advantages\nand disadvantages depending on the investigated problem. In this paper we\npresent an automatic approach for the selection of the optimal suitable\nmeta-model for the actual problem. Together with an automatic reduction of the\nvariable space using advanced filter techniques an efficient approximation is\nenabled also for high dimensional problems. This filter techniques enable a\nreduction of the high dimensional variable space to a much smaller subspace\nwhere meta-model-based sensitivity analyses are carried out to assess the\ninfluence of important variables and to identify the optimal subspace with\ncorresponding surrogate model which enables the most accurate probabilistic\nanalysis. For this purpose we investigate variance-based and moment-free\nsensitivity measures in combination with advanced meta-models as moving least\nsquares and kriging.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
