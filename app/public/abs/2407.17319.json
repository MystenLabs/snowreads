However, measuring real-world detouring\nbehavior is challenging due to the need to track the movement of individual\nvehicles. Recent developments in high-resolution vehicle trajectory data have\nenabled transportation professionals to observe real-world detouring behaviors\nwithout the need to install and maintain hardware such as license plate reading\ncameras. This paper investigates the feasibility of vehicle probe trajectory\ndata to capture commercial motor vehicle (CMV) detouring behavior under three\nunique case studies. Before doing so, a validation analysis was conducted to\ninvestigate the ability of CMV probe trajectory data to represent overall CMV\nvolumes at well-calibrated count stations near virtual weigh stations (VWS) in\nMaryland. The validation analysis showed strong positive correlations (above\n0.75) at all VWS stations. Upon validating the data, a methodology was applied\nto assess CMV detour behaviors associated with CMV enforcement activities,\ncongestion avoidance, and incident induced temporary road closures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
