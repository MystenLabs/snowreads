Astronomical\nobservations of energetic outbursts of young stellar objects (YSOs) also\nsupport the idea of an active young Sun. However, the early solar cosmic-ray\n(SCR) flux has not been well constrained. Here we use measured concentrations\nof SCR-produced nuclides that formed and are preserved in meteoritical hibonite\nand spinel, some of the oldest solids formed in the Solar System, and physical\nmodels for dust transport in the early protoplanetary disk to determine the\nmagnitude of the early SCR flux. We focus our attention on cosmogenic neon\nwhich cannot have been inherited from precursors and can only be produced in\nsitu in solids. Our modeled effective exposure time to SCRs for these solids is\nvery short on the order of years. This indicates the early SCR flux recorded in\nrefractory mineral hibonite was up to ~7 orders of magnitude higher than the\ncontemporary level. Our flux estimate is consistent with the >10^5 enhanced\nflux inferred from astronomical observations of greatly enhanced flare\nactivities of YSOs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gzyF08PW1m3K3iOexqCVgkvhlkw9ZuMuqAr5S_Gv2F0","pdfSize":"1259239"}
