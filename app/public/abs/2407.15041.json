Our\napproach utilizes a ray-casting formulation to aggregate multiple estimates\nfrom different viewing positions, enabling the computation of reliable\npseudo-labels for self-training. In particular, our ray-casting approach\nenforces multi-view consistency along all ray directions and prioritizes\nspatial proximity to the camera view for geometry reasoning. As a result, our\ngeometry-aware pseudo-labels effectively handle complex room geometries and\noccluded walls without relying on assumptions such as Manhattan World or planar\nroom walls. Evaluation on publicly available datasets, including synthetic and\nreal-world scenarios, demonstrates significant improvements in current\nstate-of-the-art layout models without using any human annotation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
