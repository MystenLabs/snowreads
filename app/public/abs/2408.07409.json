In particular, for each locally compact space $X$ and metric\nspace $Y$, we characterize the space of minimal usco maps from $X$ to $Y$,\nsatisfying one of the following properties: (i) compact, (ii) locally compact,\n(iii) $\\sigma$-compact, (iv) locally $\\sigma$-compact, (v) metrizable, (vi)\nccc, (vii) locally ccc, where in the last two items we additionally assumed\nthat $Y$ is separable and non-discrete. Some of the aforementioned results\ncomplement ones of \\v{L}ubica Hol\\'a and Du\\v{s}an Hol\\'y. Also, we obtain\nanalogical characterizations for spaces of minimal cusco maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"acfqwLW6qHHn9F8buTjyQsq4dXEydlUFWbq07o8yGOY","pdfSize":"220514"}
