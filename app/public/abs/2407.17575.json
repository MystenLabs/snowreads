The crystal structure of\nFe$_{100-x}$Ru$_x$ is shown to be predominantly body-centered cubic for $x<13$\nand to undergo a gradual transition to hexagonal close-packed in the\nconcentration range $13 \\lesssim x \\lesssim 20$. Magnetic measurements indicate\nthat the addition of Ru induces a noncollinear magnetic order in the\nbody-centered cubic FeRu alloys, while the hexagonal close-packed FeRu alloys\nexhibit paramagnetic behavior. Increasing the Ru concentration in body-centered\ncubic FeRu alloys decreases the size of magnetic domains, approaching the size\nof magnetic grains. A simple atomistic model was used to show that\nantiferromagnetic coupling of Fe atoms across Ru atoms can be responsible for\ninducing noncollinear order in the FeRu cubic structures. Magnetic multilayer\nstructures used in thin-film magnetic devices make extensive use of both Fe and\nRu layers. Our results reveal that the presence of even a small amount of Ru in\nFe influences the magnetic order of Fe, which could impact the performance of\nthese devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
