This\napproach allows for accurate modeling of real-world systems, which often rely\non both categorical and normative reasoning. Conflict-driven solving is the\nleading approach for computationally hard problems, such as satisfiability\n(SAT) and answer set programming (ASP), in which MKNF is rooted. This paper\ninvestigates the theoretical underpinnings required for a conflict-driven\nsolver of HMKNF-KBs. The approach defines a set of completion and loop\nformulas, whose satisfaction characterizes MKNF models. This forms the basis\nfor a set of nogoods, which in turn can be used as the backbone for a\nconflict-driven solver.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
