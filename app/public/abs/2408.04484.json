Specifically, we consider an\nestimator of the Log-Euclidean distance between multiple sample covariance\nmatrices (SCMs) consistent when the number of samples and the observation size\ngrow unbounded at the same rate. Within the context of multi-user MIMO\n(MU-MIMO) wireless communication systems, we develop a statistical framework\nthat allows to accurate predictions of the clustering algorithm's performance\nunder realistic conditions. Specifically, we present a central limit theorem\nthat establishes the asymptotic Gaussianity of the consistent estimator of the\nlog-Euclidean distance computed over two sample covariance matrices.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
