This greatly extends the previous ground state results.\nCombining with the recently developed exact linear conditions for fractional\ncharges in excited states, where the slopes of the linear lines are defined as\nthe excited-state chemical potentials, our result establish the physical\nmeaning of orbital energies as approximation to the corresponding excited-state\nionization potentials and electron affinities, for both ground and excited\nstates of a molecule or a bulk system. To examine the quality of this\napproximation we demonstrate numerically significant delocalization error in\ncommonly used functionals and excellent agreement in functionals correcting the\ndelocalization error.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JC4_5UkXMsqMvfaUJT6AFFzXq1TOs6_K7DqGE4o1fPA","pdfSize":"747935"}
