As GPUs were originally designed for 3D\nrendering, they still have several features for that purpose that are not used\nin scientific computing. Among them, ray tracing is a powerful technology used\nto render 3D scenes. In this paper, we propose exploiting ray tracing\ntechnology to compute particle interactions with a cutoff distance in a 3D\nenvironment. We describe algorithmic tricks and geometric patterns to find the\ninteraction lists for each particle. This approach allows us to compute\ninteractions with quasi-linear complexity in the number of particles without\nbuilding a grid of cells or an explicit kd-tree. We compare the performance of\nour approach with a classical approach based on a grid of cells and show that,\ncurrently, ours is slower in most cases but could pave the way for future\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
