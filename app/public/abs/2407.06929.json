We show that for certain classes of frequency domain problems, the\nWaveHoltz iteration without acceleration converges in $O({\\omega})$ iterations\nwith the constant factor depending logarithmically on the desired tolerance. We\nconjecture that the Helmholtz problem in open domains with no trapping waves is\none such class of problems and we provide numerical examples in one and two\ndimensions using finite differences and discontinuous Galerkin discretizations\nwhich demonstrate these converge results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
