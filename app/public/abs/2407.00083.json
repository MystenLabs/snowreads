This paper focuses on a class of these\nsemigroups introduced as $\\ll$-smooth semigroups. This computation is\napplicable in the context of the extension of the MacWilliams theorem for codes\nover semigroup algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
