These aim to assist radiologists and help them\nmanaging their growing workload. Existing methods typically generate entire\nreports directly from 3D CT images, without explicitly focusing on observed\nabnormalities. This unguided approach often results in repetitive content or\nincomplete reports, failing to prioritize anomaly-specific descriptions. We\npropose a new anomaly-guided report generation model, which first predicts\nabnormalities and then generates targeted descriptions for each. Evaluation on\na public dataset demonstrates significant improvements in report quality and\nclinical relevance. We extend our work by conducting an ablation study to\ndemonstrate its effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DbEWc0KlS1cFNlLRrTQQuqR_YfVZBWOD_o0W7Tdo__E","pdfSize":"11873352"}
