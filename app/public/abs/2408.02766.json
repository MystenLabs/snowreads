Our fully convolutional model generates dense\nfeature maps for images, where each pixel is associated with a descriptor that\ncan be matched across multiple images. Unlike previous methods, our model is\ntrained on synthetic data that includes significant distortions, such as\nperspective changes, illumination variations, shadows, and specular highlights.\nUtilizing contrastive learning, our feature maps achieve greater invariance to\nthese distortions, enabling robust matching. Notably, our method eliminates the\nneed for a keypoint detector, setting it apart from many existing\nimage-matching techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
