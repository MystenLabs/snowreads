Here, we propose a novel strain\nengineering approach to dramatically boost the in-plane second-order\nsusceptibility ($\\chi_{yyy}$) by tuning the biaxial strain to shift two\nK-valley excitons (the A-exciton and a high-lying exciton (HX)) into double\nresonance. We first identify the A-exciton and HX from the 2D Mott-Wannier\nmodel and compare the enhanced $\\chi_{yyy}$ at single 1-p and 2-p resonance\nstates. The strongest enhancement arises from the 2-p resonance state of HX. By\napplying a small uniform biaxial strain (0.16%), we observe an excitonic double\nresonance state ($E_{\\rm{HX}}$ = 2$E_{\\rm{A}}$, $E_{\\rm{HX}}$ and $E_{\\rm{A}}$\nare the exciton absorption energies). Strain-tuning can yield up to a $50$X\nenhancement in $\\chi_{yyy}$ compared to the single 2-p resonance state of HX,\nresulting in a further three orders of magnitude enhancement in SHG efficiency.\nFurther exploration of strain states near 0.16\\% reveals double resonance also\noccurs at other wavevectors near the K valley, leading to a further increase in\n$\\chi_{yyy}$, confirming that strain engineering is an effective methodology\nfor enhancing $\\chi_{yyy}$. Our findings suggest new avenues for strain\nengineering the optical properties of 2D materials for novel nonlinear\noptoelectronics applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
