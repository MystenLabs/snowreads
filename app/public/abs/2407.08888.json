Despite these statistics, detecting malicious\nemail attachments and URLs often neglects semantic cues linguistic features and\ncontextual clues. Our study employs BERTopic unsupervised topic modeling to\nidentify common semantics and themes embedded in email to deliver malicious\nattachments and call-to-action URLs. We preprocess emails by extracting and\nsanitizing content and employ multilingual embedding models like BGE-M3 for\ndense representations, which clustering algorithms(HDBSCAN and OPTICS) use to\ngroup emails by semantic similarity. Phi3-Mini-4K-Instruct facilitates semantic\nand hLDA aid in thematic analysis to understand threat actor patterns. Our\nresearch will evaluate and compare different clustering algorithms on topic\nquantity, coherence, and diversity metrics, concluding with insights into the\nsemantics and topics commonly used by threat actors to deliver malicious\nattachments and URLs, a significant contribution to the field of threat\ndetection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
