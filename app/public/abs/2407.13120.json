Recent advancements with RED\n(Regularization by Denoising) and PnP (Plug-and-Play) priors have achieved\nstate-of-the-art performance in this domain, emphasizing the need for a\nmeaningful particular solution. However, degenerate PPP algorithms typically\nexhibit weak convergence in infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, leading to\nuncertain solutions. To address this issue, we propose the Halpern-type\nPreconditioned Proximal Point (HPPP) algorithm, which leverages the strong\nconvergence properties of Halpern iteration to achieve a particular solution.\nBased on the implicit regularization defined by gradient RED, we further\nintroduce the Gradient REgularization by Denoising via HPPP called GraRED-HP3\nalgorithm. The HPPP algorithm is shown to have the regularity converging to a\nparticular solution by a toy example. Additionally, experiments in image\ndeblurring and inpainting validate the effectiveness of GraRED-HP3, showing it\nsurpasses classical methods such as Chambolle-Pock (CP), PPP, RED, and RED-PRO.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
