The datasets evaluated\ninclude TanksAndTemples, MipNeRF360, DeepBlending, and SyntheticNeRF. For each\nmethod, we report the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), Structural Similarity\nIndex (SSIM), Learned Perceptual Image Patch Similarity (LPIPS), and the\nresultant size in megabytes (MB), as provided by the respective authors. This\nis an ongoing, open project, and we invite contributions from the research\ncommunity as GitHub issues or pull requests.
