It has been noted that noise\nmay play a constructive role in neural networks and facilitate the subthreshold\nsignaling. The process of spiking pattern excitation at the characteristic\nneuronal spiking frequency from the random noisy stimulus remains unexplained.\nFurthermore, recent research indicates that neuronal processing enables signal\nselective amplification. Also, there is a growing number of studies indicating\nthe role of coloured noise for spike generation, while noise shaping effect\nhave been recently observed in neuronal networks as well as in single neurons.\nWe demonstrate for the first time that noise shaping enables efficient signal\namplification and spike excitation for below-the-threshold stimulus. On the\nexample of the seminal FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model we reveal that the complex\ninterplay between the fast and slow FHN variables leads to noise accumulation\nat the FHN characteristic spiking frequencies, while tails follow a power-law\nfrequency scaling. We demonstrate that the discovered effect allows selective\namplification of signal waveforms presenting a novel type of amplification\nprocess.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"axUw7TdcDcg2FSU2oF8u_1sVtnVd8cmN7qZlHC6_Mcw","pdfSize":"3013933"}
