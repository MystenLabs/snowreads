This paper proposes the use of Relaxed Word Mover's Distance (RWMD),\na semantic text similarity measure, to evaluate the novelty of scientific\npapers. We hypothesize that RWMD can more effectively gauge the growth of\nscientific knowledge. To test such an assumption, we apply RWMD to evaluate\nseminal papers, with Hirsch's H-Index paper as a primary case study. We compare\nRWMD results across three groups: 1) H-Index-related papers, 2) scientometric\nstudies, and 3) unrelated papers, aiming to discern redundant literature and\nhype from genuine innovations. Findings suggest that emphasizing knowledge\nclaims offers a deeper insight into scientific contributions, marking RWMD as a\npromising alternative method to traditional citation metrics, thus better\ntracking significant scientific breakthroughs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
