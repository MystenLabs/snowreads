Recently, there has been some\nwork to combine single-location quantum computing and quantum networking\ntechniques to develop distributed quantum systems such that large entangled\nqubit groups can be established through remote processors, and quantum\nalgorithms can be executed distributively. We present DisQ as a framework to\nfacilitate the rewrites of quantum algorithms to their distributed versions.\nThe core of DisQ is a distributed quantum programming language that combines\nthe concepts of Chemical Abstract Machine (CHAM) and Markov Decision Processes\n(MDP) with the objective of providing a clearly distinguishing quantum\nconcurrent and distributed behaviors. Based on the DisQ language, we develop a\nsimulation relation for verifying the equivalence of a quantum algorithm and\nits distributed versions. We present several case studies, such as quantum\naddition and Shor's algorithm, to demonstrate their equivalent rewrites to\ndistributed versions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
