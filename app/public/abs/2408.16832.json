Our proposal encompasses all prior results and\nconsequentially extends them. In particular, we show that stability can follow\nfrom a conserved quantity that is unbounded from below, contrary to\nexpectation. Novel examples illustrate all our results. Our findings take root\non a careful examination of the literature, here comprehensively reviewed for\nthe first time. This work lays the mathematical basis for ulterior extensions\nto field theory and quantization, and it constitutes a gateway for\ninter-disciplinary research in dynamics and integrability.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
