Our research introduces an\nautomated model-building process, traditionally reliant on intensive\ncollaboration between data scientists and domain experts. We present two\nprimary innovations: a taxonomy-guided prompting generation that facilitates\nthe automatic creation of AI solution recipes and a set of LLM pipelines\ndesigned to produce a solution recipe containing a set of artifacts composed of\ndocuments, sample data, and models for IAM. These pipelines, guided by\nstandardized principles, enable the generation of initial solution templates\nfor heterogeneous asset classes without direct human input, reducing reliance\non extensive domain knowledge and enhancing automation. We evaluate our\nmethodology by assessing asset health and sustainability across a spectrum of\nten asset classes. Our findings illustrate the potential of LLMs and\ntaxonomy-based LLM prompting pipelines in transforming asset management,\noffering a blueprint for subsequent research and development initiatives to be\nintegrated into a rapid client solution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
