But partial annotations pose an\nobstacle meaning that categories of labels are heterogeneous over clients. We\npropose to learn a joint backbone in a federated manner, while each site\nreceives its own multi-label segmentation head. By using Bayesian techniques we\nobserve that the different segmentation heads although only trained on the\nindividual client's labels also learn information about the other labels not\npresent at the respective site. This information is encoded in their predictive\nuncertainty. To obtain a final prediction we leverage this uncertainty and\nperform a weighted averaging of the ensemble of distributed segmentation heads,\nwhich allows us to segment \"locally unknown\" structures. With our method, which\nwe refer to as FUNAvg, we are even on-par with the models trained and tested on\nthe same dataset on average.
