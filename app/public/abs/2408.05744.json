Our approaches use laser range findings, relative distance, and\nangle to the target to guide the robot. We trained agents in the Gazebo\nsimulator and deployed them in real scenarios. Results show that parallel\ndistributional Deep-RL algorithms enhance decision-making and outperform\nnon-distributional and behavior-based approaches in navigation and spatial\ngeneralization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
