We propose character\nsimilarity grouping as a holistic evaluation task for these pipelines. We\npresent AustenAlike, a benchmark suite of character similarities in Jane\nAusten's novels. Our benchmark draws on three notions of character similarity:\na structurally defined notion of similarity; a socially defined notion of\nsimilarity; and an expert defined set extracted from literary criticism.\n  We use AustenAlike to evaluate character features extracted using two\npipelines, BookNLP and FanfictionNLP. We build character representations from\nfour kinds of features and compare them to the three AustenAlike benchmarks and\nto GPT-4 similarity rankings. We find that though computational representations\ncapture some broad similarities based on shared social and narrative roles, the\nexpert pairings in our third benchmark are challenging for all systems,\nhighlighting the subtler aspects of similarity noted by human readers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"F7OKwZU8GC5mbWiydUGAtDD2YdUu8AaUBy_IaPCv-6A","pdfSize":"242536"}
