In particular, such a metric on the interior of a compact\ncontractible $4$-manifold uniquely distinguishes the standard $4$-ball up to\ndiffeomorphism among Mazur manifolds and up to homeomorphism in general.\n  We additionally show there exist uncountably many exotic $\\mathbb{R}^4$'s\nthat do not admit such a metric and that any (non-compact) tame $4$-manifold\nhas a smooth structure that does not admit such a metric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
