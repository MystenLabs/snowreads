For a given problem\ninstance, QAOA performance depends crucially on the choice of the parameters.\nWhile average-case optimal parameters are available in many cases, meaningful\nperformance gains can be obtained by fine-tuning these parameters for a given\ninstance. This task is especially challenging, however, when the number of\ncircuit executions (shots) is limited. In this work, we develop an end-to-end\nprotocol that combines multiple parameter settings and fine-tuning techniques.\nWe use large-scale numerical experiments to optimize the protocol for the\nshot-limited setting and observe that optimizers with the simplest internal\nmodel (linear) perform best. We implement the optimized pipeline on a\ntrapped-ion processor using up to 32 qubits and 5 QAOA layers, and we\ndemonstrate that the pipeline is robust to small amounts of hardware noise. To\nthe best of our knowledge, these are the largest demonstrations of QAOA\nparameter fine-tuning on a trapped-ion processor in terms of 2-qubit gate\ncount.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
