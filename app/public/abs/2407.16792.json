We establish that,\nunder certain conditions on an inverse system of arcs, there exists a plane\nembedding of the inverse limit for which each point of a given countable set is\naccessible. As an application, we show that for any Knaster continuum $K$, and\nany countable collection $\\mathcal{C}$ of composants of $K$, there exists a\nplane embedding of $K$ in which every point in the union of the composants in\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is accessible. We also exhibit new embeddings of the Knaster\nbuckethandle continuum $K$ in the plane which are attractors of plane\nhomeomorphisms, and for which the restriction of the plane homeomorphism to the\nattractor is conjugate to a power of the standard shift map on $K$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
