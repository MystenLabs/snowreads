Despite significant progress\nin the field, the complex nature of underwater environments poses unique\nchallenges that complicate the denoising process. We begin by outlining the\nfundamental challenges associated with underwater acoustic signal processing,\nincluding signal attenuation, noise variability, and the impact of\nenvironmental factors. The review then systematically categorizes and discusses\nvarious denoising algorithms, such as conventional, decomposition-based, and\nlearning-based techniques, highlighting their applications, advantages, and\nlimitations. Evaluation metrics and experimental datasets are also reviewed.\nThe paper concludes with a list of open questions and recommendations for\nfuture research directions, emphasizing the need for developing more robust\ndenoising techniques that can adapt to the dynamic underwater acoustic\nenvironment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
