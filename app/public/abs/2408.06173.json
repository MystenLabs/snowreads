Francis-Gaitsgory proposed a\nconjecture about the general behavior of this duality. The main result of this\npaper, roughly speaking, is that Koszul duality provides an equivalence between\nthe subcategories of nilcomplete algebras and conilcomplete coalgebras and that\nthese are the largest possible subcategories for which such a result holds.\nThis disproves Francis-Gaitsgory's prediction, but does provide an adequate\nreplacement. We show that many previously known partial results about Koszul\nduality can be deduced from our results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
