We determine Beagle's effective diameter $D_{\\rm\neff}=57.3^{+4.5}_{-2.2}$ km, geometric albedo $p_{\\rm\nv}=0.05^{+0.004}_{-0.007}$, mean roughness $\\theta_{\\rm RMS}=44\\pm4^\\circ$,\nmean grain size $b=100^{+350}_{-90}~\\mu$m, mean specific heat capacity $c_{\\rm\np}=173\\sim516\\rm~JKg^{-1}K^{-1}$, mean thermal conductivity\n$\\kappa=0.7\\sim1.3\\times10^{-3}\\rm~Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ and mean thermal inertia\n$\\Gamma=14\\sim32\\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$. The albedo of Beagle is a little\nanomalous that the albedos of Beagle's neighbouring asteroids are more close to\nThemis, rather than Beagle itself. The W1-band near-infrared light curves don't\nreveal significant heterogeneous NIR features on the surface of Beagle, being\ninconsistent with the expectation of a family parent that has members with\ndiverse NIR spectral types. These results add new clues of Beagle probably\nbeing an interloper or a sister, rather than the parent of its neighbouring\nasteroids including the first main-belt comet (MBC) 133P, hence may lead to new\nscenarios about the origin of famous MBC 133P. Besides, we found that\nasteroidal shape models from inversion of optical light curves are imperfect\nfor modeling infrared lightcurves, thus could mislead evaluations of both the\nheterogeneity of regolith reflectivity at near infrared and thermophysical\ncharacteristics at thermal infrared.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"omVe9a5_2TgFH-pRPOMEfD0FtwVQiPoAf832sQ4tU8M","pdfSize":"777303","objectId":"0x86fffc64d596f0b980507c58ace98e59da345b4a41392fa69c05d76b5517db8a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
