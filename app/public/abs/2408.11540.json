These\nconditions can severely impair the quality of geometric maps, which is\nessential for applications ranging from autonomous planning to environmental\nmonitoring. In response to these challenges, this study introduces the novel\ntask of 3D Reconstruction in Rainy Environments (3DRRE), specifically designed\nto address the complexities of reconstructing 3D scenes under rainy conditions.\nTo benchmark this task, we construct the HydroViews dataset that comprises a\ndiverse collection of both synthesized and real-world scene images\ncharacterized by various intensities of rain streaks and raindrops.\nFurthermore, we propose DeRainGS, the first 3DGS method tailored for\nreconstruction in adverse rainy environments. Extensive experiments across a\nwide range of rain scenarios demonstrate that our method delivers\nstate-of-the-art performance, remarkably outperforming existing occlusion-free\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AswXe52aYdqt7xABTf206OpBR9SV9SDZjnP834ZLQU4","pdfSize":"38316260"}
