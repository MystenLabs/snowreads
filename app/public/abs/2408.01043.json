In these models,\nthe minimal length would be a physical limit, not just a mathematical tool, and\nshould be Lorentz invariant. In this paper, we study two-qubit communication\nand entanglement harvesting in a field subject to a covariant bandlimit\n(minimum length) and present the changes induced by this bandlimit. We find the\nbandlimit introduces nonlocality and acausal communication in a manner unlike\nnon-covariant bandlimits or other quantum optical approximations. We also\nobserve that this covariant bandlimit introduces uncertainties in time and\ntemporal ordering with the unusual behavior attributed to the behavior of\nvirtual particles being modified by the covariant cutoff.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
