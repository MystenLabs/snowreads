Despite substantial efforts that have been made to real-time\ncommunications and computing, real-time 3D scene representations remain a\nchallenging task. This paper investigates the tradeoff between timeliness and\nfidelity in real-time 3D scene representations. Specifically, we establish a\nframework to evaluate the impact of communication delay on the tradeoff, where\nthe real-world scenario is monitored by multiple cameras that communicate with\nan edge server. To improve fidelity for 3D scene representations, we propose to\nuse a single-step Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) method that leverages the\nAge of Information (AoI) to decide if the received image needs to be involved\nin 3D scene representations and rendering. We test our framework and the\nproposed approach with different well-known 3D scene representation methods.\nSimulation results reveal that real-time 3D scene representation can be\nsensitively affected by communication delay, and our proposed method can\nachieve optimal 3D scene representation results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
