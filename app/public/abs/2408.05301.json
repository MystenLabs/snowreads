Robots, on the other hand, have not yet been developed to\nwork similarly closely with humans, and to effectively convey information when\nengaging in physical human-robot interaction (pHRI). This currently limits the\npotential of physical human-robot collaboration to solve real-world problems.\nThis paper investigates the question of how to establish clear and intuitive\nrobot-to-human communication, while ensuring human comfort during pHRI. We\napproach this question from the perspective of a leader-follower scenario, in\nwhich a full-body humanoid robot leads a slow waltz dance by signaling the next\nsteps to a human partner. This is achieved through the development of a\nwhole-body control framework combining admittance and impedance control, which\nallows for different communication modalities including haptic, visual, and\naudio signals. Participant experiments allowed to validate the performance of\nthe controller, and to understand what types of communication work better in\nterms of effectiveness and comfort during robot-led pHRI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
