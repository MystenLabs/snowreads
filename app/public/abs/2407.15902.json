Recently, an alternative defense mechanism, namely \"circuit\nbreakers\" [Zou et al., 2024], has shown promising results for aligning LLMs. In\nthis report, we show that the robustness claims of \"Improving Alignment and\nRobustness with Circuit Breakers\" against unconstraint continuous attacks in\nthe embedding space of the input tokens may be overestimated [Zou et al.,\n2024]. Specifically, we demonstrate that by implementing a few simple changes\nto embedding space attacks [Schwinn et al., 2024a,b], we achieve 100% attack\nsuccess rate (ASR) against circuit breaker models. Without conducting any\nfurther hyperparameter tuning, these adjustments increase the ASR by more than\n80% compared to the original evaluation.
