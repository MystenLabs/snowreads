The primary\nobjectives of TCSpy include centralized control of the array, support for\ndiverse observation modes, and swift responses to the follow-up observations of\nastronomical transients. To achieve these objectives, TCSpy utilizes the ASCOM\nAlpaca protocol in conjunction with Alpyca, establishing robust communication\namong multiple telescope units. For the practical application of TCSpy, we\nimplement TCSpy within the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT). 7DT is a telescope\narray consisting of 20, 0.5-m telescopes, equipped with 40 different\nmedium-band filters. The main scientific goals of 7DT include detecting the\noptical counterparts of gravitational-wave sources, identifying kilonovae, and\nthe spectral mapping of the southern sky. Through the integration of TCSpy, 7DT\ncan achieve these scientific objectives with its unique observation modes and\nrapid follow-up capabilities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"VdggXDJYGaIAH9__Foks2XficzVv4YO7-8ieKAKER1M","pdfSize":"19955931"}
