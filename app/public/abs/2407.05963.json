Our project aims to lead the\ndevelopment of sustainable methods and energy-efficient orchestration models\nspecifically for edge environments, enhancing architectural support driven by\nAI for contemporary edge-to-cloud continuum computing. This initiative seeks to\nposition Finland at the forefront of the 6G landscape, focusing on\nsophisticated edge orchestration and robust software architectures to optimize\nthe performance and scalability of edge networks. Collaborating with leading\nFinnish universities and companies, the project emphasizes deep\nindustry-academia collaboration and international expertise to address critical\nchallenges in edge orchestration and software architecture, aiming to drive\nsignificant advancements in software productivity and market impact.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
