Our proposed machine-learning\nsupported approach addresses this by utilizing a feed-forward neural network to\nreduce the computation load of the online-optimization. We propose\napproximating part of the problem horizon, while maintaining safety guarantees\n-- constraint satisfaction -- via the remaining optimization part of the\ncontroller. The approach is validated in simulation, demonstrating an\nimprovement in computational efficiency, while maintaining guarantees and\nnear-optimal performance. The proposed MPC scheme can be applied to a wide\nrange of applications, including those requiring a rapid control response, such\nas robotics and embedded applications with limited computational resources.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"--hY44makUVopMbg-UNEQuovabjiTC26bU1AkKMik5o","pdfSize":"1132540"}
