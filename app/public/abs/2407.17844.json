Nevertheless, the progress of research is restricted by the limited\navailability of publicly accessible speech-based PD datasets, primarily due to\nprivacy concerns. The goal of this systematic review is to explore the current\nlandscape of speech-based DL approaches for PD classification, based on 33\nscientific works published between January 2020 and March 2024. We discuss\ntheir available resources, capabilities, and potential limitations, and issues\nrelated to bias, explainability, and privacy. Furthermore, this review provides\nan overview of publicly accessible speech-based datasets and open-source\nmaterial for PD. The DL approaches identified are categorized into end-to-end\n(E2E) learning, transfer learning (TL), and deep acoustic feature extraction\n(DAFE). Among E2E approaches, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are\nprevalent, though Transformers are increasingly popular. E2E approaches face\nchallenges such as limited data and computational resources, especially with\nTransformers. TL addresses these issues by providing more robust PD diagnosis\nand better generalizability across languages. DAFE aims to improve the\nexplainability and interpretability of results by examining the specific\neffects of deep features on both other DL approaches and more traditional\nmachine learning (ML) methods. However, it often underperforms compared to E2E\nand TL approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rgUfTosVONOH1UilntzYAvJKaSRtZZkwTk3vhSPsmaY","pdfSize":"937393"}
