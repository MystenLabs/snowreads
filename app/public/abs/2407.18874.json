Our first study involved 14 BLV individuals, and the second\nincluded five groups of BLV individuals with their children. Through\nsemi-structured interviews with AI descriptions of children's artwork and\nmulti-sensory design probes, we found that BLV family members value artwork\nengagement as a bonding opportunity, preferring the child's storytelling and\ninterpretation over other nonvisual representations. Additionally, despite some\ninaccuracies, BLV family members felt that AI-generated descriptions could\nfacilitate dialogue with their children and aid self-guided art discovery. We\nclose with specific design considerations for supporting artwork engagement in\nmixed visual-ability families, including enabling artwork access through\nvarious methods, supporting children's corrections of AI output, and\ndistinctions in context vs. content and interpretation vs. description of\nchildren's artwork.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
