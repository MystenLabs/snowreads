This letter considers the discrete\npassive beamforming design for IRS in order to maximize the minimum\nsignal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among multiple users in an\nIRS-assisted downlink network. The main design difficulty lies in the discrete\nphase-shift constraint. Differing from most existing works, this letter\nadvocates a convex-hull relaxation of the discrete constraints which leads to a\ncontinuous reformulated problem equivalent to the original discrete problem.\nThis letter further proposes an efficient alternating projection/proximal\ngradient descent and ascent algorithm for solving the reformulated problem.\nSimulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art methods significantly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
