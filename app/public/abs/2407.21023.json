Our findings reveal that, in the vast majority of cases,\nadequate temporal disorder in local space can make the electromagnetic field\nstatistically localized, obeying a normal distribution at a specific point in\ntime of arbitrary location within the cavity. We employ the concept of\ndisordered space-time crystals and leverage Lindeberg's and Lyapunov's theorems\nto theoretically prove the normal distribution of the field values.\nFurthermore, we find that with the increase of energy provided by time\nvariation, the probability of extreme fields will significantly increase and\nthe field intensity eventually is de-normalized, that is, deviating from the\nnormal distribution. This study not only sheds light on the statistical\nproperties of transient signals in local-disordered time-varying systems but\nalso paves the way for further exploration in wave dynamics of analogous\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
