We build a theoretical framework that helps us\nto analyze extremely difficult problems which include both nonlinearity and\nnoise of semiconductors. Using our proposed framework, we analytically\ncalculate the amplitude noise and phase noise of nonlinear RC circuits in the\npresence of nonlinear capacitance and conductance. As a more practical example,\nwe analyze the amplitude noise and phase noise of a common-emitter stage\nbipolar transistor.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wEYmXCiVzZoKhHxq8dN1HWXs8xbdtss3Y5896WGVcJY","pdfSize":"825153"}
