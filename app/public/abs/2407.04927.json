In this\nwork, we study novel collective quantum phenomena in waveguide-coupled Bragg\natom arrays with inhomogeneous frequencies. For atoms without free-space\ndissipation, collectively induced transparency is produced by destructive\nquantum interference between subradiant and superradiant states. In a large\nBragg atom array, multi-frequency photon transparency can be obtained by\nconsidering atoms with different frequencies. Interestingly, we find\ncollectively induced absorption (CIA) by studying the influence of free-space\ndissipation on photon transport. Tunable atomic frequencies nontrivially modify\ndecay rates of subradiant states. When the decay rate of a subradiant state\nequals to the free-space dissipation, photon absorption can reach a limit at a\ncertain frequency. In other words, photon absorption is enhanced with low\nfree-space dissipation, distinct from previous photon detection schemes. We\nalso show multi-frequency CIA by properly adjusting atomic frequencies. Our\nwork presents a way to manipulate collective quantum states and exotic optical\nproperties in waveguide QED systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
