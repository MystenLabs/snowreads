Especially, for a Dynkin quiver, we establish a\nbijection between the elements of the braid group and the set of isomorphism\nclasses of basic silting objects over the derived preprojective algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
