Python-based verification environment leverages open-source\nlibraries such as cocotb and cocotb-coverage that enables interfacing the\ntesbenches with any available simulator and facilitating constrained\nrandomization, coverage respectively. These libraries significantly ease the\ndevelopment of testbenches and have the potential to reduce the setup cost. The\ngoal of this paper is to assess the effectiveness of a Python-Cocotb\nverification setup with design IPs and compare its features and performance\nmetrics with the current de-facto hardware verification language i.e.,\nSystemVerilog.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
