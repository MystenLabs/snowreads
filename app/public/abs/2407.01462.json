The first step is to study the presentable\nderived category of Nori motives over a field. Next we construct an algebra in\n\\'etale motives such that modules over it afford a t-structure that restricts\nto constructible objects. This category of integral Nori motives has the six\noperations and arc-descent. We finish by providing analogous constructions and\nresults for mixed Hodge modules on schemes over the reals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HEMs7935-IUgo3QTbJkIivLk7-8CeI1FYJbUiTl8cz4","pdfSize":"709328","objectId":"0x2bc4d7ea18e03799c708a6db39d8b1876add91627154fd731dda0e2a062eafda","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
