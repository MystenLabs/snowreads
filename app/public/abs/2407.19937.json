However, most\nexisting explainable recommendations only consider the importance of content in\nreviews, such as words or aspects, and ignore the ordering relationship among\nthem. This oversight neglects crucial ordering dimensions in the human\ndecision-making process, leading to suboptimal performance. Therefore, in this\npaper, we propose Aspect Order Tree-based (AOTree) explainable recommendation\nmethod, inspired by the Order Effects Theory from cognitive and decision\npsychology, in order to capture the dependency relationships among decisive\nfactors. We first validate the theory in the recommendation scenario by\nanalyzing the reviews of the users. Then, according to the theory, the proposed\nAOTree expands the construction of the decision tree to capture aspect orders\nin users' decision-making processes, and use attention mechanisms to make\npredictions based on the aspect orders. Extensive experiments demonstrate our\nmethod's effectiveness on rating predictions, and our approach aligns more\nconsistently with the user' s decision-making process by displaying\nexplanations in a particular order, thereby enhancing interpretability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
