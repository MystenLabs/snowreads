The main reason for this\ndifficulty is that the effective strength of the Gamow-Teller transition\noperator $g_A$ for this decay is unknown. I will show the lowest-order vertex\ncorrections for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ and the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ NME of $^{136}$Xe\nin the framework of the hybrid application of the quantum field theory to the\nleptons and the Rayleigh-Schr\\\"{o}dinger perturbation to the nucleus. The\nunperturbed nuclear states are obtained by the quasiparticle random-phase\napproximation. These corrections reduce the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ NME by 30%. The\neffective $g_A$ referring to this reduced NME is also obtained, and it is shown\nfor the first time that the effective $g_A$ for the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ NME is not\nquite different from that for the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ NME; the difference is only\n10%. This indicates the possibility that the phenomenological effective $g_A$\nto reproduce the experimental half-life of the $2\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay can be\napproximately used for the calculation of the $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ NME.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nSWmJfUQhfTEhzxVJThCe3HeSm6P871auXsDlOPAGho","pdfSize":"299967"}
