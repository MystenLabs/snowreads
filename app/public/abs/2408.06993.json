This challenge involves efficiently allocating\njobs to a limited number of machines while minimizing factors like total\nprocessing time or job delays. While recent advancements in artificial\nintelligence have yielded promising solutions, such as reinforcement learning\nand graph neural networks, this paper explores the potential of Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for JSSP. We introduce the very first supervised 120k dataset\nspecifically designed to train LLMs for JSSP. Surprisingly, our findings\ndemonstrate that LLM-based scheduling can achieve performance comparable to\nother neural approaches. Furthermore, we propose a sampling method that\nenhances the effectiveness of LLMs in tackling JSSP.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
