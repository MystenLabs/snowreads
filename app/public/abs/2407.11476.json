In this work, we construct and prove infinite families of\nbilinear relations among these integration kernels that are necessary for the\nclosure of the space of higher-genus polylogarithms under integration over the\npoints on the surface. Our bilinear relations generalize the Fay identities\namong the genus-one Kronecker-Eisenstein kernels to arbitrary genus. The\nmultiple-valued meromorphic kernels in the flat connection of Enriquez are\nconjectured to obey higher-genus Fay identities of exactly the same form as\ntheir single-valued non-holomorphic counterparts. We initiate the applications\nof Fay identities to derive functional relations among higher-genus\npolylogarithms involving either single-valued or meromorphic integration\nkernels.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
