A number of continuous-time approaches exploit dynamics, however,\nand therefore are no longer physically motivated by the adiabatic principle. In\nthis work we take Planck's principle as the underlying physical motivation for\ncontinuous-time quantum algorithms. Planck's principle states that the energy\nof an isolated system cannot decrease as the result of a cyclic process. We use\nthis principle to justify monotonic schedules in quantum annealing which are\nnot adiabatic. This approach also highlights the limitations of reverse quantum\nannealing in an isolated system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
