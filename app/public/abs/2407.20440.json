In the nonrelativistic limit, this\nsymmetry mandates that electric current flowing in any crystallographic\ndirection is unpolarized. However, it is shown that elastic strain is effective\nin inducing the spin splitting effect in MnTe. For this analysis, a\nspin-orbit-coupled $\\mathbf{k}\\cdot\\mathbf{p}$ Hamiltonian for the valence band\nmaximum at the A point is derived and fitted to eigenvalues calculated from\nfirst principles. The spin splitting angle is calculated using the Boltzmann\napproach in the relaxation-time approximation. The spin splitting gauge factor\nexceeds 20 near the valence band maximum. Thus, with suitable substrate\nengineering, MnTe can be used as an efficient source and detector of spin\ncurrent in spintronic devices. Proper inclusion of the Rashba-Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit coupling is crucial for the correct description of the transport\nproperties of MnTe.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
