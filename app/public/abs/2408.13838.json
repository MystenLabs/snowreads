However, existing methods tend to\nparse night-time images from a day-time perspective, leaving the inherent\nchallenges in low-light conditions (such as compromised texture and deceiving\nmatching errors) unexplored. To address these issues, we propose a novel\nend-to-end optimized approach, named NightFormer, tailored for night-time\nsemantic segmentation, avoiding the conventional practice of forcibly fitting\nnight-time images into day-time distributions. Specifically, we design a\npixel-level texture enhancement module to acquire texture-aware features\nhierarchically with phase enhancement and amplified attention, and an\nobject-level reliable matching module to realize accurate association matching\nvia reliable attention in low-light environments. Extensive experimental\nresults on various challenging benchmarks including NightCity, BDD and\nCityscapes demonstrate that our proposed method performs favorably against\nstate-of-the-art night-time semantic segmentation methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
