We first use a\ndiscrete time deterministic optimal control problem interpretation of the time\ndiscretization scheme, and show that the discrete time value function is\nsemiconcave under regularity assumptions on the dynamics and the boundary of\ntarget set. We establish a convergence rate of order $1$ in terms of time step\nbased on this semiconcavity property. Then, we use a discrete time stochastic\noptimal control interpretation of the full discretization scheme, and we\nestablish a convergence rate of order $1$ in terms of both time and spatial\nsteps using certain interpolation operators, under further regularity\nassumptions. We extend our convergence results to problems with particular\nstate constraints. We apply our results to analyze the convergence rate and\ncomputational complexity of the fast-marching method. We also consider the\nmulti-level fast-marching method recently introduced by the authors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
