The state includes the\ncontrol functions. It is proved that there exists a unique chain control set\nwhich corresponds to the chain recurrent set of the semiflow. The semiflow can\nbe lifted to a linear semiflow on an infinite dimensional vector bundle with\nchain transitive base flow. A decomposition into exponentially separated\nsubbundles is provided by a recent generalization of Selgrade's theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cnjxsd2zDcrw7Ohv9JlEh_oXUsQMs2BDkSyrnXOKihs","pdfSize":"333088"}
