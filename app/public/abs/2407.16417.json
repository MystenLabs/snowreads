Traditionally analyzed with signal processing-based\nfeatures, recent approaches have utilized self-supervised models pre-trained on\nhuman speech for feature extraction, capitalizing on their ability to learn a\nsignal's intrinsic structure independently of its acoustic domain. However, the\nutility of such foundation models remains unclear for marmoset call analysis in\nterms of multi-class classification, bandwidth, and pre-training domain. This\nstudy assesses feature representations derived from speech and general audio\ndomains, across pre-training bandwidths of 4, 8, and 16 kHz for marmoset\ncall-type and caller classification tasks. Results show that models with higher\nbandwidth improve performance, and pre-training on speech or general audio\nyields comparable results, improving over a spectral baseline.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bAbNyItZITGnuJJQ6emR00uW6KAVcgm3tPH-ntV0vR8","pdfSize":"3683403","objectId":"0x8a875c5d1b466596dd6eac55dc11b58715dbf48a94a46e208e93be1a33811ebd","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
