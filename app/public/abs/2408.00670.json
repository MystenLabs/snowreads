This\nequation does not have a variational frame when $p\\neq 2.$ Instead of\nvariational methods, we prove the existence and uniqueness of positive radial\nsolutions of the above equation via the shooting method by establishing some\nnew differential inequalities. The proofs are based on an analysis of the\ncorresponding system of second-order differential equations, and our results\nextend the existing ones in the literature from $p=2$ to $p\\in[1,2]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
