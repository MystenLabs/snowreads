To address this \"small data\" dilemma, Meta-Learning has been\nintroduced as a solution to enhance the optimization of machine learning models\nby utilizing similar datasets, thereby facilitating a quicker adaptation to\ntarget datasets without the requirement of sufficient samples. In this study,\nwe present a meta-learning-based approach for predicting lung cancer from gene\nexpression profiles. We apply this framework to well-established deep learning\nmethodologies and employ four distinct datasets for the meta-learning tasks,\nwhere one as the target dataset and the rest as source datasets. Our approach\nis evaluated against both traditional and deep learning methodologies, and the\nresults show the superior performance of meta-learning on augmented source data\ncompared to the baselines trained on single datasets. Moreover, we conduct the\ncomparative analysis between meta-learning and transfer learning methodologies\nto highlight the efficiency of the proposed approach in addressing the\nchallenges associated with limited sample sizes. Finally, we incorporate the\nexplainability study to illustrate the distinctiveness of decisions made by\nmeta-learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ecJ6PzhvrxhwTCt2m1pTPaf9QYxdAlFQTnRWj4X59gU","pdfSize":"918415"}
