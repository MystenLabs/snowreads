The CRI has been created to address drawbacks with\nprevailing methodologies and to supplement existing methods. Modified and\nadapted from the Herfindahl-Hirschman (HH) index, the CRI can give a single\nnumeric score that can be helpful to evaluate the extent of risks that arise\nfrom holding concentrated portfolios. We discuss how the CRI can become an\nindicator of financial stability at any desired aggregation unit: regional,\nnational or international level. We show how the CRI can be easily applied to\ninsurance risk and to any product portfolio mix. The CRI is particularly\napplicable to the current facet of the decentralized terrain, wherein the\nmajority of the wealth is restricted to a small number of tokens. We calculate\nand report the CRI -- along with other risk metrics -- for individual assets\nand portfolios of crypto assets using a daily data sample from January 01, 2019\nuntil August 10, 2022. The CRI is an example of developing metrics that can\nuseful for sending concise yet powerful messages to the relevant audience. This\ntactic -- which can be described as marketing the benefits of any product or\nservice by using concepts from multiple disciplines -- of creating new metrics\ngoes further beyond the use of metrics to evaluate marketing efficacy. The\nsimplicity of our metric -- and the intuitive explanations we have provided for\nthe CRI -- makes it straightforward to properly articulate a strong -- clear\nand positive -- signal as part of marketing campaigns. The development -- and\nimplementation -- of new risk management metrics will have greater impact when\na wider rigorous risk management process has been established. We discuss\nseveral topics related to bringing about more improved risk management across\nall types of institutions and assets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
