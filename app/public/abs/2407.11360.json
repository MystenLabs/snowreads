{"id":"2407.11360","title":"Thorns and Algorithms: Navigating Generative AI Challenges Inspired by\n  Giraffes and Acacias","authors":"Waqar Hussain","authorsParsed":[["Hussain","Waqar",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 16 Jul 2024 03:53:25 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-17","timestamp":1721102005000,"abstract":"  The interplay between humans and Generative AI (Gen AI) draws an insightful\nparallel with the dynamic relationship between giraffes and acacias on the\nAfrican Savannah. Just as giraffes navigate the acacia's thorny defenses to\ngain nourishment, humans engage with Gen AI, maneuvering through ethical and\noperational challenges to harness its benefits. This paper explores how, like\nyoung giraffes that are still mastering their environment, humans are in the\nearly stages of adapting to and shaping Gen AI. It delves into the strategies\nhumans are developing and refining to help mitigate risks such as bias,\nmisinformation, and privacy breaches, that influence and shape Gen AI's\nevolution. While the giraffe-acacia analogy aptly frames human-AI relations, it\ncontrasts nature's evolutionary perfection with the inherent flaws of\nhuman-made technology and the tendency of humans to misuse it, giving rise to\nmany ethical dilemmas. Through the HHH framework we identify pathways to embed\nvalues of helpfulness, honesty, and harmlessness in AI development, fostering\nsafety-aligned agents that resonate with human values. This narrative presents\na cautiously optimistic view of human resilience and adaptability, illustrating\nour capacity to harness technologies and implement safeguards effectively,\nwithout succumbing to their perils. It emphasises a symbiotic relationship\nwhere humans and AI continually shape each other for mutual benefit.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z7ZQA-g3CJMHTNXrUlISUTEU0Mi1rhThmGa7UELrqjg","pdfSize":"21987823"}
