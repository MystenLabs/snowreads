In this study, we examine the effects of a\ngeneral class of PQ-breaking operators on the axion cosmological production via\nmisalignment, focussing on both temperature-dependent and independent\nPQ-breaking potentials. In particular, we show that a variant of the trapped\nmisalignment mechanism can delay the onset of axion oscillation, leading to an\naxion dark matter window with $m_a \\gg 10^{-5}$ eV. This scenario is testable\nthrough various experimental approaches, including standard axion haloscopes\nand helioscopes, as well as searches for electric dipole moments and\naxion-mediated forces.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZLolqa-hKLrlfARTz5o2mktve1jxPJkO5kQ8LW-7wd4","pdfSize":"902747"}
