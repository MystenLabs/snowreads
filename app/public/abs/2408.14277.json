We explore several LLMs, evaluating their\ncapabilities in extracting valuable epidemic information. We further enhance\nthe capabilities of the LLMs using in-context learning, and test the\nperformance of an ensemble model incorporating multiple open-source LLMs. The\nfindings indicate that LLMs can significantly enhance the accuracy and\ntimeliness of epidemic modelling and forecasting, offering a promising tool for\nmanaging future pandemic events.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
