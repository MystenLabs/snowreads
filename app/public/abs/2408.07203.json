Using\ntechniques from topology we elucidate how this principle holds for one of the\nproposals for the interacting bosonic case and yet fails for weak free fermion\nphases. Last we show how a variant of the principle does hold for strong\ncrystalline free fermion phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
