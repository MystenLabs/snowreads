The neutron star has a spin period of ~5.4 hr.\nThe traditional wind-accreting model requires an ultra-strong magnetic field\nfor the neutron star to explain its extremely long spin period, which seems\nproblematic for the neutron star with an age of a few tens of million years. In\nthis work, we take into account the unsteady feature of wind accretion, which\nresults in alternation of the direction of the wind matter's angular momentum.\nAccordingly, the torque exerted by the accreted wind matter varies between\npositive and negative from time to time, and largely cancels out over long\ntime. In such a scenario, neutron stars can naturally attain long spin periods\nwithout the requirement of a very strong magnetic field. This may also provide\na reasonable explanation for the spin period distribution of long-period\nneutron stars in HMXBs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
