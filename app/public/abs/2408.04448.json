Combining our light\ncurve with the ASAS-SN and ATLAS data in the rising phase, and fitting the\ncomposite multi-band light curves with MOSFiT, we estimate black hole mass of\nAT 2023clx is between $10^{5.67}$--$10^{5.82}~M_{\\odot}$. This event may be\ncaused by either a full disruption of a $0.1~M_{\\odot}$ star, or a partial\ndisruption of a $0.99~M_{\\odot}$ star, depending on the data adopted for the\nrising phase. Based on those fit results and the non-detection of soft X-ray\nphotons in the first 90 days, we propose that the observed optical radiation is\npowered by stream-stream collision. We speculate that the soft X-ray photons\nmay gradually emerge in 100--600 days after the optical peak, when the debris\nis fully circularized into a compact accretion disk.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
