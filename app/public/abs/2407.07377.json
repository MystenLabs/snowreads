We show that, distinct from the previously studied electric barrier\ntunneling, the vector potential barriers are more transparent for\npseudospin-1/2 Dirac fermions but more obstructive for pseudospin-1 Dirac\nfermions. By tuning the height of the vector potential barrier, the\npseudospin-1/2 Dirac fermions remain transmitted, whereas the transmission of\nthe pseudospin-1 Dirac fermions is forbidden, leading to a pseudospin filtering\neffect for massless Dirac fermions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
