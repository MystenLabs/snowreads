Existing industrial solutions mainly follow a\ntwo-stage pattern that incorporate heuristic or learning-based algorithms with\nnaive combinatorial methods, tackling the uncertainty of both sides' behaviors,\nincluding emerging timings, spatial relationships, and travel duration, etc. In\nthis paper, we propose a one-stage end-to-end reinforcement learning based\norder-dispatching approach that solves behavior prediction and combinatorial\noptimization uniformly in a sequential decision-making manner. Specifically, we\nemploy a two-layer Markov Decision Process framework to model this problem, and\npresent \\underline{D}eep \\underline{D}ouble \\underline{S}calable\n\\underline{N}etwork (D2SN), an encoder-decoder structure network to generate\norder-driver assignments directly and stop assignments accordingly. Besides, by\nleveraging contextual dynamics, our approach can adapt to the behavioral\npatterns for better performance. Extensive experiments on Didi's real-world\nbenchmarks justify that the proposed approach significantly outperforms\ncompetitive baselines in optimizing matching efficiency and user experience\ntasks. In addition, we evaluate the deployment outline and discuss the gains\nand experiences obtained during the deployment tests from the view of\nlarge-scale engineering implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
