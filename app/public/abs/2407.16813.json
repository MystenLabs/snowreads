Both out-of-the-money (OTM) and at-the-money\n(ATM) asymptotics are considered. Using large deviations theory methods, the\nasymptotics for the OTM options are expressed as a two-dimensional variational\nproblem, which is reduced to an extremal problem for a function of two real\nvariables. This extremal problem is solved explicitly in an expansion in\nlog-moneyness. We derive series expansions for the implied volatility for\nEuropean and VIX options which should be useful for model calibration. We give\nexplicit results for two classes of local-stochastic volatility models relevant\nin practice, with Heston-type and SABR-type stochastic volatility. The\nleading-order asymptotics for at-the-money options are computed in closed-form.\nThe asymptotic results reproduce known results in the literature for the Heston\nand SABR models and for the uncorrelated local-stochastic volatility model. The\nasymptotic results are tested against numerical simulations for a\nlocal-stochastic volatility model with bounded local volatility.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Pricing of Securities"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
