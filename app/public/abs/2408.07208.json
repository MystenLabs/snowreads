In particular, research has found multi-armed\nbandit (MAB) intelligent tutors to have notable abilities in traversing the\nexploration-exploitation trade-off landscape for student problem\nrecommendations. Prior literature, however, contains a significant lack of\nopen-sourced MAB intelligent tutors, which impedes potential applications of\nthese educational MAB recommendation systems. In this paper, we combine recent\nliterature on MAB intelligent tutoring techniques into an open-sourced and\nsimply deployable hierarchical MAB algorithm, capable of progressing students\nconcurrently through concepts and problems, determining ideal recommended\nproblem difficulties, and assessing latent memory decay. We evaluate our\nalgorithm using simulated groups of 500 students, utilizing Bayesian Knowledge\nTracing to estimate students' content mastery. Results suggest that our\nalgorithm, when turned difficulty-agnostic, significantly boosts student\nsuccess, and that the further addition of problem-difficulty adaptation notably\nimproves this metric.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
