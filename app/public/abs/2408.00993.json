By\nvirtue of the dissipative structure and the interpolation method, we firstly\nprove global regularity in $H^2$ framework for the compressible FENE system\nwith some large data. Then, we obtain optimal decay estimates of large\nsolutions in $H^1$ and remove the smallness assumption of low frequencies by\nvirtue of the Fourier splitting method and the Littlewood-Paley decomposition\ntheory. Furthermore, we establish optimal decay rate for the highest derivative\nof the solutions by a different method combining time frequency decomposition\nand the time weighted energy estimate. These obtained results generalize and\ncover the classical results of the incompressible FENE dumbbell model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
