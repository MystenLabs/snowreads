This provides yet\nanother example that the integrand of certain physical observable -- $N$-point\nenergy correlator -- is computed by the canonical form of a positive geometry\n-- the (tree-level) \"squared amplituhedron\". By extracting such squared\namplitudes from the $f$-graph construction, we compute the integrand of energy\ncorrelators up to $N=11$ and reveal new structures to all $N$; we also show\nimportant properties of the integrand such as soft and multi-collinear limits.\nFinally, we take a first look at integrations by studying possible residues of\nthe integrand: our analysis shows that while this gives prefactors in front of\nmultiple polylogarithm functions of $N=3,4$, the first unknown case of $N=5$\nalready involves elliptic polylogarithmic functions with many distinct elliptic\ncurves, and more complicated curves and higher-dimensional varieties appear for\n$N>5$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
