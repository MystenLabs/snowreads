We\naddressed these challenges by creating a physics-based synthetic image and data\ngenerator, resulting in a machine learning model that achieves comparable\nprecision (0.86), recall (0.63), F1 scores (0.71), and engineering property\npredictions (R2=0.82) to a model trained on human-labeled data. We enhanced\nboth models by using feature prediction confidence scores to derive an\nimage-wide confidence metric, enabling simple thresholding to eliminate\nambiguous and out-of-domain images resulting in performance boosts of 5-30%\nwith a filtering-out rate of 25%. Our study demonstrates that synthetic data\ncan eliminate human reliance in ML and provides a means for domain awareness in\ncases where many feature detections per image are needed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Re5gORQqENsrRw8WKWyRo-dVxhvTifn4p6KkQiB-hu4","pdfSize":"1376747","txDigest":"GSZuWEmZ88qT9jwuKLMCLDnzgqzwVpaiyJRJorHAAwPB","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
