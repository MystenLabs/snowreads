Unlike classical\nStochastic Volatility or GARCH-type models with restrictive parametric\nstationarity assumptions, our proposed Adaptive Stochastic Volatility (ASV)\nmodel provides smooth yet dynamically adaptive estimates of evolving volatility\nand its uncertainty (vol of vol). We derive the theoretical properties of the\nproposed global-local shrinkage prior. Through simulation studies, we\ndemonstrate that ASV exhibits remarkable misspecification resilience with low\nprediction error across various data generating scenarios in simulation.\nFurthermore, ASV's capacity to yield locally smooth and interpretable estimates\nfacilitates a clearer understanding of underlying patterns and trends in\nvolatility. Additionally, we propose and illustrate an extension for Bayesian\nTrend Filtering simultaneously in both mean and variance. Finally, we show that\nthis attribute makes ASV a robust tool applicable across a wide range of\ndisciplines, including in finance, environmental science, epidemiology, and\nmedicine, among others.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
