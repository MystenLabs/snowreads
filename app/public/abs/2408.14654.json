Based on\nthese phenomenological relations, we provide a framework named gwNRXHME to\ncompute multi-modal eccentric non-precessing waveforms using two inputs:\nquadrupolar eccentric waveforms, and the corresponding multi-modal\nquasi-circular non-precessing waveforms. Furthermore, we compute an overall\ndegree of departure in SXS, RIT, and MAYA NR data from these relations and find\nthat SXS NR simulations generally adhere to these relations more strictly than\nRIT and MAYA data. We also show that these relations can offer a cost-effective\nway to filter out noisy higher-order spherical harmonic modes extracted from NR\ndata. Our framework is publicly available through the gwModels package.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
