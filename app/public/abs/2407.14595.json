(2020) and the GSMF of massive galaxies at $M_* \\gtrsim\n10^{11.5} M_\\odot$ from the volume-limited MASSIVE galaxy survey. To obtain a\nrobust estimate of $M_*$ for local massive galaxies, we use MASSIVE galaxies\nwith $M_*$ measured from detailed dynamical modeling or stellar population\nsynthesis modeling (incorporating a bottom-heavy initial mass function) with\nhigh-quality spatially-resolved spectroscopy. These two independent sets of\n$M_*$ agree to within ${\\sim}7$%. Our new $z=0$ GSMF has a higher amplitude at\n$M_* \\gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\\odot$ than previous studies, alleviating prior\nconcerns of a lack of mass growth in massive galaxies between $z\\sim 1$ and 0.\nWe derive a local black hole mass function (BHMF) from this GSMF and the\nscaling relation of SMBH and galaxy masses. The inferred abundance of local\nSMBHs above $\\sim 10^{10}M_\\odot$ is consistent with the number of currently\nknown systems. The predicted amplitude of the nanohertz stochastic\ngravitational wave background is also consistent with the levels reported by\nPulsar Timing Array teams. Our $z = 0$ GSMF therefore leads to concordant\nresults in the high-mass regime of the local galaxy and SMBH populations and\nthe gravitational wave amplitude from merging SMBHs. An exception is our BHMF\nyields a $z=0$ SMBH mass density that is notably higher than the value\nestimated from quasars at higher redshifts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
