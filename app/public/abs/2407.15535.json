The\nratio method offers a new observable: the ratio of angular differential cross\nsections for breakup and scattering. It is predicted to be much more sensitive\nto the projectile structure than individual cross sections thanks to its\nindependence of the reaction process. We test this new observable\nexperimentally for the first time considering the collision of 11Be on C at\n22.8 MeV/nucleon. We extend this analysis to similar data recently measured on\nPb at 19.1 MeV/nucleon. Both analyses confirm the theoretical predictions,\nwhich opens the door to a new era in the study of nuclear structure near the\nneutron dripline. This should prove invaluable in conjunction with the start of\nFRIB. The ratio method could also be extended to other fields of quantum\nphysics beyond nuclear reactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
