A levitated\nAu nanosphere is melted, expelled from the trap, and maintained in the molten\nstate with a laser directed along the droplet trajectory until it reaches the\nsubstrate and rapidly solidifies. Also during transit, the charged droplets are\nfocused to a small region of the substrate with an electrostatic lens. After\ndeposition, the substrate can be removed from the vacuum chamber and imaged and\nanalyzed by techniques such as electron microscopy and energy dispersive\nspectroscopy (EDS). Over 90% of launched particles are deposited on the\nsubstrate, and when the lens is focused, particles land in a region of diameter\n120 $\\mu$m after traversing a distance of 236 mm. Our technique is of value for\nanalysis of materials prepared or processed while levitated that can be melted.\nAlso, Au droplets may be useful as tracers for future experiments involving\nsmaller projectiles or oriented solids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
