Alongside its efficient implementation, this algorithm\nreduces depolarization noise affections exponentially. We demonstrated energy\ngap calculations for one-dimensional Hubbard models on IBM superconducting\ndevices using circuits up to 32-system (plus one-ancilla) qubits, a five-fold\nincrease over previous QPE demonstrations, at the 7242 controlled-Z gate level\nof standard transpilation, keying a Q-CTRL error suppression module.\nAdditionally, we propose a technique towards molecular executions using spatial\norbital localization and index sorting, verified by an eight-qubit butadiene\nsimulation. Since QPDE can handle the same objectives as QPE, our algorithm\nrepresents a leap forward in quantum computing on real devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1AAkTRgc1HcB98lUiTrUcWFLrPPYgDipFE5-EQGZzsY","pdfSize":"881761"}
