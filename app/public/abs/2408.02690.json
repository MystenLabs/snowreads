We discuss the concept of using Lagrangian mechanics for systems\nundergoing synchronization and its connection to least-action principles. By\nreplacing the concept of least action with a least signaling term, we\ninvestigate how the path integral representation can be applied to study\nsynchronization dynamics in entangled networks, drawing parallels with coupled\noscillators in phase space models such as the Kuramoto model, as well as its\nrelation to algorithms, such as the firefly algorithm for potential use in\noptimization in networks. This article also illustrates how entanglement\nsignals themselves can interact strongly with ordered systems of harmonic\noscillators that reach thresholds of classical synchronization with potential\ntherefore for using entangled signals as weak measurement probes where phase\ndynamics is of interest.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fuqoAqAueZ-S3cn8xF3bSFIMZeZ5BZhlL0id7CBIuyE","pdfSize":"531634","txDigest":"FLhFeh5324tRd2qyuQEAfqpybW8GW6bN2QSayQV7RrLS","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
