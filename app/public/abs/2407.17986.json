Firstly, for the age replacement policy, Some sufficient conditions\nfor the existence and uniqueness of the optimal replacement time for both the\nseries and parallel systems are provided. By introducing deviation costs, the\nexpected cost rate of the system is optimized, and the optimal replacement time\nof the system is extended. Secondly, the periodic replacement policy for series\nand parallel systems is considered in the dependent case, and a sufficient\ncondition for the existence and uniqueness of the optimal number of periods is\nprovided. Some numerical examples are given to illustrate and discuss the above\npreventive replacement policies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6VXzbHLU4cT8R7lno55J5x-91YX7F0pcXv22wqIyZY8","pdfSize":"784963","objectId":"0x0337c25bb7f9ab0a25f8c5ed83972be779a6650d3e6de53df71db20d75df2c25","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
