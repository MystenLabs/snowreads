The proposed framework\nis designed for discrete-time stochastic linear systems with output\nmeasurements and provides a principled design of a predictive controller based\non data. The framework starts with a parameter identification method based on\nthe Expectation-Maximization algorithm, which incorporates pre-defined\nstructural constraints. Additionally, we provide an asymptotically correct\nmethod to quantify uncertainty in parameter estimates. Next, we develop a\nstrategy to synthesize robust dynamic output-feedback controllers tailored to\nthe derived uncertainty characterization. Finally, we introduce a predictive\ncontrol scheme that guarantees recursive feasibility and satisfaction of chance\nconstraints. This framework marks a significant advancement in integrating data\ninto robust and predictive control schemes. We demonstrate the efficacy of D2PC\nthrough a numerical example involving a $10$-dimensional spring-mass-damper\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
