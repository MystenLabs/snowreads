In particular we find an asymptotic for the number of\nabelian field extensions of a number field k whose conductor is the sum of two\nsquares. We also discuss an application of the Brauer group of stacks to\nquadratic number fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
