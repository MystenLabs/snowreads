Special cases of the tridiagonal algebra\ninclude the $q$-Onsager algebra, the positive part of the $q$-deformed\nenveloping algebra $U_q({\\widehat{\\mathfrak{sl}}}_2)$, and the enveloping\nalgebra of the Onsager Lie algebra.\n  In this paper, we introduce the $S_3$-symmetric tridiagonal algebra. This\nalgebra has six generators. The generators can be identified with the vertices\nof a regular hexagon, such that nonadjacent generators commute and adjacent\ngenerators satisfy a pair of tridiagonal relations. For a $Q$-polynomial\ndistance-regular graph $\\Gamma$ we turn the tensor power $V^{\\otimes 3}$ of the\nstandard module $V$ into a module for an $S_3$-symmetric tridiagonal algebra.\n  We investigate in detail the case in which $\\Gamma$ is a Hamming graph. We\ngive some conjectures and open problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
