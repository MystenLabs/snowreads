We\nemploy the Norfolk family of local chiral interactions and a consistent\nelectromagnetic charge operator. Our calculations are compared both to data and\npast theoretical evaluations. This work represents, to our knowledge, the first\nexact many-body calculation of longitudinal form factors in the\n$7\\,\\leq\\,A\\,\\leq\\,10$ mass range. Finally, we identify $^9$Be and $^{10}$B as\ncandidate targets for renewed experimental interest, as they exhibit the\npotential to provide more stringent constraints on the theoretical models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
