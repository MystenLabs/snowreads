We further investigate implications of this in relation to the\nBaum-Connes conjecture, and prove that Gromov hyperbolic groups have isomorphic\nequivariant K-theories of their Gromov boundary and their stable Higson corona.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
