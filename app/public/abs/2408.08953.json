Concretely, we show how the\ngeometry of configuration space together with the phase of the wave function of\nthe universe can, under certain conditions, lead to the definition of a\npositive-definite inner product from which probabilities can be defined. The\nnorm is conserved under time evolution, and we obtain a version of Ehrenfest's\ntheorem that is analogous to the one in ordinary quantum mechanics. We address\nhow the present approach avoids some difficulties that were encountered in\nprevious attempts at defining an Ehrenfest theorem relative to phase time in\nthe context of relativistic quantum mechanics and canonical quantum gravity,\nand how it is connected to a notion of gauge fixing the inner product. We\nconclude with a brief outlook.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
