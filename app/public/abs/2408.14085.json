Families of experiments can assess the performance\nof tools and processes and, at the same time, alleviate some of the typical\nshortcomings of individual experiments (e.g., inaccurate and potentially biased\nresults due to a small number of participants). Objective: Compare the\nusability of a chatbot for collaborative modelling (i.e., SOCIO) and an online\nweb tool (i.e., Creately). Method: We conducted a family of three experiments\nto evaluate the usability of SOCIO against the Creately online collaborative\ntool in academic settings. Results: The student participants were faster at\nbuilding class diagrams using the chatbot than with the online collaborative\ntool and more satisfied with SOCIO. Besides, the class diagrams built using the\nchatbot tended to be more concise -albeit slightly less complete. Conclusion:\nChatbots appear to be helpful for building class diagrams. In fact, our study\nhas helped us to shed light on the future direction for experimentation in this\nfield and lays the groundwork for researching the applicability of chatbots in\ndiagramming.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
