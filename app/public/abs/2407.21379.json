Topological nontriviality is detected by analyzing effective Dirac\nHamiltonian, and confirmed by numerical and analytical study of the emergence\nof topological edge states at the boundaries between topologically distinct\nregions. We have also discovered that a novel asymmetric edge current\nattributable to chirality can be excited without any involved phase shifts in\ninput sources to pick up one of the pseudospin components.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
