The main focus of this paper is to relax the conditions on\nthe symbols of pseudo-differential operators and data while still ensuring that\nthe stochastic partial differential equations remain well-posed in a weak\nsense. Specifically, we allow symbols to be random and remove all regularity\nand ellipticity conditions on them. As a result, our main operators include\nmany interesting rough operators that cannot generate any regularity gain or\nintegrability improvement from the equations. In addition, our data do not need\nto be regular or possess finite stochastic moments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
