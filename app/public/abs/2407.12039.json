We first consider Arnold's\ncircle map, for which there is a universal power law for the fraction of\nnonresonant orbits as a function of the amplitude of the nonlinearity. Our\nmethods give a more precise calculation of the coefficients for this power law.\nFor two-dimensional torus maps, we show that there is no such universal law for\nany of the classes of orbits. However, we find different categories of maps\nwith qualitatively similar behavior. Our results are obtained using three fast\nand high precision numerical methods: weighted Birkhoff averages, Farey trees,\nand resonance orders.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RFlwxwGZChaed_k7TznS9fDXGJQYuA_SztuTT2NB6ik","pdfSize":"5921792"}
