However, the effects vary highly based on\nthe content, and information on how good a video can be compressed is required.\nThis can be measured by estimating the encoded bitstream size prior to\nencoding. We identified the errors between estimated motion vectors from Motion\nSearch, an algorithm that predicts temporal changes in videos, correlates well\nto the encoded bitstream size. Combining Motion Search with Random Forests, the\nencoding bitrate can be estimated with a Pearson correlation of above 0.96.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
