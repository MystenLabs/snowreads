One of the most prevalent and\nrecent challenge that higher education faces today is making students\nskillfully employable. Institutions possess large volume of data; still they\nare unable to reveal knowledge and guide their students. Data in education is\ngenerally very large, multidimensional and unbalanced in nature. Process of\nextracting knowledge from such data has its own set of problems and is a very\ncomplicated task. In this paper, Engineering and MCA (Masters in Computer\nApplications) students data is collected from various universities and\ninstitutes pan India. The dataset is large, unbalanced and multidimensional in\nnature. A cluster based model is presented in this paper, which, when applied\nat preprocessing stage helps in parsimonious selection of variables and\nimproves the performance of predictive algorithms. Hence, facilitate in better\nprediction of Students Employability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"gFvGCxKPcfpJXy7qgZMRe3XrwPPv-ndlMOsJ91IY4vM","pdfSize":"849485"}
