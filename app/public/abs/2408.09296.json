In this analysis, we explore the properties of\nexoplanets situated with respect to circumstellar habitable zones by\nimplementing a sophisticated filtering methodology on data from the NASA\nExoplanet Archive. This research encompasses a thorough examination of 5,595\nconfirmed exoplanets listed in the Archive as of March 10th, 2024,\nsystematically evaluated according to their calculated surface temperatures and\nstellar classifications of their host stars, taking into account the biases\nimplicit in the methodologies used for their discovery. Our findings elucidate\ndistinctive patterns in exoplanetary attributes, which are significantly shaped\nby the spectral classifications and mass of the host stars. The insights\ngarnered from our study not only enhance the existing models for managing\nburgeoning exoplanetary datasets, but also lay foundational groundwork for\nfuture explorations into the dynamic relationships between exoplanets and their\nstellar environments.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EfYjEf4zh4DKOpv_P33eLWO2Y4cLS9KtXRLOYdaNXVY","pdfSize":"2055649"}
