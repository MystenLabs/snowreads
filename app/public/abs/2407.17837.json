Assuming that the\nvector field $a$ is not of Uhlenbeck-type structure, satisfies $p$-growth\nassumptions and $(z,u)\\mapsto a(z,u,\\xi)$ is H\\\"older continuous for every\n$\\xi\\in \\mathbb{R}^{Nn}$, we show that the gradient $Du$ is partially H\\\"older\ncontinuous, provided the vector field degenerates like that of the\n$p$-Laplacian for small gradients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
