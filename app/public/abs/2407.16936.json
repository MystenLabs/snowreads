To enhance the performance of\nsimple Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods, techniques of annealing type\nhave been widely used. However, quantitative theoretical guarantees of these\ntechniques are under-explored. This study takes a first step toward providing a\nnon-asymptotic analysis of annealed MCMC. Specifically, we establish, for the\nfirst time, an oracle complexity of $\\widetilde{O}\\left(\\frac{d\\beta^2{\\cal\nA}^2}{\\varepsilon^6}\\right)$ for simple annealed Langevin Monte Carlo algorithm\nto achieve $\\varepsilon^2$ accuracy in Kullback-Leibler divergence to the\ntarget distribution $\\pi\\propto{\\rm e}^{-V}$ on $\\mathbb{R}^d$ with\n$\\beta$-smooth potential $V$. Here, ${\\cal A}$ represents the action of a curve\nof probability measures interpolating the target distribution $\\pi$ and a\nreadily sampleable distribution.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
