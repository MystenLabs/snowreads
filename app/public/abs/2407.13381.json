We aim to probe the\nkinematics of the inner part of the broad-line region (BLR) by resolving the\nmicrolensing response - a proxy for the size of the emitting region - in the\nwings of the broad emission lines (BELs). Specifically, we assess the strength\nof the microlensing effects in the wings of the high-ionization lines Si IV and\nC IV across various velocity bins in five gravitationally lensed quasars: SDSS\nJ1001+5027, SDSS J1004+4112, HE 1104$-$1805, SDSS J1206+4332, and SDSS\nJ1339+1310. Using Bayesian methods to estimate the dimensions of the\ncorresponding emission regions and adopting a Keplerian model as our baseline,\nwe examine the consistency of the hypothesis of disk-like rotation. Our results\nreveal a monotonic, smooth increase in microlensing magnification with\nvelocity. The deduced velocity-size relationships inferred for the various\nquasars and emission lines closely conform to the Keplerian model of an\ninclined disk. This study provides the first direct evidence of Keplerian\nrotation in the innermost region of quasars across a range of radial distances\nspanning from $\\sim$5 to 20 light-days.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
