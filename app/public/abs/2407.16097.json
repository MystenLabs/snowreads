Our\ntesting ground is the counter-rotation regime of the Taylor-Couette flow, where\nnumerical calculations are performed within a small periodic domain. The\naccurate computation of up to the seventh period doubling bifurcation, assisted\nby a purposely defined Poincar\\'e section, has enabled the estimation of the\ntwo Feigenbaum universal constants with unprecedented accuracy in a fluid flow\nproblem. We have further devised a method to predict the bifurcation diagram up\nto the accumulation point of the cascade based on the detailed inspection of\njust the first few period doubling bifurcations. Remarkably, the method is\napplicable beyond the accumulation point, with predictions remaining valid, in\na statistical sense, for the chaotic dynamics that follows.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e4RTUYRYi69FzXzwJ7bBF8fPEnHZRORZKP6KqW9E-o0","pdfSize":"13047745"}
