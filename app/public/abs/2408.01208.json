In\nthis paper, I provide a practical toolkit to recover the whole counterfactual\ndistribution of the untreated potential outcome for the treated group in\nnon-experimental settings with staggered treatment adoption by generalizing the\nexisting quantile treatment effects on the treated (QTT) estimator proposed by\nCallaway and Li (2019). Besides the QTT, I consider different approaches that\nanonymously summarize the quantiles of the distribution of the outcome of\ninterest (such as tests for stochastic dominance rankings) without relying on\nrank invariance assumptions. The finite-sample properties of the estimator\nproposed are analyzed via different Monte Carlo simulations. Despite being\nslightly biased for relatively small sample sizes, the proposed method's\nperformance increases substantially when the sample size increases.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
