Introducing an exhaustion by a sequence of bounded sub-domains of the\nwhole channel we show that the unique weak solution is strong. We then\nconstruct the global attractor and find an explicit upper bound of its fractal\ndimension with regard to the physical parameters. This result is compatible\nwith the analogous estimate in the case of the Dirichlet boundary condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RcuT_WirNdViyKM_qB9Ul6htOTN5Fdn2YhPk6wfBNXc","pdfSize":"606518"}
