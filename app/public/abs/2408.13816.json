While few-shot learning has been studied for natural\nimage classification, its application to histopathology is relatively\nunexplored. Given the scarcity of labeled data in medical imaging and the\ninherent challenges posed by diverse tissue types and data preparation\ntechniques, this research evaluates the performance of state-of-the-art\nfew-shot learning methods for various scenarios on histology data. We have\nconsidered four histopathology datasets for few-shot histopathology image\nclassification and have evaluated 5-way 1-shot, 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 10-shot\nscenarios with a set of state-of-the-art classification techniques. The best\nmethods have surpassed an accuracy of 70%, 80% and 85% in the cases of 5-way\n1-shot, 5-way 5-shot and 5-way 10-shot cases, respectively. We found that for\nhistology images popular meta-learning approaches is at par with standard\nfine-tuning and regularization methods. Our experiments underscore the\nchallenges of working with images from different domains and underscore the\nsignificance of unbiased and focused evaluations in advancing computer vision\ntechniques for specialized domains, such as histology images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
