However, their connection to local Euclidean\nsurfaces still needs further investigation. This work aims to explore how the\ncharacteristics of crochet models relate to non-Euclidean concepts by providing\na parametrization of such surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tVnv7W_eUCZcIWvaNWIlUe-F44oWacwi1ZI7mHOM3l0","pdfSize":"2927445"}
