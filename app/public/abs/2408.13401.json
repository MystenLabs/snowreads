We\nprove that any such map is homotopic to an endperiodic relative train track\nmap. Moreover, we show that the (largest) Perron-Frobenius eigenvalue of the\ntransition matrix is a canonical quantity associated to the map.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KPU96TBLtDaDAYU--ZDZUNBtPtUF04GOG9W2BKnK5_4","pdfSize":"208690"}
