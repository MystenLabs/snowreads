We obtain the first equivalence test for\n$n$-dimensional distributions that is quasi-linear in $n$, improving the\npreviously known $\\tilde{O}(n^2/\\varepsilon^2)$ query complexity bound to\n$\\tilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon^2)$. We extend this result to general finite alphabets\nwith logarithmic cost in the alphabet size.\n  By exploiting the specific structure of the queries that we use (which are\nmore restrictive than general subcube queries), we obtain a cubic improvement\nover the best known test for distributions over $\\{1,\\ldots,N\\}$ under the\ninterval querying model of Canonne, Ron and Servedio (2015), attaining a query\ncomplexity of $\\tilde{O}((\\log N)/\\varepsilon^2)$, which for fixed\n$\\varepsilon$ almost matches the known lower bound of $\\Omega((\\log N)/\\log\\log\nN)$. We also derive a product test for $n$-dimensional distributions with\n$\\tilde{O}(n / \\varepsilon^2)$ queries, and provide an $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n} /\n\\varepsilon^2)$ lower bound for this property.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
