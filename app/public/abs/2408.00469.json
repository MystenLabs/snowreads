Here we report the evidence of the observation\nof a kink structure in Fe-based superconductor CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ using\nangle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. The kink shows an orbital selective\nand momentum dependent behavior, which is located at 15 meV below Fermi level\nalong the Gamma-M direction at the band with dxz orbital character and vanishes\nwhen approaching the Gamma-X direction, correlated with a slight decrease of\nthe superconducting gap. Most importantly, this kink structure disappears when\nthe superconducting gap closes, indicating that the corresponding bosonic mode\n(9 meV) is closely related to superconductivity. However, the origin of this\nmode remains unidentified, since it cannot be related to phonons or the spin\nresonance mode (15 meV) observed by inelastic neutron scattering. The behavior\nof this mode is rather unique and challenges our present understanding of the\nsuperconducting paring mechanism of the bilayer FeAs-based superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xpTQlP75_b5iaOUas3OC4T2hAidL7DiZvaaJKJJVAJA","pdfSize":"1228958"}
