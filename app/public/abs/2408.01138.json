In this review, we\ndiscuss different tagging frameworks available to tag boosted objects,\nespecially boosted Higgs boson and top quark, at the Large Hadron Collider\n(LHC). Our aim is to study the interplay of traditional jet substructure based\nmethods with the state-of-the-art machine learning ones. In this methodology,\nwe would gain some interpretability of those machine learning methods, and\nwhich in turn helps to propose hybrid taggers relevant for tagging of those\nboosted objects belonging to both Standard Model (SM) and physics beyond the\nSM.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gl5jSr9AY4bEcSZOR47yQdbFLc2_YchzFWh2987RaxM","pdfSize":"2703551","txDigest":"5UPNfzpDckQorZNbVH4QfMX3fSChPF9dCvFtFQv2ZUXh","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
