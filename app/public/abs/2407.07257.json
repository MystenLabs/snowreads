This is at least partially a consequence of limited\nmulti-wavelength follow up of this class of transients in real time. Here we\npresent deep optical ($g-$ and $i-$ band) photometry with Keck, and prompt\nradio observations with the VLA of FXT 210423 obtained at ${\\delta t \\approx\n14-36}$ days since the X-ray trigger. We use these multi-band observations,\ncombined with publicly available data sets, to constrain the presence and\nphysical properties of on-axis and off-axis relativistic jets such as those\nthat can be launched by neutron-star mergers and tidal disruption events, which\nare among the proposed theoretical scenarios of FXTs. Considering a wide range\nof possible redshifts $z\\le3.5$, circumstellar medium (CSM) density\n$n={10^{-6}-10^{-1}\\,\\rm{cm^{-3}}}$, isotropic-equivalent jet kinetic energy\n$E_{k,iso}={10^{48}-10^{55}\\,\\rm{erg}}$, we find that we can rule out wide jets\nwith opening angle ${\\theta_{j}=15^{\\circ}}$ viewed within ${10^{\\circ}}$\noff-axis. For more collimated jets (${\\theta_{j}=3^{\\circ}}$) we can only rule\nout on-axis (${\\theta_{obs}=0^{\\circ}}$) orientations. This study highlights\nthe constraining power of prompt multi-wavelength observations of FXTs\ndiscovered in real time by current (e.g., Einstein Probe) and future\nfacilities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
