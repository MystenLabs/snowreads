Our\napproach utilizes descent cone analysis through Mendelson's small ball method\nwith the Toeplitz constraint. The key ingredient is to determine the spectral\nnorm of the random matrix of the Topelitz structure, which may be of\nindependent interest.This improves upon earlier analyses and resolves the\nconjecture in Chen et al. (IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, 2015).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
