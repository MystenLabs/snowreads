Existing large 3D Gaussian\nmodels directly map 2D image to 3D Gaussian parameters, while regressing 2D\nimage to 3D Gaussian representations is challenging without 3D priors. In this\npaper, we propose a large Point-to-Gaussian model, that inputs the initial\npoint cloud produced from large 3D diffusion model conditional on 2D image to\ngenerate the Gaussian parameters, for image-to-3D generation. The point cloud\nprovides initial 3D geometry prior for Gaussian generation, thus significantly\nfacilitating image-to-3D Generation. Moreover, we present the\n\\textbf{A}ttention mechanism, \\textbf{P}rojection mechanism, and \\textbf{P}oint\nfeature extractor, dubbed as \\textbf{APP} block, for fusing the image features\nwith point cloud features. The qualitative and quantitative experiments\nextensively demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on GSO and\nObjaverse datasets, and show the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
