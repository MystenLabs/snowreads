The sim2real approach faces challenges due\nto mismatches between simulation and reality. These discrepancies arise from\ninaccuracies in modeling physical phenomena and asynchronous control, among\nother factors. To this end, we introduce EAGERx, a framework with a unified\nsoftware pipeline for both real and simulated robot learning. It can support\nvarious simulators and aids in integrating state, action and time-scale\nabstractions to facilitate learning. EAGERx's integrated delay simulation,\ndomain randomization features, and proposed synchronization algorithm\ncontribute to narrowing the sim2real gap. We demonstrate (in the context of\nrobot learning and beyond) the efficacy of EAGERx in accommodating diverse\nrobotic systems and maintaining consistent simulation behavior. EAGERx is open\nsource and its code is available at https://eagerx.readthedocs.io.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
