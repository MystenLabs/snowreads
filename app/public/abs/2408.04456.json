However, complex networks\noften present community structure, and tools to analyse information diffusion\non networks with communities are needed. In this paper, we develop theoretical\ntools using multi-type branching processes to model and analyse simple\ncontagion information spread on a broad class of networks with community\nstructure. We show how, by using limited information about the network -- the\ndegree distribution within and between communities -- we can calculate standard\nstatistical characteristics of the dynamics of information diffusion, such as\nthe extinction probability, hazard function, and cascade size distribution.\nThese properties can be estimated not only for the entire network but also for\neach community separately. Furthermore, we estimate the probability of\ninformation spreading from one community to another where it is not currently\nspreading. We demonstrate the accuracy of our framework by applying it to two\nspecific examples: the Stochastic Block Model and a log-normal network with\ncommunity structure. We show how the initial seeding location affects the\nobserved cascade size distribution on a heavy-tailed network and that our\nframework accurately captures this effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
