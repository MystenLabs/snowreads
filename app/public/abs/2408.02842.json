These sample-based\napproximation schemes include Monte Carlo (MC) and certain randomized\nquasi-Monte Carlo integration (RQMC) methods, such as scrambled net\nintegration. Our results can be applied to the approximation of risk-averse\nstochastic programs and risk-averse stochastic variational inequalities. Our\nnumerical simulations empirically demonstrate that RQMC approaches based on\nscrambled Sobol' sequences can yield smaller bias and root mean square error\nthan MC methods for risk-averse optimization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
