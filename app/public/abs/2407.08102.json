ACM SIGs expanded during 1970-2000; each\nexperienced increasing women's authorship. But diversity abounds. Several SIGs\nhad fewer than 10% women authors while SIGUCCS (university computing centers)\nexceeded 40%. Three SIGs experienced accelerating growth in women's authorship;\nmost, including a composite ACM, had decelerating growth. This research may\nencourage reform efforts, often focusing on general education or workforce\nfactors (across the entity of \"computer science\"), to examine under-studied\ndynamics within computer science that shaped changes in women's participation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
