An explainable methodology and architecture is\nintroduced based on the existing hardware trojan detection features. Results\nare provided for explaining digital hardware trojans within a netlist using\ntrust-hub trojan benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
