Limitations of existing methods included variation in ECG\nwaveforms due to the location of electrodes, high non-linearity in the signal,\nand amplitude measurement in millivolts. The present study reports a non-linear\nanalysis-based methodology that utilizes Recurrence plot visualization. The\npatterned occurrence of well-defined structures, such as the QRS complex, can\nbe exploited effectively using Recurrence plots. This Recurrence-based method\nis applied to the publicly available Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt\n(PTB) dataset from PhysioNet database, where we studied four classes of\ndifferent cardiac disorders (Myocardial infarction, Bundle branch blocks,\nCardiomyopathy, and Dysrhythmia) and healthy controls, achieving an impressive\nclassification accuracy of 100%. Additionally, t-SNE plot visualizations of the\nlatent space embeddings derived from Recurrence plots and Recurrence\nQuantification Analysis features reveal a clear demarcation between the\nconsidered cardiac disorders and healthy individuals, demonstrating the\npotential of this approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"X1gHSQDVP7XOp5c5bPZXGPy3BHs__3-8Y6lYwZnxf8M","pdfSize":"2215899","txDigest":"7sKEAjKX9LaRMYg8m3p1BYwm1xvwYBBKiR3rmzGn27Gc","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
