Indeed, multiple stakeholders operate and maintain different kinds\nof data but several interoperability issues limit their effective usage. In\nthis paper, we present an architecture enabled by Semantic Web technologies to\novercome such issues and facilitate the development of an integrated solution\nfor mobility stakeholders. The proposed solution is composed of different\ncomponents that address challenges for enabling data interoperability, from the\nfindability of data sources to their integrated consumption adopting\nstandardised data formats. We report on the implementation and validation in\nfour European cities of the TANGENT solution enabling data-driven tools for the\ndynamic management of multimodal traffic. Finally, we discuss the feedback\nreceived by users testing the solution and the lessons learnt during its\ndevelopment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
