We consider notions of (lax) functors between\nthese equipments, closed monoidal structures on these equipments, and\nfibrations internal to these equipments. As a main application, we will\ndemonstrate that the foundations of internal $\\infty$-category theory can be\nreadily obtained using this formalism.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
