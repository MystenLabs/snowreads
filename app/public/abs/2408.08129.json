The\nnumerical method is based on a Discontinuous Galerkin (DG) spatial\ndiscretization, highly scalable thanks to its data locality properties, and on\na second order Implicit-Explicit Runge-Kutta (IMEX-RK) method for time\ndiscretization, particularly well suited for low Mach number flows. Simulations\nwith non-conforming meshes for flows over orography can increase the accuracy\nof the local flow description without affecting the larger scales, which can be\nsolved on coarser meshes. We show that the local refining procedure has no\nsignificant impact on the parallel performance and, therefore, both efficiency\nand scalability can be achieved in this framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
