Focusing on asymptotically\n$\\text{AdS}_5$ black hole backgrounds, we derive new universal exact\nexpressions for holographic thermal two-point functions, both for scalar\noperators and conserved currents. Relatedly, we also obtain exact quantization\nconditions of the associated quasinormal modes (QNMs). Our expressions for the\nholographic $\\text{CFT}_4$ closely resemble the well-known results for 2d\nthermal CFTs on $\\mathbb{R}^{1,1}$. This structural similarity stems from the\nlocality of fusion transformation for Virasoro blocks. We provide numerical\nchecks of our quantization conditions for QNMs. Additionally, we discuss the\napplication of our results to understand specific physical properties of QNMs,\nincluding their near-extremal and asymptotic limits. The latter is related to a\ncertain large-momentum regime of semiclassical Virasoro blocks dual to\nSeiberg-Witten prepotentials.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
