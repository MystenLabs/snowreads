Depending on the properties of\nthe disorder, we show that the mean and variance of the asymptotic relaxation\nrate are non-monotonous functions of the parameters for a broad class of\ndisorders. In particular, the rate of relaxation may either increase or\ndecrease exponentially compared to the unperturbed case. In the limit of weak\ndisorder, we derive the probability distribution of the asymptotic relaxation\nrate and show that it is Gaussian, with analytic expressions for the mean and\nvariance that feature universal limits. In comparison with other, well-studied\nanomalous-relaxation effects that often lead to sub-exponential changes in the\nrelaxation rate, our results show that the effect of disorder is always\nstronger in the long-time limit. These findings indicate that controlled\ndisorder may serve to tune the relaxation speed in complex systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
