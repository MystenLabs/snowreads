ProCreate operates on a set\nof reference images and actively propels the generated image embedding away\nfrom the reference embeddings during the generation process. We propose FSCG-8\n(Few-Shot Creative Generation 8), a few-shot creative generation dataset on\neight different categories -- encompassing different concepts, styles, and\nsettings -- in which ProCreate achieves the highest sample diversity and\nfidelity. Furthermore, we show that ProCreate is effective at preventing\nreplicating training data in a large-scale evaluation using training text\nprompts. Code and FSCG-8 are available at\nhttps://github.com/Agentic-Learning-AI-Lab/procreate-diffusion-public.
