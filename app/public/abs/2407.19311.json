Yet, their effectiveness is often compromised in\nreal-world scenarios due to distribution shifts, limiting their capacity for\nknowledge transfer across changing environments or domains. Recently,\nUnsupervised Graph Domain Adaptation (UGDA) has been introduced to resolve this\nissue. UGDA aims to facilitate knowledge transfer from a labeled source graph\nto an unlabeled target graph. Current UGDA efforts primarily focus on\nmodel-centric methods, such as employing domain invariant learning strategies\nand designing model architectures. However, our critical examination reveals\nthe limitations inherent to these model-centric methods, while a data-centric\nmethod allowed to modify the source graph provably demonstrates considerable\npotential. This insight motivates us to explore UGDA from a data-centric\nperspective. By revisiting the theoretical generalization bound for UGDA, we\nidentify two data-centric principles for UGDA: alignment principle and\nrescaling principle. Guided by these principles, we propose GraphAlign, a novel\nUGDA method that generates a small yet transferable graph. By exclusively\ntraining a GNN on this new graph with classic Empirical Risk Minimization\n(ERM), GraphAlign attains exceptional performance on the target graph.\nExtensive experiments under various transfer scenarios demonstrate the\nGraphAlign outperforms the best baselines by an average of 2.16%, training on\nthe generated graph as small as 0.25~1% of the original training graph.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
