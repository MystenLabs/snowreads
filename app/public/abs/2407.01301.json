However, while\nstandardized methods for embedding proprietary or copyright information, either\novertly or subtly, exist for conventional visual content such as images and\nvideos, this issue remains unexplored for emerging generative 3D formats like\nGaussian Splatting. We present GaussianStego, a method for embedding\nsteganographic information in the rendering of generated 3D assets. Our\napproach employs an optimization framework that enables the accurate extraction\nof hidden information from images rendered using Gaussian assets derived from\nlarge models, while maintaining their original visual quality. We conduct\npreliminary evaluations of our method across several potential deployment\nscenarios and discuss issues identified through analysis. GaussianStego\nrepresents an initial exploration into the novel challenge of embedding\ncustomizable, imperceptible, and recoverable information within the renders\nproduced by current 3D generative models, while ensuring minimal impact on the\nrendered content's quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
