Many video compression methods reduce information in videos by removing\nhigh-frequency components and utilizing similarities between frames.\nAlternatively, the implicit neural representations (INRs) for videos, which use\nnetworks to represent and compress videos through model compression. A\nconventional method improves the quality of reconstruction by using frame\nfeatures. However, the detailed representation of the frames can be improved.\nTo improve the quality of reconstructed frames, we propose a method that uses\nlow-resolution frames as residual connection that is considered effective for\nimage reconstruction. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the\nexisting method, HNeRV, in PSNR for 46 of the 49 videos.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
