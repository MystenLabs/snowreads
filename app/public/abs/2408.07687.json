Here, the image patch is treated as\na 3D surface with intensity being the 3rd dimension. The considered 3D surface\nhas a rich set of second order features/statistics such as ridges, valleys,\ncliffs and so on, that can be easily captured by using the difference of\nrotating semi Gaussian filters. The originality of this method is based on\nsuccessfully combining the response of the directional filters with that of the\nDifference of Gaussian (DOG) approach. The obtained descriptor shows a good\ndiscriminative power when dealing with the variations in illumination, scale,\nrotation, blur, viewpoint and compression. The experiments on image matching,\ndemonstrates the advantage of the obtained descriptor when compared to its\nfirst order counterparts such as SIFT, DAISY, GLOH, GIST and LIDRIC.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t1xoXbfaQ0w3xF_RS0lH1TMRDd5ka-5bHgCkigohIis","pdfSize":"3269873"}
