Specifically, this paper aims to maximize the minimum beampattern\ngain at the RIS by jointly optimizing beamforming matrix at the base station\n(BS), the reflecting coefficients at the RIS and the positions of the MAs,\nsubject to signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the\nusers and maximum transmit power at the BS. To tackle this non-convex\noptimization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm and\nemploy semidefinite relaxation (SDR), sequential rank-one constraint relaxation\n(SRCR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Numerical results\nindicate that the MA and RIS-aided ISAC system outperforms conventional fixed\nposition antenna (FPA) and RIS-aided systems. In addition, the application of\nMAs can reduce the similarity of user channels and enhance channel gain in the\nISAC system.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
