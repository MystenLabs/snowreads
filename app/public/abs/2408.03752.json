The iDANSE algorithm matches the\nperformance of a centralized algorithm in a single processing cycle while\ndevices exchange fused versions of their multichannel local microphone signals.\nKey advantages of iDANSE over currently available solutions are its\niterationless nature, which favors deployment in real-time applications, and\nthe fact that devices can exchange fewer fused signals than the number of\nlatent sources in the environment. The proposed method is validated in\nnumerical simulations including a speech enhancement scenario.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CylDxiprKuL7PuVWVRzI1sK5ZyYYETTZCaGOZ9hCrdQ","pdfSize":"360536"}
