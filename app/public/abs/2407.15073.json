However, the multi-agent capabilities of LLMs in causal discovery\nremain underexplored. This paper introduces a general framework to investigate\nthis potential. The first is the Meta Agents Model, which relies exclusively on\nreasoning and discussions among LLM agents to conduct causal discovery. The\nsecond is the Coding Agents Model, which leverages the agents' ability to plan,\nwrite, and execute code, utilizing advanced statistical libraries for causal\ndiscovery. The third is the Hybrid Model, which integrates both the Meta Agents\nModel and CodingAgents Model approaches, combining the statistical analysis and\nreasoning skills of multiple agents. Our proposed framework shows promising\nresults by effectively utilizing LLMs expert knowledge, reasoning capabilities,\nmulti-agent cooperation, and statistical causal methods. By exploring the\nmulti-agent potential of LLMs, we aim to establish a foundation for further\nresearch in utilizing LLMs multi-agent for solving causal-related problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
