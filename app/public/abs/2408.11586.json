In order to design effective defenses against\nthese attacks, we must deeply understand the Psychological Tactics, PTacs, and\nPsychological Techniques, PTechs, that are exploited by these attacks. In this\npaper we present a methodology for characterizing the evolution of PTacs and\nPTechs exploited by malicious emails. As a case study, we apply the methodology\nto a real-world dataset. This leads to a number insights, such as which PTacs\nor PTechs are more often exploited than others. These insights shed light on\ndirections for future research towards designing psychologically-principled\nsolutions to effectively counter malicious emails.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
