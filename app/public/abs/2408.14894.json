We introduce a new readout scheme, termed Time to Space (T2S)\nencoding which decouples spin manipulation from optical readout both temporally\nand spatially. This is achieved by controlling the spin state within a region\nof interest, followed by rapid scanning of the optical readout position using\nan acousto-optic modulator. Time tracking allows the optical readout position\nto be encoded as a function of time. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center\nensembles in diamond, we first demonstrate that the T2S scheme enables\ncorrelated experiments for efficient common mode noise cancellation in various\nnano- and microscale sensing scenarios. In the second example, we show highly\nscalable multi-pixel imaging that does not require a camera and has the\npotential to accelerate data acquisition by several hundred times compared to\nconventional scanning methods. We anticipate widespread adoption of this\ntechnique, as it requires no additional components beyond those commonly used\nin optically addressable spin systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oHTo36U9yCv48CbKhEiK1OkXVD2g8TNja8JyrPRAp0A","pdfSize":"859558"}
