However, traditional methods falter as\npower systems grow in scale and complexity, struggling with multitasking, swift\nproblem-solving, and human-machine collaboration. This paper introduces GAIA,\nthe pioneering Large Language Model (LLM) tailored for power dispatch tasks. We\nhave developed a novel dataset construction technique that harnesses a range of\ndata sources to fine-tune GAIA for optimal performance in this domain. This\napproach streamlines LLM training, allowing for the seamless integration of\nmultidimensional data in power system management. Additionally, we have crafted\nspecialized prompt strategies to boost GAIA's input-output efficiency in\ndispatch scenarios. When evaluated on the ElecBench benchmark, GAIA surpasses\nthe baseline model LLaMA2 on multiple metrics. In practical applications, GAIA\nhas demonstrated its ability to enhance decision-making processes, improve\noperational efficiency, and facilitate better human-machine interactions in\npower dispatch operations. This paper expands the application of LLMs to power\ndispatch and validates their practical utility, paving the way for future\ninnovations in this field.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
