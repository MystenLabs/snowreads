In particular, the quadrotor is now invaluable across a\nplethora of fields and recent developments, such as the inclusion of aerial\nmanipulators, only extends their versatility. As UAVs become more widespread,\npreventing loss-of-control (LOC) is an ever growing concern. Unfortunately, LOC\nis not clearly defined for quadrotors, or indeed, many other autonomous\nsystems. Moreover, any existing definitions are often incomplete and\nrestrictive. A novel metric, based on actuator capabilities, is introduced to\ndetect LOC in quadrotors. The potential of this metric for LOC detection is\ndemonstrated through both simulated and real quadrotor flight data. It is able\nto detect LOC induced by actuator faults without explicit knowledge of the\noccurrence and nature of the failure. The proposed metric is also sensitive\nenough to detect LOC in more nuanced cases, where the quadrotor remains\nundamaged but nevertheless losses control through an aggressive yawing\nmanoeuvre. As the metric depends only on system and actuator models, it is\nsufficiently general to be applied to other systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
