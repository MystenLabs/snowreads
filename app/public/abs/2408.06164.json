This paper presents an integrated\nsensing and communication (ISAC)-based CKM prototype system, demonstrating the\nmutualistic relationship between ISAC and CKM. The system consists of an ISAC\nbase station (BS), a user equipment (UE), and a server. By using a shared\northogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) waveform over the millimeter\nwave (mmWave) band, the ISAC BS is able to communicate with the UE while\nsimultaneously sensing the environment and acquiring the UE's location. The\nprototype showcases the complete process of the construction and application of\nthe ISAC-based CKM. For CKM construction phase, the BS stores the UE's channel\nfeedback information in a database indexed by the UE's location, including beam\nindices and channel gain. For CKM application phase, the BS looks up the best\nbeam index from the CKM based on the UE's location to achieve training-free\nmmWave beam alignment. The experimental results show that ISAC can be used to\nconstruct or update CKM while communicating with UEs, and the pre-learned CKM\ncan assist ISAC for training-free beam alignment.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
