Only a subset of previous\nexperience, collected in similar conditions, is relevant to learning an\naccurate classifier for current data. Learning from irrelevant experience\ndescribing a different concept can degrade performance. A system learning from\nstreaming data must identify which recent experience is irrelevant when\nconditions change and which past experience is relevant when concepts reoccur,\n\\textit{e.g.,} when weather events or financial patterns repeat. Existing\nstreaming approaches either do not consider experience to change in relevance\nover time and thus cannot handle concept drift, or only consider the recency of\nexperience and thus cannot handle recurring concepts, or only sparsely evaluate\nrelevance and thus fail when concept drift is missed. To enable learning in\nchanging conditions, we propose SELeCT, a probabilistic method for continuously\nevaluating the relevance of past experience. SELeCT maintains a distinct\ninternal state for each concept, representing relevant experience with a unique\nclassifier. We propose a Bayesian algorithm for estimating state relevance,\ncombining the likelihood of drawing recent observations from a given state with\na transition pattern prior based on the system's current state.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
