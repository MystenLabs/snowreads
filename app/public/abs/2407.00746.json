By using judicious choices for the sketch, such as\nthe history of residuals, we develop weighting strategies that enable short\nrecursive formulas. The proposed algorithms have a low memory footprint and\niteration complexity compared to regular sketch-and-project methods. In a set\nof numerical experiments the new methods compare well to GMRES, SYMMLQ and\nstate-of-the-art randomized solvers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
