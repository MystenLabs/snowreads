However, its experimental realization\nfor interacting many-body systems remains elusive. We show that Yang-Lee edge\nsingularities, regarded as many-body exceptional points, can be observed using\nboth the self-normal and the associated-biorthogonal Loschmidt echoes,\nleveraging the advantages of nonunitary dynamics in non-Hermitian systems. The\nLoschmidt echoes are demonstrated to display unitary dynamics in the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric regime but exhibit nonunitary dynamics in the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken regime, leading to a sharp change near an\nexceptional point. We hereby identify exceptional points in both the\nnon-Hermitian transverse field Ising model and the Yang-Lee model, and\ndetermine the critical exponent that is consistent with nonunitary conformal\nfield theory. This work provides a direct observation of Yang-Lee edge\nsingularities in non-Hermitian many-body systems arising from nonunitary\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
