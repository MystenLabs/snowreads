Numerical approximations are obtained as minima of\nregularized least squares functionals. The arising dual norms are replaced by\ndiscretized dual norms, which leads to a mixed formulation in terms of trial-\nand test-spaces. For stable pairs of such spaces, and a proper choice of the\nregularization parameter, the $L_2$-error on a subdomain in the obtained\nnumerical approximation can be bounded by the best possible fractional power of\nthe sum of the data error and the error of best approximation. Compared to the\nuse of a standard variational formulation, the latter two errors are measured\nin weaker norms. To avoid the use of $C^1$-finite element test spaces,\nnonconforming finite element test spaces can be applied as well. They either\nlead to the qualitatively same error bound, or in a simplified version, to such\nan error bound modulo an additional data oscillation term. Numerical results\nillustrate our theoretical findings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
