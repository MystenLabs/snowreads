In the problem, we are given a graph with prizes on the\nnodes and lengths on the edges, together with a budget on the overall tour\nlength. The goal is to find a tour that respects the length budget and\nmaximizes the collected prizes. In this work, we introduce the orienteering\ninterdiction game, in which a competitor (the leader) tries to minimize the\ntotal prize that the follower can collect within a feasible tour. To this end,\nthe leader interdicts some of the nodes so that the follower cannot collect\ntheir prizes. The resulting interdiction game is formulated as a bilevel\noptimization problem, and a single-level reformulation is obtained based on\ninterdiction cuts. A branch-and-cut algorithm with several enhancements,\nincluding the use of a solution pool, a cut pool and a heuristic method for the\nfollower's problem, is proposed. In addition to this exact approach, a genetic\nalgorithm is developed to obtain high-quality solutions in a short computing\ntime. In a computational study based on instances from the literature for the\norienteering problem, the usefulness of the proposed algorithmic components is\nassessed, and the branch-and-cut and genetic algorithms are compared in terms\nof solution time and quality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
