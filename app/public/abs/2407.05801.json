The\ngoal of this project is to offer a common perceptual and cognitive framework to\nall users, both sighted, deaf, and blind or visually impaired, concerning the\nexperience of observing the night sky, but also to provide all equal access to\nscientific data regarding the observed objects, going beyond what can be\nsensed. The planetarium will consist of a Plexiglas hemisphere on which stars\nup to the fourth magnitude are represented by a brass bar that, when touched,\nactivates visual, haptic, and acoustic stimuli. We mapped the magnitude of\nstars on acoustic and visual stimuli, while the distance of the star from us is\nmapped on a vibration. All the stimuli have been evaluated in pilot experiments\nusing Plexiglas tablets representing some constellations, to assess their\nusability, intelligibility, and consistency with possible intuitive\ninterpretations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
