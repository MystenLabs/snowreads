Although initially thought to be trivially connected to an order\nparameter flipping sign, a certain kind of \\textit{anomalous} DQPTs have been\ndiscovered that exhibit no direct connection to the order parameter and have\nbeen shown to arise in the presence of confinement. Here, we show in two\nparadigmatic models how the onset time of anomalous DQPTs is directly\nconnected, through a power law, to the meson mass in the confined regime of a\nglobal symmetry-broken phase. This relation becomes more prominent the closer\nthe initial parameters are to the equilibrium quantum critical point, where a\nrelativistic quantum field theory emerges. Our findings draw a direct\nconnection between mesons and anomalous DQPTs, highlighting the power of the\nlatter to classify exotic far-from-equilibrium criticality.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
