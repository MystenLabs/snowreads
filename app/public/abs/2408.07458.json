By calculating the displacement\ncorrelations and the shear strain correlations from the numerical data of\nparticle simulations, the displacement field is shown to have nontrivial\ncorrelations, even in liquids that are only slightly glassy with the area\nfraction as low as 0.5. It is suggested analytically and demonstrated\nnumerically that the displacement correlations are more informative than the\nshear correlations: the former behaves logarithmically with regard to the\nspatial distance at shorter scales, while the corresponding information is\nmissing from the shear correlations. The logarithmic behavior of the\ndisplacement correlations is interpreted as manifesting a long-lived aspect of\nthe cage effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
