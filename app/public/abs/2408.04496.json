This paper analyzes\nthe behavior of this distance when it is used to measure closeness between\nindependent sample covariance matrices. A closed form expression is given for\nthe deterministic equivalent of such distance, which asymptotically\napproximates the actual distance in the large observation regime (both sample\nsize and observation dimension grow to infinity at the same rate). The\ndeterministic equivalent can be used to analyze the performance of the\nlog-Euclidean metric when compared to other commonly used metrics such as the\nEuclidean norm or the symmetrized Kullback-Leibler divergence.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
