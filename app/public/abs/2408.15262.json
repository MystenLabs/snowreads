For compact type curves with two components, every exact limit\nlinear series is simple. But, for the case of three components, this property\nis no longer true. We study a certain distributivity property related with the\nexistence of a simple basis and we find characterizations of that property at\nany fixed multidegree. Also, we find a characterization of simple limit linear\nseries among the exact limit linear series. In our approach, we also study\nother structure similar to a simple basis and we get a certain inequality for\nany exact limit linear series.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DrABvYaM0bpYJaYZsRx4xn_2VH4LFpVfNXahwWLujFI","pdfSize":"313118"}
