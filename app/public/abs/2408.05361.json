Building communication\nsystems that enable seamless and symbiotic communication between humans and AI\nagents is increasingly important. This research advances the field of human-AI\ninteraction by developing an innovative approach to decode imagined speech\nusing non-invasive high-density functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS).\nNotably, this study introduces MindGPT, the first thought-to-LLM (large\nlanguage model) system in the world.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
