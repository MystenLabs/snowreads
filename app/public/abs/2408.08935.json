In this review, we\nwill discuss two greedy algorithms. First, we will talk about the so-called\nRelaxed Greedy Algorithm in the context of dictionaries in Hilbert spaces\nanalyzing the optimality of definition of this algorithm and, next, we give a\ngeneral overview of the Thresholding Greedy Algorithm and the Chebyshev\nThresholding Greedy Algorithm with regard to bases in p-Banach spaces with $0 <\np \\leq 1$. In both cases, we pose some questions for future research.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
