For scalar beams, the star constellations for the\nLaguerre-Gaussian beam basis reside at the poles of the sphere. For vector\nfields, these constellations represent well-defined circular polarization. The\nunderlying $su(2)$ symmetry of angular momenta enables populating the sphere\nthrough generalized unitary rotations of the basis elements, resulting in\noptical analogues of Bloch and generalized $su(2)$ coherent states for both\nscalar beams and vector fields. Constellations for scalar Hermite-Gaussian\nbeams and vector Hermite-Gaussian partial Poincar\\'e fields, restricted to\nlinear polarization, occupy the equator of the sphere as a result of these\nrotations. Additionally, we investigate scalar and vector analogues of cat\ncodes and kings of quantumness, providing insights into the visualization and\ncharacterization of complex optical beams and fields with potential\napplications in optical communications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
