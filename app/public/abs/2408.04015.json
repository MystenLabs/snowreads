Utilizing a diverse\ncollection of image-to-LaTeX data, we build two models: a base model with a\nSwin Transformer encoder and a GPT-2 decoder, trained on machine-generated\nimages, and a fine-tuned version enhanced with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\ntrained on handwritten formulas. We then compare the BLEU performance of our\nspecialized model on a handwritten test set with other similar models, such as\nPix2Text, TexTeller, and Sumen. Through this project, we contribute open-source\nmodels for converting images to LaTeX and provide from-scratch code for\nbuilding these models with distributed training and GPU optimizations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sWlQexL1IuXu2wgL06h-0zkSKScJMhQW6Mgp2LBTnZg","pdfSize":"1201621"}
