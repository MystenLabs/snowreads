We study the variance $V(L)$, under $\\nu_\\rho$, of the\nnumber of particles in an interval of $L$ sites. Under $\\nu_{1/2}$ either all\nodd or all even sites are occupied, so that $V(L)=0$ for $L$ even and\n$V(L)=1/4$ for $L$ odd: the state is hyperuniform, since $V(L)$ grows more\nslowly than $L$. We prove that for densities approaching 1/2 from below there\nexist three regimes in $L$, in which the variance grows at different rates: for\n$L\\gg\\delta^{-2}$, $V(L)\\simeq\\rho(1-\\rho)L$, just as in the initial state; for\n$A(\\delta)\\ll L\\ll\\delta^{-2}$, with $A(\\delta)=\\delta^{-2/3}$ for $L$ odd and\n$A(\\delta)=1$ for $L$ even, $V(L)\\simeq CL^{3/2}$ with $C=2\\sqrt{2/\\pi}/3$; and\nfor $L\\ll\\delta^{-2/3}$ with $L$ odd, $V(L)\\simeq1/4$. The analysis is based on\na careful study of a renewal process with a long tail. Our study is motivated\nby simulation results showing similar behavior in higher dimensions; we discuss\nthis background briefly.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
