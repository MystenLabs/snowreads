Setting q=1\nrecovers results of Dieker and Saliola, whose computation of the spectrum of\nrandom-to-random in the symmetric group resolved a nearly 20 year old\nconjecture by Uyemura-Reyes. Our methods simplify their proofs by drawing novel\nconnections to the Jucys-Murphy elements of the Hecke algebra, Young seminormal\nforms, and the Okounkov-Vershik approach to representation theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
