The\nonly exceptions are given by the $\\langle JJO\\rangle_{odd}$ and the $\\langle\nTTO \\rangle_{odd}$ which in momentum-space are protected by chiral and\nconformal anomalies. Specifically, one can obtain a non-vanishing solution by\nconsidering scalar operators such as $O=\\nabla \\cdot J_A$,\n$O=g_{\\mu\\nu}T^{\\mu\\nu}$ or their shadow transforms. We comment on the\nimplications of these results that constrain the coupling of axions and\ndilatons in a conformal phase of the early universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
