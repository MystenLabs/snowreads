In the case of pretzel\nknots, it is shown that after evaluation, the determinant of the matrix\nrecovers the Jones polynomial. Although the Jones polynomial is known to be\n#P-hard by Jaeger, Vertigan, and Welsh, this presents a class of knots for\nwhich the Jones polynomial can be computed in polynomial time by using the\ndeterminant. In this paper, we extend these results by recovering the Jones\npolynomial as the determinant of a weighted adjacency matrix for certain\nsubfamilies of the braid group. Lastly, we compute the Kauffman polynomial of\n(2,q) torus knots in polynomial time using the balanced overlaid Tait graphs.\nThis is the first known example of generalizing the methodology of Cohen to a\nclass of quantum invariants which cannot be derived from the HOMFLYPT\npolynomial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
