In this paper, we\ntighten our previous constraints on the fraction of detected GW events that may\nhave originated from Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN). We consider 159 mergers\ndetected not later than June 1st, 2024, and the all-sky quasar catalogue Quaia.\nWe increase by a factor of 5.3 and 114 the number of considered GW sources and\nAGN respectively, also extending our analysis from redshift 0.3 to 1.5. This is\npossible thanks to the uniformity of the AGN catalogue and its high level of\ncompleteness, which we estimate as a function of redshift and luminosity. We\nfind at a 95 per cent credibility level that un-obscured AGN with a bolometric\nluminosity higher than $10^{44.5}{\\rm erg\\ s}^{-1}$ ($10^{45}{\\rm erg\\\ns}^{-1}$) do not contribute to more than the 21 (11) per cent of the detected\nGW events.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"gGohtEAdY5coWGvtTXo0vNIqKZ74oe-zOOJQd0WnYco","pdfSize":"1668412"}
