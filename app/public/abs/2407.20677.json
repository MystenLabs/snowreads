Generating functions of this distribution,\nsuch as the probability-generating function, the moment-generating function,\nand the characteristic function, are known to involve the Gauss hypergeometric\nfunction. We elucidate that the existing formula of generating functions is\nincomplete and provide the corrected formula. In view of the utility and\napplicability of the hypergeometric distribution, the exact and correct\nfoundation is crucially important.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_JKFhj-QRW9__HwqRrwkWPEEnPrnI6q-CXGBWIAuGIM","pdfSize":"153439","objectId":"0x8ebe3fc320b03a6b3a4c9b7ad7a08e036fe49161ce89c7b1840996938d5e6f26","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
