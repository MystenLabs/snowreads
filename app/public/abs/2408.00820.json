Basing the underlying free energy on capillarity and wettability\ncontributions for all relevant interfaces in their full-curvature variant we\nestablish transparent consistency relations between macroscopic and mesoscopic\nparameters. In consequence, we obtain mesoscopic Neumann and Young laws that\nare also fully consistent with the macroscopic ones. In particular, we discuss\nthe minimal requirements for the wetting energy that ensure the full spectrum\nof macroscopic parameters is addressed by the mesoscopic model. Having\nestablished the dynamic model in long-wave and full-curvature variants, the\nlatter is employed to illustrate the usage of the mesoscopic model. As\nexamples, we use the spreading of individual compound drops on one-dimensional\nhorizontal substrates, sliding compound drops on one-dimensional inclined\nsubstrates, and the coarsening of drop ensembles on one- and two-dimensional\nhorizontal substrates. In each case, the discussion emphasizes occurring\nqualitative changes in the drop configurations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
