Many optimization applications in engineering have more than one\nobjective (or performance criterion). Such applications require multi-objective\n(or multi-criteria) optimization (MOO or MCO). Spurred by this and development\nof techniques for handling multiple objectives, MOO has found many applications\nin engineering in the last two decades. Optimization of an application for more\nthan one objective gives a set of optimal solutions (known as non-dominated or\nPareto-optimal solutions), which are equally good in the sense that no\nobjective can be further improved without resulting in deterioration of at\nleast one other objective. MOO in engineering has mainly focused on development\nof a model for the application, formulation of the MOO problem and solution of\nthe formulated problem to find Pareto-optimal solutions. However, for\ncompletion of MOO, one more step is required to choose one of these optimal\nsolutions for implementation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
