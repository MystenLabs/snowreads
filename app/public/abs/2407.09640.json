For each individual drawn randomly\nfrom the unknown population distribution, the corresponding parameters for the\nODE-IVP cannot be measured directly, but a vector of covariates is given, and\none component of the solution to the corresponding ODE-IVP is observed at a\nfixed finite time grid. The task is to identify a covariate-parameter\nrelationship that maps covariate vectors to parameter vectors. Such settings\nand problems arise in pharmacokinetics, where the observations are blood drug\nconcentrations, the covariates are clinically observable quantities, and the\ncovariate-parameter relationship is used for personalised drug dosing. For\nlinear homogeneous ODE-IVPs with vector fields defined by matrices that are\ndiagonalisable over $\\mathbb{R}$, and for fixed time and random covariate\ndesign, we use recent results of Nickl et al. for Bayesian nonlinear\nstatistical inverse problems, to prove posterior contraction and Bernstein--von\nMises results for the unknown covariate-parameter relationship. We analytically\ndemonstrate our results on an example from the pharmacokinetics literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zIVhRM_UISxOf3BD7ICROfRiokv5ksM7_aTxW2RnQng","pdfSize":"366353"}
