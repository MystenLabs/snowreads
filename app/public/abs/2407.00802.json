Realizing such tasks in practice puts\nstringent requirements on the characteristics of the states in terms of\nfidelity and generation rate, along with a desired compatibility with\ntelecommunication network deployment. Here, we demonstrate a photonic platform\ndesign capable of producing high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ)\nstates, at telecom wavelength and in a compact and scalable configuration. Our\nsource relies on spontaneous parametric down-conversion in a layered Sagnac\ninterferometer, which only requires a single nonlinear crystal. This enables\nthe generation of highly indistinguishable photon pairs, leading by\nentanglement fusion to four-qubit polarization-entangled GHZ states with\nfidelity up to $(94.73 \\pm 0.21)\\%$ with respect to the ideal state, at a rate\nof 1.7Hz. We provide a complete characterization of our source and highlight\nits suitability for practical quantum network applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
