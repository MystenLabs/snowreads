In\nthis paper, we introduce effective implementations of rational transformations\nof a target operator on quantum hardware. By leveraging suitable integral\nrepresentations of the operator resolvent, we show that rational\ntransformations can be performed efficiently with Hamiltonian simulations using\na linear-combination-of-unitaries (LCU). We formulate two complementary LCU\napproaches, discrete-time and continuous-time LCU, each providing unique\nstrategies to decomposing the exact integral representations of a resolvent. We\nconsider quantum rational transformation for the ubiquitous task of\napproximating functions of a Hermitian operator, with particular emphasis on\nthe elementary signum function. For illustration, we discuss its application to\nthe ground and excited state problems. Combining rational transformations with\nobservable dynamic mode decomposition (ODMD), our recently developed\nnoise-resilient quantum eigensolver, we design a fully real-time approach for\nresolving many-body spectra. Our numerical demonstration on spin systems\nindicates that our real-time framework is compact and achieves accurate\nestimation of the low-lying energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
