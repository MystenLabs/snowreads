This research work offers a novel approach\nthat extends beyond the conventional Generalized Additive Model framework by\nconsidering models like Graph Convolutional Networks or Graph SAGE. These\ngraph-based models enable the incorporation of various levels of\ninterconnectedness and information sharing among nodes, where each node\ncorresponds to the combined load (i.e. consumption) of a subset of consumers\n(e.g. the regions of a country). More specifically, we introduce a range of\nmethods for inferring graphs tailored to consumption forecasting, along with a\nframework for evaluating the developed models in terms of both performance and\nexplainability. We conduct experiments on electricity forecasting, in both a\nsynthetic and a real framework considering the French mainland regions, and the\nperformance and merits of our approach are discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
