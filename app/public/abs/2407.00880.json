Although each XS$_2$ is\ndynamically unstable, CoS$_2$, TcS$_2$, RuS$_2$, and RhS$_2$ can be stabilized\nby developing charge density waves in the (2$\\times$2) supercell, leading to\nmetal-insulator transitions. Without really needing the metal-insulator\ntransitions and large atomic distortions, additional energy may be gained in\nthe total energy by mixing transition metal elements to create high-entropy\ncombinations for X, presenting a wide range of high-entropy XS$_2$ compounds\nthat exhibit a variety of band structures, including direct- and indirect-gap\nsemiconductors, metals, and semimetals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
