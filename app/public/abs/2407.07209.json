The\nconventional control of the emitted light's circular polarization requires a\nchange in the external magnetic field, limiting the operation conditions of\nspin-LEDs. Here, we demonstrate an atomically thin spin-LED device based on a\nheterostructure of a monolayer WSe2 and a few-layer antiferromagnetic CrI3,\nseparated by a thin hBN tunneling barrier. The CrI3 and hBN layers polarize the\nspin of the injected carriers into the WSe2. With the valley optical selection\nrule in the monolayer WSe2, the electroluminescence exhibits a high degree of\ncircular polarization that follows the CrI3 magnetic states. Importantly, we\nshow an efficient electrical tuning, including a sign reversal, of the\nelectroluminescent circular polarization by applying an electrostatic field due\nto the electrical tunability of the few-layer CrI3 magnetization. Our results\nestablish a new platform to achieve on-demand operation of nanoscale spin-LED\nand electrical control of helicity for device applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
