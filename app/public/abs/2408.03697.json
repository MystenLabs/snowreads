The parameters of the Wood-Saxon optical potential\nare found to be a good fit for proton elastic scattering data involving\np-nuclei and elements with mass numbers near p-nuclei (within the range of 74 <\nA < 148) at energies around the Coulomb barrier of the system. The elastic\nscattering data were meticulously fitted using the SFRESCO code, allowing for\nthe calculation of the real and imaginary parts of the Wood Saxon optical\npotential. To validate the model, experimental proton capture cross-sections\nfor 106Cd and 113In near the Coulomb barrier were compared with results\nobtained using the TALYS-1.96 code, showing better agreement than the available\nglobal proton optical model potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"isH8SsbGenHO3WvqJJ6IIQYB_WDN1vBUqV4K9GcYQCI","pdfSize":"332069"}
