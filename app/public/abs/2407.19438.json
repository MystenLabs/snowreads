The new approach is illustrated, along with the\nmain components, delineating the key benefits and use cases for deploying\nstandard multi-modal AI agency (or agentic AI) communications. Beginning with\nUniversal APIs based on Natural Language, the framework establishes and enables\ninteroperable interactions among diverse Conversational AI agents, including\nchatbots, voicebots, videobots, and human agents. Furthermore, a new Discovery\nspecification framework is introduced, designed to efficiently look up agents\nproviding specific services and to obtain accurate information about these\nservices through a standard Manifest publication, accessible via an extended\nset of Natural Language-based APIs. The main purpose of this contribution is to\nsignificantly enhance the capabilities and scalability of AI interactions\nacross various platforms. The novel architecture for interoperable\nConversational AI assistants is designed to generalize, being replicable and\naccessible via open repositories.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XvP-ut9HdzE0v63sExRVPTMeSTZXkVmgd3PMFkXbCwQ","pdfSize":"6974151"}
