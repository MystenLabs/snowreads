Via a suitable rescaling, the concentration gives rise to a\nlimiting profile that solves a nonautonomous elliptic semilinear equation with\na sharp sign change in the nonlinearity. We characterize the (radial or\nfoliated Schwarz) symmetries and the (polynomial) decay of the least-energy\npositive and nodal limiting profiles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
