Traditional methods for solving these equations\noften face stability issues when dealing with small perturbation parameters. We\npropose an exact finite difference method to solve these equations and provide\na detailed stability and $\\varepsilon$-uniform convergence analysis. Our\napproach is validated with an example, demonstrating its uniform convergence\nand applicability, with a convergence order of 1. The results illustrate the\nmethod's robustness in handling perturbation effects efficiently.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
