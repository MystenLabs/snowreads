Furthermore, we present a knowledge\nservice system Spark Research Assistant (SparkRA) based on our SciLit-LLM.\nSparkRA is accessible online and provides three primary functions: literature\ninvestigation, paper reading, and academic writing. As of July 30, 2024,\nSparkRA has garnered over 50,000 registered users, with a total usage count\nexceeding 1.3 million.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
