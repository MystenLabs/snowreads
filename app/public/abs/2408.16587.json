By harnessing quantum effects, high-precision sensors can\nachieve sensitivity and accuracy far beyond their classical counterparts when\nusing the same number of sensing resources. Therefore, developing gravimeters\nwith quantum-enhanced sensitivity is essential for advancing theoretical and\napplied physics. While novel quantum gravimeters have already been proposed for\nthis purpose, the ultimate sensing precision, known as the Heisenberg limit,\nremains largely elusive. Here, we demonstrate that the gravimetry precision in\na conditional displacement spin-mechanical system increases quadratically with\nthe number of spins: a Heisenberg-limited spin-mechanical gravimeter. In\ngeneral, the gravitational parameter is dynamically encoded into the entire\nentangled spin-mechanical probe. However, at some specific times, the\nmechanical degree of freedom disentangles from the spin subsystem, transferring\nall the information about the gravitational acceleration to the spin subsystem.\nHence, we prove that a feasible spin magnetization measurement can reveal the\nultimate gravimetry precision at such disentangling times. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that the proposed system is robust against spin-mechanical coupling\nanisotropies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
