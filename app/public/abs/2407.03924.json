However,\nthe computation time of many multi-physical simulation models is far from\nreal-time. It might even exceed sensible time frames to produce sufficient data\nfor training data-driven reduced-order models. This study presents TwinLab, a\nframework for data-efficient, yet accurate training of neural-ODE type\nreduced-order models with only two data sets. Design/methodology/approach:\nCorrelations between test errors of reduced-order models and distinct features\nof corresponding training data are investigated. Having found the single best\ndata sets for training, a second data set is sought with the help of similarity\nand error measures to enrich the training process effectively. Findings: Adding\na suitable second training data set in the training process reduces the test\nerror by up to 49% compared to the best base reduced-order model trained only\nwith one data set. Such a second training data set should at least yield a good\nreduced-order model on its own and exhibit higher levels of dissimilarity to\nthe base training data set regarding the respective excitation signal.\nMoreover, the base reduced-order model should have elevated test errors on the\nsecond data set. The relative error of the time series ranges from 0.18% to\n0.49%. Prediction speed-ups of up to a factor of 36,000 are observed.\nOriginality: The proposed computational framework facilitates the automated,\ndata-efficient extraction of non-intrusive reduced-order models for digital\ntwins from existing simulation models, independent of the simulation software.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
