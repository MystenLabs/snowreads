We conduct a realistic modeling of indoor obstacles and analyze their\nimpact on performance. Order statistics are applied to calculate the cumulative\ndistribution functions (CDFs) of distances from the transmitter to the selected\nRIS, i.e., the nearest RIS in the bounded indoor environment to the\ntransmitter, and from the selected RIS to the receiver. We calculate the\ncoverage probability (CP) as a function of RIS number, obstacle density, room\nsize, and the transmitter's location. By comparing the numerical results\nobtained from the analytical expressions with Monte Carlo simulations, we\nverify the accuracy of our analysis. Through numerical results, it is observed\nthat room size and obstacle density affect the CP in a significant way.\nHowever, by optimizing the transmitter's location and increasing the RIS number\ndeployed in the room, the CP can be significantly improved (e.g., an increase\nof around 15% by optimizing the transmitter's location, and an increase of\naround 30% by increasing the RIS number deployed in the room).\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mgOiopp38AiwUE0yC6eEcr3E-H7l8EDe8Dpqp52xWbU","pdfSize":"5260582","objectId":"0x6af9e8dbcdcfead323f497bc370e6edf305eff0d9953886534466bec6cc0479f","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
