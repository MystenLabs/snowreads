Faenzi\n(\\cite{F}) and later Pons-Llopis and Tonini (\\cite{PLT}) have completely\ncharacterized ACM line bundles over $X$. As a natural continuation of their\nstudy in the non-ACM direction, in this paper, we completely classify\n$\\ell$-away ACM line bundles (introduced recently by Gawron and Genc\n(\\cite{GG})) over $X$, when $\\ell \\leq 2$. For $\\ell\\geq 3$, we give examples\nof $\\ell$-away ACM line bundles on $X$ and for each $\\ell \\geq 1$, we establish\nthe existence of smooth hypersurfaces $X^{(d)}$ of degree $d >\\ell$ in $\\mathbb\nP^3$ admitting $\\ell$-away ACM line bundles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
