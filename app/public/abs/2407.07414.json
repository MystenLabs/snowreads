For the first time, formation and growth of dust in the\nenvelope is calculated explicitly. We find that the first dust grains appear as\nearly as $\\sim$1-3 yrs after the onset of the CE, and are smaller than grains\nformed later. As the simulations progress, a high-opacity dusty shell forms,\nresulting in the CE photosphere being up to an order of magnitude larger than\nit would be without the inclusion of dust. At the end of the simulations, the\ntotal dust yield is $0.0082~M_{\\odot}$ ($0.022~M_{\\odot}$) for a CE with a\n$1.7~M_{\\odot}$ ($3.7~M_{\\odot}$) AGB star. Dust formation does not\nsubstantially lead to more mass unbinding or substantially alter the orbital\nevolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"owViheCekE6bEXiIfkqs-wS8iJbzJqPim5HkWB8NuDw","pdfSize":"1006364"}
