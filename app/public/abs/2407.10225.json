In the case when dark matter\nparticles are able to annihilate, the density in the central regions of the\nspikes decreases due to the elimination of particles, which gives an upper\nbound on the central density. In this paper, the modification of the central\ndensity profile is investigated, taking into account the distribution of the\nparticle orbits. The orbits in spike around a primordial black hole are very\nelongated, almost radial, and the angular momentum distribution has an\nexponential form. For such an initial distribution function, it is obtained\nthat a cusp with the exponent $\\approx-0.7$ is formed in the central region,\ninstead of an annihilation plateau. The presence of the cusp provides some\ncorrection to the rate of dark matter annihilation around primordial black\nholes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
