However, evolutionary divergence between humans and\nresearch organisms hinders effective knowledge transfer across species. Here,\nwe review state-of-the-art methods for computationally transferring knowledge\nacross species, primarily focusing on methods that utilize transcriptome data\nand/or molecular networks. We introduce the term \"agnology\" to describe the\nfunctional equivalence of molecular components regardless of evolutionary\norigin, as this concept is becoming pervasive in integrative data-driven models\nwhere the role of evolutionary origin can become unclear. Our review addresses\nfour key areas of information and knowledge transfer across species: (1)\ntransferring disease and gene annotation knowledge, (2) identifying agnologous\nmolecular components, (3) inferring equivalent perturbed genes or gene sets,\nand (4) identifying agnologous cell types. We conclude with an outlook on\nfuture directions and several key challenges that remain in cross-species\nknowledge transfer.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sdt4axNoC3hfIogP0Y7pgZ1mOo61hwGzolQmSchWKa8","pdfSize":"1945160"}
