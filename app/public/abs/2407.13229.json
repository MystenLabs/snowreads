Especially, the intricate coupling\nbetween internal uncertainty and external disturbance is usually difficult to\nbe modeled explicitly. Here we show an effective and convergent algorithm\nenabling accurate estimation of the coupled disturbance via combining control\nand learning philosophies. Specifically, by resorting to Chebyshev series\nexpansion, the coupled disturbance is firstly decomposed into an unknown\nparameter matrix and two known structures depending on system state and\nexternal disturbance respectively. A Regularized Least Squares (RLS) algorithm\nis subsequently formalized to learn the parameter matrix by using historical\ntime-series data. Finally, a higher-order disturbance observer (HODO) is\ndeveloped to achieve a high-precision estimation of the coupled disturbance by\nutilizing the learned portion. The efficiency of the proposed algorithm is\nevaluated through extensive simulations. We believe this work can offer a new\noption to merge learning schemes into the control framework for addressing\nexisting intractable control problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
