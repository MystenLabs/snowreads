Previously, the best known bound on the minimal automaton\nsize for such a sequence was doubly exponential in $\\alpha$. We improve this\nbound to the order of $p^{\\alpha^3 h d}$, where $h$ and $d$ are the height and\ndegree of the minimal annihilating polynomial. We achieve this bound by showing\nthat all states in the automaton are naturally represented in a new numeration\nsystem. This significantly restricts the set of possible states. Since our\napproach embeds algebraic sequences as diagonals of rational functions, we also\nobtain bounds more generally for diagonals of multivariate rational functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
