As we use flexible two-layer random\ngraphs as the underlying network, we can also study how much the structure of\nthe graphs in the training set and the test set can differ while to get a\nreasonably good estimate. In addition, we also examine whether additional\ninformation (such as the average degree of infected vertices) can help\nimproving the results, compared to the case when we only know the time series\nconsisting of the number of susceptible and infected individuals. Our\nsimulation results also show which methods are most accurate in the different\nphases of the epidemic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zdGu6koMSzdo0c3OPYfZJWjLtAgS53za44z98Y6Qkvw","pdfSize":"417892"}
