We show\nthat when $X$ is of uniformly locally $p$-controlled geometry, these two spaces\ndo not coincide under a wide variety of geometric and potential theoretic\nconditions. We also show that when the metric measure space is the standard\nhyperbolic space $\\mathbb{H}^n$ with $n\\ge 2$, these two spaces coincide\nprecisely when $1\\le p\\le n-1$. We also provide additional characterizations of\nwhen a function in $D^{1,p}(X)$ is in $N^{1,p}(X)+\\mathbb{R}$ in the case that\nthe two spaces do not coincide.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
