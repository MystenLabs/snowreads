We present consistent\nestimators for the model parameters and perform numerical simulations to\nillustrate the properties of the estimators on finite samples. We also develop\nanalytical solutions for basic and effective reproductive numbers for the early\nstage of discrete-time SIR spreading process. We apply three distinct temporal\nconfiguration models to empirical student proximity networks and compare their\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
