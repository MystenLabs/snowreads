For the single graded case, forty years ago, Bayer and\nStillman unravelled all aspects of this relation, which in turn the use to\ncomplexity estimates for the computation with Gr\\\"obner bases. We build on\ntheir work to introduce a bounding region of the multidegrees of minimal\ngenerators of multigraded Gr\\\"obner bases for $I$. We also use this region to\ncertify the presence of some minimal generators close to its boundary. Finally,\nwe show that, up to a certain shift, this region is related to the multigraded\nCastelnuovo-Mumford regularity of $I$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
