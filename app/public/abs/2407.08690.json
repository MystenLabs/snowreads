Using a\nsymbolic representation a similar result follows for maps $T_j$ in a small\n$C^1$ neighborhood of an Axiom A map and H\\\"older continuous functions $f_j$.\nAll of our results are already new when all maps are the same $T_j=T$ but\nobservables $(f_j)$ are different. The current paper compliments [43] where\nBerry--Esseen theorems are obtained. An important step in the proof is\ndeveloping an appropriate reduction theory in the sequential case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
