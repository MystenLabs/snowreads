When specializing to the minimal case, we discover a pattern\nresulting in the coefficients of the involved expansions being alternating\nmultiple zeta values (MZVs), which generalizes the notion of Riemann's zeta\nvalues to multiple integer variables. This allows us to extend a new existence\nproof of the Lawson surfaces $\\xi_{1,g}$ to all $g\\geq 3$ using complex\nanalytic methods and to give closed form expressions of their area expansion up\nto order $7$. For example, the third order coefficient is\n$\\tfrac{9}{4}\\zeta(3)$ (the first and second order term were shown to be\n$\\log(2)$ and $0$ respectively in \\cite{HHT}). As a corollary, we obtain that\nthe area of $\\xi_{1,g}$ is monotonically increasing in their genus $g$ for all\n$g\\geq 0.$\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
