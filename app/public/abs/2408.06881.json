It is based on the formulation of the array design problem as a\nmulti-objective one where, for each scan angle, both the radiated power density\nin the scan direction and the total reflected power are accounted for. A set of\nnumerical results from full-wave simulated examples - dealing with different\nradiators, arrangements, frequencies, and number of elements - is reported to\nshow the features of the proposed approach as well as to assess its\npotentialities.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
