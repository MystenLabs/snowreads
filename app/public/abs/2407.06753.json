Knowing vulnerabilities that\nare related to these reports helps cybersecurity researchers and practitioners\nunderstand and adjust to evolving attacks and develop mitigation plans. This\npaper aims to aid cybersecurity researchers and practitioners in choosing\nattack extraction methods to enhance the monitoring and sharing of threat\nintelligence. In this work, we examine five feature extraction methods (TF-IDF,\nLSI, BERT, MiniLM, RoBERTa) and find that Term Frequency-Inverse Document\nFrequency (TF-IDF) outperforms the other four methods with a precision of 75\\%\nand an F1 score of 64\\%. The findings offer valuable insights to the\ncybersecurity community, and our research can aid cybersecurity researchers in\nevaluating and comparing the effectiveness of upcoming extraction methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
