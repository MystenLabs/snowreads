By fitting relightable Gaussians to multi-view OLAT data, our method\nenables real-time, free-viewpoint relighting. By estimating the radiance\ntransfer based on high-order spherical harmonics, we achieve a balance between\ncapturing detailed relighting effects and maintaining computational efficiency.\nWe utilize a two-stage process: in the first stage, we reconstruct a coarse\ngeometry of the object from multi-view images. In the second stage, we\ninitialize 3D Gaussians with the obtained point cloud, then simultaneously\nrefine the coarse geometry and learn the light transport for each Gaussian.\nExtensive experiments on synthetic datasets show that our approach can achieve\nfast and high-quality relighting for general objects.
