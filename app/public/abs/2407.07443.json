However,\nexisting methods face challenges in generating proteins with diverse lengths\nand shapes while maintaining key structural features. To address these\nchallenges, we introduce CPDiffusion-SS, a latent graph diffusion model that\ngenerates protein sequences based on coarse-grained secondary structural\ninformation. CPDiffusion-SS offers greater flexibility in producing a variety\nof novel amino acid sequences while preserving overall structural constraints,\nthus enhancing the reliability and diversity of generated proteins.\nExperimental analyses demonstrate the significant superiority of the proposed\nmethod in producing diverse and novel sequences, with CPDiffusion-SS surpassing\npopular baseline methods on open benchmarks across various quantitative\nmeasurements. Furthermore, we provide a series of case studies to highlight the\nbiological significance of the generation performance by the proposed method.\nThe source code is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/riacd/CPDiffusion-SS\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
