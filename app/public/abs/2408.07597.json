By applying the no-ghost theorem from\nstring theory we express the corresponding Lie brackets in terms of vertex\nalgebra operations. In the special case of the Moonshine module this result\nanswers a question of Borcherds, posed in his paper on the Monstrous moonshine\nconjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
