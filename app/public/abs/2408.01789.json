We use\nAdaptic with haptic retargeting to redirect the user's hand to provide haptic\nfeedback for several virtual objects in arm's reach using only a single prop.\nTo evaluate the effectiveness of Adaptic with haptic retargeting, we conducted\na within-subjects experiment employing a docking task to compare Adaptic to\nnon-matching proxy objects (i.e., Styrofoam balls) and matching shape props. In\nour study, Adaptic sat on a desk in front of the user and changed shapes\nbetween grasps, to provide matching tactile feedback for various virtual\nobjects placed in different virtual locations. Results indicate that the\nillusion was convincing: users felt they were manipulating several virtual\nobjects in different virtual locations with a single Adaptic device. Docking\nperformance (completion time and accuracy) with Adaptic was comparable to props\nwithout haptic retargeting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
