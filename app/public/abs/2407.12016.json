A typical task-oriented conversational system can be\nbroken down into three phases: external API selection, argument filling, and\nresponse generation. The focus of our work is the task of argument filling,\nwhich is in charge of accurately providing arguments required by the selected\nAPI. Upon comprehending the dialogue history and the pre-defined API schema,\nthe argument filling task is expected to provide the external API with the\nnecessary information to generate a desirable agent action. In this paper, we\nstudy the application of Large Language Models (LLMs) for the problem of API\nargument filling task. Our initial investigation reveals that LLMs require an\nadditional grounding process to successfully perform argument filling,\ninspiring us to design training and prompting frameworks to ground their\nresponses. Our experimental results demonstrate that when paired with proposed\ntechniques, the argument filling performance of LLMs noticeably improves,\npaving a new way toward building an automated argument filling framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
