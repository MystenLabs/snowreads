At the end of the paper, we discuss the\npotential philosophical repercussions of two possible future research routes\nthat the main stream of our applications of ADG to QG may bifurcate towards in\nview of three independent, but overlapping, research papers that are currently\nunder development.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
