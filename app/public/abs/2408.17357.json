In particular, we can engineer self-locking mechanisms at the\nmolecular level through careful shape selection or chemical functionalisation.\nThe present work focuses on the use of collapsed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) as\nself-locking elements. We start by inserting a thin CNT into each of the two\nlobes of a collapsed larger CNT. We aim to create a system that utilises the\nunique properties of CNTs to achieve stable configurations and enhanced energy\nabsorption capabilities at the nanoscale. We have used molecular dynamics\nsimulations to investigate the mechanical properties of periodic systems\nrealised with such units. This approach extends the application of self-locking\nmechanisms and opens up new possibilities for the development of advanced\nmaterials and devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cFiev2SkNcQJOfg9G_X8jOTxbC4ubNVW4FmDkbW2UTc","pdfSize":"3371582"}
