Misuse or\nmisissuance of these certificates threaten the Web PKI security model, which\nled to the development of several guarding techniques. In this paper, we study\nthe DNS/DNSSEC records CAA and TLSA as well as CT logs from the perspective of\nthe certificates in use. Our measurements comprise 4 million popular domains,\nfor which we explore the existence and consistency of the different extensions.\nOur findings indicate that CAA is almost exclusively deployed in the absence of\nDNSSEC, while DNSSEC protected service names tend to not use the DNS for\nguarding certificates. Even though mainly deployed in a formally correct way,\nCAA CA-strings tend to not selectively separate CAs, and numerous domains hold\ncertificates beyond the CAA semantic. TLSA records are repeatedly poorly\nmaintained and occasionally occur without DNSSEC.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
