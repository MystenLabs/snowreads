Our model\ntracks individuals evolving within a continuous-time framework indexed by a\nbinary tree, characterised by age and a multidimensional trait. Branching\nevents occur with rates dependent on age, where offspring inherit traits from\ntheir parent with random increase or decrease in some coordinates, while the\nmost of them are left unchanged. Exponential ergodicity is obtained at the cost\nof an exponential normalisation, despite the fact that we have an unbounded\nage-dependent birth rate that may depend on the multidimensional trait, and a\nnon-compact transition kernel. These two difficulties are respectively treated\nby stochastically comparing our model to Bellman-Harris processes, and by using\na weak form of a Harnack inequality. We conclude this study by giving examples\nwhere the assumptions of our main result are verified.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
