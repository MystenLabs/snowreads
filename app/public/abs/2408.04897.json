In this paper we provide new evidences\nfor the validity of a conjecture proposed by Sylwia Cichacz and Tomasz Hinc on\nthe existence of an $\\mathrm{MRS}_\\Gamma(a,b;c)$. We also generalize this\nproblem, describing constructions of $\\Gamma$-magic rectangle sets, whose\nelements are partially filled arrays.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"78YG2O1KGD2ND889VMftOyI8FMgXfNsN0r5zuRN2IcU","pdfSize":"274785"}
