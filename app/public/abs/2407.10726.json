The readout method\nhere presented significantly reduces the dependence between the detector area\nand the number of electronic channels, without substantial reduction of its\nperformance: a 30 cm x 30 cm double stack multi-gap timing RPC was operated\nduring weeks with cosmic rays, achieving a 2D spatial resolution well below 1\nmm and time resolution lower than 100 ps, while its efficiency was kept above\n98%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
