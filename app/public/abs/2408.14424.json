The model includes the\nproduction of $\\Delta(1940)$ and $\\Delta(1920)$ in the intermediate state\nexcited by the $\\rho$ and $p$ exchanges between the initial proton and $\\pi$\nmeson. Due to the large contribution of $\\rho$ exchange in $\\Delta(1940)$\nproduction, $\\Delta(1940)$ is found a significant contribution near the\nthreshold in this reaction. We provide total and differential cross section\npredictions for the reation and discuss the possible influence of model\nparameters, off-shell effects and branching ratios for $\\Delta(1940)\\to pa_0$\nand $\\Delta(1920)\\to pa_0$ decays, which will be useful in future experimental\nstudies. This reaction can provide a platform for studying the features of\n$\\Delta(1940)$ resonance, especially the coupling to $pa_0$ channel.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
