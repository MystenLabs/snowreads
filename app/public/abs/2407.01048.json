We prove that the Hankel system admits\nself-absorption property provided that the monoid $\\mathcal{M}$ has the local\nalgebraic structure: \\[ \\big(ax = by, cx=dy, az=bw \\,\\, \\text{in\n$\\mathcal{M}$}\\big)\\Longrightarrow \\big(cz=dw \\,\\, \\text{in\n$\\mathcal{M}$}\\big). \\] Our result holds for all group-embeddable monoids and\ngoes beyond. In particular, it works for all cancellative Abelian monoids and\nmost common non-Abelian cancellative monoids such as $$\n\\mathrm{SL}_d(\\mathbb{N}): = \\big\\{[a_{ij}]_{1\\le i,j\\le d}\\in\n\\mathrm{SL}_d(\\mathbb{Z})\\big| a_{ij} \\in \\mathbb{N}\\big\\}. $$ The Hankel\nsystem determined by the multiplication table of a monoid is further\ngeneralized to that determined by level sets of any abstract two-variable map.\nWe introduce an algebraic notion of lunar maps and establish a stronger\nhereditary self-absorption property for the corresponding generalized Hankel\nsystems. As a consequence, we prove the self-absorption property for arbitrary\nspatial compression of the regular representation system\n$\\{\\lambda_G(g)\\}_{g\\in G}$ of any discrete group $G$, as well as the Hankel\nsystem $\\{\\Gamma_\\ell^\\Phi\\}$ determined by the level sets of any rational map\nof the form $\\Phi(x,y)=a x^m + b y^n$ with $a,b,m,n\\in \\mathbb{Z}^*$: \\[\n\\Gamma_\\ell^{\\Phi}(x, y)= \\mathbf{1}(a x^m + b y^n= \\ell), \\quad x, y\\in\n\\mathbb{N}^*, \\, \\ell\\in \\Phi (\\mathbb{N}^*\\times \\mathbb{N}^*). \\] The\nself-absorption property is applied to the study of completely bounded Fourier\nmultipliers between Hardy spaces. Further applications are: i) exact complete\nbounded norm of the Carleman embedding in any dimension; ii) mixed\nFourier-Schur multiplier inequalities with critical exponent $4/3$; iii)\nfailure of hyper-complete-contractivity for the Poisson semigroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
