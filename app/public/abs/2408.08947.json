Dark matter (DM) in the vicinity of\nsupermassive black holes may scatter off CRs, resulting in the rapid cooling of\nCRs for sufficiently large cross sections. This in turn can alter the\nhigh-energy neutrino and gamma-ray fluxes detected from these sources. We show\nthat AGN cooling bounds obtained through the multimessenger data of NGC 1068\nand TXS 0506+056 allow to reach unprecedently large mass splittings for\ninelastic DM ($\\gtrsim$ TeV), orders of magnitude larger than those probed by\ndirect detection experiments and DM capture in neutron stars. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that cooling bounds from AGNs can probe thermal light DM with small\nmass splittings. This provides novel and complementary constraints in parts of\na parameter space accessible solely by colliders and beam dump experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
