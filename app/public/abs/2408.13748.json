It has been successful for cloud applications and is now\nincreasingly used for edge applications. This new architecture brings many\nbenefits but it makes deciding where a given service request should be executed\n(i.e. its placement) more complex as every small block needed for the request\nhas to be placed.\n  In this paper, we investigate decentralized request placement (DRP) for\nservices using the microservice architecture. We consider the DRP problem as an\ninstance of a traveling purchaser problem and propose an integer linear\nprogramming formulation. This formulation aims at minimizing energy consumption\nwhile respecting latency requirements. We consider two different energy\nconsumption metrics, namely overall or marginal energy, to study how optimizing\ntowards these impacts the request placement decision.\n  Our simulations show that the request placement decision can indeed be\ninfluenced by the energy metric chosen, leading to different energy reduction\nstrategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
