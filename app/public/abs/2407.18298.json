Within the\nregime of validity of the Born-Oppenheimer approximation, we systematically\nstudy and explicitly construct tetraquark states. At leading order in the $1/N$\nexpansion, the bound spectrum consists of free mesons, while the $1/N$\ncorrections give rise to a Born-Oppenheimer potential that can bind the mesons\ninto tetraquarks. We find two different types of tetraquarks, each endowed with\ndistinct color-spatial wavefunctions. These states arise in the presence of an\n$\\mathcal{O}(N)$ mass hierarchy between the quarks and the antiquarks. We\nprovide a quantitative argument indicating that only for such a hierarchy is\nthe ground state of the system a tetraquark. We discuss what the extrapolation\nof our results to realistic values of the parameters may imply for the QCD\ntetraquark states.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
