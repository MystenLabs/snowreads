The scalar spectrum\nof the model, which imposes a custodial SU(2) on the potential, gets classified\ninto a 5-plet, a 3-plet and two singlets under the custodial symmetry. While\nmost attempts to probe or constrain the scenario at the LHC depend largely on\nsignals of charged scalars, we point out that the custodial SU(2) singlet state\nH can have a substantial branching ratio (amounting to a few percent) into two\nphotons. We carry out a detailed simulation of the resulting signal and the\nstandard model backgrounds, obtaining the signal significance in different\nregions of the parameter space using the profile likelihood ratio method.\nSubstantial regions of the GM parameter space is thus shown to be accessible to\nLHC studies, both at the high-luminosity run with $\\int {\\cal L} dt = 3000\nfb^{-1}$, and also in Run-3 with $\\int {\\cal L} dt = 300 fb^{-1}$, even after\nfolding in systematic errors. We have also demonstrated that a rather\nsubtantial improvement in the signal significance is achieved by switching over\nfrom a cut-based analysis to one based on neural network.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
