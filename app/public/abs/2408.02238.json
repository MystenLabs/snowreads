This extension\nintroduces four additional un-Higgsed scalar doublets that do not develop\nvacuum expectation values, two scalar singlets, and a pair of vector-like\nfermionic singlets. Within this framework, the masses of third-generation\ncharged fermions are generated through the conventional SM Yukawa interactions,\nwhile the masses of second-generation charged fermions are suppressed via a\nmechanism reminiscent of Froggatt-Nielsen. In contrast, the masses of\nfirst-generation charged fermions are predominantly determined by radiative\ncorrections.\n  Unlike traditional implementations of the Froggatt-Nielsen mechanism, our\nmodel does not require additional colored vector or chiral fermions beyond the\nSM. This model provides an economical ultraviolet-complete mechanism to explain\nthe observed patterns in charged fermion masses and Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nmatrix elements. Notably, the electron electric dipole moment vanishes\nautomatically at the two-loop level, and there is no charged lepton flavor\nviolation to all orders. We also discuss potential experimental signatures that\ncould distinguish this model from other $ Z' $ models, such as specific\npatterns in gauge boson decays and associated collider signatures.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
