Traditionally, range maps were manually created\nby experts. However, species distribution models (SDMs) and, more recently,\ndeep learning-based variants offer a potential automated alternative. Deep\nlearning-based SDMs generate a continuous probability representing the\npredicted presence of a species at a given location, which must be binarized by\nsetting per-species thresholds to obtain binary range maps. However, selecting\nappropriate per-species thresholds to binarize these predictions is non-trivial\nas different species can require distinct thresholds. In this work, we evaluate\ndifferent approaches for automatically identifying the best thresholds for\nbinarizing range maps using presence-only data. This includes approaches that\nrequire the generation of additional pseudo-absence data, along with ones that\nonly require presence data. We also propose an extension of an existing\npresence-only technique that is more robust to outliers. We perform a detailed\nevaluation of different thresholding techniques on the tasks of binary range\nestimation and large-scale fine-grained visual classification, and we\ndemonstrate improved performance over existing pseudo-absence free approaches\nusing our method.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
