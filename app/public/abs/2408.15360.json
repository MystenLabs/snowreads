This extends previous work of the authors\nin which they considered the case of prime power moduli $q$. Above, $\\alpha_2$\nis arbitrary but fixed and $\\alpha_3$ is variable, and we assume that\n$(\\alpha_2\\alpha_3,q)=1$. We show that for all $\\alpha_3$ modulo $q$ which are\ncoprime to $q$ except for a small number of $\\alpha_3$'s, an asymptotic formula\nfor the number of solutions $(x_1,x_2,x_3)$ to the congruence\n$x_1^2+\\alpha_2x_2^2+\\alpha_3x_3^2\\equiv 0 \\bmod{q}$ with\n$\\max\\{|x_1|,|x_2|,|x_3|\\}\\le N$ and $(x_3,q)=1$ holds if $N\\ge\nq^{11/24+\\varepsilon}$ and $q$ is large enough. It is of significance that we\nbreak the barrier 1/2 in the above exponent. Key tools in our work are\nBurgess's estimate for character sums over short intervals and Heath-Brown's\nestimate for character sums with binary quadratic forms over small regions\nwhose proofs depend on the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields. We\nalso formulate a refined conjecture about the size of the smallest solution of\na ternary quadratic congruence, using information about the Diophantine\nproperties of its coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
