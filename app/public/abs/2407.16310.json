It is equivalent to a Generalized Quadratic Residue (GQR) code in the\nsense of van Lint and MacWilliams (1978). These codes are the abelian\ngeneralizations of the quadratic residue (QR) codes which are cyclic. The union\nof the [50,25,8] extension of the said code and its dual supports a\n3-(50,14,1248) design. The automorphism group of the latter design is a double\ncover of the permutation part of the automorphism group of the [50,25,8] code,\nwhich is isomorphic to $P{\\Sigma}L(2,49).$ Other weights in this code, other\nGQR codes, and other QR codes yield other 3-designs by the same process. A\nsimple group action argument is provided to explain this behaviour of isodual\ncodes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
