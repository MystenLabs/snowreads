These relationships are often dynamic in nature and can change\nwith multiple external factors (e.g., time and groups). Methods for estimating\ngraphical models are often restricted to static graphs or graphs that can\nchange with a single covariate (e.g., time). We propose a novel class of\ngraphical models, the covariate-varying network (CVN), that can change with\nmultiple external covariates.\n  In order to introduce sparsity, we apply a $L_1$-penalty to the precision\nmatrices of $m \\geq 2$ graphs we want to estimate. These graphs often show a\nlevel of similarity. In order to model this 'smoothness', we introduce the\nconcept of a 'meta-graph' where each node in the meta-graph corresponds to an\nindividual graph in the CVN. The (weighted) adjacency matrix of the meta-graph\nrepresents the strength with which similarity is enforced between the $m$\ngraphs.\n  The resulting optimization problem is solved by employing an alternating\ndirection method of multipliers. We test our method using a simulation study\nand we show its applicability by applying it to a real-world data set, the gene\nexpression networks from the study 'German Cancer in childhood and\nmolecular-epidemiology' (KiKme).
