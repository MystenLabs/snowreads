The coupled model is discretized using a\npositivity-preserving second-order path-conservative finite volume scheme. The\ndata assimilation problem is posed in a global optimization framework and we\ndevelop and compare parallel metaheuristic stochastic global optimization\nalgorithms, more precisely multi-path versions of the Simulated Annealing\nalgorithm, with hybrid global optimization algorithms based on hybridizing\nSimulated Annealing with gradient local searchers, like L-BGFS-B.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
