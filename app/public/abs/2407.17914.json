Despite these successes, most studies to date concern unimodal\nDNNs, encoding either visual or textual input but not both. Yet, there is\ngrowing evidence that human meaning representations integrate linguistic and\nsensory-motor information. Here we investigate whether the integration of\nmultimodal information operated by current vision-and-language DNN models\n(VLMs) leads to representations that are more aligned with human brain activity\nthan those obtained by language-only and vision-only DNNs. We focus on fMRI\nresponses recorded while participants read concept words in the context of\neither a full sentence or an accompanying picture. Our results reveal that VLM\nrepresentations correlate more strongly than language- and vision-only DNNs\nwith activations in brain areas functionally related to language processing. A\ncomparison between different types of visuo-linguistic architectures shows that\nrecent generative VLMs tend to be less brain-aligned than previous\narchitectures with lower performance on downstream applications. Moreover,\nthrough an additional analysis comparing brain vs. behavioural alignment across\nmultiple VLMs, we show that -- with one remarkable exception -- representations\nthat strongly align with behavioural judgments do not correlate highly with\nbrain responses. This indicates that brain similarity does not go hand in hand\nwith behavioural similarity, and vice versa.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
