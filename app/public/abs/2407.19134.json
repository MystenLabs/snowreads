It had uncertain redshift ($z$)\nand using spectroscopical measurement, Paiano et al. (2017) found it to be\n$z=0.604$. Using four different extragalactic background light (EBL) models and\nthe photohadronic model, nine independently observed VHE gamma-ray spectra of\nPKS 1424+240 are analyzed and a global $\\chi^2$ fit is performed on all\nobservations to estimate the best-fit value for the redshift for each EBL\nmodel. Confidence levels (CL) intervals for the redshift are also estimated\nusing all the EBL models. This method is tested by comparing our analysis with\nthe observed value. It is shown that the photohadronic scenario provides an\nexcellent description of all the observed spectra. It is found that the EBL\nmodel of Dom\\'inguez et al. (2011) is the one that provides the most\nrestrictive limits on the redshift of PKS 1424+240, but in our analysis,\n$z=0.604$ lies within the $3\\sigma$ CL interval of the EBL model of\nSaldana-Lopez et al. (2021).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ium6nGoW9xNXGSx3R3EUCJerbfIcbT5FJOhUEU72duQ","pdfSize":"584433","objectId":"0x0c8fb6e86b7cb7f2c5698ac319ff6795ab90646ad79fbe7761e07d6edda0c17a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
