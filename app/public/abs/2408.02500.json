We report on a\ndedicated measurement with Gator, a low-background, high-purity germanium\ndetector operated at the Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso, aimed at testing\nPEP-violating atomic transitions in lead. The experimental technique, relying\non forming a new symmetry state by introducing electrons into the pre-existing\nelectron system through a direct current, satisfies the conditions of the\nMessiah-Greenberg superselection rule. No PEP violation has been observed, and\nan upper limit on the PEP violation probability of $\\beta^2/2 < 4.8 \\cdot\n10^{-29}$ (90% CL) is set. This improves the previous constraint from a\ncomparable measurement by more than one order of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GHh1JLmb4wrGUCxtArvTCgm_D5d0tWt3b5nopff84xY","pdfSize":"4225950"}
