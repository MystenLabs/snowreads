Under the only\nassumption that the sequence $\\{Q_n\\}$ has a weak* limiting zero distribution\n(an empirical distribution of zeros) represented by a unit measure $\\mu_0$ with\ncompact support in the complex plane, we show that as $n, k \\rightarrow \\infty$\nsuch that $k / n \\rightarrow t \\in(0,1)$, the Cauchy transform of the\nzero-counting measure of the polynomials $Q_{n, k}$ converges in a neighborhood\nof infinity to the Cauchy transform of a measure $\\mu_t$.\n  The family of measures $\\mu_t $, $t \\in(0,1)$, whose dependence on the\nparameter $t$ can be interpreted as a flow of the zeros under iterated\ndifferentiation, has several interesting connections with the inviscid Burgers\nequation, the fractional free convolution of $\\mu_0$, or a nonlocal diffusion\nequation governing the density of $\\mu_t$ on $\\mathbb R$.\n  The main goal of this paper is to provide a streamlined and elementary proof\nof all these facts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tndiG4GlGYq8F6up2z1kRo8j_OaNaZMGy-Oxv6mHKOg","pdfSize":"327438"}
