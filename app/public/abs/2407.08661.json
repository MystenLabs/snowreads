In this work, we present a\nself-consistent Hartree-Fock theory for the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG. In\nparticular, we focus on the convergence of the Hartree-Fock calculation with\nvarious reference fields and discuss the stability of the FQAH states in PLG.\nWe show that the so-called charge neutrality scheme provides an unambiguous\nresult for the Hartree-Fock calculation, as it ensures a convergence with\nrespect to the momentum cutoff. Based on the Hartree-Fock band structure, we\nfurther carry out exact diagonalization calculations to explore the stability\nof the FQAH states in PLG. Our work provides an improved and unified (minimal)\ntheoretical framework to understand the FQAH effect in rhombohedral PLG and\npaves the way for future experimental and theoretical studies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
