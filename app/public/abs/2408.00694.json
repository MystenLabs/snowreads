However, at the level of\ndiscrete stochastic realizations, heat flow is unraveled as a series of abrupt\nquantum jumps, each representing an exchange of finite quanta with the\nenvironment. In this work, we present a framework that resolves the dynamics of\nquantum thermal machines into cycles that are classified as engine-like,\ncooling-like, or idle. We explore the statistics of each cycle type and its\nduration, enabling us to determine both the fraction of cycles useful for\nthermodynamic tasks and the average waiting time between cycles of the same\ntype. Our framework presents a novel approach in characterizing thermal\nmachines, with significant relevance to modern experiments such as mesoscopic\ntransport using quantum dots.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
