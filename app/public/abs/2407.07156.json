They are usually\nquantified by a set of complex coefficients which include tidal Love numbers,\ndescribing the conservative response to an external perturbation. In the static\ncase, these are found to vanish exactly for asymptotically flat black holes in\ngeneral relativity in four spacetime dimensions, and recently they have been\ngeneralized to dynamical interactions. In the context of response theory, the\nretarded Green's function provides the complete description of the behavior of\ndynamical systems. In this work we investigate the relation between Love\nnumbers and Green's functions, and highlight the relevance of radiation\nreaction effects to their connection. As a special case, we discuss\nBanados-Teitelboim-Zanelli black holes, where the absence of radiative modes\nallows us to make a direct link between them.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
