Such configurations can produce heavy RHNs with\nmass many orders of magnitude above the scale of symmetry breaking as well as\nthe temperature of the plasma, thereby enabling high scale leptogenesis without\nthe need for high reheat temperatures while also naturally suppressing washout\neffects. This mechanism also extends the window of viability to RHN masses\n$\\gtrsim 10^{14}$ GeV, the natural scale for type-I seesaw with\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ couplings, where standard thermal leptogenesis cannot produce\nthe observed baryon asymmetry. The corresponding phase transitions are at\nscales $\\gtrsim\\!10^9$ GeV and produce gravitational wave signals that could be\ndetected by future experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
