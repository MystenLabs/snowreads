Accurate prediction of coordinated spectral efficiency (CSE)\ncan guide the optimization of network parameters, resulting in enhanced\nresource utilization efficiency. However, characterizing the CSE is intractable\ndue to the inherent complexity of the CoMP channel model and the diversity of\nthe 5G dynamic network environment, which poses a great challenge for CSE\nprediction in real-world 5G CoMP systems. To address this challenge, in this\nletter, we propose a data-driven model-assisted approach. Initially, we\nleverage domain knowledge to preprocess the collected raw data, thereby\ncreating a well-informed dataset. Within this dataset, we explicitly define the\ntarget variable and the input feature space relevant to channel statistics for\nCSE prediction. Subsequently, a residual-based network model is built to\ncapture the high-dimensional non-linear mapping function from the channel\nstatistics to the CSE. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated\nby experimental results on real-world data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
