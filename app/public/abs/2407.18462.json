These threats compromise the security and reliability of\ncommunications among road users, thereby jeopardizing road and traffic safety.\nOne of the main vectors of these attacks within vehicular networks is\nmisbehaving vehicles. To address this challenge, we propose deploying a\npretrained Large Language Model (LLM)-empowered Misbehavior Detection System\n(MDS) within an edge-cloud detection framework. Specifically, we fine-tune\nMistral-7B, a state-of-the-art LLM, as the edge component to enable real-time\ndetection, whereas a larger LLM deployed in the cloud can conduct a more\ncomprehensive analysis. Our experiments conducted on the extended VeReMi\ndataset demonstrate Mistral-7B's superior performance, achieving 98\\% accuracy\ncompared to other LLMs such as LLAMA2-7B and RoBERTa. Additionally, we\ninvestigate the impact of window size on computational costs to optimize\ndeployment efficiency. Leveraging LLMs in MDS shows interesting results in\nimproving the detection of vehicle misbehavior, consequently strengthening\nvehicular network security to ensure the safety of road users.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
