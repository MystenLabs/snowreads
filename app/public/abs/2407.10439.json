In this\npaper, we aim to reconstruct the floorplan with a vectorized representation\nfrom point clouds. Despite significant advancements achieved in recent years,\ncurrent methods still encounter several challenges, such as missing corners or\nedges, inaccuracies in corner positions or angles, self-intersecting or\noverlapping polygons, and potentially implausible topology. To tackle these\nchallenges, we present PolyRoom, a room-aware Transformer that leverages\nuniform sampling representation, room-aware query initialization, and\nroom-aware self-attention for floorplan reconstruction. Specifically, we adopt\na uniform sampling floorplan representation to enable dense supervision during\ntraining and effective utilization of angle information. Additionally, we\npropose a room-aware query initialization scheme to prevent non-polygonal\nsequences and introduce room-aware self-attention to enhance memory efficiency\nand model performance. Experimental results on two widely used datasets\ndemonstrate that PolyRoom surpasses current state-of-the-art methods both\nquantitatively and qualitatively.
