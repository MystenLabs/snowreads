Thus, proper parameter tuning should be\ncarried out to ensure that the algorithm used for optimization performs well\nand is sufficiently robust for solving different types of optimization\nproblems. In this study, the Firefly Algorithm (FA) is used to evaluate the\ninfluence of its parameter values on its efficiency. Parameter values are\nrandomly initialized using both the standard Monte Carlo method and the Quasi\nMonte-Carlo method. The values are then used for tuning the FA. Two benchmark\nfunctions and a spring design problem are used to test the robustness of the\ntuned FA. From the preliminary findings, it can be deduced that both the Monte\nCarlo method and Quasi-Monte Carlo method produce similar results in terms of\noptimal fitness values. Numerical experiments using the two different methods\non both benchmark functions and the spring design problem showed no major\nvariations in the final fitness values, irrespective of the different sample\nvalues selected during the simulations. This insensitivity indicates the\nrobustness of the FA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
