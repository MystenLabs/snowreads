We begin by noting that property is\nan asset in an economy. That economy is organized in sectors, driven by its\nproductivity which is a multidimensional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, while the\nclimate transition is declined thanks to the carbon price, a continuous\ndeterministic process. We then extend the sales comparison approach and the\nincome approach to valuate an energy inefficient real estate asset. We obtain\nits value as the difference between the price of an equivalent efficient\nbuilding following an exponential Ornstein-Uhlenbeck as well as the actualized\nrenovation costs and the actualized sum of the future additional energy costs.\nThese costs are due to the inefficiency of the building, before an optimal\nrenovation date which depends on the carbon price process. Finally, we carry\nout simulations based on the French economy and the house price index of\nFrance. Our results allow to conclude that the order of magnitude of the\ndepreciation obtained by our model is the same as the empirical observations.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics","Quantitative Finance/General Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oLhGnmlT_HKLh8Ru53gqOxH_BIpqVJgjfihpnC-7HcQ","pdfSize":"1210701","txDigest":"3zcpsrQZX7JMCwrbHK8MDdpnR59HiytaXrZQZyYJq56e","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
