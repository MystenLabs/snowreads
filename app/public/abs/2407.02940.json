Vortex-antivortex (VAV)\nensembles can be produced, self-organizing into the respective polar lattices.\nHowever, these structures are in general highly unstable due to the strong VAV\nattraction. Here, we demonstrate that multiple optical VAV clusters nested in\nthe propagating coherent field can crystallize into patterns which preserve\ntheir lattice structures over distance up to several Rayleigh lengths. To\nexplain this phenomenon, we present a model for effective interactions between\nthe vortices and antivortices at different lattice sites. The observed VAV\ncrystallization is a consequence of the globally balanced VAV couplings. As the\ncrystallization does not require the presence of nonlinearities and appears in\nfree space, it may find applications to high-capacity optical communications\nand multiparticle manipulations. Our findings suggest possibilities for\nconstructing VAV complexes through the orbit-orbit couplings, which differs\nfrom the extensively studied spin-orbit couplings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8hWd-QzRZ6PUBovZVqF36u83CKZEWA8JxJsC1qeAg6I","pdfSize":"27706056"}
