{"id":"2407.06463","title":"Noise-tolerant public-key quantum money from a classical oracle","authors":"Peter Yuen","authorsParsed":[["Yuen","Peter",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2024 23:53:07 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-10","timestamp":1720482787000,"abstract":"  Quantum money is the task of verifying the validity of banknotes while\nensuring that they cannot be counterfeited. Public-key quantum money allows\nanyone to perform verification, while the private-key setting restricts the\nability to verify to banks, as in Wiesner's original scheme. The current state\nof technological progress means that errors are impossible to entirely\nsuppress, hence the requirement for noise-tolerant schemes. We show for the\nfirst time how to achieve noise-tolerance in the public-key setting. Our\ntechniques follow Aaronson and Christiano's oracle model, where we use the\nideas of quantum error correction to extend their scheme: a valid banknote is\nnow a subspace state possibly affected by noise, and verification is performed\nby using classical oracles to check for membership in \"larger spaces.\"\nAdditionally, a banknote in our scheme is minted by preparing conjugate coding\nstates and applying a unitary that permutes the standard basis vectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
