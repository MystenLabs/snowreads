However, the\nMA-aided system introduces the non-convex antenna distance constraints, which\nposes challenges in the underlying optimization problems. To fill this gap,\nthis paper proposes a general framework for optimizing the MA-aided system\nunder the antenna distance constraints. Specifically, we separate the\nnon-convex antenna distance constraints from the objective function by\nintroducing auxiliary variables. Then, the resulting problem can be efficiently\nsolved under the alternating optimization framework. For the subproblems with\nrespect to the antenna position variables and auxiliary variables, the proposed\nalgorithms are able to obtain at least stationary points without any\napproximations. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed optimization\nframework, we present two case studies: capacity maximization and regularized\nzero-forcing precoding. Simulation results demonstrate the proposed\noptimization framework outperforms the existing baseline schemes under both\ncases.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
