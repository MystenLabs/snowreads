However, it is almost exclusively performed in the privacy of an\nindividual's home via typing on a keyboard. In this article, we explore body\nprompting as input for image generation. Body prompting extends interaction\nwith generative AI beyond textual inputs to reconnect the creative act of image\ngeneration with the physical act of creating artworks. We implement this\nconcept in an interactive art installation, Artworks Reimagined, designed to\ntransform artworks via body prompting. We deployed the installation at an event\nwith hundreds of visitors in a public and private setting. Our results from a\nsample of visitors (N=79) show that body prompting was well-received and\nprovides an engaging and fun experience. We identify three distinct patterns of\nembodied interaction with the generative AI and present insights into\nparticipants' experience of body prompting and AI co-creation. We provide\nvaluable recommendations for practitioners seeking to design interactive\ngenerative AI experiences in museums, galleries, and other public cultural\nspaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
