The crossed product presents a natural\nmethod for implementing constraints through the commutation theorem, rendering\nit a useful tool for constructing gauge invariant algebras. The crossed product\nof a Type III algebra with its modular automorphism group is semifinite, which\nmeans that the crossed product regulates divergences in local quantum field\ntheories. In this letter, we find a sufficient condition for the semifiniteness\nof the crossed product of a type III algebra with any locally compact group\ncontaining the modular automorphism group. Our condition surprisingly implies\nthe centrality of the modular flow in the symmetry group, and we provide\nevidence for the necessity of this condition. Under these conditions, we\nconstruct an associated trace which computes physical expectation values. We\ncomment on the importance of this result and and its implications for subregion\nphysics in gauge theory and gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
