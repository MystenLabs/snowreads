By adiabatically varying the periodic kicks to\nthe rotor we find nodal-line braiding, which causes sign flips of topological\ncharges of band nodes and can prevent them from annihilating, indicated by\nnon-zero values of the %non-Abelian patch Euler class. In particular, we report\non the emergence of an anomalous Dirac string phase arising in the strongly\ndriven regime, a truly out-of-equilibrium phase of the quantum rotor. This\nphase emanates from braiding processes involving all (quasienergy) gaps and\nmanifests itself with edge states at zero angular momentum. Our results reveal\ndirect applications in state-of-the-art experiments of quantum rotors, such as\nlinear molecules driven by periodic far-off-resonant laser pulses or artificial\nquantum rotors in optical lattices, whose extensive versatility offers precise\nmodification and observation of novel non-Abelian topological properties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W4oySHmRQ7F0VsB1QMKItIAXELBjYtZ2l08qN-u0_-I","pdfSize":"1709694"}
