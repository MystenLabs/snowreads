Here, the magnitude of\nthe velocity vector is still determined by the curvature, but its direction is\ngiven by an associated time-dependent moving frame. After establishing local\nexistence and global estimates, we analyze the trajectory surfaces generated by\ndifferent variations of this flow, specifically those leading to surfaces of\nconstant mean or Gaussian curvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
