Great mathematics has consequences far beyond the problems that\noriginally inspired it, and Viazovska's work is no exception. In this article,\nwe'll examine how it has led to new interpolation theorems in Fourier analysis,\nspecifically a theorem of Radchenko and Viazovska.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
