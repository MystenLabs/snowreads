Another main\ndrive of the paper concerns a version of the above result in the case of a\nproduct of general forms of arbitrary degrees (in particular, transverse ones).\nFinally, some relevant cases of non general forms are also contemplated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
