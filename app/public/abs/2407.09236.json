Despite\ndecades of research, ambiguities persist on principles of intuition.\nExperimental psychology reveals many types of intuition, which depend on state\nof the human mind. We focus on visual intuition, useful for completing missing\ninformation during visual cognitive tasks. First, we set up a scenario to\ngradually decrease the amount of visual information in the images of a dataset\nto examine its impact on CNN accuracy. Then, we represent a model for visual\nintuition using Gestalt theory. The theory claims that humans derive a set of\ntemplates according to their subconscious experiences. When the brain decides\nthat there is missing information in a scene, such as occlusion, it\ninstantaneously completes the information by replacing the missing parts with\nthe most similar ones. Based upon Gestalt theory, we model the visual\nintuition, in two layers. Details of these layers are provided throughout the\npaper. We use the MNIST data set to test the suggested intuition model for\ncompleting the missing information. Experiments show that the augmented CNN\narchitecture provides higher performances compared to the classic models when\nusing incomplete images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
