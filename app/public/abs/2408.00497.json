The proposed algorithm is dual to the\ninterconnected approach since it offers alternative flexibility to be tuned and\nto be implemented in real-time processes. In particular, an application to a\nnumerical integration scheme is presented as the Taylor refinement can be of\ninterest to improve the global convergence. Numerical results are presented to\nsupport the rightness of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
