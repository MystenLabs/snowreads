Kerala receives minimum and maximum rainfall\nduring the winter and monsoon seasons, respectively. Sunspot number, F10.7\nIndex, and cosmic ray intensity are the solar indices considered and their\nvariations with rainfall were studied over a period of 57 years (1965-2021),\ni.e., starting from Solar Cycle 20. For each solar cycle, correlative studies\nare performed and correlation coefficients are calculated. We find that\nrainfall in Kerala is correlated with sunspot activity, but with varying\ndegrees of significance. During Solar Cycle 21, rainfall and solar activity are\ncorrelated with high significance during both winter and monsoon seasons. The\nvariation of different solar indices with rainfall is studied. The winter\nseason showed a better link between the sun and rainfall than the monsoon\nseason. The years with rainfall surplus and deficiency are calculated and\ncompared with the solar indices. We find that the years with rainfall excess\nand deficit mostly occur in the years around solar maximum or minimum (within\n$\\pm$2 years). We hypothesise a physical relationship between solar activity\nand extreme rainfall events in Kerala that contributes to their predictability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WcXauFWh0pT3UYnP1jfbAB8EGMGTPRl2HSy5Izp79MA","pdfSize":"1736102"}
