Building on recent results relating\nmiddle convolution and finite complex reflection groups, our work implements\nKatz's middle convolution to explicitly classify finite orbits in the\n$SL_2(\\C)$-character variety of the punctured sphere. We provide theoretical\nresults on the existence of finite orbits arising from the imprimitive finite\ncomplex reflection groups and formulas for constructing such examples when they\nexist. In the primitive finite complex reflection groups, we perform an\nexhaustive search and provide computational results. Our contributions also\ninclude Magma computer code for middle convolution and for computing the orbit\nunder this action when it is known to be finite.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xUvZhMAhGULf7KLH5PUyhVFlQrth009sqrAqtaOpVjg","pdfSize":"525639"}
