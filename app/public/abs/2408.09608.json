The dichroic contrast is maximized at the energy of\nthe hybridization of the O 2p state and the Fe 3d orbitals, which is split by\nthe octahedral crystal field of the perovskite structure. The thus obtained\nmicroscopy images compliment the ptychographic imaging of the antiferromagnetic\ncontribution at the Fe L$_3$-edge. The approach is extendible to the separation\nof different ferroic contributions in other multiferroic oxides.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
