Features of our construction are that it respects a modified\naction filtration (in contrast to Pomerleano--Seidel's construction); it uses a\ncompact telescope model (in contrast to Abouzaid--Groman--Varolgunes'\nconstruction); and it is adapted to the purposes of our follow-up work where we\nconstruct Maurer--Cartan elements in symplectic cochains which are associated\nto a normal-crossings compactification of the Liouville domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_S3eTqkJjJAW-njnbcP9GkXMPSTA0F2rhlu_fbXsMTI","pdfSize":"450858"}
