As the complexity of a system increases, it is subject to\ndeprecation, difficulties in making updates, and risks in introducing defects\nwhen making changes. Microservices are small, loosely coupled, highly cohesive\nunits that interact to provide system functionalities. We provide a\ncomprehensive survey of current research into ways of identifying services in\nsystems that can be redeployed as microservices. Static, dynamic, and hybrid\napproaches have been explored. While code analysis techniques dominate the\narea, dynamic and hybrid approaches remain open research topics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
