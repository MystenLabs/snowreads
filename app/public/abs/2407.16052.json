Other types of diagrams can also\ncontribute to the soft limit at leading order in the soft momentum, but have a\ndifferent pole structure. We derive these results at four points using explicit\nformulae recently obtained from the cosmological bootstrap and double copy, and\nextend them to any multiplicity using bootstrap techniques in Mellin-momentum\nspace.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0LuVLMlyAFTgTNpNbYZRZvbd0EC3i-IlhjsmZKnKvrw","pdfSize":"839625","objectId":"0xd2226b556fbc8e4a3e2271c928aa132782ab41e2192038d8d6078da247673c8a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
