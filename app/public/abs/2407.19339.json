Yet measurement and reporting of polling error has\nfocused solely on sampling error, represented by the margin of error of a poll.\nSurvey statisticians have long recommended measurement of the total survey\nerror of a sample estimate by its mean square error (MSE), which jointly\nmeasures sampling and non-sampling errors. Extending the conventional language\nof polling, we think it reasonable to use the square root of maximum MSE to\nmeasure the total margin of error (TME). This paper demonstrates how to measure\nthe potential impact of nonresponse using the concept of TME, which we suggest\nshould be a standard feature in the reporting of election poll results. We\nfirst show how to jointly measure statistical imprecision and response bias\nwhen a pollster lacks any knowledge of the candidate preferences of\nnon-responders. We then extend the analysis to settings where the pollster has\npartial knowledge that bounds the preferences of non-responders. In each\nsetting, we derive the poll estimate that minimizes TME, a midpoint estimate,\nand compare it to a conventional poll estimate. We identify conditions under\nwhich the two estimates coincide, noting that the TME exceeds the margin of\nsampling error whenever the pollster has less than complete knowledge of the\nnature of nonresponse.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
