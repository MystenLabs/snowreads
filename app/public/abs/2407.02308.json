This paper introduces a tactical time slot management\nproblem for subscription-based e-retailers, focusing on slot assortment and\nprice discounts. The novelty of our model lies in incorporating customers'\nheterogeneous preferences regarding delivery slots, captured through a mixed\nlogit choice model. The resulting stochastic problem is formulated as a\nmixed-integer linear programming relying on simulations. We utilize a\nsimulation-based adaptive large neighborhood search to solve this problem\nefficiently for large instances. Numerical experiments demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach, particularly in addressing uncertain\nheterogeneous customer behavior when optimizing assortment and pricing\nstrategies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"V4C-Md1swk7EEpM01VTURkGpiX-9nHJxOBvNFx1p0DU","pdfSize":"1069095"}
