However,\ntheir potential remains underexplored in the realm of network security,\nparticularly for intrusion detection. To bridge this gap, we propose an\narchitecture chatbot specifically designed to enhance security within edge\nnetworks specifically for intrusion detection. Leveraging advanced machine\nlearning algorithms, this chatbot will monitor network traffic to identify and\nmitigate potential intrusions. By securing the network environment using an\nedge network managed by a Raspberry Pi module and ensuring ethical user consent\npromoting transparency and trust, this innovative solution aims to safeguard\nsensitive data and maintain a secure workplace, thereby addressing the growing\nneed for robust network security measures in the digital age.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
