An approach to assess data\nvalidity is data quality scoring, which assigns a score to each data point or\nstream based on various quality dimensions. However, certain dimensions exhibit\ndynamic qualities, which require adaptation on the basis of the system's\ncurrent conditions. Existing methods often overlook this aspect, making them\ninefficient in dynamic production environments. In this paper, we introduce the\nAdaptive Data Quality Scoring Operations Framework, a novel framework developed\nto address the challenges posed by dynamic quality dimensions in industrial\ndata streams. The framework introduces an innovative approach by integrating a\ndynamic change detector mechanism that actively monitors and adapts to changes\nin data quality, ensuring the relevance of quality scores. We evaluate the\nproposed framework performance in a real-world industrial use case. The\nexperimental results reveal high predictive performance and efficient\nprocessing time, highlighting its effectiveness in practical quality-driven AI\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
