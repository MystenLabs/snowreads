In this\npaper, we propose DHSNet,which extracts the objects features with a end-to-end\narchitecture along with a heatmap proposal. Deformable convolutions are also\nutilized in the proposed network. The DHSNet finely combines low-level feature\nmaps with high-level ones by using upsampling operators as well as downsampling\noperators in a U-shape manner. Besides, DHSNet also aims to capture static\nobjects of various shapes and scales. We also predict a proposal heatmap to\ndetect the proposal points for more accurate target aiming in the network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
