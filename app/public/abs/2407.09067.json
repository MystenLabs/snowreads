For $k\\ge 0$ an integer, a subset $I_k$ of $V(G)$ is called a\n$k$-nearly independent vertex subset of $G$ if $I_k$ induces a subgraph of size\n$k$ in $G$. The number of such subsets in $G$ is denoted by $\\sigma_k(G)$. In\nthis paper we continue the study of $\\sigma_1$. In particular, we prove the\nlower bound on $\\sigma_1$ for a connected graph that contains a cycle and also\ncharacterise the two extremal graphs. This improves the result obtained in [E.\nO. D.
