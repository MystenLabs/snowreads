We demonstrate\nthat these systems can exhibit negative entropy production, making them\npotential candidates for information engines. We also identify a key\ninformational quantity that can characterize phase transitions beyond the reach\nof traditional partition functions. This work enhances our understanding of the\ninterplay between information and thermodynamics, providing a new perspective\non non-Hermitian quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
