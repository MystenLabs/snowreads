In this paper we\ninitiate the rigorous systematic analysis of these equations by studying them\nin one space dimension in the $C^1$ setting. We begin by proposing a notion of\nisentropic Carrollian equations, and use this to reduce the Carrollian\nequations to a $2 \\times 2$ system of conservation laws. Using the scheme of\nLax, we then classify when $C^1$ solutions to the isentropic Carrollian\nequations exist globally, or blow up in finite time. Our analysis assumes a\nCarrollian analogue of a constitutive relation for the Carrollian energy\ndensity, with exponent in the range $\\gamma \\in (1,3]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
