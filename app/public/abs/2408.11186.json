We\nexplore autonomous negotiation in a setting where two self-interested rational\nagents sequentially trade items from a finite set of categories. Each agent has\na utility function that depends on the amount of items it possesses in each\ncategory. The offering agent makes trade offers to improve its utility without\nknowing the responding agent's utility function, and the responding agent\naccepts offers that improve its utility. We present a comparison-based\nalgorithm for the offering agent that generates offers through previous\nacceptance or rejection responses without extensive information sharing. The\nalgorithm estimates the responding agent's gradient by leveraging the\nrationality assumption and rejected offers to prune the space of potential\ngradients. After the algorithm makes a finite number of consecutively rejected\noffers, the responding agent is at a near-optimal state, or the agents'\npreferences are closely aligned. Additionally, we facilitate negotiations with\nhumans by representing natural language feedback as comparisons that can be\nintegrated into the proposed algorithm. We compare the proposed algorithm\nagainst random search baselines in integer and fractional trading scenarios and\nshow that it improves the societal benefit with fewer offers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
