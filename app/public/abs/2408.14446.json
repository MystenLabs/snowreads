We give the Euler-Lagrange equation for the limit shape and show how to\nsolve it for a class of rectilinear polygonal domains. Its solutions are given\nby piecewise-algebraic functions with lines of discontinuities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KmPup8e3ofxeAlos5nHoFYv8eJakjEmVQGy_OeRZg7w","pdfSize":"2593823"}
