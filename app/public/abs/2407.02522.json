Our goal was to delve\ninto documented experiences and findings. Specifically, we were keen to learn\nabout the motivations behind choosing third-party packages, software engineers'\nresponses to warning messages, and their overall understanding of security\nissues. The main aim of this review was to pinpoint prevailing trends, methods,\nand concerns in trust tools for the present npm environment. Furthermore, we\nsought to understand the complexities of integrating SECO into platforms such\nas npm. By analyzing earlier studies, our intention was to spot any overlooked\nareas and steer our research to address them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
