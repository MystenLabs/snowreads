The dataset\noriginates in fungal records labeled and curated by experts. It consists of\nabout 350k multi-modal observations that include more than 650k photographs\nfrom 5k fine-grained categories and diverse accompanying information, e.g.,\nacquisition metadata, satellite images, and body part segmentation. FungiTastic\nis the only benchmark that includes a test set with partially DNA-sequenced\nground truth of unprecedented label reliability. The benchmark is designed to\nsupport (i) standard close-set classification, (ii) open-set classification,\n(iii) multi-modal classification, (iv) few-shot learning, (v) domain shift, and\nmany more. We provide baseline methods tailored for almost all the use-cases.\nWe provide a multitude of ready-to-use pre-trained models on HuggingFace and a\nframework for model training. A comprehensive documentation describing the\ndataset features and the baselines are available at\nhttps://bohemianvra.github.io/FungiTastic/ and\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/picekl/fungitastic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ny8DzKO6ZyzWB33c1795TYXhtelzAw18eTotY3P6LH8","pdfSize":"22917547"}
