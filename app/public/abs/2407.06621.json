For these\npurposes, the DM in a homogeneous cosmological model has typically been used,\nneglecting the inhomogeneity of matter distribution. In this study, we derive a\nbias in the ensemble average of the DM over many FRBs owing to gravitational\nlensing by the inhomogeneous matter distribution based on cosmological\nperturbation theory. We demonstrate that the ensemble average is $0.4 \\,\n\\%$--$1\\,\\%$ smaller than the DM in the corresponding homogeneous model for a\nsource redshift of $z_{\\rm s}=1$, according to recent cosmological hydrodynamic\nsimulations of IllustrisTNG and BAHAMAS. This reduction occurs because light\nrays from FRBs tend to avoid high-density regions owing to lensing deflection.\nWe also discuss another selection effect, magnification bias, where demagnified\nFRBs with low DMs, fainter than the detection threshold, are excluded from the\nobserved sample, leading to a selective observation of magnified FRBs with high\nDMs. Lensing bias, including magnification bias, must be considered to achieve\npercent level accuracy in the DM--redshift relation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
