And how might economic theory survive ideological pressures? The\narticle addresses these questions by focusing on the mathematization of\neconomics over the past century and drawing on the history of Soviet science.\nMathematics in the USSR remained internationally competitive and generated many\nideas that were taken up and played important roles in economic theory. These\nsame ideas, however, were disregarded or adopted only in piecemeal fashion by\nSoviet economists, despite the efforts of influential scholars to change the\neconomic research agenda. The article draws this contrast into sharper focus by\nexploring the work of Soviet mathematicians in optimization, game theory, and\nprobability theory that was used in Western economics. While the intellectual\nexchange across the Iron Curtain did help advance the formal modeling\napparatus, economics could only thrive in an intellectually open environment\nabsent under the Soviet rule.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nmFFrm_MNlR2R1VmRYx50qmY_s5qDJkkrCCw_4lLPB8","pdfSize":"471335","objectId":"0xe6c223cd8315b08b7acdd356f10ba48a3c0b30005dfd6a54bae576f191cefe36","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
