In complex\nenvironments, where the human sensory system reaches its limits, behaviour is\nstrongly driven by our beliefs about the state of the world around us.\nAccessing others' mental states, e.g., beliefs and intentions, allows for more\neffective social interactions in natural contexts. Yet, these variables are not\ndirectly observable, making understanding ToM a challenging quest of interest\nfor different fields, including psychology, machine learning and robotics. In\nthis paper, we contribute to this topic by showing a developmental synergy\nbetween learning to predict low-level mental states (e.g., intentions, goals)\nand attributing high-level ones (i.e., beliefs). Specifically, we assume that\nlearning beliefs attribution can occur by observing one's own decision\nprocesses involving beliefs, e.g., in a partially observable environment. Using\na simple feed-forward deep learning model, we show that, when learning to\npredict others' intentions and actions, more accurate predictions can be\nacquired earlier if beliefs attribution is learnt simultaneously. Furthermore,\nwe show that the learning performance improves even when observed actors have a\ndifferent embodiment than the observer and the gain is higher when observing\nbeliefs-driven chunks of behaviour. We propose that our computational approach\ncan inform the understanding of human social cognitive development and be\nrelevant for the design of future adaptive social robots able to autonomously\nunderstand, assist, and learn from human interaction partners in novel natural\nenvironments and tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
