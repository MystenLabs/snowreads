In particular, we reveal how the ground and thermal particle ratios,\ncondensate temperature, internal energy, specific heat and equation of state\nfunctions change in the EUP formalism. Nevertheless, we conclude that, in\ncontrast to the effects of the Gravitational (Generalized) Uncertainty\nPrinciple (GUP), the EUP modifications can be disregarded in ideal Bose and\nFermi gas systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
