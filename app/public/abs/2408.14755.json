We prove\nthe existence of multiple nontrivial solutions if either $\\mu$ or the volume of\n$\\Omega$ is sufficiently small. The proof is based on an abstract critical\npoint theorem that only assumes a local $(\\text{PS})$ condition. Our results\nare new even in the semilinear case $p = 2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
