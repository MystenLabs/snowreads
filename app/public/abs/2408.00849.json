The flux is assumed to have two genuinely\nnonlinear characteristic fields. We consider a general force which may possibly\ndepend on time and space variable as well. To prove the existence, we assume\nthe initial data to be small in $L^\\infty$. Furthermore, we also study\nqualitative behavior for entropy solutions to hyperbolic system of balance\nlaws.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-0Enf4XFcimOYZWtYGls_r9uta-SN3WotCzIZbY0b6U","pdfSize":"335939"}
