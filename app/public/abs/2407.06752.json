In particular, our theorems apply to degree-2 Rossby-Haurwitz waves.\nThese results are achieved via a variational approach, with the key ingredient\nbeing to show that the flows under consideration satisfy the conditions of two\nBurton-type stability criteria which are established in this paper. As\nbyproducts, we obtain some sharp rigidity results for solutions of semilinear\nelliptic equations on a sphere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
