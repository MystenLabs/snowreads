As is well known, MOTS play an\nimportant role in the theory of black holes and, at the same time, are\ninteresting spacetime analogues of minimal surfaces in Riemannian geometry. The\nmain results presented here expand upon earlier works by the authors,\nspecifically addressing initial data sets incorporating charge.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
