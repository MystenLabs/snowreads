However, despite the abundance of\nunlabeled data on end-users, unsupervised learning problems such as clustering\nin the federated setting remain underexplored. In this paper, we investigate\nthe federated clustering problem, with a focus on federated k-means. We outline\nthe challenge posed by its non-convex objective and data heterogeneity in the\nfederated framework. To tackle these challenges, we adopt a new perspective by\nstudying the structures of local solutions in k-means and propose a one-shot\nalgorithm called FeCA (Federated Centroid Aggregation). FeCA adaptively refines\nlocal solutions on clients, then aggregates these refined solutions to recover\nthe global solution of the entire dataset in a single round. We empirically\ndemonstrate the robustness of FeCA under various federated scenarios on both\nsynthetic and real-world data. Additionally, we extend FeCA to representation\nlearning and present DeepFeCA, which combines DeepCluster and FeCA for\nunsupervised feature learning in the federated setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
