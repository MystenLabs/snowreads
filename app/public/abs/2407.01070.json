The\ninteraction between the visible photon and dark photon is introduced by the\ngauge kinetic mixing between the field strength tensors of the Abelian gauge\ngroups in the Standard Model and dark sector. The relativistic electrodynamics\nwas generalized to quantum electromagnetodynamics (QEMD) in the presence of\nboth electric and magnetic charges. The photon is described by two\nfour-potentials corresponding to two $U(1)$ gauge groups and satisfying\nnon-trivial commutation relations. In this work, we construct the low-energy\ndark photon-photon interactions in the framework of QEMD and obtain new dark\nphoton-photon kinetic mixings. The consequent field equations and the new\nMaxwell's equations are derived in this framework. We also investigate the\ndetection strategies of dark photon as light dark matter as well as the generic\nkinetic mixings at haloscope experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
