Then, we study the asymptotics of the volume of\ntubular neighbourhoods around such submanifolds. Finally, for the case of\ncurves in the Heisenberg groups, we prove a Weyl's invariance result: the\nvolume of small tubes around a curve does not depend on the way the curve is\nisometrically embedded, but only on its Reeb angle. The proof does not need the\ncomputation of the actual volume of the tube, and it is new even for the\nthree-dimensional Heisenberg group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nUF7BqSS0_X5fsLVQokqsf0kbyjuIy7ZEx8_7T0yqCM","pdfSize":"413328"}
