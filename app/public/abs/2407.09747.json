Typically, users interact with posts from\nfriends by commenting and using reaction emojis, reflecting their level of\ninterest on social media such as Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. Our objective\nis to analyze user history over time, including their posts and engagement on\nvarious topics. Additionally, we take into account the user's profile, seeking\nconnections between their activities and social media platforms. By integrating\nuser history, engagement, and persona, we aim to assess recommendation scores\nbased on relevant item sharing by Hit Rate (HR) and the quality of the ranking\nsystem by Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), where we achieve the\nhighest for NeuMF 0.80 and 0.6 respectively. Our hybrid approach solves the\ncold-start problem when there is a new user, for new items cold-start problem\nwill never occur, as we consider the post category values. To improve the\nperformance of the model during cold-start we introduce collaborative filtering\nby looking for similar users and ranking the users based on the highest\nsimilarity scores.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
