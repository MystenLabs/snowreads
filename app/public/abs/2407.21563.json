We verify that the cardinality of the\nset of gapsets with genus $3n+1$ such that the maximum distance between two\nconsecutive elements is $2n$ is equal to the cardinality of the set of gapsets\nwith genus $3n+2$ such that the maximum distance between two consecutive\nelements is $2n+1$, for all $n\\in \\mathbb{N}$. In particular, we compute the\ncardinality of the symmetric and pseudo-symmetric gapsets in these cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
