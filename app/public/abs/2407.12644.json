To\nverify our findings we calculate the propagator associated with the free\nparticle and the harmonic oscillator in the presence of the Dunkl derivative.\nWe also deduce the energy spectra and the corresponding bound-state wave\nfunctions from the spectral decomposition of the propagator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
