By modifying the model architecture and\ntraining to make predictions using similarities to any set of class examples\nfrom the training dataset, we acquire the ability to sample for prototypical\nexamples that contributed to the prediction, which provide an instance-based\nexplanation for the model's decision. Furthermore, by learning relationships\nbetween images from the training dataset through relative distances within the\nmodel's latent space, we obtain a metric for uncertainty that is better able to\ndetect out of distribution data than softmax confidence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7RERVjP-ErR-dfCeWZmhpv26LxHURbNFUK9YnYid3K4","pdfSize":"1133650"}
