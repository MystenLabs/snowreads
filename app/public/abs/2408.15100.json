We will be dealing with a wave\npropagation problem in a piece-wise homogeneous medium. Mathematically, the\nproblem is reduced to analyzing two systems of partial differential equations\nposed on two domains with a common boundary. The differential equations may not\nbe satisfied on the boundary (or part of the boundary), but some interface\nconditions are satisfied. These interface conditions depend on a specific\nphysical problem. We aim to prove the existence and regularity of the solution\nfor the case of hyperbolic systems of first-order equations with different\ndomains separated by a hyperplane, where we need to formulate the interface\nconditions. We do this for the initial value problem in 1D-space variable when\nthe coefficient matrix has discontinuity on $m$ lines. More specifically, we\nfind explicit solutions to the case when the coefficient matrix is piecewise\nconstant with a discontinuity along $1$ line or $2$ lines. We also prove the\nexistence of solution to the general initial value problem. We then formulate\nthe weak solution of initial value problem for the corresponding symmetric\nhyperbolic system in $n $D-space variables with interface conditions, get the\nenergy estimates for this system, and prove the existence of solution to the\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
