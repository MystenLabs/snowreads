In this work, we propose a successive convex\napproximation algorithm for maximizing the downlink energy efficiency (EE) at\nthe UAVs under per-UAV power budget and user quality-of-service constraints. We\nderive a closed-form expression for the EE that accounts for maximum-ratio\ntransmission and statistical channel knowledge at the users. Simulation results\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in maximizing the EE at the\nUAV layer. Moreover, we observe that a few tens of UAVs transmitting with a\nfine-tuned power are sufficient to empower the service of satellite networks\nand significantly increase the spectral efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4Wrlv1Mqpfdv6l6mKNWyr9gcmkbbL7-dnAppGkfIsbU","pdfSize":"1301651"}
