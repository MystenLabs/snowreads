Both first and second order schemes are constructed. Since the\npositivity of the solution is closely related to entropy, we also propose\npositivity-preserving versions of these schemes to ensure robustness, which\ninclude a scheme specially designed for the Boltzmann equation and a more\ngeneral scheme using Lagrange multipliers. The accuracy and provable\nentropy-dissipation properties of the proposed schemes are validated for both\nthe Boltzmann equation and the Landau equation through extensive numerical\nexamples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
