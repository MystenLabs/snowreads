Taking as input, a user-defined rig, we show how\nto efficiently compute deformations of the character mesh which respect\nartist-supplied handle positions and orientations, but without requiring\ncomplicated constraints on the physics solver, which can cause poor\nperformance. Rather we demonstrate an efficient, user controllable skinning\npipeline that can generate compelling character deformations, using a variety\nof physics material models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
