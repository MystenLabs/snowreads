At high Reynolds\nnumber $Re >> 1$, the dipole can travel a very long way, compared to the\ndistance between the vortex centers, before being slowed down and eventually\ndestroyed by diffusion. In this regime we construct an accurate approximation\nof the solution in the form of a two-parameter asymptotic expansion involving\nthe aspect ratio of the dipole and the inverse Reynolds number. We then show\nthat the exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations remains close to the\napproximation on a time interval of length $O(Re^\\sigma)$, where $\\sigma < 1$\nis arbitrary. This improves upon previous results which were essentially\nrestricted to $\\sigma = 0$. As an application, we provide a rigorous\njustification of an existing formula which gives the leading order correction\nto the translation speed of the dipole due to finite size effects.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
