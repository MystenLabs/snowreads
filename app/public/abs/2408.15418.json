The goal is to demystify the internal\nworkings of these models and provide insightful perspectives into their\ndecision-making processes. This is done by uncovering connections to two\napproximation algorithms studied in the domain of Boolean Satisfiability:\nBelief Propagation and Semidefinite Programming Relaxations. Revealing these\nconnections has empowered us to introduce a suite of impactful enhancements.\nThe first significant enhancement is a curriculum training procedure, which\nincrementally increases the problem complexity in the training set, together\nwith increasing the number of message passing iterations of the Graph Neural\nNetwork. We show that the curriculum, together with several other\noptimizations, reduces the training time by more than an order of magnitude\ncompared to the baseline without the curriculum. Furthermore, we apply\ndecimation and sampling of initial embeddings, which significantly increase the\npercentage of solved problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
