This paper focuses\non the rigorous mathematical justification of linear response theory for\nLangevin dynamics. We give some equivalent characterizations for reversible\noverdamped/underdamped Langevin dynamics, which is the unperturbed reference\nsystem. Then we clarify sufficient conditions for the smoothness and\nexponential convergence to the invariant measure for the overdamped case. We\nalso clarify those sufficient conditions for the underdamped case, which\ncorresponds to hypoellipticity and hypocoercivity. Based on these, the\nasymptotic dependence of the response function on the small perturbation is\nproved in both finite and infinite time horizons. As applications, Green-Kubo\nrelations and linear response theory for a generalized Langevin dynamics are\nalso proved in a rigorous fashion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
