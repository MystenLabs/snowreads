However, recent observations of multiple sources near\nsingle pulsars and significant offsets between TeV halo centroids and their\nparent pulsars suggest that this assumption is overly simplistic. In this\nLetter, we demonstrate that asymmetric propagation of cosmic rays near their\naccelerators may create multiple TeV sources instead of a single symmetric\nsource. This mechanism also explains the large offsets between TeV halo\ncentroids and their pulsars. We demonstrate that several perplexing detected\nsources can be naturally explained without invoking additional invisible\naccelerators.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"9U0os7jIa1LZVVwhtzLHY47M68hDXedJXn0bl2HGCZ4","pdfSize":"420745"}
