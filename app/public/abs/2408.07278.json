While machine learning approaches have shown promise\nin multi-scene recommendation, existing methodologies often struggle to address\ncold-start problems in unprecedented scenes: the increasing diversity of\ncommercial choices, along with the short online lifespan of scenes, give rise\nto the complexity of effective recommendations in online and dynamic scenes. In\nthis work, we propose Scene-wise Adaptive Network (SwAN), a novel approach that\nemphasizes high-performance cold-start online recommendations for new scenes.\nOur approach introduces several crucial capabilities, including scene\nsimilarity learning, user-specific scene transition cognition, scene-specific\ninformation construction for the new scene, and enhancing the diverged logical\ninformation between scenes. We demonstrate SwAN's potential to optimize dynamic\nmulti-scene recommendation problems by effectively online handling cold-start\nrecommendations for any newly arrived scenes. More encouragingly, SwAN has been\nsuccessfully deployed in Meituan's online catering recommendation service,\nwhich serves millions of customers per day, and SwAN has achieved a 5.64% CTR\nindex improvement relative to the baselines and a 5.19% increase in daily order\nvolume proportion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
