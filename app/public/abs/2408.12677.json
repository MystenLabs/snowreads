Emerging 3D\nGaussian splatting bridges this gap, but existing Gaussian-based reconstruction\nmethods often suffer from artifacts and inconsistencies with the underlying 3D\nstructure, and struggle with real-time optimization, unable to provide users\nwith immediate feedback in high quality. One of the bottlenecks arises from the\nmassive amount of Gaussian parameters that need to be updated during\noptimization. Instead of using 3D Gaussian as a standalone map representation,\nwe incorporate it into a volumetric mapping system to take advantage of\ngeometric information and propose to use a quadtree data structure on images to\ndrastically reduce the number of splats initialized. In this way, we\nsimultaneously generate a compact 3D Gaussian map with fewer artifacts and a\nvolumetric map on the fly. Our method, GSFusion, significantly enhances\ncomputational efficiency without sacrificing rendering quality, as demonstrated\non both synthetic and real datasets.
