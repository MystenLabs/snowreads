SatHub is dedicated to observations, data analysis,\nsoftware, and related activities. The session opened with a talk on the current\nstate of affairs with regards to satellite constellation mitigation, with a\nfocus on optical astronomy, and moved to focused discussion around the\ntop-voted topics. These included tools and techniques for forecasting satellite\npositions and brightnesses as well as streak detection and masking.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aALCiMBPb9ZrSd2mf-5ab8Gi5O5t1iViilGjORjkRik","pdfSize":"101565"}
