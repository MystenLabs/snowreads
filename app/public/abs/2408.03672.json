We incorporate deterministic quantum\ncomputation with a single qubit to replace classical post-processing, thus\nincreasing the inherent security. Further, our proposed hash function exhibits\nzero collision rate and high reliability. We further show that it provides $ >\n50\\%$ avalanche on average, and is highly sensitive to the initial conditions.\nWe show comparisons of several performance metrics for the proposed FQH with\ndifferent settings as well as with existing protocols to prove its efficacy.\nFQH requires minimal quantum resources to produce a large hash value, providing\nsecurity against the birthday attack. This innovative approach thus serves as\nan efficient hash function and lays the foundation for potential advancements\nin quantum cryptography by integrating the fully quantum hash generation\nprotocol.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
