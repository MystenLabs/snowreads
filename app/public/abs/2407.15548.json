In terms of their algebraic encoding\nby bisets, this translates to contraction of group elements along sequences\narising from iterated lifting.\n  As an application, we show that for every non-exceptional rational map on\n$\\mathbb{P}^1$ with $4$ post-critical points, there is a finite collection of\nisotopy classes of curves into which every curve eventually lands under\niterated lifting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
