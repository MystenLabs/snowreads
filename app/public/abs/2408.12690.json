Consequently, a locking technique is deemed secure if\nit resists a good array of attacks aimed at finding this correct key. This\npaper challenges this one-key premise by introducing a more efficient attack\nmethodology, focused not on identifying that one correct key, but on finding\nmultiple, potentially incorrect keys that can collectively produce correct\nfunctionality from the protected circuit. The tasks of finding these keys can\nbe parallelized, which is well suited for multi-core computing environments.\nEmpirical results show our attack achieves a runtime reduction of up to 99.6%\ncompared to the conventional attack that tries to find a single correct key.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4vN68CN1dyiKy-MZWl-Mlo0-U-fm3dZHSgMbeYYNXng","pdfSize":"121195"}
