First, we establish the models of the MIMO radar system\nand the target location distribution. Based on the considered models, we\npropose the first category of target location distribution exploitation methods\nby analyzing the radar direction-of-angle (DoA) estimation performance and\nderiving a general form of posterior Cramer-Rao bound (PCRB) as the lower bound\nof the mean square error of DoA estimation. Following this, to explore more\ninsights, we proposed the second category of target location distribution\nexploitation methods by introducing a novel radar metric, probability scaled\nbeampattern (PSBP), from the perspective of radar beampattern. To compare the\ntwo methods, we formulate the PCRB and PSBP oriented radar waveform design\nproblems and propose corresponding low-complexity and convergence-guaranteed\nalgorithms to tackle them. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted in\ndifferent scenarios to provide a comprehensive evaluation and comparison of the\nradar performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
