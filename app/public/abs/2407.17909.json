Extensive\nresearch efforts have led to the development of related benchmarks such as\nMVTec AD (Bergmann et al., 2019). However, in industrial settings, there can be\ninstances of logical defects, where acceptable items are found in unsuitable\nlocations or product pairs do not match as expected. Recent methods tackling\nlogical defects effectively employ knowledge distillation to generate\ndifference maps. Knowledge distillation (KD) is used to learn normal data\ndistribution in unsupervised manner. Despite their effectiveness, these methods\noften overlook the potential false negatives. Excessive similarity between the\nteacher network and student network can hinder the generation of a suitable\ndifference map for logical anomaly detection. This technical report provides\ninsights on handling potential false negatives by utilizing a simple constraint\nin KD-based logical anomaly detection methods. We select EfficientAD as a\nstate-of-the-art baseline and apply a margin-based constraint to its\nunsupervised learning scheme. Applying this constraint, we can improve the\nAUROC for MVTec LOCO AD by 1.3 %.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aiGGezr2nFu6EpPAYQEuBoJfE3OtcPTwuXKY9vLOX8g","pdfSize":"1896846"}
