While\nthe governing equations were formulated by Scriven in 1960, solving for the\nflow of a deformable viscous surface with arbitrary shape and topology has\nremained a challenge. In this study, we present a straightforward discrete\nmodel based on variational principles to address this long-standing problem. We\nreplace the classical equations, which are expressed with tensor calculus in\nlocal coordinate, with a simple coordinate-free, differential-geometric\nformulation. The formulation provides a fundamental understanding of the\nunderlying mechanics and directly translates to discretization. We construct a\ndiscrete analogue of the system using the Onsager variational principle, which,\nin a smooth context, governs the flow of a viscous medium. In the discrete\nsetting, instead of term-wise discretizing the coordinate-based Stokes\nequations, we construct a discrete Rayleighian for the system and derive the\ndiscrete Stokes equations via the variational principle. This approach results\nin a stable, structure-preserving variational integrator that solves the system\non general manifolds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
