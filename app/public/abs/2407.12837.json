Our purpose is twofold:\n(1)~For each model, we give a complete characterisation for the existence of a\ntopological chaos (of the GDP levels), (2)~Even if a chaos exists, using\nergodic theory, we show that it is possible to predict the future GDP levels\n\"on average\". This paper gives a new application of a celebrated result in\nergodic theory by A. Avila (2014 fields medalist). We believe that our\nmethod/strategy in this paper is generic enough to be used to analyse many\nother (seemingly untractable) chaotic economic models.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
