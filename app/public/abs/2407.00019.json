We propose an auto-tuning (AT) method by using the\n$D_{mat}^i$ - $R_{ell}^i$ graph, which plots the derivation/average for the\nnumber of non-zero elements per row ($D_{mat}^i$) and the ratio, SpMV\nspeedups/transformation time from the CRS to ELL ($R_{ell}^i$ ). The\nexperimental results show the ELL format is very effective in the Earth\nSimulator 2. The speedup factor of 151 with the ELL-Row inner-parallelized\nformat is obtained. The transformation overhead is also very small, such as\n0.01 to 1.0 SpMV time with the CRS format. In addition, the $D_{mat}^i$ -\n$R_{ell}^i$ graph can be modeled for the effectiveness of transformation\naccording to the $D_{mat}^i$ value.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2024 08:19:14 GMT"}],"update_date":"2024-07-02","authors_parsed":[["Katagiri","Takahiro",""],["Sato","Masahiko",""]]}
