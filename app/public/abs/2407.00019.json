We propose an auto-tuning (AT) method by using the\n$D_{mat}^i$ - $R_{ell}^i$ graph, which plots the derivation/average for the\nnumber of non-zero elements per row ($D_{mat}^i$) and the ratio, SpMV\nspeedups/transformation time from the CRS to ELL ($R_{ell}^i$ ). The\nexperimental results show the ELL format is very effective in the Earth\nSimulator 2. The speedup factor of 151 with the ELL-Row inner-parallelized\nformat is obtained. The transformation overhead is also very small, such as\n0.01 to 1.0 SpMV time with the CRS format. In addition, the $D_{mat}^i$ -\n$R_{ell}^i$ graph can be modeled for the effectiveness of transformation\naccording to the $D_{mat}^i$ value.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Il9pXYtN4V5s4kbajX38rDFnxne6JVfW3OMCXEx1PO4","pdfSize":"2011882"}
