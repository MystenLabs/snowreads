We\nobtain some recurrence relations satisfied by Speyer's $g$-polynomials\n$g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$ of $U_{n,d}$. Based on these recurrence relations, we prove\nthat the polynomial $g_{U_{n,d}}(t)$ has only real zeros for any $n-1\\geq d\\geq\n1$. Furthermore, we show that the coefficient of $g_{U_{n,[n/2]}}(t)$ is\nasymptotically normal by local and central limit theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
