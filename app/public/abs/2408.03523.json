Representations of FS-domains and BF-domains via (topological)\nFS-approximation spaces are considered. It is proved that the collection of\nCF-closed sets in an FS-approximation space (resp., a topological\nFS-approximation space) endowed with the set-inclusion order is an FS-domain\n(resp., a BF-domain) and that every FS-domain (resp., BF-domain) is order\nisomorphic to the collection of CF-closed sets of some FS-approximation space\n(resp., topological FS-approximation space) endowed with the set-inclusion\norder. The concept of topological BF-approximation spaces is introduced and a\nskillful method without using CF-approximable relations to represent BF-domains\nis given. It is also proved that the category of FS-domains (resp., BF-domains)\nwith Scott continuous maps as morphisms is equivalent to that of\nFS-approximation spaces (resp., topological FS-approximation spaces) with\nCF-approximable relations as morphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
