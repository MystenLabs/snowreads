{"id":"2408.08874","title":"Hydrogen Development in China and the EU: A Recommended Tian Ji's Horse\n  Racing Strategy","authors":"Hong Xu","authorsParsed":[["Xu","Hong",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2024 21:51:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-20","timestamp":1722549071000,"abstract":"  The global momentum towards establishing sustainable energy systems has\nbecome increasingly prominent. Hydrogen, as a remarkable carbon-free and\nrenewable energy carrier, has been endorsed by 39 countries at COP28 in the\nUAE, recognizing its essential role in global energy transition and industry\ndecarbonization. Both the European Union (EU) and China are at the forefront of\nthis shift, developing hydrogen strategies to enhance regional energy security\nand racing for carbon neutrality commitments by 2050 for the EU and 2060 for\nChina. The wide applications of hydrogen across hard-to-abate sectors and the\nflexibility of decentralized production and storage offer customized solutions\nutilizing local resources in a self-paced manner. To unveil the trajectory of\nhydrogen development in China and the EU, this paper proposes a comparative\nanalysis framework employing key factors to investigate hydrogen developments\nin both economic powerhouses. Beyond country-wise statistics, it dives into\nrepresentative hydrogen economic areas in China (Inner Mongolia, Capital\nEconomic Circle, Yangtze River Delta) and Europe (Delta Rhine Corridor) for\nunderstanding supply and demand, industrial synergy, and policy incentives for\nlocal hydrogen industries. The derived implications offer stakeholders an\nevolving hydrogen landscape across the Eurasian continent and insights for\nfuture policy developments facilitating the global green transition.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/General Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"l-JXEfFee7HvcY0EJ8qLLHHCKfPrLQFntF8IzM68OWg","pdfSize":"2716511"}
