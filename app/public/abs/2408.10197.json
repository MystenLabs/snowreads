Much of this\nprogress has been fueled by distributed training, yet distributed communication\nremains a substantial bottleneck to training progress. This paper examines the\ncommunication behavior of transformer models - that is, how different\nparallelism schemes used in multi-node/multi-GPU DL Training communicate data\nin the context of transformers. We use GPT-based language models as a case\nstudy of the transformer architecture due to their ubiquity. We validate the\nempirical results obtained from our communication logs using analytical models.\nAt a high level, our analysis reveals a need to optimize small message\npoint-to-point communication further, correlations between sequence length,\nper-GPU throughput, model size, and optimizations used, and where to\npotentially guide further optimizations in framework and HPC middleware design\nand optimization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
