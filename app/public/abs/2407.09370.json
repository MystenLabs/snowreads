Despite their effectiveness, existing PEs require\nmanual, empirical adjustment of crucial hyperparameters, specifically the\nFourier features, tailored to each unique task. Further, PEs face challenges in\nefficiently learning high-frequency functions, particularly in tasks with\nlimited data. In this paper, we introduce sinusoidal PE (SPE), designed to\nefficiently learn adaptive frequency features closely aligned with the true\nunderlying function. Our experiments demonstrate that SPE, without\nhyperparameter tuning, consistently achieves enhanced fidelity and faster\ntraining across various tasks, including 3D view synthesis, Text-to-Speech\ngeneration, and 1D regression. SPE is implemented as a direct replacement for\nexisting PEs. Its plug-and-play nature lets numerous tasks easily adopt and\nbenefit from SPE.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9zkz-T04QLsR4FVjTueXE4yRLhiZJrEoIcEYrhga1LI","pdfSize":"1110111"}
