However, there are few explorations for\nthese foundation models used in quadruped robot navigation through terrains in\n3D environments. In this work, we introduce SARO (Space Aware Robot System for\nTerrain Crossing), an innovative system composed of a high-level reasoning\nmodule, a closed-loop sub-task execution module, and a low-level control\npolicy. It enables the robot to navigate across 3D terrains and reach the goal\nposition. For high-level reasoning and execution, we propose a novel\nalgorithmic system taking advantage of a VLM, with a design of task\ndecomposition and a closed-loop sub-task execution mechanism. For low-level\nlocomotion control, we utilize the Probability Annealing Selection (PAS) method\nto effectively train a control policy by reinforcement learning. Numerous\nexperiments show that our whole system can accurately and robustly navigate\nacross several 3D terrains, and its generalization ability ensures the\napplications in diverse indoor and outdoor scenarios and terrains.
