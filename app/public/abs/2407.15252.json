Wearable devices,\nby collecting real-time physiological signals, offer a solution for accurate\nstress detection accommodating individual differences. This position paper\nintroduces an adaptive framework for personalized stress detection using PPG\nand EDA signals. Unlike traditional methods that rely on a generalized model,\nwhich may suffer performance drops when applied to new users due to domain\nshifts, this framework aims to provide each user with a personalized model for\nhigher stress detection accuracy. The framework involves three stages:\ndeveloping a generalized model offline with an initial dataset, adapting the\nmodel to the user's unlabeled data, and fine-tuning it with a small set of\nlabeled data obtained through user interaction. This approach not only offers a\nfoundation for mobile applications that provide personalized stress detection\nand intervention but also has the potential to address a wider range of mental\nhealth issues beyond stress detection using physiological signals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
