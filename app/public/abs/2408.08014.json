Our results for the mixing\nangles are smaller than those predicted by the Bethe-Salpeter, relativistic and\nnon-relativistic quark models. These angles can be measured by analyzing\nvarious decay channels at experiments conducted at BELLE II, and LHCb.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
