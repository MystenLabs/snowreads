The proposed method accounts for\nuncertainty in the observations and PDE and surrogate models. First, we use the\nsurrogate model to formulate a minimization problem in the reduced space for\nthe maximum a posteriori (MAP) inverse solution. Then, we randomize the MAP\nobjective function and obtain samples of the posterior distribution by\nminimizing different realizations of the objective function. We test the\nproposed framework by comparing it with the iterative ensemble smoother and\ndeep ensembling methods for a non-linear diffusion equation with an unknown\nspace-dependent diffusion coefficient. Among other problems, this equation\ndescribes groundwater flow in an unconfined aquifer. Depending on the training\ndataset and ensemble sizes, the proposed method provides similar or more\ndescriptive posteriors of the parameters and states than the iterative ensemble\nsmoother method. Deep ensembling underestimates uncertainty and provides less\ninformative posteriors than the other two methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
