In 2017, Sanna posed an open question to classify primes $p$ for\nwhich the quotient set of $(x_n)_{n\\geq0}$ is dense in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. In a\nrecent paper, we showed that if the characteristic polynomial of the recurrence\nsequence has a root $\\pm \\alpha$, where $\\alpha$ is a Pisot number and if $p$\nis a prime such that the characteristic polynomial of the recurrence sequence\nis irreducible in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$, then the quotient set of $(x_n)_{n\\geq 0}$ is\ndense in $\\mathbb{Q}_p$. In this article, we answer the problem for certain\nlinear recurrence sequences whose characteristic polynomials are reducible over\n$\\mathbb{Q}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
