In this note we determine the minimal\ndiscrepancy that a binary de Bruijn sequence of order $n$ can achieve, which is\n$n$. This was an open problem until now. We give an algorithm that constructs a\nbinary de Bruijn sequence with minimal discrepancy. A slight modification of\nthis algorithm deals with arbitrary alphabets and yields de Bruijn sequences of\norder $n$ with discrepancy at most $1$ above the trivial lower bound $n$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
