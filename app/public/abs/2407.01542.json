It employs the growth optimal portfolio of the stocks as\nnumeraire and the new benchmark-neutral pricing measure for pricing. For a\nrealistic parsimonious model, this pricing measure turns out to be an\nequivalent probability measure, which is not the case for the risk-neutral\npricing measure. Many risk-neutral prices of long-term contracts are more\nexpensive than necessary. Benchmark-neutral pricing identifies the minimal\npossible prices of contingent claims, which is illustrated with remarkable\naccuracy for a long-term zero-coupon bond.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UZBNB43XCPTcSzTYhHNoHv-nK4v6FAI321SOcXbPRGA","pdfSize":"581549","objectId":"0xce3520af4d835fc627904b0b48e36c94bd6ece8eb42def0828caa90a64003d84","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
