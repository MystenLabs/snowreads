The up-to-date Skyrme-type $N\\la$ interaction\nSLL4 and the $NN$ interaction SGII are employed. Low-lying energy spectra of\n$^{20,22,24,26,28,30,32,34}$Ne, including the low-lying states with $J\\leq 6$,\nare predicted, discussed in detail, and found in good agreement with\nexperimental results. The electric quadrupole transition rate is also examined.\nThe coexistences of a ground state rotational band and a $\\be$ vibrational band\nare revealed in $^{20,22,24}$Ne. Unlike the previously discovered shrinkage\neffect of $\\la_{s}$ on the ground state nuclei, it is found that the $\\la_{s}$\nmay alter the excitation mode of the second band by affecting the distribution\nof the collective wave function, thereby causing the $\\be$ vibrational band\ntransitions to a vibrational band with equidistant energy levels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
