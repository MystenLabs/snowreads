The derived column densities are\n(1.4$\\pm$0.2)$\\times$10$^{11}$ for NC$_3$S and (1.5$\\pm$0.2)$\\times$10$^{11}$\nfor HC$_3$S. We searched for NCCS, but only three transitions are within the\ndomain of our QUIJOTE line survey and the observed lines are marginally\ndetected at the 3$\\sigma$ level, providing an upper limit to its column density\nof $\\leq$6$\\times$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$. We also unsuccessfully searched for\nlonger species of the NC$_n$S (n$\\ge$4) and HC$_n$S (n$\\ge$5) families in our\nTMC-1 data. A chemical model based on a reduced set of reactions involving\nHC$_3$S and NC$_3$S predicts abundances that are 10-100 times below the\nobserved values. These calculations indicate that the most efficient reactions\nof formation of HC$_3$S and NC$_3$S in the model are S + C$_3$H$_2$ and N +\nHC$_3$S, respectively, while both radicals are very efficiently destroyed\nthrough reactions with neutral atoms.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
