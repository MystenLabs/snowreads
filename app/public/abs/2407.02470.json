We use a finite-element method implemented in\nCOMSOL Multiphysics to solve the problem numerically, demonstrating how the\nfluid velocity, induced magnetic field and temperature change depending on the\nkey physical and geometrical parameters. The observed flow structures are\nelucidated by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions to obtain\napproximate solutions in the limit where the Hartmann number is large and the\ntrench walls are thin.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
