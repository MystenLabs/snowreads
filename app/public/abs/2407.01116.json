We study its sectional properties and show\nthat the $\\ell$-dimensional section of a Poisson-Laguerre tessellation\ncorresponding to $f$ is an $\\ell$-dimensional Poisson-Laguerre tessellation\ncorresponding to $f_{\\ell}$, which is up to a constant a fractional integral of\n$f$ of order $(d-\\ell)/2$. Further we derive an explicit representation for the\ndistribution of the volume weighted typical cell of the dual Poisson-Laguerre\ntessellation in terms of fractional integrals and derivatives of $f$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
