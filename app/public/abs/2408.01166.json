We show (by\nnumerical experiments) that this is indeed possible: within some range of\nparameters, any random score of spike trains (for all neurons in the network)\ncan be robustly memorized and autonomously reproduced with stable accurate\nrelative timing of all spikes, with probability close to one. We also\ndemonstrate associative recall under noisy conditions.\n  In these experiments, the required synaptic weights are computed offline, to\nsatisfy a template that encourages temporal stability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
