{"id":"2408.09029","title":"An Improved Tur\\'an Exponent for 2-Complexes","authors":"Maya Sankar","authorsParsed":[["Sankar","Maya",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 16 Aug 2024 21:54:29 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-20","timestamp":1723845269000,"abstract":"  The topological Tur\\'an number $\\mathrm{ex}_{\\hom}(n,X)$ of a 2-dimensional\nsimplicial complex $X$ asks for the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex\n3-uniform hypergraph containing no triangulation of $X$ as a subgraph. We prove\nthat the Tur\\'an exponent of any such space $X$ is at most $8/3$, i.e., that\n$\\mathrm{ex}_{\\hom}(n,X)\\leq Cn^{8/3}$ for some constant $C=C(X)$. This\nimproves on the previous exponent of $3-1/5$, due to Keevash, Long, Narayanan,\nand Scott. Additionally, we present new streamlined proofs of the\nasymptotically tight upper bounds for the topological Tur\\'an numbers of the\ntorus and real projective plane, which can be used to derive asymptotically\ntight upper bounds for all surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
