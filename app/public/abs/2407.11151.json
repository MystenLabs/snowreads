In particular, we establish small-data scattering for\nboth `intercritical' and `mass-subcritical' powers by suitable modifications of\nthe standard approach via Strichartz estimates. In addition, we prove\nscattering for arbitrary data in a weighted Sobolev space for intercritical\npowers by establishing a pseudoconformal energy estimate. We also rule out\n(unmodified) scattering for sufficiently low powers. Finally, we give some\nremarks concerning blowup for the focusing equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
