The texts are generated by three large language models\nusing five different decoding strategies, and they fall into six different text\ntype categories. EMTeC entails the eye movement data at all stages of\npre-processing, i.e., the raw coordinate data sampled at 2000 Hz, the fixation\nsequences, and the reading measures. It further provides both the original and\na corrected version of the fixation sequences, accounting for vertical\ncalibration drift. Moreover, the corpus includes the language models' internals\nthat underlie the generation of the stimulus texts: the transition scores, the\nattention scores, and the hidden states. The stimuli are annotated for a range\nof linguistic features both at text and at word level. We anticipate EMTeC to\nbe utilized for a variety of use cases such as, but not restricted to, the\ninvestigation of reading behavior on machine-generated text and the impact of\ndifferent decoding strategies; reading behavior on different text types; the\ndevelopment of new pre-processing, data filtering, and drift correction\nalgorithms; the cognitive interpretability and enhancement of language models;\nand the assessment of the predictive power of surprisal and entropy for human\nreading times. The data at all stages of pre-processing, the model internals,\nand the code to reproduce the stimulus generation, data pre-processing and\nanalyses can be accessed via https://github.com/DiLi-Lab/EMTeC/.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O5a-otEjPdKnLFDTCJOvL7Axl7dLMVZ00WxxxsRkkAc","pdfSize":"3691593"}
