The embedded space is composed of a number of\nsub-features to mimic both local affinity and remote structural relevance.\nThese sub-feature dimensions are defined by several indicators that we\nspeculate to catch nodal similarities, such as hop-based topological patterns,\nthe number of overlapping labels, the transitional probabilities (markov-chain\nprobabilities), and the cluster indices computed by our recursive spectral\nbisection (RSB) algorithm. These measures are flattened over the one\ndimensional vector space into their respective sub-component ranges such that\nthe entire set of vector similarity functions could be used for finding similar\nnodes. The error is defined by the sum of pairwise square differences across a\nrandomly selected sample of graph nodes between the assumed embeddings and the\nground truth estimates as our novel loss function. The ground truth is\nestimated to be a combination of pairwise Jaccard similarity and the number of\noverlapping labels. Finally, we demonstrate a multi-variate stochastic gradient\ndescent (SGD) algorithm to compute the weighing factors among sub-vector spaces\nto minimize the average error using a random sampling logic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
