The model was developed to address\nlimitations in the surplus production model that was previously used to assess\nthis stock. The ACL model included temporal variations in recruitment, growth,\nand mortality rates, which were limitations identified for the surplus\nproduction model. Our ACL model revealed some important discrepancies in survey\nand fishery length compositions. Our model also required large population\ndynamics process errors to achieve good fits to survey indices and catch\nestimates, which also demonstrated that additional understanding of these data\nand other model assumptions is required. As such, we do not propose the ACL\nmodel to provide management advice for 3LN redfish, but we do provide research\nrecommendations that should provide a better basis to model the 3LN redfish\nstock dynamics. Recommendations include implementing sampling programs to\ndetermine redfish species/ecotypes in commercial and research survey catches\nand improving biological sampling for maturity and age.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
