Current\nresearch aims at design of 2D magnets with particular functional properties. A\nformidable challenge is to produce metallic monolayers: the material landscape\nof layered magnetic systems is strongly dominated by insulators; rare metallic\nmagnets, such as Fe3GeTe2, become insulating as they approach the monolayer\nlimit. Here, electron transport measurements demonstrate that the recently\ndiscovered 2D magnet GdAlSi - graphene-like AlSi layers coupled to layers of Gd\natoms - remains metallic down to a single monolayer. Band structure analysis\nindicates the material to be an electride, which may stabilize the metallic\nstate. Remarkably, the sheet conductance of 2D GdAlSi is proportional to the\nnumber of monolayers - a manifestation of scalable conductivity. The GdAlSi\nlayers are epitaxially integrated with silicon, facilitating applications in\nelectronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EWOR5_UtR5IGNtK8zpt246all_DVmd3EWFMhltD22v8","pdfSize":"18408802"}
