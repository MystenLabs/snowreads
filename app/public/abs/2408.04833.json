The DFT effective actions, which are well suited for\naccommodating abelian and non-abelian T dualities, are naturally written in\nterms of modified connections and curvatures with torsion. We construct the\nmost general solutions with vanishing modified torsion, and such geometries\ndon't receive quantum corrections. We also compute the leading $\\alpha'$\ncorrections to several supergravity solutions, including a pair of geometries\nrelated by a non-abelian T duality.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
