Based on a colorful inspection of the\nbeginning of violet-colored dots along the filament of the flower's bud stage\nand the emergence of alternating bands of violet and white color in the matured\nbloom, it is possible to deduce that a two-degree model for polynomial mapping\ncan be used to study color oscillations in the flower.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6xg4Ia4ZI5a9g-fbcnAjliGMlrMj7BcHYJhDxcQb4K8","pdfSize":"647438"}
