In this paper we make use of a recent model which uses the\nX-ray reflection spectrum to constrain the ratio of the black hole mass to the\nsource distance. By folding in a reported distance measurement, we are able to\nestimate the mass of the black hole to be $12\\pm2~\\text{M}_\\odot$ ($1\\sigma$\ncredible interval). We are then able to revise a previous disc continuum\nfitting estimate of black hole spin $a_*$ (previously relying on a population\nmass distribution) using our new mass constraint, finding $a_*=0.47\\pm0.10$.\nThis work is a proof of principle demonstration of the method, showing it can\nbe used to find the mass of black holes in X-ray binaries.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0dWzlcVS2S09ZKlu9GUZ9GfKhGGfzFKgxtH8EA28suI","pdfSize":"2237488"}
