The primary advantages of these test selectors\ninclude performance that is not impacted by coverage holes, straightforward\nimplementation, and relatively low computational expense. However, the\ndetection of stimuli with novel temporal patterns remains largely unexplored.\nThis paper introduces two novel test selectors designed to identify such\nstimuli. The experiments reveal that both test selectors can accelerate the\nfunctional coverage for a commercial bus bridge, compared to random test\nselection. Specifically, one selector achieves a 26.9\\% reduction in the number\nof simulated tests required to reach 98.5\\% coverage, outperforming the savings\nachieved by two previously published test selectors by factors of 13 and 2.68,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
