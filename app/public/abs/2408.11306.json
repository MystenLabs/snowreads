Time series forecasting techniques have\nbeen developing in parallel with the machine learning community, from early\nstatistical learning methods to current deep learning methods. Although\nexisting methods have made significant progress, they still suffer from two\nchallenges. The mathematical theory of mainstream deep learning-based methods\ndoes not establish a clear relation between network sizes and fitting\ncapabilities, and these methods often lack interpretability. To this end, we\nintroduce the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) into time series forecasting\nresearch, which has better mathematical properties and interpretability. First,\nwe propose the Reversible Mixture of KAN experts (RMoK) model, which is a\nKAN-based model for time series forecasting. RMoK uses a mixture-of-experts\nstructure to assign variables to KAN experts. Then, we compare performance,\nintegration, and speed between RMoK and various baselines on real-world\ndatasets, and the experimental results show that RMoK achieves the best\nperformance in most cases. And we find the relationship between temporal\nfeature weights and data periodicity through visualization, which roughly\nexplains RMoK's mechanism. Thus, we conclude that KAN and KAN-based models\n(RMoK) are effective in time series forecasting.
