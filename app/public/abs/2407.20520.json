The proposed approach leverages the implicit function\ntheorem and primal-dual optimality conditions for a particular problem class.\nThe motivating application is multi-dimensional raking, where observations are\nadjusted to match marginals; for example, adjusting estimated deaths across\nrace, county, and cause in order to match state all-race all-cause totals. We\nreview raking from a convex optimization perspective, providing explicit\nprimal-dual formulations, algorithms, and optimality conditions for a wide\narray of raking applications, which are then leveraged to obtain the\nuncertainty estimates. Empirical results show that the approach obtains, at the\ncost of a single solve, nearly the same uncertainty estimates as\ncomputationally intensive Monte Carlo techniques that pass thousands of\nobserved and of marginal draws through the entire raking process.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
