By introducing a velocity operator he was able to derive a\nquantum analogue of the mass density flux equation and a quantum Euler\nequation. The article shows that it is possible to formulate a consistent\nquantum theory of the ideal liquid based on Landau's Quantum Hydrodynamics.\nThis means that it is added the quantum analogue of the momentum density flux\nequation, the energy density flux equation, the entropy density flux equation,\nand a quantum vorticity equation. These are all manifestly in agreement with\nthe classical limit of the flux equations of classical ideal liquids. It is\nalso shown that the various aspects that have been criticised about Landau's\nQuantum Hydrodynamics - e.g. the application of the inverse of the mass density\noperator - are not justified. Such a consistent quantum theory of an ideal\nliquid may therefore provide a starting point of a complementary approach in\nthe theoretical research of superfluid Helium 4.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
