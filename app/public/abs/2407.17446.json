We also propose another generalisation of the\nsignature, inspired by the previous one, but more convenient to use in machine\nlearning. Finally, we test this last signature in a toy application to the\nproblem of handwritten digit recognition, where significant improvements in\naccuracy rates are observed compared to those of the original signature.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
