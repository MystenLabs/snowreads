However, such networks can be convoluted and difficult to interpret,\nbut the Helmholtz-Hodge-Kodaira decomposition can split them into a rotational\nand gradient component which reveals the hierarchy of Granger causality flow.\nUsing Kenneth French's business sector return time series, it is revealed that\nduring the Covid crisis, precious metals and pharmaceutical products are causal\ndrivers of the financial network. Moreover, the estimated Granger causality\nnetwork shows a high connectivity during crisis which means that the research\npresented here can be especially useful to better understand crises in the\nmarket by revealing the dominant drivers of the crisis dynamics.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
