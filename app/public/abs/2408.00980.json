The correlation between polarization degrees and angles with X-Ray\nintensity was analyzed using data collected by the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry\nExplorer (IXPE) in June 2022. Given that X-Ray variability in the low/hard\nstate of Cygnus X-1 is non-periodic, flux peaks were aggregated to suppress\nstatistical fluctuations. We divided the temporal profiles of these aggregated\nflux peaks into seven time segments and evaluated the polarization for each\nsegment. The results reveal that the polarization degree was 4.6\\%$\\pm$1.2 and\n5.3\\%$\\pm$1.2 before and after the peak, respectively, but decreased to\n3.4\\%$\\pm$1.1 and 2.7\\%$\\pm$1.1 in the segments including and immediately\nfollowing the peak. Furthermore, the polarization angle exhibited a slight\nshift from approximately 30$^{\\circ}$ to $\\sim$40$^{\\circ}$ before and after\nthe peak. These findings suggest that the accretion disk contracts with\nincreasing X-Ray luminosity, and the closer proximity of the X-Ray emitting gas\nto the black hole may lead to reduced polarization.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
