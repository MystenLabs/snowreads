This paper investigates the formation and collapse of dark\nmatter solitons influenced by nonminimal gravitational effects, characterized\nby gradient-dependent self-interactions of dark matter and an additional source\nin Poisson's equation for gravity. Our simulations suggest that the initial\nevolution of dark matter resembles that without nonminimal gravitational\neffects. However, regions with negative mass density may develop, and solitons\nwill collapse when their densities reach certain critical values for both\npositive and negative coupling constants. With strong nonminimal coupling,\nstructure growth could be significantly enhanced.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
