We first\ndiscuss the expected goals of using synthetic data in data augmentation, which\ncan be divided into four parts: 1) Improving Diversity, 2) Data Balancing, 3)\nAddressing Domain Shift, and 4) Resolving Edge Cases. Synthesizing data are\nclosely related to the prevailing machine learning techniques at the time,\ntherefore, we summarize the domain of synthetic data techniques into four\ncategories: 1) Expert-knowledge, 2) Direct Training, 3) Pre-train then\nFine-tune, and 4) Foundation Models without Fine-tuning. Next, we categorize\nthe goals of synthetic data filtering into four types for discussion: 1) Basic\nQuality, 2) Label Consistency, and 3) Data Distribution. In section 5 of this\npaper, we also discuss the future directions of synthetic data and state three\ndirection that we believe is important: 1) focus more on quality, 2) the\nevaluation of synthetic data, and 3) multi-model data augmentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
