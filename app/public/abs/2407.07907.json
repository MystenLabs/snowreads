Furthermore, for every\nnon-(square-free) positive integer m which is not the square of a prime number,\na non-simple, indecomposable, irretractable, involutive, non-degenerate\nset-theoretic solution $(X,r)$ of the Yang-Baxter equation of cardinality $|X|\n= m$ is constructed. A recent question of Castelli on the existence of singular\nsolutions of certain type is also answered affirmatively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
