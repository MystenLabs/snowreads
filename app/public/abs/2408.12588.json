Our method is founded on\nthe observation that attention difference in the diffusion process exhibits a\nU-shaped pattern, indicating significant redundancy. We mitigate this by\nbroadcasting attention outputs to subsequent steps in a pyramid style. It\napplies different broadcast strategies to each attention based on their\nvariance for best efficiency. We further introduce broadcast sequence parallel\nfor more efficient distributed inference. PAB demonstrates superior results\nacross three models compared to baselines, achieving real-time generation for\nup to 720p videos. We anticipate that our simple yet effective method will\nserve as a robust baseline and facilitate future research and application for\nvideo generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
