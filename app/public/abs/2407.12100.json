We introduce an agglomerative clustering algorithm that clusters\nmultivariate empirical distributions using the regularized Wasserstein distance\nand apply the proposed methodology on a call-center model.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
