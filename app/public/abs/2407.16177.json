The core idea is to formulate a logifold structure and\nto interpret network models with restricted domains as local charts of\ndatasets. In particular, this provides a mathematical foundation for ensemble\nmachine learning. Our experiments demonstrate that logifolds can be implemented\nto identify fuzzy domains and improve accuracy compared to taking average of\nmodel outputs. Additionally, we provide a theoretical example of a logifold,\nhighlighting the importance of restricting to domains of classifiers in an\nensemble.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wgQg5w7UW5gyMwa_pAXM7yAnUZKpb1BnPALOmDj_qZ0","pdfSize":"154729"}
