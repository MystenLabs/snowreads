In this work we ask - How can the knowledge in a pre-trained\nlanguage model be leveraged for 3D scene understanding without any 3D\npre-training. The aim of this work is to establish whether pre-trained LLMs\npossess priors/knowledge required for reasoning in 3D space and how can we\nprompt them such that they can be used for general purpose spatial reasoning\nand object understanding in 3D. To this end, we present SceneGPT, an LLM based\nscene understanding system which can perform 3D spatial reasoning without\ntraining or explicit 3D supervision. The key components of our framework are -\n1) a 3D scene graph, that serves as scene representation, encoding the objects\nin the scene and their spatial relationships 2) a pre-trained LLM that can be\nadapted with in context learning for 3D spatial reasoning. We evaluate our\nframework qualitatively on object and scene understanding tasks including\nobject semantics, physical properties and affordances (object-level) and\nspatial understanding (scene-level).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
