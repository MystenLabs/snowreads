We\nfind it useful to investigate this monotonicity more abstractly for linear\nprograms over polytopes, regularized with the squared norm. Here, monotonicity\ncan be stated as an invariance property of the curve mapping the regularization\nparameter to the solution: once the curve enters a face of the polytope, does\nit remain in that face forever? We show that this invariance is equivalent to a\ngeometric property of the polytope, namely that each face contains the minimum\nnorm point of its affine hull. Returning to the optimal transport problem and\nits associated Birkhoff polytope, we verify this property for low dimensions,\nbut show that it fails for dimension $d\\geq25$. As a consequence, the\nconjectured monotonicity of the support fails in general, even if experiments\nsuggest that monotonicity holds for many cost matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
