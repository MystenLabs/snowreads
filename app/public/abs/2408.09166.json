The\nnumber of summands, namely $k$, is called the number of parts of $\\pi$. In this\npaper, we introduce two statistics over compositions of an integer $n$ with\nexactly $k$ parts: heights of symmetric peaks and depths of symmetric valleys\nover all compositions of $n$. We derive an explicit formula for the generating\nfunctions of compositions of $n$ with exactly $k$ parts according to the number\nof symmetric peaks (valleys) and the total heights (depths) of peaks (valleys).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
