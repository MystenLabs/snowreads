The low\nexcitation energy likely results from a cancellation between the contributions\nof the electromagnetic and strong forces. Physics beyond the Standard Model\ncould disrupt this cancellation, highlighting nuclear clocks' sensitivity to\nnew physics. Accurate predictions of the different contributions to nuclear\ntransition energies, and therefore of the quantitative sensitivity of a nuclear\nclock, are challenging. We improve upon previous sensitivity estimates and\nassess a ''nightmare scenario'', where all binding energy differences are small\nand the new physics sensitivity is poor. A classical geometric model of\nthorium-229 suggests that fine-tuning is needed for such a scenario. We also\npropose a $d$-wave halo model, inspired by effective field theory. We show that\nit reproduces observations and suggests the ''nightmare scenario'' is unlikely.\nWe find that the nuclear clock's sensitivity to variations in the effective\nfine structure constant is enhanced by a factor of order $10^4$. We finally\npropose auxiliary nuclear measurements to reduce uncertainties and further test\nthe validity of the halo model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
