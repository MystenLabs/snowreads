In this study,\nwe used machine learning to predict elemental combinations with high reactivity\nfor materials discovery. The essential issue for such prediction is the\nuncertainty of whether the unreported combinations are non-reactive or not just\ninvestigated, though the reactive combinations can be easily collected as\npositive datasets from the materials databases. To construct the negative\ndatasets, we developed a process to select reliable non-reactive combinations\nby evaluating the similarity between unreported and reactive combinations. The\nmachine learning models were trained by both datasets and the prediction\nresults were visualized by two-dimensional heatmaps: elemental reactivity maps\nto identify elemental combinations with high reactivity but no reported stable\ncompounds. The maps predicted high reactivity (i.e., synthesizability) for the\nCo_Al_Ge ternary system, and two novel ternary compounds were synthesized:\nCo4Ge3.19Al0.81 and Co2Al1.24Ge1.76.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"82c485u1708F2CBN9u3hM2U8a0JB2VpGEwZsNXjNpvY","pdfSize":"1248093"}
