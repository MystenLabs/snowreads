In this model, at every time step, every vertex chooses $k \\ge 1$\nincident edges, whose weight is then increased by 1. The choice of this\n$k$-tuple occurs proportionally to the product of the corresponding edge\nweights raised to some power $\\alpha > 0$. Our investigations are guided by the\nconjecture that the set of infinitely reinforced edges percolates for $k = 2$\nand $\\alpha \\gg 1$. First, we study the case $\\alpha = \\infty$, where we show\nthe percolation for $k = 2$ after adding arbitrarily sparse independent\nsprinkling and also allowing dual connectivities. We also derive a finite-size\ncriterion for percolation without sprinkling. Then, we extend this finite-size\ncriterion to the $\\alpha < \\infty$ case. Finally, we verify these conditions\nnumerically.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
