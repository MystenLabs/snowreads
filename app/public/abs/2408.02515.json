The state of the\nreservoir contains a parameter {\\varepsilon} interpolating between quantum and\nclassical reservoir features. We derive the explicit expression for the\ntime-dependent reduced spin density matrix, valid for all values of\n{\\varepsilon} and for energy conserving interactions. We study decoherence and\nmarkovianity properties. Our main finding is that the spin decoherence is\nenhanced (full decoherence) when the spin is coupled to quantum reservoir\nstates while it is dampened (partial decoherence) when coupled to classical\nreservoir states. The markovianity properties depend in a subtle way on the\nclassicality parameter {\\varepsilon} and on the finer details of the\nspin-reservoir interaction. We further examine scattering and periodicity\nproperties for energy exchange interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
