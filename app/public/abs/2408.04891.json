However, these\nmethods are unable to distinguish important features from unimportant ones\nunder simply unsupervised settings, and definitions of importance vary\naccording to the type of downstream task or analysis goal, such as the\nidentification of objects or backgrounds. In this paper, we focus on\nunsupervised image clustering as the downstream task and propose a\nrepresentation learning method that enhances features critical to the\nclustering task. We extend a clustering-friendly contrastive learning method\nand incorporate a contrastive analysis approach, which utilizes a reference\ndataset to separate important features from unimportant ones, into the design\nof loss functions. Conducting an experimental evaluation of image clustering\nfor three datasets with characteristic backgrounds, we show that for all\ndatasets, our method achieves higher clustering scores compared with\nconventional contrastive analysis and deep clustering methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
