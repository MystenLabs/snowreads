The bilevel program is solved using a micro\ngenetic algorithm that is enhanced with a linear program. While the genetic\nalgorithm searches over discrete hyperparameters, the linear program\nenhancement allows hyper local search over continuous hyperparameters. The\nmajor contribution in this paper is the formulation of a linear program that\nsupports fast search over continuous hyperparameters, and can be integrated\nwith any hyperparameter search technique. It can also be applied directly on\nany trained machine learning or deep learning model for the purpose of\nfine-tuning. We test the performance of the proposed approach on two datasets,\nMNIST and CIFAR-10. Our results clearly demonstrate that using the linear\nprogram enhancement offers significant promise when incorporated with any\npopulation-based approach for hyperparameter tuning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
