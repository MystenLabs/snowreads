In\nturn, we examine how players' information over each others' planned actions\ninfluences winning odds in matching pennies games, and how it incentivises the\nuse of decoys, deception, and camouflage. Across scenarios, we emphasize that\nthe decomposition of an action into (i) a preparation to act and (ii) the\nexecution of the action, allows to analyze one-shot simultaneous-move games,\nwhere players partially observe each others' contemporaneous actions.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
