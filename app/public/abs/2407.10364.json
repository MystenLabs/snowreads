The unitary addition Cayley graph of $R$, denoted\n$\\mathcal{U}(R)$, is the graph with vertex $R$, and two distinct vertices $x$\nand $y$ are adjacent if and only if $x+y$ is a unit. We determine a formula for\nthe clique number and chromatic number of such graphs when $R$ is a finite\ncommutative ring. This includes the special case when $R$ is $\\mathbb{Z}_n$,\nthe integers modulo $n$, where these parameters had been found under the\nassumption that $n$ is even, or $n$ is a power of an odd prime. Additionally,\nwe study the achromatic number of $\\mathcal{U}( \\mathbb{Z}_n )$ in the case\nthat $n$ is the product of two primes. We prove that the achromatic number of\n$\\mathcal{U} ( \\mathbb{Z}_{3q})$ is equal to $\\frac{3q+1}{2}$ when $q > 3$ is a\nprime. We also prove a lower bound that applies when $n = pq$ where $p$ and $q$\nare distinct odd primes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
