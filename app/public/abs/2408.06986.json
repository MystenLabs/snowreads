Using a clustering hierarchical algorithm,\n315 dust cloud at high Galactic latitudes are identified. Additionally, using\nthe optical and ultraviolet extinction of 4 million and 1 million stars,\nrespectively, provided by Sun et al., we derive the distances and physical\nproperties for 190 high Galactic latitude dust clouds and the ultraviolet\nexcess ratios for 165 of them. Through the study of color excess ratios, this\nwork confirms that molecular clouds with large Galactic distances and low\nextinction likely have a higher proportion of small-sized dust grains. In\naddition, clouds with well-defined distances in the catalog are used to trace\nthe local bubble, showing good consistency with the boundary of the local\nbubble from the literature.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
