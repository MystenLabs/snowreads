In this work, Ge\nQDs, pumped by an above bandgap near infrared wavelength, exhibit THz amplitude\nmodulation in the frequency range of 0.1-1.0 THz. The epitaxial Ge QDs\noutperform reference SOI substrate in THz amplitude modulation owing to higher\ncarrier generation in weakly confined dots compared to its bulk counterpart.\nThis is further corroborated using theoretical model based on the\nnon-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) method. This model enables the\ncalculation of photo carriers generated (PCG) and their confinement in the Ge\nQD region. Our model also reroutes the calculation from PCG to corresponding\nplasma frequency and hence to refractive index and THz photo-conductivity.\nMoreover, the photo-generated confined holes accumulation at the Ge QDs-Si\ninterface is elevated after optical illumination, leading to a decreased THz\nphoto-conductivity. This augmentation in THz photo-conductivity contributes to\na significant enhancement of THz modulation depth ~77% at Ge QDs-Si interfaces\ncompared to bare SOI at 0.1 THz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
