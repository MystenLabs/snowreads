This case study presents our experience using the\nonline flier distribution service Peachjar to recruit minor teenagers for an\nonline security experiment. By distributing fliers to 90 K-12 schools, we\nrecruited a diverse sample of 55 participants at an estimated cost per\nparticipant of $43.18. We discuss the benefits and drawbacks of Peachjar,\nconcluding that it can facilitate the recruitment of a geographically diverse\nsample of teens for online studies, but it requires careful design to protect\nagainst spam and may be more expensive than other online methods. We conclude\nby proposing ways of using Peachjar more effectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7knJj5T6au3wgob9gJ28jYFNy1tI9esunDbvkeQ6JIs","pdfSize":"556644"}
