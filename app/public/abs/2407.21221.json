We propose\nthe Fast Bi-level Proximal Gradient (FBi-PG) algorithm, which can be\ninterpreted as applying FISTA to a dynamic regularized composite objective\nfunction. The dynamic nature of the regularization parameters allows to achieve\nan optimal fast convergence rate of $O(1/k^{2})$ in terms of the inner\nobjective function. This is the fastest known convergence rate under no\nadditional restrictive assumptions. We also show that FBi-PG achieves\nsub-linear simultaneous rates in terms of both the inner and outer objective\nfunctions. Moreover, we show that under an H\\\"olderian type error bound\nassumption on the inner objective function, the FBi-PG algorithm converges to\nan optimal solution of the bi-level optimization problem. Finally, we present\nnumerical experiments demonstrating the performances of the proposed scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
