As highly\nprioritized targets for the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), more information\nabout the surface and atmosphere of lava planets will soon be available. In\nmost previous studies of lava planets, the system is typically assumed to be\nvigorously convecting and isentropic. This implies a magma ocean depth reaching\n$O$($10^4$--$10^5$) m, determined by the adiabats and melting curves. In this\nstudy, we aim to simulate ocean circulation and ocean depth on tidally locked\nlava worlds using an idealized 2D (x-z) model developed by the authors. Our\nsimulation results show that under zero or a small internal source, the maximum\nzonal current speed ranges from 0.1--1.0 m s$^{-1}$ and the magma ocean depth\nremains $O$(100) m, being more than 100 times shallower than that predicted in\na fully convecting system. We demonstrate that the ocean heat transport\ndivergence is consistently smaller than the stellar insolation by 1--2 orders\nof magnitude. Consequently, the impact of ocean circulation on the thermal\nphase curve of tidally locked lava worlds is minimal in observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
