By investigating samples with MOCVD-grown MoS${_2}$ channels exposed\nto atmospheric conditions, the existence of electron traps in MoS${_2}$ and at\nthe interface between the gate insulator and the thin-film MoS${_2}$ are\nrevealed. Differential conductance and capacitance data of the transistor\nchannels are plotted as 3D surfaces on a base plane spanned by the measurement\nfrequency versus the gate voltage. The existence of defects is confirmed by\ncomparison with ideal results from a theoretical model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
