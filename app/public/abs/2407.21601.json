Depending on the initial conditions in these\nenvironments, such as initial density and substructure, the distances of\nencounters between stars will differ. These encounters can also affect\njust-formed exoplanetary systems. Using N-body simulations, we show the effect\nof a single fly-by on a common type of exoplanetary system: close-in\nSuper-Earths/sub-Neptunes with or without a distant Giant planet. Even a single\nencounter can significantly modify the architecture of these exoplanetary\nsystems over their long lifetimes. We test fly-bys with different\ncharacteristics, such as distance and mass, and show how they perturb the inner\nplanets long after the encounter, leading to collisions and mutual inclination\nexcitation, which can significantly modify the observed architecture of these\nsystems in transit. We find that our initially four-planet inner systems reduce\nto three or two inner planets depending on their initial separation and that\nthe mutual inclinations of these remaining planets can be high enough to reduce\nthe number of observable, transiting planets. In our 500 Myr simulations, we\nshow that this reduction in the number of transiting planets due to stellar\nfly-bys can contribute to the observed excess of single-transit systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
