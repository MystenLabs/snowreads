To gain\ninsight into the microscopic properties of such a stochastically complex\nsystem, deterministic dynamics known as the Slicer Map and Fly-and-Die dynamics\nare used. We analytically derive the generalized position auto-correlation\nfunction of these dynamics and study the special case, the $3$-point position\ncorrelation function. For this, we derive single parameter-dependent scaling\nand compare it with the numerically estimated $3$-point position\nauto-correlation of the L\\'evy-Lorentz gas, for which the analytical expression\nis still an open question. Here we obtained a remarkable agreement between\nthem, irrespective of any functional relationship with time. Moreover, we\ndemonstrate that the position moments and the position auto-correlations of\nthese systems scale in the same fashion, provided the times are large enough\nand far enough apart. Other observables, such as velocity moments and\ncorrelations, are reported to distinguish the systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"krJOAUnkft5XjKQmOZzuP63iMk0q_CqCaybMQ3XwoDw","pdfSize":"539277"}
