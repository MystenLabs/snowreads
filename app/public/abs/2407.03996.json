We\ndevelop an analytical formalism to homogenize the spacetime crystals that\nextends the renowned Clausius-Mossotti formula to time-varying platforms. Our\nformalism shows that travelling-wave spacetime crystals can be used to engineer\na wide range of classes of nonreciprocal bianisotropic couplings in the long\nwavelength limit. In particular, our theory reveals the possibility of\nrealizing a purely isotropic Tellegen response in crystals formed by interlaced\nsub-lattices of scatterers subjected to different modulation velocities.\nFurthermore, we introduce a class of generalized Minkowskian crystals that\ndisplays invariance under arbitrary Lorentz boosts aligned with a fixed spatial\ndirection. We prove that such systems are formed by pseudo-uniaxial materials\nwith the principal axis aligned parallel to the modulation velocity. The\nelectromagnetic response of such generalized Minkowskian crystals is\nindistinguishable from that of moving photonic crystals.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
