We make his discussion mathematically\nrigorous, keeping it elementary, using his other idea. The resulting model\nleads to accurate quantitative results and allows us to derive a well-known\nformula from optics. In the process, we get acquainted with mathematical tools\nsuch as Smirnov's fermionic observables, transfer matrices, and spectral radii.\nQuantum walks and the six-vertex model arise as the next step in this\ndirection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/History and Overview","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
