These discoveries, along with the\nproposed additional emission due to inverse Compton scattering at TeV energies,\nlead us to consider suitable candidates for detection with current and future\nextensive air show (EAS) experiments at very-high-energy (VHE; 0.1 $-$ 100 TeV)\nranges. Leveraging energy spectrum data from pulsars as observed by Fermi and\nImaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Telescopes (IACTs) and considering the\nsensitivities of both LHAASO and SWGO, this study evaluates their detectability\nand estimates the time required for their significant detection. Our results\nindicate that LHAASO could detect the Crab's pulsed signal within six years,\nwhile SWGO might detect Vela's signal within one year. Observations of the most\nenergetic Fermi pulsars with EAS experiments will provide insight into the\nnature of VHE pulsar emissions, helping to clarify the primary characteristics\nof VHE pulsars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SdFAb-Quxr_t7ivs5EMbXkbbxOffiWBJPsmqHqIrWrg","pdfSize":"555129"}
