Here\nwe properly explain, demonstrate, quantify (for diamond) and explore the\npossibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on\nchanges in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband\npolarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between\nelectronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the four-wave mixing process,\ndepends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering\ngeometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such\nphenomenon in information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
