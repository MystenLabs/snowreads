In this work, we investigate two such\nrelations ($C_S = -C_P$, $C_S^\\prime = C_P^\\prime$) among the scalar and the\npseudoscalar new-physics WCs that can contribute to $b\\to s \\,\\tau \\tau $\nprocesses. We show that, even when new physics violating these relations would\nnot be measurable in the branching ratios of $B_s \\to \\tau^+ \\tau^-$ and $B\\to\nK^{(*)}\\,\\tau^+ \\tau^-$ at HL-LHC and FCC-ee, it can still manifest itself in\nthe angular distribution of $B\\to K^{*0}\\,\\tau^+ \\tau^-$. We identify the\ncombinations of angular observables in this decay channel that are sensitive to\nscenarios beyond SMEFT. We find that the two observables $S_6^c$ and $A_7$, and\ntheir combination, have the potential to identify physics beyond SMEFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
