We here consider the case of slab geometry which models\nchemotactic motion between two infinite membranes. Like previous works, we are\nparticularly interested in the asymptotic regime of high tumbling rates. We\nestablish local existence and uniqueness of solutions to the kinetic equation\nand show their convergence towards solutions of a parabolic Keller-Segel model\nin the asymptotic limit. In addition, we prove convergence rates with respect\nto the asymptotic parameter under additional regularity assumptions on the\nproblem data. Particular difficulties in our analysis are caused by vanishing\nvelocities in the kinetic model as well as the occurrence of boundary terms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MHG7m8JZyEwFtDUi_1oN9SelvjUGyyHg7zLxNR5FYlk","pdfSize":"263972"}
