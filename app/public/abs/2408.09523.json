We model\nTransformer information dynamics as a continuous PDE process, encompassing\ndiffusion, self-attention, and nonlinear residual components. Our comprehensive\nexperiments across image and text modalities demonstrate that the PDE model\neffectively captures key aspects of Transformer behavior, achieving high\nsimilarity (cosine similarity > 0.98) with Transformer attention distributions\nacross all layers. While the model excels in replicating general information\nflow patterns, it shows limitations in fully capturing complex, non-linear\ntransformations. This work provides crucial theoretical insights into\nTransformer mechanisms, offering a foundation for future optimizations in deep\nlearning architectural design. We discuss the implications of our findings,\npotential applications in model interpretability and efficiency, and outline\ndirections for enhancing PDE models to better mimic the intricate behaviors\nobserved in Transformers, paving the way for more transparent and optimized AI\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
