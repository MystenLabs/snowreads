To\naddress this problem, most existing methods attempt to find proper valid\ninstrumental variables (IVs) for the target causal effect by expert knowledge\nor by assuming that the causal model is a one-directional MR model. As such, in\nthis paper, we first theoretically investigate the identification of the\nbi-directional MR from observational data. In particular, we provide necessary\nand sufficient conditions under which valid IV sets are correctly identified\nsuch that the bi-directional MR model is identifiable, including the causal\ndirections of a pair of phenotypes (i.e., the treatment and outcome). Moreover,\nbased on the identification theory, we develop a cluster fusion-like method to\ndiscover valid IV sets and estimate the causal effects of interest. We\ntheoretically demonstrate the correctness of the proposed algorithm.\nExperimental results show the effectiveness of our method for estimating causal\neffects in bi-directional MR.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
