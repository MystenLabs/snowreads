We investigate the\neigenfunctions of the Schr\\\"odinger operators with critically singular\npotentials, and estimate the $L^p$ norms and period integrals for their\nrestriction to submanifolds. Recently, Blair-Sire-Sogge obtained global $L^p$\nbounds for Schr\\\"odinger eigenfunctions by the resolvent method. Due to the\nSobolev trace inequalities, the resolvent method cannot work for submanifolds\nof all dimensions. We get around this difficulty and establish spectral\nprojection bounds by the wave kernel techniques and the bootstrap argument\ninvolving an induction on the dimensions of the submanifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uA7OtcQtodTdlUM_Iro1TcVu3pyDuN-Zt-klJ0bM-no","pdfSize":"561229","txDigest":"Gxdcw2Cde8DwSz7DrrGXTMd2b8DuJruVqnDCZZtGMgDS","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
