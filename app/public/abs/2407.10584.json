Among these materials, hexagonal MnTe has emerged\nas a standout material candidate for its substantial spin-splitting. In this\nstudy, employing first-principles electronic structure calculations and spin\ngroup symmetry analysis, we delve into the interplay of altermagnetism and\npressure in two main phases of MnTe. Our relativistic calculations demonstrate\nthe presence of tunable anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in hexagonal MnTe. In\naddition, our results underscore the pivotal role of pressure as a tuning\nparameter for the alternative magnetic traits in the system. Furthermore, we\nidentify another phase of MnTe with orthorhombic structure, namely\n$\\gamma$-MnTe, hosting altermagnetic characteristics. We study, in detail, its\nresponse in AHE and spin-spliting due to magnetization and pressure variations,\nrespectively. Our study highlights the substantial impact of pressure on the\nproperties of alternative magnetic materials, particularly emphasizing the\npronounced tuning effect observed in the hexagonal and orthorhombic MnTe.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
