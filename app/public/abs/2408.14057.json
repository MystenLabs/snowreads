Because of\nspecial conjugate operation characteristics, time-variant complex conjugate\nmatrix equations need to be transformed into corresponding real field\ntime-variant large-scale linear equations. In this paper, zeroing neural\ndynamic models based on complex field error (called Con-CZND1) and based on\nreal field error (called Con-CZND2) are proposed for in-depth analysis.\nCon-CZND1 has fewer elements because of the direct processing of complex\nmatrices. Con-CZND2 needs to be transformed into the real field, with more\nelements, and its performance is affected by the main diagonal dominance of\ncoefficient matrices. A neural hypercomplex numbers space compressive\napproximation approach (NHNSCAA) is innovatively proposed. Then Con-CZND1 conj\nmodel is constructed. Numerical experiments verify Con-CZND1 conj model\neffectiveness and highlight NHNSCAA importance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
