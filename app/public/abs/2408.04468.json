The results show that\nthrough the coupling of waveguide and resonant cavity, a resonant peak with\nhigh Q-factor can emerge, and the frequency of which is significantly sensitive\nto the liquid parameters. Based on that, a topological-resonance SAW\nliquid-phase sensor is proposed. The results show that the formation of the\ntopological phase transition is closely related to the liquid-layer loading.\nFurthermore, by changing the thickness of the liquid-layer loading, the\noperating-frequency range of the device can be significantly expanded, which is\nvital for biomedical detecting applications. Based on which, the sensing\nperformances of topological-resonance SAW liquid-phase sensor are simulated,\nwhich are used to sensing the concentration of albumin and hemoglobin\nconcentration in blood, and high sensitivities and Q-factors can be obtained\nfor this device. The results presented in this paper can provide an important\nbasis for the realization of highly sensitive and stable SAW biomedical sensors\nin the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
