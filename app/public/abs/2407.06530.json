While conventional optimization approaches such as\nweighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) achieve suboptimal solutions for\nRSMA beamforming optimization, they are computationally demanding. A novel\napproach based on fractional programming (FP) has unveiled the optimal\nbeamforming structure (OBS) for RSMA. This method, combined with a hyperplane\nfixed point iteration (HFPI) approach, named FP-HFPI, provides suboptimal\nbeamforming solutions with identical sum rate performance but much lower\ncomputational complexity compared to WMMSE. Inspired by such an approach, in\nthis work, a novel deep unfolding framework based on FP-HFPI, named\nrate-splitting-beamforming neural network (RS-BNN), is proposed to unfold the\nFP-HFPI algorithm. Numerical results indicate that the proposed RS-BNN attains\na level of performance closely matching that of WMMSE and FP-HFPI, while\ndramatically reducing the computational complexity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
