The\nmagneto-inertial range of scales at sub-electron scales has been also briefly\ndiscussed. Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical\nparameters, the results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement\nwith the space observations in the frames of this approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
