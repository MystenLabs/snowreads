We develop an explicit combinatorial\nconstruction that computes $\\mathsf{Tev}_g^{trop} = 2^g$. We prove that these\ntropical enumerative invariants agree with their algebraic counterparts, giving\nan independent tropical computation of the algebraic degrees $Tev_g$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kRfxBQ468ctj-lvH_oZI-G8X-r6OmVWhYBfAca8LMAg","pdfSize":"460736"}
