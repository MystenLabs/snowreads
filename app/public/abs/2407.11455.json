MHP form a versatile family of point\nprocesses that models interactions between connected individuals within a\nnetwork. In this paper, the classes are discriminated by the exogenous\nintensity vector and the adjacency matrix, which encodes the strength of the\ninteractions. The observed learning data consist of labeled repeated and\nindependent paths on a fixed time interval. Besides, we consider the\nhigh-dimensional setting, meaning the dimension of the network may be large\n{\\it w.r.t.} the number of observations. We consequently require a sparsity\nassumption on the adjacency matrix. In this context, we propose a novel\nmethodology with an initial interaction recovery step, by class, followed by a\nrefitting step based on a suitable classification criterion. To recover the\nsupport of the adjacency matrix, a Lasso-type estimator is proposed, for which\nwe establish rates of convergence. Then, leveraging the estimated support, we\nbuild a classification procedure based on the minimization of a $L_2$-risk.\nNotably, rates of convergence of our classification procedure are provided. An\nin-depth testing phase using synthetic data supports both theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
