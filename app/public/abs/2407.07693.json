The derived column densities are (5.0+-1.1) x\n10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, (6.0+-0.6) x $^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$, and (2.0+-0.5) x $^{10}$\ncm$^{-2}$, respectively. This translates into fractional abundances with\nrespect to H$_2$ of (3.7+-1.0) x $10^{-13}$, (4.4+-0.8) x $10^{-13}$, and\n(1.5+-0.4) x $10^{-13}$, respectively. We have also searched for other Na-, Mg-\nand Ca-bearing species towards this source but none of them have been detected\nand thus we provide upper limits for their abundances. We discuss the possible\nchemical routes involved in the formation of these molecules containing metals\nunder interstellar conditions. Finally, we compare the ratio between\nsulfur-bearing and oxygen-bearing molecules with and without metals, finding\nthat metal-bearing sulfur molecules are much more abundant than metal-bearing\noxygen ones, in contrast with the general trend found in the ratios between\nother non metal- oxygen- and sulfur-bearing molecules. This further strengthen\nthe idea that sulfur may be little depleted in G+0.693-0.027 as a result of the\nlow velocity shocks present in this source sputtering large amounts of material\nfrom dust grains.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ov5D8I7Wecd-IllKlqPuvjjVAyg9nUwTwMfmtZL35Fo","pdfSize":"5737255","objectId":"0xd2bc1ee54bf7cdc97bb820cd682286743657485eddf304c260bf06109aaafdc2","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
