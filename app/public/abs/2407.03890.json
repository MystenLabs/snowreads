Despite this broad interest, there is a lack of UWB datasets that\nthoroughly analyze the performance of UWB ranging measurement. To address this\nissue, our paper introduces a UWB dataset that examines UWB relative pose\nfactors affecting ranging measurement. To the best of our knowledge, our\ndataset is the first to analyze these factors while rigorously providing\nprecise ground-truth UWB poses. The dataset is accessible at\nhttps://github.com/cjhhalla/RCV_uwb_dataset .\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
