In this paper, we show that these\nexecutable implementations are exactly the applications of G-semismooth Newton\nmethods for solving nonsmooth equations localized from these generalized\nequations. This new understanding expands the breadth of G-semismooth Newton\nmethods in theory, and more importantly, facilitates the design and\nimplementation of practical Newton-type algorithms for solving generalized\nequations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
