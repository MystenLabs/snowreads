While models suggest SNAs\nare common in dynamical systems, experimental observations are primarily\nlimited to systems with external forcing. We observe SNA prior to the emergence\nof periodic oscillations from chaotic fluctuations. In complex systems,\nself-organization can lead to order, and inherent nonlinearity can induce\nchaos. The occurrence of SNA, which is nonchaotic yet nonperiodic in one such\ncomplex system, is intriguing.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
