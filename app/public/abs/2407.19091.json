As\na consequence, we obtain simple characterizations of the Li-Yorke chaotic\nweighted shifts on $c_0$ and on $\\ell^p$ ($1 \\leq p < \\infty$) that complement\npreviously known results. We also investigate the notion of Li-Yorke chaos for\nweighted shifts on Fr\\'echet sequence spaces. As applications, we obtain\ncharacterizations of the Li-Yorke chaotic weighted shifts on K\\\"othe sequence\nspaces depending only on the entries of the K\\\"othe matrix and the weights of\nthe shift.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
