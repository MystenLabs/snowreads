In this model, a learner has access to a set of labeled quantum\nsamples as the training set. The objective is to find a quantum measurement\nthat predicts the label of the unseen samples. The hardness of learning is\nmeasured via sample complexity under a quantum counterpart of the well-known\nprobably approximately correct (PAC). Quantum sample complexity is expected to\nbe higher than classical one, because of the measurement incompatibility and\nstate collapse. Recent efforts showed that the sample complexity of learning a\nfinite quantum concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ scales as $O(|\\mathcal{C}|)$. This\nis significantly higher than the classical sample complexity that grows\nlogarithmically with the class size. This work improves the sample complexity\nbound to $O(V_{\\mathcal{C}^*} \\log |\\mathcal{C}^*|)$, where $\\mathcal{C}^*$ is\nthe set of extreme points of the convex closure of $\\mathcal{C}$ and\n$V_{\\mathcal{C}^*}$ is the shadow-norm of this set. We show the tightness of\nour bound for the class of bounded Hilbert-Schmidt norm, scaling as $O(\\log\n|\\mathcal{C}^*|)$. Our approach is based on a new quantum empirical risk\nminimization (ERM) algorithm equipped with a shadow tomography method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
