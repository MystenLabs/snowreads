Their superiority over alternative Anderson acceleration is\ndemonstrated for linear contraction mappings. Both strategies perform well in\nthree nonlinear fixed-point applications that include partial differential\nequations and the EM algorithm. One strategy surpasses all other Anderson\nacceleration implementations tested in terms of computation time across various\nspecifications, including composite Anderson acceleration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
