Explanations in recommender systems\nhelp users understand why such recommendations have been generated, which in\nturn makes the system more transparent and promotes users' trust and\nsatisfaction. In recent years, explaining recommendations has drawn increasing\nattention from both academia and from industry. In this paper, we present a\nuser study to investigate context-aware explanations in recommender systems. In\nparticular, we build a web-based questionnaire that is able to interact with\nusers: generating and explaining recommendations. With this questionnaire, we\ninvestigate the effects of context-aware explanations in terms of efficiency,\neffectiveness, persuasiveness, satisfaction, trust and transparency through a\nuser study. Besides, we propose a novel method based on fuzzy synthetic\nevaluation for aggregating these metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
