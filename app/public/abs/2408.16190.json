Typical estimation approaches include optical\nflow (OF), which approximates the apparent motion instantaneously in a scene,\nand multiple object tracking (MOT), which tracks the motion of subjects over\ntime. Often, the motion of objects in a scene is governed by some underlying\ndynamical system which could be inferred by analyzing the motion of groups of\nobjects. Standard motion analyses, however, are not designed to intuit flow\ndynamics from trajectory data, making such measurements difficult in practice.\nThe goal of this work is to extend gradient-based dynamical systems analyses to\nreal-world applications characterized by complex, feature-rich image sequences\nwith imperfect tracers. The tracer trajectories are tracked using deep vision\nnetworks and gradients are approximated using Lagrangian gradient regression\n(LGR), a tool designed to estimate spatial gradients from sparse data. From\ngradients, dynamical features such as regions of coherent rotation and\ntransport barriers are identified. The proposed approach is affordably\nimplemented and enables advanced studies including the motion analysis of two\ndistinct object classes in a single image sequence. Two examples of the method\nare presented on data sets for which standard gradient-based analyses do not\napply.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
