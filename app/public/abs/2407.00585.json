Attackers posing as\ndiagnostic services or accessing the CAN bus can threaten the drivers' location\nprivacy to know the exact location at a certain point in time or to infer the\nvisited areas. This represents a serious threat to users' privacy, but also an\nadvantage for police investigations to gather location-based evidence. In this\npaper, we present On Path Diagnostic - Intrusion \\& Inference (OPD-II), a novel\npath inference attack leveraging a physical car model and a map matching\nalgorithm to infer the path driven by a car based on CAN bus data. Differently\nfrom available attacks, our approach only requires the attacker to know the\ninitial location and heading of the victim's car and is not limited by the\navailability of training data, road configurations, or the need to access other\nvictim's devices (e.g., smartphones). We implement our attack on a set of four\ndifferent cars and a total number of 41 tracks in different road and traffic\nscenarios. We achieve an average of 95% accuracy on reconstructing the\ncoordinates of the recorded path by leveraging a dynamic map-matching algorithm\nthat outperforms the 75% and 89% accuracy values of other proposals while\nremoving their set of assumptions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
