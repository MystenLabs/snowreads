Motivated by the Koornwinder orthogonal\npolynomials on the triangle, we introduce a Koornwinder W-system. Once\ndiscretised by this W-system, the resulting spatial differentiation matrix is\nskew symmetric, affording important advantages insofar as stability and\nconservation of structure are concerned. We analyse the construction of the\ndifferentiation matrix and matrix vector multiplication, demonstrating optimal\ncomputational cost. Numerical convergence is illustrated through experiments\nwith different parameter choices. As a result, our method exhibits key\ncharacteristics of a practical spectral method, inclusive of rapid convergence,\nfast computation and the preservation of structure of the underlying partial\ndifferential equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
