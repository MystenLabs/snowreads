We establish several explicit lower and upper\nbounds. The main results correspond to two asymptotic forms expressed by means\nof the Lambert $W$ function. As an application, some straightforward elementary\nbounds are derived. Additionally, an absolute convergence rate of the ratio of\nthe consecutive Bell numbers is derived. The main challenge was to obtain\nsatisfactory constants, as the Bell numbers grow rapidly, while the convergence\nrates are rather slow.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
