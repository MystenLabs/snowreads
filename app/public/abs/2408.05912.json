Speculatively executed instructions on the wrong path can\nsignificantly change cache state, depending on speculation levels. Architects\noften employ trace-driven simulation models in the design exploration stage,\nwhich sacrifice precision for speed. Trace-driven simulators are orders of\nmagnitude faster than execution-driven models, reducing the often hundreds of\nthousands of simulation hours needed to explore new micro-architectural ideas.\nDespite this strong benefit of trace-driven simulation, these often fail to\nadequately model the consequences of wrong path because obtaining them is\nnontrivial. Prior works consider either a positive or negative impact of wrong\npath but not both. Here, we examine wrong path execution in simulation results\nand design a set of infrastructure for enabling wrong-path execution in a trace\ndriven simulator. Our analysis shows the wrong path affects structures on both\nthe instruction and data sides extensively, resulting in performance variations\nranging from $-3.05$\\% to $20.9$\\% when ignoring wrong path. To benefit the\nresearch community and enhance the accuracy of simulators, we opened our traces\nand tracing utility in the hopes that industry can provide wrong-path traces\ngenerated by their internal simulators, enabling academic simulation without\nexposing industry IP.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
