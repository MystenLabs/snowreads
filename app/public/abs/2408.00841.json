As a consequence, the\nmagnetic phase displays an altermagnetic character, i.e. a finite\n(non-relativistic) Zeeman splitting of the electronic excitations, despite the\nabsence of a net magnetization. By means of a variational Monte Carlo approach\nbased on Jastrow-Slater wave functions, which accounts for electronic\ncorrelations beyond the single-particle approximation, we study how $d$-wave\naltermagnetism shows up in the ground state properties and in the spectral\nfunction of the system. We characterize the metal-insulator transition between\naltermagnetic phases at half-filling and the stability of altermagnetism as a\nfunction of doping. The calculation of the single-particle spectral function\ndisplays the spin-split nature of the electronic excitations, also within the\nMott insulating regime. We discuss possible realizations of the model in the\ncontext of organic $\\alpha$- or $\\kappa$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X charge transfer salts.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
