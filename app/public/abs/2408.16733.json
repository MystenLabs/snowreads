A tripod in $D$ is a subgraph consisting of\nthe union of two $S$-$T$-paths that have distinct start-vertices and the same\nend-vertex, and are disjoint apart from sharing a suffix.\n  We prove that tripods in directed graphs exhibit the Erd\\H{o}s-P\\'osa\nproperty. More precisely, there is a function $f\\colon \\mathbb{N}\\to\n\\mathbb{N}$ such that for every digraph $D$ with sources $S$ and sinks $T$, if\n$D$ does not contain $k$ vertex-disjoint tripods, then there is a set of at\nmost $f(k)$ vertices that meets all the tripods in $D$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
