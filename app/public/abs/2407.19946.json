In this work, we focus on a variant of this problem\nwhere the underlying formula is expressed in the Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF),\nalso known as #DNF. This problem has been shown to be #P-complete, making it\noften intractable to solve exactly. Much research has therefore focused on\nobtaining approximate solutions, particularly in the form of $(\\varepsilon,\n\\delta)$ approximations.\n  The primary contribution of this paper is a new approach, called pepin, an\napproximate #DNF counter that significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art\napproaches. Our work is based on the recent breakthrough in the context of the\nunion of sets in the streaming model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach through extensive experiments and show that it provides an affirmative\nanswer to the challenge of efficiently computing #DNF.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
