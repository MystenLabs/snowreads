The search is based on proton-proton\ncollision data collected in 2016-2018 at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV with\nthe CMS detector at the LHC, and corresponding to an integrated luminosity of\n138 fb$^{-1}$. Events containing a pair of leptons with the same-sign electric\ncharge and at least one jet are considered. The results are used to constrain\nthe branching fraction ($\\mathcal{B}$) of the top quark decaying to a Higgs\nboson and an up (u) or charm (c) quark. No significant excess above the\nestimated background was found. The observed (expected) upper limits at 95%\nconfidence level are found to be 0.072% (0.059%) for $\\mathcal{B}$(t $\\to$ Hu)\nand 0.043% (0.062%) for $\\mathcal{B}$(t $\\to$ Hc). These results are combined\nwith two other searches performed by the CMS Collaboration for flavor-changing\nneutral current interactions of top quarks and Higgs bosons in final states\nwith a pair of photons or of bottom quarks. The resulting observed (expected)\nupper limits at 95% confidence level are 0.019% (0.027%) for $\\mathcal{B}$(t\n$\\to$ Hu) and 0.037% (0.035%) for $\\mathcal{B}$(t $\\to$ Hc). These results\nconstitute the most stringent limits on these branching fractions to date.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BiKYbsLzpXrGNfRiYvmeH3Z82fHpD9NQKelmhiRgiqc","pdfSize":"2565727"}
