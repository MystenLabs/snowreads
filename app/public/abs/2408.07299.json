Whereas in most\napplications of Lie-transform perturbation such gauge functions must be\napproximately solved from some partial differential equations, our scheme,\ncharacterized by a staggered determination of the generating vectors, naturally\nproduces the gauge functions through explicit integral over the gyro-angle,\nleaving no unaccountable error of high order in all the succeeding\ntransformations. Based on such scheme, a formalism of guiding-center\ntransformation has been derived in a unified manner retaining the effects of\nthe strong ExB shearing as well as those of electromagnetic fluctuations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
