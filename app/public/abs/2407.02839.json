In this\npaper, we use Quantum Annealers to address the feature selection problem in\nrecommendation algorithms. This feature selection problem is a Quadratic\nUnconstrained Binary Optimization(QUBO) problem. By incorporating\nCounterfactual Analysis, we significantly improve the performance of the\nitem-based KNN recommendation algorithm compared to using pure Mutual\nInformation. Extensive experiments have demonstrated that the use of\nCounterfactual Analysis holds great promise for addressing such problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
