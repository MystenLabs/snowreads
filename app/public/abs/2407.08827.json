However, there is a current lack of\nstatistical guidance for the design and analysis of such surveys. The only\nexisting method is a Monte Carlo procedure which is difficult to interpret,\ncomputationally intensive, and lacks available open-source code for its\nimplementation. We provide an alternative method by framing methane surveys in\nthe context of multi-stage sampling designs. We contribute estimators of the\ntotal emissions along with variance estimators which do not require simulation,\nas well as stratum-level total estimators. We show that the variance\ncontribution from each stage of sampling can be estimated to inform the design\nof future surveys. We also introduce a more efficient modification of the\nestimator. Finally, we propose combining the multi-stage approach with a simple\nMonte Carlo procedure to model measurement error. The resulting methods are\ninterpretable and require minimal computational resources. We apply the methods\nto aerial survey data of oil and gas facilities in British Columbia, Canada, to\nestimate the methane emissions in the province. An R package is provided to\nfacilitate the use of the methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"zMa5mY6CRyqd3YgZV1xhl0maIGG6Ll6eb1YkZyOZFe0","pdfSize":"1786331"}
