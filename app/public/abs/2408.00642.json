First, we propose the quota lawn mowing problem, an\nextension of the classic lawn mowing problem in computational geometry, as\nfollows: given a quota of coverage, compute the shortest lawn mowing route to\nachieve said quota. We give constant-factor approximations for the quota lawn\nmowing problem.\n  Second, we investigate the expected detection time minimization problem in\ngeometric coverage path planning with local, continuous sensory information. We\nprovide the first approximation algorithm with provable error bounds with\npseudopolynomial running time. Our ideas also extend to another search\nmechanism, namely visibility-based search, which is related to the watchman\nroute problem. We complement our theoretical analysis with some simple but\neffective heuristics for finding an object in minimum expected time, on which\nwe provide simulation results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
