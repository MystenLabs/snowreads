In this\nscheme, counterterms for mixing angles of the Higgs bosons are determined by\nusing the decay rates of the discovered Higgs boson $h$, $i.e.$, $h \\to\n\\tau^+\\tau^-$ and $h \\to ZZ^* \\to Z\\ell^+\\ell^-$ at next leading order (NLO)\ninstead of using the renormalized two-point functions which are adopted in the\nprevious scheme. We require that the decay rates at NLO are determined to be\nthe corresponding predictions at NLO in the Standard Model (SM) times square of\nthe scaling factor which describes the deviation of $h$ couplings at tree level\nfrom the SM value. The mixing angles then maintain the meaning of the\n``alignmentness\", $i.e.$, how the properties of $h$ are close to the SM\npredictions, while they lose such meaning in the previous scheme. We compare\nthe predictions of the decay rates at NLO given in the new scheme and those in\nthe previous scheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
