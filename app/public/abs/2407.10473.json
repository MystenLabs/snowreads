While language containment is trace inclusion, and the (fair)\nsimulation preorder coincides with tree inclusion, strategic dominance falls\nstrictly between the two and can be characterized as \"strategy inclusion\"\nbetween A and B: every strategy that resolves the nondeterminism of A is\ndominated by a strategy that resolves the nondeterminism of B. Strategic\ndominance can be checked in 2-ExpTime by a decidable first-order Presburger\nlogic with quantification over words and strategies, called resolver logic. We\ngive several other applications of resolver logic, including checking the\nco-safety, co-liveness, and history-determinism of boolean and quantitative\nautomata, and checking the inclusion between hyperproperties that are specified\nby nondeterministic boolean and quantitative automata.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5AvChkVnKnb_aEV8yHDjDJGLA-KVmVSBpf6X0F4KKDA","pdfSize":"886118"}
