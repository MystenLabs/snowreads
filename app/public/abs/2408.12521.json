Disclosure risk measures are\nstatistical measures meant to quantify how big such a risk is for a specific\ndataset. One of the most common measures is the number of sample unique values\nthat are also population-unique. \\cite{Man12} have shown how mixed membership\nmodels can provide very accurate estimates of this measure. A limitation of\nthat approach is that the number of extreme profiles has to be chosen by the\nmodeller. In this article, we propose a non-parametric version of the model,\nbased on the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process (HDP). The proposed approach does\nnot require any tuning parameter or model selection step and provides accurate\nestimates of the disclosure risk measure, even with samples as small as 1$\\%$\nof the population size. Moreover, a data augmentation scheme to address the\npresence of structural zeros is presented. The proposed methodology is tested\non a real dataset from the New York census.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GDFrzzdX7eNcXrdTaCMwmM6Ses41f4SR8LJ94MDFt34","pdfSize":"1242173"}
