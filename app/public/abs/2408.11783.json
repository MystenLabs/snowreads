For films with thickness $h \\gtrsim 200$ nm, the rejuvenation\nof vapour deposited stable PS glass films follow behaviour well-documented for\nother stable glasses. For films with thickness $h \\lesssim 160$nm the behaviour\nof the vapour deposited films becomes more complicated. This behaviour is\ncharacterized for different film thicknesses. The results are compared with\nvapour deposited films that are aged after rejuvenation or spincast and aged.\nCollectively, the results of these studies strongly suggest two distinct\nmechanisms that can result in rejuvenation, and hence two distinct relaxation\nprocesses that can couple to the material density. The two physical mechanisms\ncan provide insight into poorly understood or apparently contradictory aspects\nof $T_g$ measurements in thin PS films.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cqmCu6FkdVaysFUG5g3CYbStt57EijkQ9MTdfc6gJ_k","pdfSize":"11021016"}
