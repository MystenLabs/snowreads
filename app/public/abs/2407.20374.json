McMullen asks for which $n$ these functions are congruence,\nthat is, when they only depend on the image of the cusp $c \\in\n\\mathbf{P}^1(\\mathcal{O})$ in $\\mathbf{P}^1(\\mathcal{O}/d)$ for some integer\n$d$. In this note, we answer McMullen's questions. We obtain our results by\ncomputing the exact closure of $\\Delta_n \\subset \\mathrm{SL}_2({\\mathcal{O}})$\ninside $\\mathrm{SL}_2(\\widehat{{\\mathcal{O}}})$, where\n$\\widehat{{\\mathcal{O}}}$ is the profinite completion of ${\\mathcal{O}}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
