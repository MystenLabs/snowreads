We also\nidentify which among them are Hopf skew-braces. Then we determine when two Hopf\nq-brace structures on rank one pointed Hopf algebras are isomorphic, and,\nfinally, we compute all the weak braiding operators on these Hopf algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
