A powerful approach for this is\nconformal prediction, which has several practical benefits due to\nmodel-agnostic finite-sample guarantees. Yet, existing methods for conformal\nprediction of causal effects are limited to binary/discrete treatments and make\nhighly restrictive assumptions such as known propensity scores. In this work,\nwe provide a novel conformal prediction method for potential outcomes of\ncontinuous treatments. We account for the additional uncertainty introduced\nthrough propensity estimation so that our conformal prediction intervals are\nvalid even if the propensity score is unknown. Our contributions are\nthree-fold: (1) We derive finite-sample prediction intervals for potential\noutcomes of continuous treatments. (2) We provide an algorithm for calculating\nthe derived intervals. (3) We demonstrate the effectiveness of the conformal\nprediction intervals in experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets. To\nthe best of our knowledge, we are the first to propose conformal prediction for\ncontinuous treatments when the propensity score is unknown and must be\nestimated from data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
