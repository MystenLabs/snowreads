There are six possible phase transition processes between\nthe three different stable states (small, medium, and large black hole states).\nDuring these phase transitions, there are two key temperatures. One is the\ntemperature at which the medium black hole state emerges, and the other is the\ntemperature at which the small black hole state annihilates. Meanwhile, two\ndynamic equilibrium processes are formed. One is a dynamic equilibrium of the\ntransition from the medium black hole state to the large black hole state and\nthe transition from the small black hole state to the medium black hole state.\nThe other is a dynamic equilibrium of the transition from the small black hole\nstate to the medium black hole state and the transition from the medium black\nhole state to the small black hole state.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
