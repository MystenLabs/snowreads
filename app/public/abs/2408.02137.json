Our framework allows for tractability, quantifying the amount of\nadditional information, and permits the description of the smallness and the\nstability with respect to small perturbations of the weak information. We\nprovide sharp conditions for the stability with counterexamples. The results\nrely on a theorem of independent interest on the stability of the optimal\ninvestment problem with respect to small changes in the physical probability\nmeasure. We also investigate contingent claims that are indifference price\ninvariant with respect to changes in weak information. We show that, in\nincomplete models, the class of information-invariant claims includes the\nreplicable claims, and it can be strictly bigger. In particular, in complete\nmodels, all contingent claims are information invariant. We augment the results\nwith examples and counterexamples.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
