These challenges stem from three primary issues: the difficulty in\nidentifying grounded sequences of steps to achieve a goal; the lack of a\nstandardized mapping between high-level actions and low-level commands; and the\nchallenge of maintaining low computational overhead given the limited resources\nof robotic hardware. We introduce EMPOWER, a framework designed for\nopen-vocabulary online grounding and planning for embodied agents aimed at\naddressing these issues. By leveraging efficient pre-trained foundation models\nand a multi-role mechanism, EMPOWER demonstrates notable improvements in\ngrounded planning and execution. Quantitative results highlight the\neffectiveness of our approach, achieving an average success rate of 0.73 across\nsix different real-life scenarios using a TIAGo robot.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DEZU2I9i_8BwBIEzg94I9Xwa_Nv_uj_LlD5wwr13XoE","pdfSize":"5670444"}
