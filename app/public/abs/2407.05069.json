We analyze the game using Markov\nchain and Monte Carlo methods. We compute the expected game length for two to\neight players and determine the probability of winning for each player in the\ngame. We discuss the surprising conclusions of which players have the highest\nand lowest chance of winning, and we propose a small rule change that makes the\ngame a little more fair.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
