To study\nthis, we set up a minimal model consisting of two particle reservoirs of the\nsame finite carrying capacity connected by two equally sized anti-parallel\nasymmetric exclusion processes (TASEP). We focus on the steady-state currents\nand particle density profiles in the two TASEP lanes. The ensuing phases and\nthe phase diagrams, which can be remarkably complex, are parametrized by the\nmodel parameters defining particle exchange between the TASEP lanes and the\nreservoirs and the filling fraction of the particles that determine the total\nresources available. These parameters may be tuned to make the densities of the\ntwo TASEP lanes globally uniform or piece-wise continuous in the form of a\ncombination of a single localized domain wall and a spatially constant density\nor a pair of delocalized domain walls. Our model reveals that the two\nreservoirs can be preferentially populated or depopulated in the steady states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-O5UFQmk0ftAAuQJ81niQUMBcJTYF6Qgu_sQNoy7iTg","pdfSize":"476768"}
