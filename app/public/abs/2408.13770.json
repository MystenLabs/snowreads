However, the promising\nreconstruction performance of existing G-3DGS methods relies heavily on\naccurate multi-view feature matching, which is quite challenging. Especially\nfor the scenes that have many non-overlapping areas between various views and\ncontain numerous similar regions, the matching performance of existing methods\nis poor and the reconstruction precision is limited. To address this problem,\nwe develop a strategy that utilizes a predicted depth confidence map to guide\naccurate local feature matching. In addition, we propose to utilize the\nknowledge of existing monocular depth estimation models as prior to boost the\ndepth estimation precision in non-overlapping areas between views. Combining\nthe proposed strategies, we present a novel G-3DGS method named TranSplat,\nwhich obtains the best performance on both the RealEstate10K and ACID\nbenchmarks while maintaining competitive speed and presenting strong\ncross-dataset generalization ability.
