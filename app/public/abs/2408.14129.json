The question of whether evaporation could lead\nto specific phase separation at the liquid interface and eventually to the\nformation of patterns in small liquid volumes remains unaddressed. In this\nstudy, we investigated the liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) of an organic\npolymeric monomer in a salt-containing buffer within an evaporating sessile\ndroplet. We observed that LLPS occurs at the dynamic interface of the droplet\nand leads to the formation of polymeric coacervates or regular lattice patterns\ndepending on the initial concentration of the polymer. Our results show that\nthe interaction of salt with the polymeric monomers at the droplet interface\ncan lead to LLPS and the formation of regular patterns. This study suggests\nthat the sessile droplet setup can be utilized to achieve very regular patterns\nas a result of LLPS.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
