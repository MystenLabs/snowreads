We\ncalculate ${\\sigma_{red}}^{b\\overline{b}}$ and ${F_2}^{b\\overline{b}}$ in the\n$k_t$-factorization formalism by using the integral form of the\nKimber-Martin-Ryskin and Martin-Ryskin-Watt unintegrated parton distribution\nfunction with the angular ordering constraint ($AOC$) and the MMHT2014 PDF set\nas the input. Recently Guiot and van Hameren demonstrated that the upper limit,\n$K_{max}$, of the transverse-momentum integration performed in the\n$k_t$-factorization formalism should be almost equal to Q, where Q is the hard\nscale, otherwise it leads to an overestimation of the proton structure function\n($F_2(x, Q^2)$). In the present work, we show that $k_{max}$ cannot be equal Q\nat low and moderate energy region, and also by considering the gluon and quark\ncontributions to the same perturbative order and a physical gauge for the\ngluon, i. e., $A^\\mu q^{\\prime}_\\mu=0$ in the calculation of\n${F_2}^{b\\overline{b}}$ in the $k_t$-factorization formalism, we do not\nencounter any overestimation of the theoretical predictions due to different\nchoices of $K_{max}>Q$. Finally, the resulted ${\\sigma_{red}}^{b\\overline{b}}$\nand ${F_2}^{b\\overline{b}}$ are compared to the experimental data and the\ntheoretical predictions. In general, the extracted\n${\\sigma_{red}}^{b\\overline{b}}$ and ${F_2}^{b\\overline{b}}$ based on the KMR\nand MRW approaches are in perfect agreement with the experimental data and\ntheoretical predictions at high energies, but at low and moderate energies, the\none developed from the KMR approach has better consistency than that of MRW\napproach.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
