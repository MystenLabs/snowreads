Implicit communication is considered\nmore desirable in teaming situations that requires reduced interruptions for\nimproved fluency. In this paper, we investigate another unique advantage of\nimplicit communication: its ability to manipulate the perception of object or\nbehavior of interest. When communication results in the perception of an object\nor behavior to deviate from other information (about the object or behavior)\navailable via observation, it introduces a discrepancy between perception and\nobservation. We show that such a discrepancy in visual perception can benefit\nhuman-robot interaction in a controlled manner and introduce an approach\nreferred to as active shadowing (ASD). Through user studies, we demonstrate the\neffectiveness of active shadowing in creating a misaligned perception of the\nrobot's behavior and its execution in the real-world, resulting in more\nefficient task completion without sacrificing its understandability. We also\nanalyze conditions under which such visual manipulation is effective.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"051-rKry3fJIajKO_7W5D80S5J7DBc8PbXejAiV_f_4","pdfSize":"11610788"}
