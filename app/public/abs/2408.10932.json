This\nsurvey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications\nand frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity,\nmulti-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an\nintriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and\nRL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning\nmethods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions.\nThis survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative\nFinance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and\ncritique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p7mlGRdoEqwavE6uf9Eqh1qpdrDXhbOARLjQT9BosUM","pdfSize":"1261604"}
