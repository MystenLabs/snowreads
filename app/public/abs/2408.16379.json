While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel\nat modeling and forecasting spatio-temporal data, they often lack the ability\nto directly incorporate underlying physical laws. This work presents TG-PhyNN,\na novel Temporal Graph Physics-Informed Neural Network framework. TG-PhyNN\nleverages the power of GNNs for graph-based modeling while simultaneously\nincorporating physical constraints as a guiding principle during training. This\nis achieved through a two-step prediction strategy that enables the calculation\nof physical equation derivatives within the GNN architecture. Our findings\ndemonstrate that TG-PhyNN significantly outperforms traditional forecasting\nmodels (e.g., GRU, LSTM, GAT) on real-world spatio-temporal datasets like\nPedalMe (traffic flow), COVID-19 spread, and Chickenpox outbreaks. These\ndatasets are all governed by well-defined physical principles, which TG-PhyNN\neffectively exploits to offer more reliable and accurate forecasts in various\ndomains where physical processes govern the dynamics of data. This paves the\nway for improved forecasting in areas like traffic flow prediction, disease\noutbreak prediction, and potentially other fields where physics plays a crucial\nrole.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
