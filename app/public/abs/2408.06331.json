With its inherent\ndecentralization and immutability, blockchain offers itself as a potential\nsolution for these requirements. However, the practicality of incorporating\nblockchain into real-time sensor data storage systems is a topic that demands\nin-depth examination. While blockchain promises unmatched data security and\nauditability, some intrinsic qualities, namely scalability restrictions,\ntransactional delays, and escalating storage demands, impede its seamless\ndeployment in high-frequency, voluminous data contexts typical of real-time\nsensors. This essay launches a methodical investigation into these\ndifficulties, illuminating their underlying causes, potential effects, and\npotential countermeasures. In addition, we present a novel pragmatic\nexperimental setup and analysis of blockchain for smart system applications,\nwith an extended discussion of the benefits and disadvantages of deploying\nblockchain based solutions for smart system ecosystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
