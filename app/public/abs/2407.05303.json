We use the method of Kac and\nWard. The novel aspect is that the coupling constants may have negative signs.\nWe describe the logarithmic singularity of the specific heat of the classical\nmodel and the validity of the Cimasoni--Duminil-Copin--Li formula for the\ncritical temperature. We also discuss the quantum phase transition of the\nquantum model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
