The technique we apply is\nlargely inspired by the works of X. Zhong, where the $q$-Laplacian was studied\nin the Heinsenberg group and the H\\\"older regularity of gradient was proved.\nDue to the degeneracy of the present equation, this regularity of the gradient\nis not even known in the Euclidean setting, and only its boundedness is\nexpected.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
