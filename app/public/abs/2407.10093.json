A variable grid is adopted to\ncapture more details and information in the area nearby the wall. The\nNavier-Stokes equation is rewritten as a particular form suitable to the\nvariable grids. In simulation, Reynolds number is set 100 as an example. The\nvelocity, vorticity and streamline contour are produced by the CFD scheme\ndeveloped in this paper and then are compared with those by Ghia et. al. (1982)\nto validate this numerical scheme. It shows that the numerical CFD scheme\ndeveloped in this paper works very well for both uniform grids and variable\ngrids. The numerical tests with different grids setting show that a) the\nvariable grids have advantages in capturing the reversed flow and separation\nbubbles produced in the corners associated with a good efficiency, b) the\nnumerical schemes with symmetric and dense grids gives a more accurate solution\nthan those with non-symmetric and sparse grids, and c) both the vorticity and\nstream function have a better accuracy than velocity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UTwr8mOk_rDCI91PVQTMOv3C_cC4OmQzZv3TI8lNaFQ","pdfSize":"1231973"}
