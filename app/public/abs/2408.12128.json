{"id":"2408.12128","title":"Diffusion-Based Visual Art Creation: A Survey and New Perspectives","authors":"Bingyuan Wang, Qifeng Chen, Zeyu Wang","authorsParsed":[["Wang","Bingyuan",""],["Chen","Qifeng",""],["Wang","Zeyu",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 22 Aug 2024 04:49:50 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-23","timestamp":1724302190000,"abstract":"  The integration of generative AI in visual art has revolutionized not only\nhow visual content is created but also how AI interacts with and reflects the\nunderlying domain knowledge. This survey explores the emerging realm of\ndiffusion-based visual art creation, examining its development from both\nartistic and technical perspectives. We structure the survey into three phases,\ndata feature and framework identification, detailed analyses using a structured\ncoding process, and open-ended prospective outlooks. Our findings reveal how\nartistic requirements are transformed into technical challenges and highlight\nthe design and application of diffusion-based methods within visual art\ncreation. We also provide insights into future directions from technical and\nsynergistic perspectives, suggesting that the confluence of generative AI and\nart has shifted the creative paradigm and opened up new possibilities. By\nsummarizing the development and trends of this emerging interdisciplinary area,\nwe aim to shed light on the mechanisms through which AI systems emulate and\npossibly, enhance human capacities in artistic perception and creativity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
