Each entry in the\ndataset contains a text sample and corresponding labels that indicate the start\nand end positions of propaganda techniques within the text. Tokens falling\nwithin a labeled span were assigned \"B\" (Begin) or \"I\" (Inside), \"O\",\ncorresponding to the specific propaganda technique. Using attention masks, we\ncreated uniform lengths for each span and assigned BIO tags to each token based\non the provided labels. Then, we used AraBERT-base pre-trained model for Arabic\ntext tokenization and embeddings with a token classification layer to identify\npropaganda techniques. Our training process involves a two-phase fine-tuning\napproach. First, we train only the classification layer for a few epochs,\nfollowed by full model fine-tuning, updating all parameters. This methodology\nallows the model to adapt to the specific characteristics of the propaganda\ndetection task while leveraging the knowledge captured by the pre-trained\nAraBERT model. Our approach achieved an F1 score of 0.2774, securing the 3rd\nposition in the leaderboard of Task 1.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wtHhpk2nUTQheqH10I_QuOj9eipK3q_rMm1slMJXXE4","pdfSize":"494991"}
