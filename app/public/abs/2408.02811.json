REGAI uses rubrics,\nwhich can be created manually or automatically by the system, to enhance the\nperformance of LLMs for evaluation purposes. REGAI improves on the performance\nof both classical LLMs and RAG-based LLM techniques. This paper describes\nREGAI, presents data regarding its performance and discusses several possible\napplication areas for the technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
