It is assumed that there can be a\njump of finite step size in all possible directions such that the probability\nof simultaneous transition in more than one direction is zero. Such processes\nare of interest as their transition probability matrix is diagonalizable under\nsuitable conditions. Thus, their $k$-step transition probabilities can be\nefficiently obtained. For GBDP on two-dimensional finite grid, we obtain a\nsufficient and necessary condition for the vertical and horizontal transition\nprobability matrices to commute. Later, we extend these results to the case of\n$q$-dimensional finite grid. We obtain the minimum number of constraints\nrequired on transition probabilities that ensure the commutation of transition\nprobability matrices for each possible direction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
