Either annealing under\nsulfur-deficient conditions at progressively higher temperatures or deposition\nof increasing amounts of Nb at elevated temperature result in phase-pure\nNb$_{5/3}$S$_3$-2D followed by Nb$_2$S$_3$-2D. The materials are characterized\nby scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy and X-ray\nphotoemission spectroscopy. The experimental assessment combined with\nsystematic density functional theory calculations reveals their structure. The\n2D materials are covalently bound without any van der Waals gap. Their stacking\nsequence and structure are at variance with expectations based on corresponding\nbulk materials highlighting the importance of surface and interface effects in\nstructure formation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
