The uniqueness of solutions is ensured by the well-known weak\nmaximum principle. We introduce a novel approach to demonstrate the existence\nof a solution using harmonic polynomials that converge uniformly to a solution.\nSpecifically, we rigorously derive the convergence rate of the harmonic\npolynomials and show that smoother boundary data and proximity of the target\npoint to the disk's origin accelerate the convergence. Additionally, we obtain\nuniform estimates for the derivatives of solutions of arbitrary orders,\ncontrolled by $L^1$-boundary data. Notably, the constants in our estimates are\nsignificantly improved compared to existing results. Furthermore, we provide an\nenhanced radius of convergence for Taylor's series of the solution at each\npoint in the open disk.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
