All gas planets in our solar system, the Sun,\nand many stars show a pattern of east- or westward mean flows. This phenomenon\nis known as differential rotation in the stellar and as zonal jets in the\nplanetary context. Observations, laboratory experiments and simulations show\nthat the zonal flow kinetic energy scales like $\\ell^{-5}$, where $\\ell$ is the\nspherical harmonic degree (which is effectively a latitudinal wave number).\nHere, we analyze observation of the Sun, as well as simulations of the dynamics\nin Saturn and in the outer atmosphere of an ultra-hot Jupiter. While these\nsystems are very different, they all develop strong zonal winds that obey the\n$\\ell^{-5}$ scaling. Our results strongly suggest that there is a simple common\nmechanism that shapes zonal mean flows in planets and stars independent of the\nflow driving.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
