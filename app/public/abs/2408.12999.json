This led to the rise of multicore CPU\narchitectures, which are now commonplace in modern computers at all scales. In\nthis chapter, we discuss the evolution of multicore CPUs since their\nintroduction. Starting with a historic overview of multiprocessing, we explore\nthe basic microarchitecture of a multicore CPU, key challenges resulting from\nshared memory resources, operating system modifications to optimize multicore\nCPU support, popular metrics for multicore evaluation, and recent trends in\nmulticore CPU design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
