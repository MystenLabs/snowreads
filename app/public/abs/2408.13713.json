However, given the high cost and limited availability\nof quantum resources, delegating VQAs via cloud networks is a more practical\nsolution for clients with limited quantum capabilities. Recently, Shingu et\nal.[Physical Review A, 105, 022603 (2022)] proposed a variational secure cloud\nquantum computing protocol, utilizing ancilla-driven quantum computation (ADQC)\nfor cloud-based VQAs with minimal quantum resource consumption. However, their\nprotocol lacks verifiability, which exposes it to potential malicious behaviors\nby the server. Additionally, channel loss requires frequent re-delegation as\nthe size of the delegated variational circuit grows, complicating verification\ndue to increased circuit complexity. This paper introduces a new protocol to\naddress these challenges and enhance both verifiability and tolerance to\nchannel loss in cloud-based VQAs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8bVcyu7X5gNFPYBp-uE9sSsWyhD1PAqU65HFEPiThzQ","pdfSize":"380318"}
