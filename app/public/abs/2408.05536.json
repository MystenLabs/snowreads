We first show that the original problem is\nconnected with a fractional differential inclusion problem involving the Clarke\nsubdifferential operator, and then we prove the approximate controllability of\nthe original problem via the approximate controllability of the connected\nfractional differential inclusion problem. In the meantime, we face the issue\nof convexity in the multivalued fixed point map due to the nonlinear nature of\nthe duality map in reflexive Banach spaces involved in the expression of the\ncontrol. We resolve this convexity issue and deduce main result. We also\njustify the abstract finding of this paper through an example.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
