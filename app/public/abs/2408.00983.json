We give a new structural description of such graphs in terms of\nso-called quasi-tree-partitions. We demonstrate the utility of this result\nthrough applications to (fractional) clustered colouring. Further\ngeneralisations of these structural and colouring results are presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
