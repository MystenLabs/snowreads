NeRF-based techniques have\nrecently garnered attention for the ability to reconstruct scenes implicitly.\nOn the other hand, Gaussian splatting-based 3D-GS represents scenes explicitly\nusing 3D Gaussians and projects them onto a 2D plane as a replacement for the\ncomplex volume rendering in NeRF. However, these methods face challenges\nregarding surgical scene reconstruction, such as slow inference, dynamic\nscenes, and surgical tool occlusion. This work explores and reviews\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, discussing their innovations and\nimplementation principles. Furthermore, we replicate the models and conduct\ntesting and evaluation on two datasets. The test results demonstrate that with\nadvancements in these techniques, achieving real-time, high-quality\nreconstructions becomes feasible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
