While neural networks have shown great performance at\nlearning useful representations, they are often criticized for their limited\nhigh-level reasoning abilities. In this work, we present Graph Reasoning\nNetworks (GRNs), a novel approach to combine the strengths of fixed and learned\ngraph representations and a reasoning module based on a differentiable\nsatisfiability solver. While results on real-world datasets show comparable\nperformance to GNN, experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate the potential\nof the newly proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
