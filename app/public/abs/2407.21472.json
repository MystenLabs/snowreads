A set $D$ of vertices\nof a graph $G$ with the vertex set $V$ is a double dominating set of $G$, if\nevery vertex $v\\in D$ has at least one neighbor in $D$ and every vertex $v \\in\nV \\setminus D$ has at least two neighbors in $D$. A double coalition consists\nof two disjoint sets of vertices $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, neither of which is a\ndouble dominating set but their union $V_{1}\\cup V_{2}$ is a double dominating\nset. A double coalition partition of a graph $G$ is a partition $\\Pi = \\{V_1,\nV_2,..., V_k \\}$ of $V$ such that no subset of $\\Pi$ is a double dominating set\nof $G$, but for every set $V_i \\in \\Pi$, there exists a set $V_j \\in \\Pi$ such\nthat $V_i$ and $V_j$ form a double coalition. In this paper, we study\nproperties of double coalitions in graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
