Related issues have also been explored,\nsuch as the identification of partially fake signals, i.e., tracks that include\nboth real and fake speech segments. However, generating high-quality spliced\naudio is not as straightforward as it may appear. Spliced signals are typically\ncreated through basic signal concatenation. This process could introduce\nnoticeable artifacts that can make the generated data easier to detect. We\nanalyze spliced audio tracks resulting from signal concatenation, investigate\ntheir artifacts and assess whether such artifacts introduce any bias in\nexisting datasets. Our findings reveal that by analyzing splicing artifacts, we\ncan achieve a detection EER of 6.16% and 7.36% on PartialSpoof and HAD\ndatasets, respectively, without needing to train any detector. These results\nunderscore the complexities of generating reliable spliced audio data and lead\nto discussions that can help improve future research in this area.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6CybsAGr7hAS6222m1l-FSPFlkzEX35ljQ_FSoM9kEw","pdfSize":"938069"}
