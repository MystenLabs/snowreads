Similar to\nthe Belief Propagation (BP)-based QLDPC decoders, the proposed GNN-based QLDPC\ndecoder exploits the sparse graph structure of QLDPC codes and can be\nimplemented as a message-passing decoding algorithm. We compare the proposed\nGNN-based decoding algorithm against selected classes of both conventional and\nneural-enhanced QLDPC decoding algorithms across several QLDPC code designs.\nThe simulation results demonstrate excellent performance of GNN-based decoders\nalong with their low complexity compared to competing methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KvZ8zH1YUq3JVMEsIlMWPoYF0IZfGYcN58Wuu8YxW-I","pdfSize":"540868"}
