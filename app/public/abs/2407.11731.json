While knot-like\nexcitations emerge in various systems of condensed matter physics, the\nfundamental constituents of matter have been revealed to be elementary\nparticles such as electrons and quarks, seemingly leaving no room for the\nappearance of knots in particle physics. Here, we show that knots indeed appear\nas meta-stable solitons in a realistic extension of the standard model of\nparticle physics that provides the QCD axion and right-handed neutrinos. This\nresult suggests that during the early Universe, a \"knot dominated era\" may have\nexisted, where knots were a dominant component of the Universe, and this\nscenario can be tested through gravitational wave observations. Furthermore, we\npropose that the end of this era involves the collapse of the knots via quantum\ntunneling, leading to the generation of matter-antimatter asymmetry in the\nUniverse. Our findings exhibit the significant role of knots in particle\nphysics and represent a modern version of Kelvin's hypothesis.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
