As a consequence, a\nmulti-TeV muon collider would provide a unique test of NP in the muon $g$-2\nthrough the study of high-energy processes such as $\\mu^+ \\mu^-\\to h +\\gamma\n/Z$. Since the analysis involved a SMEFT approach to Higgs-processes, it could\nalso be studied by the more general HEFT formulation. We compute the\nmodification of the high-energy cross-section $\\mu^+ \\mu^-\\to h +\\gamma/Z$ and\n$h\\to \\mu^{+} \\mu^{-} +\\gamma /Z$ decay using the dimension six HEFT Lagrangian\nand compare them with the SMEFT analysis. We find that, in some reasonable\ncases, the HEFT approach could lead to a higher sensitivity to test the NP\ncontributions in the muon $g$-2, requiring thus a less energetic muon collider\nfor such a purpose.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-zBfK9BQT7G2MzDt7Qw5gMu209gjfgvaykxrkXI1OhI","pdfSize":"915659"}
