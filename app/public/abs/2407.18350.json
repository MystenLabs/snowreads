While Andrews and\nYee utilized $q$-series and combinatorial methods, Alfes et al. proved the\nfinite number of remaining cases using asymptotics originating with Meinardus\ntogether with high-performance computing. In 2020, Kang and Park conjectured a\n\"level $2$\" Alder-Andrews type partition inequality which relates to the second\nRogers-Ramanujan identity. Duncan, Khunger, the second author, and Tamura\nproved Kang and Park's conjecture for all but finitely many cases using a\ncombinatorial shift identity. Here, we generalize the methods of Alfes et al.\nto resolve nearly all of the remaining cases of Kang and Park's conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
