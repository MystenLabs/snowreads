Specifically, we consider fluctuations of a massless spectator\nscalar field set up in the early universe, which later acquires mass during the\nradiation-dominated era. We find that there are non-vanishing effects on\nobservables, and the amplitude of these effects peaks for observables set up at\nthe time of equal matter and radiation, and decreases as $\\eta^{-2}$ where\n$\\eta$ is the conformal time. Hence, the back-reaction effects are important\nfor CMB anisotropies, but their impact on late-time observables is suppressed.\nIn particular, the back-reaction effects are unable to explain the Hubble\ntension while they might alleviate the cosmic dipole tension. In contrast to a\nlot of the previous work on back-reaction, we work in position rather than\nmomentum space.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
