Understanding this\noutflow's origin and structure illuminates how massive star formation shapes\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) and helps predict future Galactic conditions\naffecting our Solar System. We analysed H I emission and optical ISM absorption\nlines towards 47 early-type stars around the Upper Sco region to refine the map\nof the Sco-Cen outflow. Combined with data for nearby stars, we find that the\noutflow has at least two components: a faster, low-density component traced by\nCa II, and a slower, possibly lower-density component traced by Mg II and Fe II\nin the UV that is passing through the Earth. A constant flow model successfully\ndescribes both components with $(l,b,|\\vec{v}|) = (335.4^{\\circ}, -6.8^{\\circ},\n14.0 \\,\\,\\textrm{km}\\,\\textrm{s}^{-1})$ and $(305.5^{\\circ}, +17.6^{\\circ},\n21.2\\,\\,\\textrm{km}\\,\\textrm{s}^{-1})$, respectively. The origin of the faster\ncomponent points towards the Sco-Cen 15 Myr population, which is consistent\nwith the origin of the slower component within 2 $\\sigma$. A simple model\ncomparison indicates that a constant flow is favoured over a spherical flow\ngeometry, implying an extended distribution of feedback sources within Sco-Cen.\nWe also found that a poorly studied 25 pc long H I cloud at a distance of 107\npc belongs to the established Sco-Cen flow.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
