While large language models\nand machine translation have been celebrated as a way to break down barriers,\nwe regard their use as a symptom of linguistic exclusion of scientists and\npotential readers. We propose alternative futures for a healthier publishing\nculture, organized around three themes: administering conferences in the\nlanguages of the country in which they are held, instructing peer reviewers not\nto adjudicate the language appropriateness of papers, and offering\nopportunities to publish and present in multiple languages. We welcome new\ntranslations of this piece. Please contact the authors if you would like to\ncontribute one.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-V27IkOvV8mJTvUbWmolRfprOZ6aa0YLQRaKDv-s7-U","pdfSize":"315835"}
