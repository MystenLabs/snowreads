Existing studies have demonstrated the\nfeasibility of RR monitoring under specific user conditions (e.g., while\nremaining still, or while breathing heavily). Yet, performing accurate,\ncontinuous and non-obtrusive RR monitoring across diverse daily routines and\nactivities remains challenging. In this work, we present RespEar, an\nearable-based system for robust RR monitoring. By leveraging the unique\nproperties of in-ear microphones in earbuds, RespEar enables the use of\nRespiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA) and Locomotor Respiratory Coupling (LRC),\nphysiological couplings between cardiovascular activity, gait and respiration,\nto indirectly determine RR. This effectively addresses the challenges posed by\nthe almost imperceptible breathing signals under daily activities. We further\npropose a suite of meticulously crafted signal processing schemes to improve RR\nestimation accuracy and robustness. With data collected from 18 subjects over 8\nactivities, RespEar measures RR with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.48\nbreaths per minutes (BPM) and a mean absolute percent error (MAPE) of 9.12% in\nsedentary conditions, and a MAE of 2.28 BPM and a MAPE of 11.04% in active\nconditions, respectively, which is unprecedented for a method capable of\ngeneralizing across conditions with a single modality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZyEmqYi0mTojrQaOuD1DEdmUaaIhQW-Pf6KZL-FCg44","pdfSize":"6838574"}
