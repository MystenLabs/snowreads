This study\nfocuses on the conformational changes induced by activity, impacting effective\nstiffness and crucially influencing entanglement and dynamics. When the two\nterminals of a linear chain undergo active modification through coupling to a\nhigh-temperature thermal bath, there is a substantial increase in chain size,\nindicating a notable enhancement in effective stiffness. Unlike in passive\nsemiflexible chains where stiffness predominantly affects local bond angles,\nactivity-induced stiffness manifests at the scale of tens of monomers. While\nactivity raises the ambient temperature, it significantly decreases diffusion\nby over an order of magnitude. The slowdown of dynamics observed can be\nattributed to increased entanglement due to chain elongation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
