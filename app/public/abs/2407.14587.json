We discuss the validity of\nthe shift for general theories of spin $\\leq$ 1, and illustrate the connection\nbetween Ward identity and constructibility for massive spin-1 amplitude under\nthe ALT shift. We apply the shift to the electroweak theory, and various\nfour-point scattering amplitudes among electroweak gauge bosons and fermions\nare constructed. We show explicitly that the four-point gauge boson contact\nterms in massive electroweak theory automatically arise after recursive\nconstruction, independent of UV completion, and they automatically cancel the\nterms growing as (energy)$^4$ at high energy. We explore UV completion of the\nelectroweak theory that cancels the remaining (energy)$^2$ terms and impose\nunitarity requirements to constrain additional couplings. The ALT shift\nframework allows consistent treatment in dealing with contact term ambiguities\nfor renormalizable massive and massless theories, which we show can be useful\nin studying real-world amplitudes with massive spinors.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
