We analyze the performance of the canonical discrepancy minimization\nalgorithms of Lovett-Meka and Rothvoss/Eldan-Singh for the asymmetric binary\nperceptron problem. We obtain new algorithmic results in the $\\kappa = 0$ case\nand in the large-$|\\kappa|$ case. In the $\\kappa\\to-\\infty$ case, we\nadditionally characterize the storage capacity and complement our algorithmic\nresults with an almost-matching overlap-gap lower bound.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
