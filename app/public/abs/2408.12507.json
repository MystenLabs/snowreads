During time propagation, the environment occasionally makes\nmeasurements, forcing the system's wave function to collapse randomly. The von\nNeumann density matrix incorporates the statistics involved in these random\nprocesses, and its time development is often described by Markovian quantum\nmaster equations that incorporate a dissipator. For large systems, the\ncomplexity of the dissipator grows with the increasing number of possible\nmeasurements, posing conceptual and severe computational challenges. This\narticle introduces a stochastic representation of the dissipator, using bundled\nmeasurement operators to address this complexity. Taking the Morse oscillator\nas an example, we demonstrate that small samples of bundled operators capture\nthe system's dynamics. This stochastic bundling is different from the\nstochastic unraveling and the jump operator formalism and offers a new way of\nunderstanding quantum dissipation and decoherence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8WrKIyhP3TvnpMLWwjySYVa3tADDUjLuirxr-HABix4","pdfSize":"1374247"}
