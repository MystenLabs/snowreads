Each eon is dominated by emergent physics\nat an energy scale controlled by higher-curvature terms of a given order,\ntransitioning to higher-order eons as the singularity is approached. The\npurpose of this paper is twofold. First, we demonstrate that the inclusion of\nmatter dramatically modifies the physics of eons compared to the vacuum case.\nWe illustrate this by considering a family of quasi-topological gravities of\narbitrary order minimally coupled to a scalar field. Second, we investigate\nKasner eons in the interior of black holes with field theory duals and analyze\ntheir imprints on holographic observables. We show that the behavior of the\nthermal $a$-function, two-point functions of heavy operators, and holographic\ncomplexity can capture distinct signatures of the eons, making them promising\ntools for diagnosing stringy effects near black hole singularities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
