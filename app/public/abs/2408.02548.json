This is equivalent to finding the\nusual weight distributions of all extension codes of $C_q$ over every field\nextension of $F_q$ of finite degree. To obtain our results we will utilize\nwell-known connections between these weights and properties of the\nStanley-Reisner rings of a series of matroids associated to each code $C_q$. In\nthe process, we are able to explicitly determine all the graded Betti numbers\nof matroids associated to $C_q$ and its elongations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
