Conventional techniques to solve discrete\noptimization problems that use simple continuous relaxation of the objective\nfunction followed by gradient descent minimization are inherently unable to\navoid local optima, thus producing poor-quality solutions. Our method considers\nthe physical dynamics of macrospins capable of escaping from local minima, thus\nfacilitating the discovery of high-quality, nearly optimal solutions, as\nsupported by extensive numerical simulations on a prototypical quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Our method produces solutions\nthat compare favorably with those obtained using state-of-the-art minimization\nalgorithms (such as simulated annealing) while offering the advantage of being\nphysically realizable by means of arrays of stochastic magnetic tunnel junction\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
