To achieve this effectively, it is essential\nto thoroughly examine user-generated content from various perspectives.\nHowever, previous studies have struggled with automatically extracting and\neffectively integrating information from multiple perspectives, thereby\nlimiting their performance on personality detection. To address these\nchallenges, we propose the Multi-view Mixture-of-Experts Model for Textual\nPersonality Detection (MvP). MvP introduces a Multi-view Mixture-of-Experts\n(MoE) network to automatically analyze user posts from various perspectives.\nAdditionally, it employs User Consistency Regularization to mitigate conflicts\namong different perspectives and learn a multi-view generic user\nrepresentation. The model's training is optimized via a multi-task joint\nlearning strategy that balances supervised personality detection with\nself-supervised user consistency constraints. Experimental results on two\nwidely-used personality detection datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nMvP model and the benefits of automatically analyzing user posts from diverse\nperspectives for textual personality detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
