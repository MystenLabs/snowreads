Recent progress on neural implicit SLAM has shown encouraging and\nimpressive results. However, the robustness of neural SLAM, particularly in\nchallenging or data-limited situations, remains an unresolved issue. This paper\npresents HERO-SLAM, a Hybrid Enhanced Robust Optimization method for neural\nSLAM, which combines the benefits of neural implicit field and feature-metric\noptimization. This hybrid method optimizes a multi-resolution implicit field\nand enhances robustness in challenging environments with sudden viewpoint\nchanges or sparse data collection. Our comprehensive experimental results on\nbenchmarking datasets validate the effectiveness of our hybrid approach,\ndemonstrating its superior performance over existing implicit field-based\nmethods in challenging scenarios. HERO-SLAM provides a new pathway to enhance\nthe stability, performance, and applicability of neural SLAM in real-world\nscenarios.
