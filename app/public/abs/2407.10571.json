This problem, known to be NP-hard,\nhas attracted significant attention due to its importance in network design and\noptimization. Extensive research has been conducted on the algorithmic and\ncombinatorial aspects of this problem, with recent studies delving into its\nfixed-parameter tractability.\n  In this paper, we focus primarily on the parameter modular-width. We\ndemonstrate that finding a spanning tree with the minimum number of branch\nvertices is Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) when considered with respect to\nmodular-width. Additionally, in cases where each vertex in the input graph has\nan associated cost for serving as a branch vertex, we prove that the problem of\nfinding a spanning tree with the minimum branch cost (i.e., minimizing the sum\nof the costs of branch vertices) is FPT with respect to neighborhood diversity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ekPIlCCWHBpQzOcEtkCtqdRYJCt9RexdJHkG5n_3m38","pdfSize":"312043"}
