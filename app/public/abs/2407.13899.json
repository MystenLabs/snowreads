Many approaches have been\nadopted to determine the stability of these systems, including brute-force\nN-body simulations, semi-analytical calculations, and more recently machine\nlearning methods. This allows significant advances in our understanding of\nplanetary system dynamics, as well as providing tools to constrain unknown\nparameters of exoplanetary systems (assuming these systems are stable). In the\nfollowing, we focus on planets around single star hosts, and we provide an\noverview of the studies of planetary system stability for compact multi-planet\nsystems and hierarchical multi-planet systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HMEcCAhOp0keYov1vD_AyjxLhYT665_XXWwXmg0X8EA","pdfSize":"569527"}
