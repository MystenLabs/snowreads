Nevertheless, despite its relevance to understanding\nbrain function, a formal description of this phenomenon is still lacking. To\nthis end, we introduce a machine learning based method allowing for the\ndetermination of the probabilities of all possible states at a given\ncoarse-graining, from which all the thermodynamics can be derived. This is a\nchallenge not unique to the brain, since similar problems are at the heart of\nthe statistical mechanics of complex systems. This paper uncovers a linear\nscaling of the entropies and energies of the brain states, a behaviour first\nconjectured by Hagedorn to be typical at the limiting temperature in which\nordinary matter disintegrates into quark matter. Equivalently, this establishes\nthe existence of a Zipf law scaling underlying the appearance of a wide range\nof brain states. Based on our estimation of the density of states for large\nscale functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) human brain recordings, we\nobserve that the brain operates asymptotically at the Hagedorn temperature. The\npresented approach is not only relevant to brain function but should be\napplicable for a wide variety of complex systems.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
