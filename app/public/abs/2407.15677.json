Promising\nrecent research has been conducted showing that the knowledge contained in LLMs\ncan be utilized in making goal-driven decisions that are enactable in\ninteractive, embodied environments. Nonetheless, there is a considerable drop\nin correctness of programs generated by LLMs. We apply goal modeling techniques\nfrom software engineering to large language models generating robotic plans.\nSpecifically, the LLM is prompted to generate a step refinement graph for a\ntask. The executability and correctness of the program converted from this\nrefinement graph is then evaluated. The approach results in programs that are\nmore correct as judged by humans in comparison to previous work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
