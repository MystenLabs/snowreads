We prove\nthat the resulting transformed trapezoidal rule attains the optimal rate of\nconvergence if the integrand function lives in a weighted Sobolev space with a\nweight that is only assumed to be a positive Schwartz function decaying\nmonotonically to zero close to infinity. Our algorithm only requires the\nability to evaluate the weight at the selected nodes, and it does not require\nsampling from a probability measure defined by the weight nor information on\nits derivatives. In particular, we show that the M\\\"obius transformation, as a\nchange of variables between the real line and the unit circle, sends a function\nin the weighted Sobolev space to a periodic Sobolev space with the same\nsmoothness. Since there are various results available for integrating and\napproximating periodic functions, we also describe several extensions of the\nM\\\"obius-transformed trapezoidal rule, including function approximation via\ntrigonometric interpolation, integration with randomized algorithms, and\nmultivariate integration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
