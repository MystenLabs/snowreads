This multimodal dataset utilizes signals of opportunity,\nleveraging existing WiFi infrastructure to provide detailed indoor\nenvironmental sensing without additional sensor deployment. Data were collected\nusing two Franka Emika robotic arms, complemented by three cameras, three WiFi\nsniffers to collect CSI, and three microphones capturing distinct yet\ncomplementary audio data streams. The combination of CSI, visual, and auditory\ndata can enhance robustness and accuracy in MRAR. This comprehensive dataset\nenables a holistic understanding of robotic environments, facilitating advanced\nautonomous operations that mimic human-like perception and interaction. By\nrepurposing ubiquitous WiFi signals for environmental sensing, this dataset\noffers significant potential aiming to advance robotic perception and\nautonomous systems. It provides a valuable resource for developing\nsophisticated decision-making and adaptive capabilities in dynamic\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
