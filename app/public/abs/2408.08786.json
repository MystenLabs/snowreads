We introduce a classical correlation model based\non hidden random fields for modeling such errors. We show that this proposed\nmodel can capture certain correlation patterns not captured by the joint\n(system and bath) Hamiltonian model with pairwise terms. Towards that, we\nderive a converse result for retention time in the presence of an error\ndistribution, which is from the proposed class and exhibits quadratically small\ncorrelations. On the other hand, we show that for a broad subclass of error\ndistributions within the proposed model, Tanner codes can ensure exponential\nretention time when the error rate is sufficiently low. The proposed model is\nanalytically tractable due to the existence of a rich probability literature\nand thus, can offer insights complementary to the joint Hamiltonian model with\npairwise terms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
