A key challenge\nis surpassing the Whittaker-Nyquist-Shannon (WNS) aliasing limit, establishing\na frequency below which the signal cannot be faithfully reconstructed. However,\nthe WNS limit applies only to periodic sampling, opening the door to bypass\naliasing by aperiodic sampling. In this work, we investigate the efficiency of\na recently discovered family of aperiodic monotile tilings, the Hat family, in\novercoming the aliasing limit when spatially sampling a wavefield. By analyzing\ntheir spectral properties, we show that monotile aperiodic seismic (MAS)\narrays, based on a subset of the Hat tiling family, are efficient in surpassing\nthe WNS sampling limit. Our investigation leads us to propose MAS arrays as a\nnovel design principle for seismic arrays. We show that MAS arrays can\noutperform regular and other aperiodic arrays in realistic beamforming\nscenarios using single and distributed sources, including station-position\nnoise. While current seismic arrays optimize beamforming or imaging\napplications using spiral or regular arrays, MAS arrays can accommodate both,\nas they share properties with both periodic and aperiodic arrays. More\ngenerally, our work suggests that aperiodic monotiles can be an efficient\ndesign principle in various fields requiring wave sampling.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
