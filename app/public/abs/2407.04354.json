In the present study we prove that, in the limit of small and\nfrequent orders, the discrete system indeed converges to the fluid limit, which\nis characterized by a system of coupled nonlinear ODEs with singular\ncoefficients at the origin. Moreover, we establish that the fluid system is\nasymptotically stable for an arbitrary number of limit order books in that,\nover time, it converges to the stationary equilibrium state studied by Maglaras\net al. (2021).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
