While pixel-based OPC, termed as inverse lithography technology\n(ILT), has gained research interest due to its flexibility and precision. Its\ncomplexity and intricate features can lead to challenges in mask writing,\nincreased defects, and higher costs, hence hindering widespread industrial\nadoption. In this paper, we propose DiffOPC, a differentiable OPC framework\nthat enjoys the virtue of both edge-based OPC and ILT. By employing a mask\nrule-aware gradient-based optimization approach, DiffOPC efficiently guides\nmask edge segment movement during mask optimization, minimizing wafer error by\npropagating true gradients from the cost function back to the mask edges. Our\napproach achieves lower edge placement error while reducing manufacturing cost\nby half compared to state-of-the-art OPC techniques, bridging the gap between\nthe high accuracy of pixel-based OPC and the practicality required for\nindustrial adoption, thus offering a promising solution for advanced\nsemiconductor manufacturing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"o0xhfFLQKSnNE8PiuyR-_3uZLoRkmwESNLI97DC_sls","pdfSize":"1975389"}
