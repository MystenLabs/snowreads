Since these\nproperties stem from complex, subwavelength geometry, full-scale dynamic\nsimulations are often prohibitively expensive at scales of interest. Prior\nstudies have therefore utilized low-order effective medium models, such as\ndiscrete mass-spring lattices, to capture essential properties in the\nlong-wavelength limit. While models of this type have been successfully\nimplemented for a wide variety of nonlinear elastic systems, they have\npredominantly considered dynamics depending only on the instantaneous\nkinematics of the lattice, neglecting history-dependent effects, such as wear\nand plasticity. To address this limitation, the present study develops a\nlattice-based modeling framework for nonlinear elastic metamaterials undergoing\nplastic deformation. Due to the history- and rate-dependent nature of\nplasticity, the framework generally yields a system of differential-algebraic\nequations whose computational cost is significantly greater than an elastic\nsystem of comparable size. We demonstrate the method using several models\ninspired by classical lattice dynamics and continuum plasticity theory, and\nexplore means to obtain empirical plasticity models for general geometries.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
