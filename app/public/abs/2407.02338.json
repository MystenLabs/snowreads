Comparable results are not known for any other\ninfinite-dimensional Kac-Moody flag variety (except for type $\\tilde{A}_1$,\nwhere every Schubert variety is rationally smooth). As a consequence, we deduce\nthat if $x$ is a point in a non-spiral Schubert variety $X_w$, then $x$ is nrs\nin $X_w$ if and only if there are more than $\\dim X_w$ curves in $X_w$ through\n$x$ which are stable under the action of a maximal torus, as is true for\nSchubert varieties in (finite) type $A$. Combined with the work of Graham and\nLi for spiral Schubert varieties, this implies the Lookup Conjecture for\n$\\tilde{A}_2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
