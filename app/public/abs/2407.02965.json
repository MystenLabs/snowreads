Periodic interference\nsignificantly modifies conditions for chirped pulse amplification (CPA) which\ngives rise to temporal and spectral distortions during CPA due to the optical\nKerr nonlinearity. Multi-pulse chirped amplification to mJ energies may lead to\na pronounced degradation of burst fidelity and the appearance of periodic\ntemporal satellites after de-chirping the amplified waveform. We study,\nexperimentally and numerically, the limitations of THz burst-mode CPA caused by\nself- and cross-phase modulation. A number of practical recipes to suppress\nnonlinear distortions and improve energy scaling by optimizing burst parameters\nand applying modulation techniques are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
