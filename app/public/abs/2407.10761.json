However, the data-driven ML's \"black box\" nature has presented a\nchallenge to interpreting its outcomes. On the other hand, governing physical\nlaws are not effectively utilized to develop data-efficient ML algorithms. To\nleverage the advantages of ML and physical laws of advanced manufacturing, this\npaper focuses on the development of a physics-informed machine learning (PIML)\nmodel by integrating neural networks and physical laws to improve model\naccuracy, transparency, and generalization with case studies in laser metal\ndeposition (LMD).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
