Atomic-scale simulation acts as an indispensable tool to\nprovide a microscopic understanding of PCET. However, consideration of the\nquantum nature of transferring protons under an exact grand canonical (GC)\nconstant potential condition is a great challenge for theoretical\nelectrocatalysis. Here, we develop a unified computational framework to\nexplicitly treat nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) by a sufficient GC sampling,\nfurther assisted by a machine learning force field adapted for electrochemical\nconditions. Our work demonstrates a non-negligible impact of NQEs on PCET\nsimulations for hydrogen evolution reaction at room temperature, and provides a\nphysical picture that wave-like quantum characteristic of the transferring\nprotons facilitates the particles to tunnel through classical barriers in PCET\npaths, leading to a remarkable activation energy reduction compared to\nclassical simulations. Moreover, the physical insight of NQEs may reshape our\nfundamental understanding of other types of PCET reactions in broader scenarios\nof energy conversion processes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hBM5su6WUWvXJafNPbKXWSu8yiSFsaFdYfkdcY_nXao","pdfSize":"2353983"}
