We show that the transport properties\nof thermally-generated magnons under a Py wire depends on the relative\norientation between the temperature gradient and the Py-magnetization\ndirection. The symmetries of this non-reciprocal magnon transport match with\nthose predicted by the remote dipolar interaction between YIG and Py magnons,\ncontrolled by the chirality of the YIG magnon dipolar stray fields. We also\nshow that the directional magnon generation by the spin Seebeck effect from the\nPy wire displays the symmetries expected from the chiral spin Seebeck effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GxyylGmlsByGlQjckt_IJv0aTPZaxmadGVswLokxnWo","pdfSize":"764315"}
