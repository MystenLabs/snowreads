In 1976, Serre gave a conditional proof of the cyclicity\nconjecture, but the Koblitz conjecture (refined by Zywina in 2011) remains\nopen. The conjectures are now known unconditionally \"on average\" due to work of\nBanks--Shparlinski and Balog--Cojocaru--David. Recently, there has been a\ngrowing interest in the cyclicity conjecture for primes in arithmetic\nprogressions (AP), with relevant work by Akbal--G\\\"ulo\\u{g}lu and Wong. In this\npaper, we adapt Zywina's method to formulate the Koblitz conjecture for primes\nin AP and refine a theorem of Jones to establish results on the moments of the\nconstants in both the cyclicity and Koblitz conjectures for AP. In doing so, we\nuncover a somewhat counterintuitive phenomenon: On average, these two constants\nare oppositely biased over congruence classes. Finally, in an accompanying\nrepository, we give Magma code for computing the constants discussed in this\npaper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
