Contemporary\nresearch predominantly centers on crafting cooperative scheduling algorithms\ntailored for vehicular networks. Notwithstanding, the intricacies of\norchestrating scheduling in vehicular social networks both effectively and\nefficiently remain formidable. This paper introduces an innovative\nlearning-based algorithm for scheduling data transmission that prioritizes\nefficiency and security within vehicular social networks. The algorithm first\nuses a specifically constructed neural network to enhance data processing\ncapabilities. After this, it incorporates a Q-learning paradigm during the data\ntransmission phase to optimize the information exchange, the privacy of which\nis safeguarded by differential privacy through the communication process.\nComparative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed\nQ-learning enhanced scheduling algorithm relative to existing state-of-the-art\nscheduling algorithms in the context of vehicular social networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
