In this way we establish a\nconnection between DPTs in a quantum spin system and an everyday natural\nphenomenon: The dark band between the primary and seconday bows (caustics) in\nrainbows known as Alexander's dark band. The DPT occurs when the Loschmidt echo\ncrosses the switching line between the evanescent tails of two back-to-back\nAiry functions that dress neighbouring fold caustics in Fock space and is the\ntime-dependent analogue of what is seen as a function of angle in the sky. The\nstructural stability and universal properties of caustics, as described\nmathematically by catastrophe theory, explains the generic occurrence of DPTs\nin the model and suggests that our analysis has wide applicability. Based on\nour thorough analytical understanding we propose a protocol which can be used\nto verify the existence of a DPT in a finite system experiment.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
