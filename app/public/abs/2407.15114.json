We define some functions on the\nhomogeneous space G/H that we call generalised spherical minors. When G = H x\nH, we recover Fomin-Zelevinsky generalised minors. We prove that generalised\nspherical minors satisfy some integer coefficients polynomial relations, that\nextend the identities of classical generalised minors due to Fomin and\nZelevinsky, and that have the shape of exchange relations of LP-algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
