To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to\ndifferentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation\nfrom those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we\ndemonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics -- average daily\ntweet count, and account age -- can be leveraged to help identify potential low\nfactuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that\nhigher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared\ncontent, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that\nsome of the effects, namely the effect of the number of accounts followed and\nthe number of tweets produced, differ depending on the number of followers a\nuser has. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network\nmetrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of\nusers who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to\ncombating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
