The SLR optical absorption peak is by at least one\norder of magnitude more intense than the LSPR one, making SLR superior for\napplications in which LSPR is commonly used. Recently, we have developed a\nroute for the fabrication of spherical virus-like particles (VLPs) with\nplasmonic cores and protein coronas, where the LSPR in the cores amplifies\nvibrational signals originating from protein-antibody bonding, showing the\npotential of VLPs in biodetection. However, the signals were not strong enough\nto detect antibodies at very low concentrations. Here, we show that by ordering\nthe VLPs in periodic nanoarrays exhibiting SLR amplifies the signals by two\norders of magnitude, revealing superior potential of SLR arrays in\nultrasensitive biodetection.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
