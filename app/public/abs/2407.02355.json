While executing a program is the ultimate test for its correctness\nreviewing the program can occur earlier in its development and find problems if\ndone effectively. This work focuses on review techniques. It enables the\nprogrammer to effectively review a program and find a range of problems from\nconcurrency to interface issues. The review techniques can be applied in a time\nconstrained industrial development context and are enhanced by knowledge on\nprogramming pitfalls.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7MyJJdoj15y9bTLM-pI8sGDnChcGrsNgvYdibiPq1P0","pdfSize":"471168"}
