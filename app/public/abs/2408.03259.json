However, integrating these\ntwo theories presents immense challenges, and their interplay remains untested.\nRecent theoretical studies suggest that the single-photon interference covering\nhuge space can effectively probe the interface between quantum mechanics and\ngeneral relativity. We developed an alternative design using unbalanced\nMichelson interferometers to address this and validated its feasibility over an\n8.4 km free-space channel. Using a high-brightness single-photon source based\non quantum dots, we demonstrated single-photon interference along this\nlong-distance baseline. We achieved a phase measurement precision of 16.2 mrad,\nwhich satisfied the measurement requirements for a gravitational redshift at\nthe geosynchronous orbit by five times the standard deviation. Our results\nconfirm the feasibility of the single-photon version of the\nColella-Overhauser-Werner experiment for testing the quantum effects in curved\nspacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
