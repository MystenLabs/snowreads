The location of the\nsources is unknown a priori, so the UAVs rely on measurements of the field\nintensity to gauge safety. The UAVs estimate the unknown scalar field using\nGaussian process (GP) regression and use the estimate to generate a map of\nhigh-intensity regions using Hough transform (HT), updated online based on the\nfield measurements. A convergence analysis shows the boundedness of the error\nbetween the actual scalar field and the learned scalar field. The effectiveness\nof the method is evaluated through simulations, showcasing its ability to\naccurately learn scalar fields with multiple high-intensity regions while\nreducing the number of measurements taken inside the high-intensity regions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
