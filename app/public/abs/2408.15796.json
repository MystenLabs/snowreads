Traditional NER systems rely on extensive labeled\ndatasets, which are costly and time-consuming to obtain. Few-Shot Prompting or\nin-context learning enables models to recognize entities with minimal examples.\nWe assess state-of-the-art models like GPT-4 in NER tasks, comparing their\nfew-shot performance to fully supervised benchmarks. Results show that while\nthere is a performance gap, large models excel in adapting to new entity types\nand domains with very limited data. We also explore the effects of prompt\nengineering, guided output format and context length on performance. This study\nunderscores Few-Shot Learning's potential to reduce the need for large labeled\ndatasets, enhancing NER scalability and accessibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
