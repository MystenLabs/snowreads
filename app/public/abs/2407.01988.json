Sasaki\nrecently published examples, independently discovered by the author, of\nautomorphisms on the Hilbert scheme of two points of certain abelian surfaces\nwhich preserve the exceptional divisor but are nevertheless unnatural, giving a\nnegative answer to the question. We construct additional examples for abelian\nsurfaces of unnatural automorphisms which preserve the exceptional divisor of\nthe Hilbert scheme of an arbitrary number of points. The underlying abelian\nsurfaces in these examples have Picard rank at least 2, and hence are not\ngeneric. We prove the converse statement that all automorphisms are natural on\nthe Hilbert scheme of two points for a principally polarized abelian surface of\nPicard rank 1. Additionally, we prove the same if the polarization has\nself-intersection a perfect square.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vcgk0gZxISH4L7NS-iuMk0MSf1_ODTPTMLpe1MprtNs","pdfSize":"541393"}
