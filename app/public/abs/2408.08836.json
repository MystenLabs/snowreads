This study introduces\nan innovative approach, integrating the Bees Optimization Algorithm (BOA) to\novercome one of the most significant hurdles -- barren plateaus. Our\nexperiments across varying qubit counts and circuit depths demonstrate the\nBOA's superior performance compared to the Adam algorithm. Notably, BOA\nachieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and greater computational\nefficiency. This study confirms BOA's potential in enhancing the applicability\nof QNNs in complex quantum computations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
