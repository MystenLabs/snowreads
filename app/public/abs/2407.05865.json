In addition to previously known results, we find a\nunique candidate mixing between spin-1 and PM spin-2 fields. We derive all the\nquadratic constraints on the structure constants of the theory, allowing for\nrelative ``wrong-sign'' kinetic terms for any of the fields. In the particular\ncase when the kinetic terms in each sector have no relative signs, we find that\nthe unique consistent non-trivial theory is given by multiple independent\ncopies of conformal gravity coupled to a Yang-Mills sector in $D=4$. Our\nresults strengthen the well-known no-go theorems on the absence of mutual\ninteractions for massless and PM spin-2 fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
