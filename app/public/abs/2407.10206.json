Product evolution is the result of\ntechnological evolution and market selection. A phylogenetic network is the\nmain method to study product evolution. The formation of the dominant design\ndetermines the trajectory of technology development. How to predict future\ndominant design has become a key issue in technology forecasting and new\nproduct development. We define the dominant product and use machine learning\nmethods, combined with product evolutionary theory, to construct a Fully\nConnected Phylogenetic Network dataset to effectively predict the future\ndominant design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
