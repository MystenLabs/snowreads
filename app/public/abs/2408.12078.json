Natl. Acad. Sci.\nU.S.A.\\ 97(4):1423--1426, 2000). The former measure quantifies the degree of\nprominence of each vertex in receiving choices, whereas the latter measure\nevaluates the degree of importance in giving choices. The proposed measures can\nhandle graphs with both edge and vertex weights, as well as undirected graphs.\nHowever, examining a graph using a measure defined over a single `scale'\ninevitably leads to a loss of information, as each vertex may exhibit distinct\nstructural characteristics at different levels of locality. To this end, we\nfurther develop local versions of the proposed measures with a tunable locality\nparameter. Using these tools, we present a multiscale network analysis\nframework that provides much richer structural information about each vertex\nthan a single-scale inspection. By applying the proposed measures to the\nnetworks constructed from the Seoul Mobility Flow Data, it is demonstrated that\nthese measures accurately depict and uncover the inherent characteristics of\nindividual city regions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
