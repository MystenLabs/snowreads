In this paper, we consider two recent experimental demonstrations\nof LOSR-GMNL, focusing on a tripartite scenario where the goal is to exhibit\ncorrelations impossible in a network where each two-party subset shares\nbipartite resources and every party has access to unlimited shared randomness.\nTraditional statistical analyses measuring violations of witnessing\ninequalities by the number of experimental standard deviations do not account\nfor subtleties such as memory effects. We demonstrate a more sound method based\non the prediction-based ratio (PBR) protocol to analyse finite experimental\ndata and quantify the strength of evidence in favour of genuine tripartite\nnonlocality in terms of a valid $p$-value. In our work, we propose an efficient\nmodification of the test factor optimisation using an approximating polytope\napproach. By justifying a further restriction to a smaller polytope we enhance\npractical feasibility while maintaining statistical rigour.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
