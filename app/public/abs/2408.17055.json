We explore different\nsituations and demonstrate a variety of conclusions, highlighting the crucial\nrole these structures play within the framework of invariants.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
