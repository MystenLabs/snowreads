Based on the existence of $t$-norms and\n$t$-conorms on arbitrary bounded trellises, we propose some construction\nmethods of nullnorms on bounded trellises. Moreover, some illustrative examples\nare provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fmWYxHG5qlCF1H7gVT265_p2qCjdVDVuQzGz_Y54UVw","pdfSize":"424844"}
