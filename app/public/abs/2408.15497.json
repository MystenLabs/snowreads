Such properties can be characterized by the ability to conduct\npreintegration and exact linearization with Jacobians independent of the\nlinearization point. IMU dynamics in navigation can be constructed into linear\nobserved settings, leading to invariant filters with guaranteed behaviors such\nas local convergence and consistency. In this letter, we establish linear\nobserved property for dynamics evolving on an arbitrary smooth manifold through\nthe connection structure endowed upon this space. Our key findings are the\nexistence of linear observed systems on manifolds poses strong constraints on\nthe state space itself, apart from requiring the dynamics to be in some\nspecific forms. The existence of such systems is equivalent to the flatness of\nthe state space, forcing the manifold to admit a group structure under mild\ntopological assumptions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
