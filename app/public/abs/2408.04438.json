Here, we report a systematic investigation\non a quasi-kagome Kondo Weyl semimetal candidate Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$. A series of\nunconventional Hall effects are observed. In the paramagnetic phase, signature\nof dynamic $c$-$f$ hybridization is revealed by a reduction of anomalous Hall\neffect and is connected to frustration-promoted incoherent Kondo scattering. A\nlarge topological Hall effect exceeding 0.2 $\\mu\\Omega$ cm is found at low\ntemperatures, which should be ascribed to the noncolinear magnetic structures\nof the frustrated quasi-kagome lattice. In addition, a peculiar loop-shaped\nHall effect with switching chirality is also seen, which is inferred to be\nassociated with magnetic domain walls that pin history-dependent spin chirality\nand / or Fermi-arc surface states projected from the in-gap Weyl nodes. These\nexotic results place Ce$_3$TiSb$_5$ in a regime of highly-frustrated\nantiferromagnetic dense Kondo lattice with a nontrivial topology on an\n``extended\" global phase diagram, and highlight the interplay among electronic\ncorrelation, geometric frustration and topology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TUj2Gc0JcnKVC3oTtGGVpdaHULBShrZESZsI3082LfE","pdfSize":"14828444"}
