Addressing these needs, we\nintroduce the tactile-morph skill framework, which integrates unified\nforce-impedance control with data-driven learning. Our system adjusts robot\nmovements and force application based on estimated energy levels for the\ndesired trajectory and force profile, ensuring safety by stopping if energy\nallocated for the control runs out. Using a Temporal Convolutional Network, we\nestimate the energy distribution for a given motion and force profile, enabling\nskill transfer across different tasks and surfaces. Our approach maintains\nstability and performance even on unfamiliar geometries with similar friction\ncharacteristics, demonstrating improved accuracy, zero-shot transferable\nperformance, and enhanced safety in real-world scenarios. This framework\npromises to enhance robotic capabilities in industrial settings, making\nintelligent robots more accessible and valuable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"78rVhezhZN95hr0SdhKsN0O7i0iTmcLPhinCp4xMAzM","pdfSize":"4628933"}
