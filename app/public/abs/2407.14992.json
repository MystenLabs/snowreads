Burer shows\nthis relaxation is exact when $m=2$. For general $m$, Burer (2024) provides\nnumerical evidence that this lifted relaxation is tighter than the Kronecker\nproduct based Reformulation Linearization Technique (RLT) inequalities\nintroduced by Anstreicher (2017), and conjectures that this must be\ntheoretically true as well. In this note, we provide an affirmative answer to\nthis question and formally prove that this lifted relaxation indeed implies the\nKronecker inequalities. Our proof is based on a decomposition of non-rank-one\nextreme rays of the lifted relaxation for each pair of ball constraints. Burer\n(2024) also numerically observes that for this lifted relaxation, an RLT-based\ninequality proposed by Zhen et al. (2021) is redundant, and conjectures this to\nbe theoretically true as well. We also provide a formal proof that Zhen et al.\n(2021) inequalities are redundant for this lifted relaxation. In addition, we\nestablish that Burer's lifted relaxation is a particular case of the\nmoment-sum-of-squares hierarchy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R3qmzatcMHTridO4H2ulykW8Z-OnbUmhT4vAShb-PQo","pdfSize":"185336"}
