First, we construct two commuting representations\n$(\\mathbf{L}_n,\\bar{\\mathbf{L}}_n)_{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}}$ of the Virasoro algebra\nwith central charge\n$c_\\mathrm{M}=1-6(\\frac{2}{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}-\\frac{\\sqrt{\\kappa}}{2})^2\\leq1$ as\n(unbounded) first order differential operators on $L^2(\\nu)$. Second, we\nintroduce highest-weight representations and characterise their structure: in\nparticular, we prove the existence of vanishing singular vectors at arbitrary\nlevels on the Kac table. Third, we prove an integration by parts formula for\nthe SLE loop measure, and use it to define the Shapovalov form of the\nrepresentation, a non degenerate (but \\emph{not} positive definite) Hermitian\nform $\\mathcal{Q}$ on $L^2(\\nu)$ with a remarkably simple geometric expression.\nThe fact that $\\mathcal{Q}$ differs from the $L^2(\\nu)$-inner product is a\nmanifestation of non-unitarity. Finally, we write down a spectral resolution of\n$\\mathcal{Q}$ using the joint diagonalisation of $\\mathbf{L}_0$ and\n$\\bar{\\mathbf{L}}_0$. As an application of these results, we provide the first\nproof of the uniqueness of restriction measures, as conjectured by Kontsevich\nand Suhov.\n  Our results lay the groundwork for an in-depth study of the CFT of SLE: in\nforthcoming works, we will define correlation functions on Riemann surfaces,\nand prove conformal Ward identities, BPZ equations, and conformal bootstrap\nformulas.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
