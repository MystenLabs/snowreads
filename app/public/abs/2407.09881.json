We show an identity between the twisted\nAlexander polynomials of a symmetric union and its partial knot. As a\ncorollary, we obtain an inequality concerning their genera. It is known that\nthere exists an epimorphism between their knot groups, and thus our inequality\nprovides a positive answer to an old problem of Jonathan Simon in this case.\nOur formula also offers a useful condition to constrain possible symmetric\nunion presentations of a given ribbon knot. It is an open question whether\nevery ribbon knot is a symmetric union.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
