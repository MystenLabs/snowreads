In this paper, we are interested in testing\n$k$-monotonicity of a compactly supported p.m.f. and we put our main focus on\nmonotonicity and convexity; i.e., $k \\in \\{1,2\\}$. We consider new testing\nprocedures that are directly derived from the definition of $k$-monotonicity\nand rely exclusively on the empirical measure, as well as tests that are based\non the projection of the empirical measure on the class of $k$-monotone\np.m.f.s. The asymptotic behaviour of the introduced test statistics is derived\nand a simulation study is performed to assess the finite sample performance of\nall the proposed tests. Applications to real datasets are presented to\nillustrate the theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
