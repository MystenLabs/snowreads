It is natural to ask which aspects of the extensions' arithmetic\nare invariant under this bijection. We show that corresponding extensions share\nmany of the same features enjoyed by arithmetically equivalent fields, despite\nnot generally being arithmetically equivalent themselves. In the process of\nelaborating on this, we observe that arithmetically equivalent fields have the\nsame odd K-groups, and we prove a simple lemma allowing for quick proofs of\ntheorems characterizing Kronecker and weak Kronecker equivalence. We also\nextend a group cohomological result of Arapura et. al. and conclude with a\ngeometric application.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
