We examine four systems, all previously analyzed by\nDavid Brown: three with familiar components (point masses, springs, rods,\nropes, and pulleys) and one chosen specifically for its detailed illustration\nof the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm's logical steps. Including this fourth system\nallows for a direct and insightful comparison with the Hamilton-Jacobi\nformalism, thereby deepening our understanding of both methods. To provide a\nthorough analysis, we classify the systems based on their constraints:\nnon-involutive, involutive, and a combination of both. We then use generalized\nbrackets to ensure the theory's integrability, systematically remove\nnon-involutive constraints, and derive the equations of motion. This approach\neffectively showcases the Hamilton-Jacobi method's ability to handle complex\nconstraint structures. Additionally, our study includes an analysis of a gauge\nsystem, highlighting the versatility and broad applicability of the\nHamilton-Jacobi formalism. By comparing our results with those from the\nDirac-Bergmann and Faddeev-Jackiw algorithms, we demonstrate that the\nHamilton-Jacobi approach is simpler and more efficient in its mathematical\noperations and offers advantages in computational implementation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
