However, existing attacks are\ntypically designed for single-task purposes, which means they are tailored to\nexploit vulnerabilities unique to the individual target rather than being\nadaptable for multiple users or systems. This limitation makes them unsuitable\nfor certain attack scenarios, such as morphing, universal, transferable, and\ncounter attacks. In this paper, we propose a multi-task adversarial attack\nalgorithm called MTADV that are adaptable for multiple users or systems. By\ninterpreting these scenarios as multi-task attacks, MTADV is applicable to both\nsingle- and multi-task attacks, and feasible in the white- and gray-box\nsettings. Furthermore, MTADV is effective against various face datasets,\nincluding LFW, CelebA, and CelebA-HQ, and can work with different deep learning\nmodels, such as FaceNet, InsightFace, and CurricularFace. Importantly, MTADV\nretains its feasibility as a single-task attack targeting a single user/system.\nTo the best of our knowledge, MTADV is the first adversarial attack method that\ncan target all of the aforementioned scenarios in one algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
