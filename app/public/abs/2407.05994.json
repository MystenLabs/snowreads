By using the complex-conjugate pole-residue (CCPR) model,\nwe can accurately model any linear materials' dispersion without limiting to\nspecific material classes. We incorporate the CCPR model via auxiliary\ndifferential equations (ADE) into Maxwell's equations in the time domain, and\nformulate a gradient-based topology optimization problem to optimize the\ndissipation over a broad spectrum of frequencies. To estimate the objective\nfunction gradient, we use the adjoint field method, and explain the\ndiscretization and integration of the adjoint system into the finite-difference\ntime-domain (FDTD) framework. Our method is demonstrated using the example of\ntopology optimized spherical nanoparticles made of Gold and Silicon with an\nenhanced absorption efficiency in the visible-ultraviolet spectral range. In\nthis context, a detailed analysis of the challenges of topology optimization of\nplasmonic materials associated with a density-based approach is given.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
