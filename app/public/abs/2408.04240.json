Unlike frictions in solid-solid\ninterfaces, pinning forces at contact points (2D) or contact lines (3D) would\nbe the cause of friction. We will define coefficients of static friction and\nrelate them with advancing and receding contact angles for the case of\n2-dimensional droplets. In our work sessile drops in an inclined plane, and\npendent drops in a slanted ceiling will all be analyzed within a single\nframework with the inclination angle as a free parameter. We can then visualize\nthe gradual change of shapes of a droplet put on a plane as the inclination\nangle changes adiabatically to make a complete turn. We also point out that\nthere could be two distinct stable configurations of pendent droplets for the\nsame physical conditions, i.e. the bifurcation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"D6MaqvIu33rQIrBQuLK8bKFiikkXK2JdL-D-IRgeOkE","pdfSize":"17306641"}
