While these properties exhibit nonequilibrium dynamics due to\nthe thermal and nonthermal forces that universally coexist in\nactin-myosin-active proliferative cells, quantifying them within such complex\nsystems remains challenging. Here, we develop a nonequilibrium framework that\ncombines fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) measurements of\nintracellular diffusion with nonequilibrium theory to quantitatively analyze\ncell-specific nonthermal driving forces and cellular adaptability. Our results\nreveal that intracellular particle diffusion is influenced not only by common\nthermal forces but also by nonthermal forces generated by approximately 10-100\nmotor proteins. Furthermore, we derive a physical parameter that quantitatively\nassesses the sensitivity of intracellular particle responses to these\nnonthermal forces, showing that systems with more active diffusion exhibit\nhigher response sensitivity. Our work highlights the biological fluctuations\narising from multiple interacting elements, advancing the understanding of the\ncomplex mechanical properties within living cells.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"PtiId8gzoHYlbZ5L2-QQ2Je28lrNsCBnWBr58aEhAsg","pdfSize":"618003"}
