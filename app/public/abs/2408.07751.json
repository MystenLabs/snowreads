In this paper we test whether we can use the optical line\nemission of spatially resolved, ionized nebulae around ultraluminous X-ray\nsources (ULXs) as a proxy for their X-ray luminosity. We choose the ULX NGC\n6946 X-1 and its nebula, MF16, as a test case. By studying how the nebular\noptical line emission responds to assumed irradiation, we can infer the degree\nto which we require the UV or X-ray emission from the inflow to be collimated\nby optically thick winds seemingly ubiquitously associated with ULXs. We find\nthat the nebula is highly sensitive to compact UV emission but mostly\ninsensitive to hard X-rays. Our attempts to quantify the beaming of the soft\nand hard X-rays therefore strongly depends on the UV luminosity of the ULX in\nthe center of the nebula. We find that it is not possible to conclude a lack of\ngeometrical beaming of hard X-rays from such sources via nebula feedback.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
