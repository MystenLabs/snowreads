This research effort aims to\naddress the accelerating growth in biomedical publications and the intricate\nnature of biomedical texts, which are written for mainly domain experts. To\nhandle these challenges, we develop a novel framework that utilizes external\nknowledge to construct a task-independent and reusable background knowledge\ngraph for biomedical entity and relation extraction. The design of our model is\ninspired by how humans learn domain-specific topics. In particular, humans\noften first acquire the most basic and common knowledge regarding a field to\nbuild the foundational knowledge and then use that as a basis for extending to\nvarious specialized topics. Our framework employs such common-knowledge-sharing\nmechanism to build a general neural-network knowledge graph that is learning\ntransferable to different domain-specific biomedical texts effectively.\nExperimental evaluations demonstrate that our model, equipped with this\ngeneralized and cross-transferable knowledge base, achieves competitive\nperformance benchmarks, including BioRelEx for binding interaction detection\nand ADE for Adverse Drug Effect identification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
