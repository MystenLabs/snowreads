We find that\n$\\mathcal{B}_a$ is written in terms of the transfer matrix $T$, and vice versa.\nIn particular, the identity operator on the chord Hilbert space is expanded as\na linear combination of $\\mathcal{B}_a$, which implies that the disk partition\nfunction of DSSYK is written as a linear combination of trumpets. We also find\nthat the thermofield double state of DSSYK is generated by a pair of baby\nuniverse operators, which corresponds to a double trumpet. This can be thought\nof as a concrete realization of the idea of ER=EPR.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
