When the exponent is\nlarge, the existence and multiplicity of solutions strongly depend on the\ngeometric properties of the domain, which also deeply affect their qualitative\nbehavior. Remarkably, a wide variety of solutions, both positive and\nsign-changing, have been found when the exponent is sufficiently large. In this\npaper, we focus on this topic and fine new sign-changing solutions that exhibit\nan unexpected concentration phenomenon as the exponent approaches infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
