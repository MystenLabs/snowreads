It has the potential to enhance the efficiency of manufacturing machines\nand reduce the frequency of errors. In order to fulfill its purpose, a DT must\nbe an exact enough replica of its corresponding physical object. Nevertheless,\nthe physical object endures a lifelong process of degradation. As a result, the\ndigital twin must be modified accordingly in order to satisfy the accuracy\nrequirement. This article introduces the novel concept of \"learning digital\ntwin (LDT),\" which concentrates on the temporal behavior of the physical object\nand highlights the digital twin's capacity for lifelong learning. The structure\nof a LDT is first described. Then, in-depth descriptions of various algorithms\nfor implementing each component of a LDT are provided. The proposed LDT is\nvalidated on the simulated degradation process of an anisotropic non-ideal\nrotor system.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
