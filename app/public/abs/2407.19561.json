Using it, we show that the scrambling speed of a random quantum\ncircuit is lower bounded: Namely, every input qubit has an influence that is at\nleast exponentially small in depth, on any output qubit touched by its\nlightcone.\n  We give three applications of this new scrambling speed lower bound that\napply to random quantum circuits with Haar random gates:\n  $\\bullet$ An optimal $\\Omega(\\log \\varepsilon^{-1})$ depth lower bound for\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate unitary designs;\n  $\\bullet$ A polynomial-time quantum algorithm that computes the depth of a\nbounded-depth circuit, given oracle access to the circuit;\n  $\\bullet$ A polynomial-time algorithm that learns log-depth circuits up to\npolynomially small diamond distance, given oracle access to the circuit.\n  The first depth lower bound works against any architecture. The latter two\nalgorithms apply to architectures defined over any geometric dimension, and can\nbe generalized to a wide class of architectures with good lightcone properties.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eyJhAyvUCynIOhKDsSOXCKVsHqdBnH9NIOH3cSUSgVE","pdfSize":"370350"}
