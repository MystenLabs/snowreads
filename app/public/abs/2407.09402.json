By pinpointing the\n$\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$-covariant conserved currents corresponding to these\nsymmetries, we first derive a set of $\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ invariant\ninvertible topological operators that encapsulate the integer BPS charges\ninherent to the theory. Moving forward, by incorporating fractional charges\nwhile maintaining gauge invariance, we introduce the non invertible topological\noperators for each generalized symmetry, and in particular for the\n$\\text{SL}(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ 0-form symmetry. Identifying them as a novel kind of\nsymmetries reminiscent of fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE)-like non\ninvertible operators, we study their action on charged objects and their\nassociated SymTFTs obtained via half (higher) gauging.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w-ZELxiqMkAgQj__pbaQGhGP-pHACfMMYf_3BbVIKNw","pdfSize":"244456"}
