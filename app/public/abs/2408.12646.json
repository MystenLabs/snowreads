We find that the transport coefficient $2\\kappa$ transverse to and\n$\\kappa_z$ along the beam direction display a qualitatively different\nevolution. We attribute this to the underlying excitation spectra of these\nsystems, thus providing evidence for the existence of non-perturbative\nproperties in the spectrum. This is accomplished by first reconstructing the\ndiffusion coefficients using gauge-fixed correlation functions, which\naccurately reproduces the time evolution of $2\\kappa$ and $\\kappa_z$. We then\nmodify these excitation spectra to study the impact of their non-perturbative\nfeatures on the transport coefficients. In particular, we find evidence for a\nnovel transport peak in the low-frequency spectrum that is crucial for\nheavy-quark diffusion. We also demonstrate that gluonic excitations are broad\nwhile scalar excitations associated with $\\kappa_z$ are narrow and strongly\nenhanced at low momenta. Our findings indicate that the large values and\ndynamical properties of transport coefficients in the Glasma could originate\nfrom genuinely non-perturbative features in the spectrum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pbf13XEvXOAID8FiQRumt02ioXiieL3Ocm9vpX3XpgY","pdfSize":"2196995"}
