This makes the security evaluation of cryptographic\nsystems in quantum attack models significant and urgent. For symmetric ciphers,\nthe security analysis heavily relies on cyptanalytic tools. Thus exploring the\nuse of quantum algorithms to traditional cyptanalytic tools has drawn a lot of\nattention. In this study, we utilize quantum algorithms to improve impossible\ndifferential attack, and design two quantum automatic tools for searching\nimpossible differentials. The proposed quantum algorithms exploit the idea of\nmiss-in-the-middle and the properties of truncated differentials. We rigorously\nprove their validity and calculate the quantum resources required to implement\nthem. Compared to existing classical automatic cryptanalysis, the quantum tools\nproposed have the advantage of accurately characterizing S-boxes while only\nrequiring polynomial complexity, and can take into consideration the impact of\nthe key schedules in single-key model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t29mrR0T-i1SknH7QWy_g2mJgmPvv0EJHEvfTECMrPM","pdfSize":"621863"}
