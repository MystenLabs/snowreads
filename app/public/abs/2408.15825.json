Several different types of contributions are simultaneously included in\nour calculation, namely the nucleon exchanges up to next-to-leading order, the\n$a\\gamma\\gamma$ vertex and the vector meson exchanges in the $t$-channel. We\nutilize the existing hadronic inputs as much as possible to fix the unknown\ncouplings. A comprehensive study of the phenomenological discussions is then\nprovided in this work. Different mechanisms in the $\\gamma N \\to a N$ processes\nmanifest distinct behaviors in the total and differential cross sections, which\ncould provide useful quantities to distinguish different axion models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
