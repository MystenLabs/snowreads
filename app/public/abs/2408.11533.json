The balance between those effects\nresults a soliton which has always been an interesting topic in research due to\nits potential applicability as signal carrier in information technology. We\nhave induced a variation to the dispersion effects and apply Hirota bilinear\nmethod to realise soliton solution of the proposed DLFLE and explore how the\nsoliton dynamic behaves in accordance to the variation of the dispersion\neffects. The proposed equation is applicable for number of systems like\nultrashort optical pulse, ioncyclotron plasma wave, Bose-Einstein condensate\n(BEC) matter-wave soliton under certain external fields, etc. The study on such\nsystems under varying effects is very limited and we hope our work can benefit\nthe researchers to understand soliton dynamics more and work on various other\nnonlinear fields under varying effects.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
