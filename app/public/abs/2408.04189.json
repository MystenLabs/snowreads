Two specific\ntypes of attacks considered are false data injection and denial-of-service\n(DoS). Unlike existing methods, which are either model-based or model-free and\nyet require two separate learning modules for detection and mitigation leading\nto longer response times before clearing an attack, our deep learner\nincorporate both goals within the same integrated framework. A Long Short-Term\nMemory (LSTM) encoder-decoder based GAN is proposed that captures the temporal\ndynamics of the power system significantly more accurately than fully-connected\nGANs, thereby providing better accuracy and faster response for both goals. The\nmethod is validated using the IEEE 68-bus power system model.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
