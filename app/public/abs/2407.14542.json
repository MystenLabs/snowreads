To determine these corrections, we\nconsider a power-law parametrization of the deviations between the teleparallel\nequivalent of general relativity and the scalar-torsion gravity. The estimates\nof the possible influence of the non-minimal coupling of the scalar field and\ntorsion on the background cosmological parameters and the parameters of\ncosmological perturbations for the inflationary models implying linear relation\nbetween tensor-to-scalar ratio and spectral index of the scalar perturbations\nare obtained. A procedure for verifying these inflationary models based on\nobservational constraints on the values of cosmological perturbation parameters\nis also considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
