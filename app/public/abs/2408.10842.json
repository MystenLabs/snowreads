Indeed, it consists of sending two bits of classical\ninformation using a single qubit, leading to faster and more efficient quantum\ncommunication. In this paper, we propose a model to evaluate the effect of\nbackflow information in a superdense coding protocol through a non-Markovian\ndynamics. The model considers a qubit interacting with a structured Markovian\nenvironment. In order to generate a non-Markovian dynamic, an auxiliary qubit\ncontacts a Markovian reservoir in such a way that the non-Markovian regime can\nbe induced. By varying the coupling strength between the central qubit and the\nauxiliary qubit, the two dynamical regimes can be switched interchangeably. An\nenhancement in non-Markovian effects corresponds to an increase in this\ncoupling strength. Furthermore, we conduct an examination of various\nparameters, namely temperature weight, and decoherence parameters in order to\nexplore the behaviors of superdense coding, quantum Fisher information, and\nlocal quantum uncertainty using an exact calculation. The obtained results show\na significant relationship between non-classical correlations and quantum\nFisher information since they behave similarly, allowing them to detect what is\nbeyond entanglement. In addition, the presence of non-classical correlations\nenables us to detect the optimal superdense coding capacity in a non-Markovian\nregime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
