Specifically, we will consider the cases where a \"fair\"\nmeeting place is defined to be either 1) a node on a graph that minimizes the\nmaximum time/distance to each person or 2) a node on a graph that minimizes the\nsum of times/distances to each of the sources. In graph theory, these nodes are\ndenoted as the center and centroid of a graph respectively. In this paper, we\npropose a novel solution for finding the center and centroid of a graph by\nusing a multiple source alternating Dijkstra's Algorithm. Additionally, we\nintroduce a stopping condition that significantly saves on time complexity\nwithout compromising the accuracy of the solution. The results of this paper\nare a low complexity algorithm that is optimal in computing the center of S\nsources among N nodes and a low complexity algorithm that is close to optimal\nfor computing the centroid of S sources among N nodes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
