However, manually creating such comics is currently time-consuming,\ncomplex, and error-prone. In this paper, we propose DG Comics, a novel comic\nauthoring tool for dynamic graphs that allows users to semi-automatically build\nand annotate comics. The tool uses a newly developed hierarchical clustering\nalgorithm to segment consecutive snapshots of dynamic graphs while preserving\ntheir chronological order. It also presents rich information on both\nindividuals and communities extracted from dynamic graphs in multiple views,\nwhere users can explore dynamic graphs and choose what to tell in comics. For\nevaluation, we provide an example and report the results of a user study and an\nexpert review.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"e_fFe5Tg_WvbQREIp7p4wR8UbaSpj4zlhkDTC-FWtJc","pdfSize":"44810423"}
