Moreover, we demonstrate that these sufficient conditions can be\nsatisfied with standard design methods. A small example is presented to\nillustrate the inherent robustness of economic MPC to small disturbances.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
