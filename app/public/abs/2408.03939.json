The impact of introducing additional\ninteraction to the system in such frustrated systems is, however, a highly\ncontroversial issue. On the one hand, numerical studies on geometrically\nfrustrated systems of hard-core boson (equivalent to a spin-1/2 systems)\ntypically lead to glass or solid phases containing only local many-body\ncoherence, indicating the persistence of the damage in quantum coherence. On\nthe other, there continues to be noticeable claims of development of\nsuperfluidity that implies kinetic flow of particles. To resolve this apparent\ncontradiction of great significance, we present a rigorous proof showing that\ndensity-density interaction is incapable of defeating the geometric frustration\nto allow propagation of those immobile particles, let alone sustaining a\nsuperfluidity. Instead, the frustrated systems develop many $\\textit{compact}$\nmany-body localized states as \"many-body scars\" that do not thermalize, making\nthem good candidates for storing $\\textit{robust}$ and $\\textit{manipulable}$\nquantum information.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z0sjdJgJ6tWZPZi7w36dFsJZwAJHzIDgkWBLTJWREs8","pdfSize":"1528606"}
