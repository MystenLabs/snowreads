In this paper, we\nsystematically analyze the challenges of this task: online environment,\nunsupervised nature, and the risks of error accumulation and catastrophic\nforgetting under continual domain shifts. To address these challenges, we\nreshape the online data buffering and organizing mechanism for CTTA. We propose\nan uncertainty-aware buffering approach to identify and aggregate significant\nsamples with high certainty from the unsupervised, single-pass data stream.\nBased on this, we propose a graph-based class relation preservation constraint\nto overcome catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, a pseudo-target replay\nobjective is used to mitigate error accumulation. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method in both segmentation and\nclassification CTTA tasks.
