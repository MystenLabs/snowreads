To address these problems, we performed sample deletion,\nre-labeling, and integration of these two datasets. Additionally, we introduced\nthe PBC and Raabin-WBC datasets, and ultimately created a high-quality,\nsample-balanced new dataset, which we named TXL-PBC. The dataset contains 1008\ntraining sets, 288 validation sets, and 144 test sets. Firstly, The dataset\nunderwent strict manual annotation, automatic annotation with YOLOv8n model,\nand manual audit steps to ensure the accuracy and consistency of annotations.\nSecondly, we addresses the blood cell mislabeling problem of the original\ndatasets. The distribution of label boundary box areas and the number of labels\nare better than the BCCD and BCD datasets. Moreover, we used the YOLOv8n model\nto train these three datasets, the performance of the TXL-PBC dataset surpass\nthe original two datasets. Finally, we employed YOLOv5n, YOLOv5s, YOLOv5l,\nYOLOv8s, YOLOv8m detection models as the baseline models for TXL-PBC. This\nstudy not only enhances the quality of the blood cell dataset but also supports\nresearchers in improving models for blood cell target detection.
