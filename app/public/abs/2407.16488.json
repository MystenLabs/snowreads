The\ndetection capabilities of such surveys rapidly decrease at low frequencies,\nbecause the signals become hardly distinguishable from the background motion of\nstars. In this work, we find that the background motion can be well described\nby a linear model over time, based on which we propose a linear background\nsubtraction scheme. Compared to the conventional quadratic subtraction, the\nadvantage of linear subtraction emerges within the frequency range below $6\n\\times 10^{-9}~{\\rm Hz}$. Taking dark photons with purely gravitational\ninteractions, dark photons with additional $U(1)_{B}$ or $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge\ninteractions, and low-frequency gravitational waves as examples, we illustrate\nthat the linear subtraction scheme can result in an enhancement of more than\none order of magnitude in the exclusion limits of Gaia-like experiments in the\nlow-frequency range.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
