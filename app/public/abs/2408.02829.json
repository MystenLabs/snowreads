Comput. Phys., 272\n(2014)] to deal with arbitrary magnetic field topologies. The original scheme\n(which showed remarkable numerical properties) was valid for the so-called\ntokamak-ordering regime, in which the magnetic field magnitude was not allowed\nto vary much along field lines. The proposed extension maintains the attractive\nfeatures of the original scheme (including the analytical Green's function,\nwhich is critical for tractability) with minor modifications, while allowing\nfor completely general magnetic fields. The accuracy and generality of the\napproach are demonstrated by numerical experiment with an analytical\nmanufactured solution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
