However, prior studies have mostly concentrated on averaged abundances\nor specific flare phases, leaving a gap in exploring the comprehensive\nobservations throughout the entire flare process. Consequently, investigations\ninto this area are relatively scarce. Exploiting the Solar X-ray Monitor data\nobtained from the Chang'E-2 lunar orbiter, we present two comprehensive soft\nX-ray spectroscopic observations of flares in active regions, AR 11149 and\n11158, demonstrating elemental abundance evolutions under different conditions.\nOur findings unveil the inverse first ionization potential (IFIP) effect during\nflares for Fe for the first time, and reaffirm its existence for Si.\nAdditionally, we observed a rare depletion of elemental abundances, marking the\nsecond IFIP effect in flare decay phases. Our study offers a CSHKP model-based\ninterpretation to elucidate the formation of both the FIP and IFIP effects in\nflare dynamics, with the inertia effect being incorporated into the\nponderomotive force fractionation model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
