This derivative is designed to\nreconstruct the discrete Laplacian, enabling an extension of the theory of\nnonlinear wave equations, including quasilinear wave equations, to lattice\ngraphs. We prove the local well-posedness of generalized quasilinear wave\nequations and the long-time well-posedness of these equations for small initial\ndata. Furthermore, we prove the global well-posedness of defocusing semilinear\nwave equations for large initial data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
