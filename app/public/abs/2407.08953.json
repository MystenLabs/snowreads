As a result of axiomatic attribution methods, feature contributions\nhave been explained more clearly and rigorously. There are, however, few\nstudies that have examined domain knowledge in conjunction with the axioms. In\nthis study, we examine asset pricing in finance, a field closely related to\nrisk management. Consequently, when applying machine learning models, we must\nensure that the attribution methods reflect the underlying risks accurately. In\nthis work, we present and study several axioms derived from asset pricing\ndomain knowledge. It is shown that while Shapley value and Integrated Gradients\npreserve most axioms, neither can satisfy all axioms. Using extensive\nanalytical and empirical examples, we demonstrate how attribution methods can\nreflect risks and when they should not be used.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
