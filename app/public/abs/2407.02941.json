The resulting phase diagram shows that there is a\ntopologically nontrivial phase with the Chern number $C=1$, emerging via the\ndevelopment of the imbalance between $U_{\\text{A}}$ and $U_{\\text{B}}$. In this\nphase, the antiferromagnetic correlations are observed in the ED calculation,\nin line with the finite antiferromagnetic order obtained by the MF method. The\nspontaneous symmetry breaking of SU(2) spin rotation in the phase is also\nidentified in the MF level. Distinct from previous studies in which the exotic\n$C=1$ phase relies on the interplay between sublattice-dependent potentials and\nelectronic interactions, our paper presents an alternative way by solely tuning\nthe on-site interactions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
