When all blocks have\nsize 2, this reduces to the repeated averages studied in [CDSZ22], a version of\nthe averaging process on a graph [AL12]. We study the convergence to\nequilibrium of this process as a function of the distribution of the block\nsize, and provide sharp conditions for the emergence of the cutoff phenomenon.\nMoreover, we characterize the size of the cutoff window and provide an explicit\nGaussian cutoff profile. To complete the analysis, we study in detail the\nsimplified case where the block size is not random. We show that the absence of\na cutoff is equivalent to having blocks of size $n^{\\Omega(1)}$, in which case\nwe provide a convergence in distribution for the total variation distance at\nany given time, showing that, on the proper time scale, it remains constantly 1\nup to an exponentially distributed random time, after which it decays following\na Poissonian profile.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dHSaKdA7fANBoHRGBYm1KZt6rwmesWxnY7mqhTEr0dY","pdfSize":"833318"}
