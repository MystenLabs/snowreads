Furthermore, we\npresent four new benchmark datasets for graph machine learning, created from\nlarge RDF knowledge graphs using our framework. These datasets serve as\nvaluable resources for evaluating graph machine learning approaches, such as\ngraph neural networks. Overall, our framework effectively bridges the gap\nbetween the Graph Machine Learning and Semantic Web communities, paving the way\nfor RDF-based machine learning applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GEmlvfbK1OUb8NimA8wR-QApxdBFwe9zWyYtWaTQHmk","pdfSize":"595423"}
