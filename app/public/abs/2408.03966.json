Community detection algorithms have numerous practical\napplications, particularly due to their scalability with data size.\nNonetheless, a notable drawback of community detection algorithms is their\ncomputational intensity~\\cite{Apostol2014}, resulting in decreasing performance\nas data size increases. For this purpose, new frameworks that employ\ndistributed systems such as Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark which can seamlessly\nhandle large-scale graphs must be developed. In this paper, we propose a novel\nframework for community detection algorithms, i.e., K-Cliques, Louvain, and\nFast Greedy, developed using Apache Spark GraphFrames. We test their\nperformance and scalability on two real-world datasets. The experimental\nresults prove the feasibility of developing graph mining algorithms using\nApache Spark GraphFrames.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
