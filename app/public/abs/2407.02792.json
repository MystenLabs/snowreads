Fluid\nflow was found to be capable of controlling the structure and effective\ntemperature of LLPS, but the extent and precision of control were less than\noptimal. In this article, we propose that patterned flow can be employed as a\ngeneric tool to manipulate LLPS effectively. By combining theoretical modeling\nand numerical simulations, we demonstrate that flows with tailor-made\nstructures can become functional, allowing us to control diverse aspects of\nLLPS. Typical examples include the capture and pinning of droplets, fine-tuning\nof droplet sizes, forced assembly of periodic droplet arrays, and the\nremodeling of the kinetics and structure of phase separation. These\nmanipulations are grounded on the redistribution of chemical potential by the\nstructured flow. Our results not only can lead to potential LLPS-based\ntechnologies, but also highlight the rich behavior of LLPS introduced by the\npatterned flow.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
