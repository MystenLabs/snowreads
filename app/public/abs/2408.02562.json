In the process of defining what fast\nmeans exactly, we faced a number of interesting issues that arise when\nconventional time metrics are applied to asynchronous implementations. We\ndiscovered some gaps in latency claims made in earlier work on snapshot\nalgorithms, which hampers their comparative time-complexity analysis. We then\ncame up with a new unifying time-complexity analysis that captures the latency\nof an operation in an asynchronous, long-lived implementation, which allowed us\nto formally grasp latency improvements of our solution with respect to the\nstate-of-the-art protocols: optimal latency in fault-free runs without\ncontention, short constant latency in fault-free runs with contention, the\nworst-case latency proportional to the number of failures, and constant, close\nto optimal amortized latency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
