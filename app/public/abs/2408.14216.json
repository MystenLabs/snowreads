To do so, it uses consecutive sweeps through the BDDs to\nresolve computations. Yet, this approach has kept algorithms for multi-variable\nquantification, the relational product, and variable reordering out of its\nscope.\n  In this work, we address this by introducing the nested sweeping framework.\nHere, multiple concurrent sweeps pass information between eachother to compute\nthe result. We have implemented the framework in Adiar and used it to create a\nnew external memory multi-variable quantification algorithm. Compared to\nconventional depth-first implementations, Adiar with nested sweeping is able to\nsolve more instances of our benchmarks and/or solve them faster.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
