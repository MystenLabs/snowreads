We present relevant query evaluation tasks, and notions\nof tractable circuits. We then show how these tractable circuits can be used to\naddress database tasks. We first focus on Boolean provenance and its\napplications for aggregation tasks, in particular probabilistic query\nevaluation. We study these for Monadic Second Order (MSO) queries on trees, and\nfor safe Conjunctive Queries (CQs) and Union of Conjunctive Queries (UCQs). We\nalso study circuit representations of query answers, and their applications to\nenumeration tasks: both in the Boolean setting (for MSO) and the multivalued\nsetting (for CQs and UCQs).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"31cxcH-zbUutUnV2IM4Tt1XQ-2wHdkSzmsDnPSvgpWM","pdfSize":"479818"}
