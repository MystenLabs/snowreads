We quantify the long-timescale\ncorrelations of these evolving networks by an autocorrelative measure of edge\npersistence. Several distinct patterns of autocorrelation arise, including\npower-law decay and exponential decay, depending on the choice of node-variable\ndynamics and connection probability function. Our methods are also applicable\nin wider contexts; our temporal network models are tractable mathematically and\nin simulation, and our long-term memory quantification is analytically\ntractable and straightforwardly computable from temporal network data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
