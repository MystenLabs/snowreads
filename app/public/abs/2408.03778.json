These algebras\nnaturally generalize biserial and special biserial algebras to algebras of wild\nrepresentation type, in a different direction of multiserial and special\nmultiserial algebras. We show that all special quasi-biserial algebras are\nquasi-biserial, all special quasi-biserial algebras are quotients of symmetric\nspecial quasi-biserial algebras and all symmetric special quasi-biserial\nalgebras are labeled Brauer graph algebras. Moreover, we show that the labeled\nBrauer graph algebras are derived equivalent under Kauer moves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
