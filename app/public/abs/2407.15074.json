On the other hand, the vector mean free path provides\nexact solutions for the linearized Boltzmann transport equation, and in\nprinciple, we can systematically evaluate it to any desired order in the\nexternal magnetic field. After laying out the general formalism of the\nmagneto-thermoelectric responses of anisotropic systems based on the vector\nmean free path approach, we study the longitudinal and Hall charge\nconductivities, as well as the Seebeck and Nernst coefficients of two\nrepresentative anisotropic two-dimensional electronic systems: a semi-Dirac\nsemimetal and a two-dimensional system of tilted massless Dirac fermions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
