This enables neuromorphic sensors to sample at a\nmicro-second level and efficiently capture the dynamics. Since, only sequences\nof asynchronous event changes are recorded rather than brightness intensities\nover time, many traditional image processing techniques cannot be directly\napplied. Furthermore, existing approaches, including the ones recently\nintroduced by the authors, use traditional images combined with neuromorphic\nevent data to carry out reconstructions. The aim of this work is introduce an\noptimization based approach to reconstruct images and dynamics only from the\nneuromoprhic event data without any additional knowledge of the events. Each\npixel is modeled temporally. The experimental results on real data highlight\nthe efficacy of the presented approach, paving the way for efficient and\naccurate processing of neuromorphic sensor data in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
