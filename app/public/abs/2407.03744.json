These transmission conditions, which are\nshown to be consistent with generalized Snell's law written in the laboratory\nframe, are then used to examine the effect of motion on waves incident on a\nmagnetized plasma. For an incident wave in the plane perpendicular to the\nmagnetic field the motion is observed to lead to non negligible deviation of\nthe low-frequency X-mode, as well as to non-symmetrical total reflection\nangles. These effects are shown to be further complicated when the magnetic\nfield is in the plane formed by the incident wavevector and the medium's\nvelocity, as the anisotropy now competes with the motion-induced drag. Although\nobtained in simplified configurations, these results suggest that accounting\nfor motion when modeling plasma waves trajectory could be important under\ncertain conditions, calling for a more detailed quantification of the effect of\nmotion in actual diagnostics and plasma control schemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
