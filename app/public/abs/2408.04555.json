To answer this question, we design\nmeta-mechanisms that provide a uniform way of transforming mechanisms from\nclassical models to mechanisms over networks and prove that the desirable\nproperties are preserved by our meta-mechanisms. Our meta-mechanisms provide\nsolutions to combinatorial auction scenarios in the network setting: (1)\ncombinatorial auction with single-minded buyers and (2) combinatorial auction\nwith general monotone valuation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the\nfirst work that designs combinatorial auctions over a social network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
