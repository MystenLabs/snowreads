They assume uniform and strict rotational symmetry across all\nfeatures, as the transformations under the specific group. However, real-world\ndata rarely conforms to strict rotational symmetry commonly referred to as\nRotational Symmetry-Breaking in the system or dataset, making GConv unable to\nadapt effectively to this phenomenon. Motivated by this, we propose a simple\nbut highly effective method to address this problem, which utilizes a set of\nlearnable biases called the $G$-Biases under the group order to break strict\ngroup constraints and achieve \\textbf{R}elaxed \\textbf{R}otational\n\\textbf{E}quivarant \\textbf{Conv}olution (RREConv). We conduct extensive\nexperiments to validate Relaxed Rotational Equivariance on rotational symmetry\ngroups $\\mathcal{C}_n$ (e.g. $\\mathcal{C}_2$, $\\mathcal{C}_4$, and\n$\\mathcal{C}_6$ groups). Further experiments demonstrate that our proposed\nRREConv-based methods achieve excellent performance, compared to existing\nGConv-based methods in classification and detection tasks on natural image\ndatasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
