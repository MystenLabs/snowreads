Our study examines\nauctions with groups distinguished by specific attributes, seeking to (1)\ndefine a fairness notion that ensures equitable treatment for all, (2) identify\nmechanisms that adhere to this fairness while preserving incentive\ncompatibility, and (3) explore the balance between fairness and seller's\nrevenue. We introduce two fairness notions-group fairness and individual\nfairness-and propose two corresponding auction mechanisms: the Group\nProbability Mechanism, which meets group fairness and incentive criteria, and\nthe Group Score Mechanism, which also encompasses individual fairness. Through\nexperiments, we validate these mechanisms' effectiveness in promoting fairness\nand examine their implications for seller revenue.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
