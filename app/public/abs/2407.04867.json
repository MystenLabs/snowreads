These techniques are applied to\nvarious formulations for rectangle packing, conjectured to be pairwise-ideal.\nAdditionally, we address a variation of the rectangle packing problem which\nincorporates clearances along selected edges of the packed objects. We present\nboth existing and novel MBLP formulations for the underlying disjunctive\nprogram and investigate the poor performance of Gurobi's default branch-and-cut\nmethodology. We operate under a strip-packing objective that aims to minimize\nthe overall height of the packed objects.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
