Ripepi), covering 110 square degrees in the outer\nregions of the Magellanic Clouds (MCs), a pair of interacting galaxies and the\nmost massive dwarf satellites of the Milky Way. %The survey achieves a notable\nphotometric depth, allowing us to resolve faint, old stellar populations. Among\nthe key results, we discovered four star clusters (SCs) within the Large\nMagellanic Cloud (LMC) exhibiting ages within the so-called \"age gap\", a period\ndeemed so far devoid of SCs. Additionally, we unveiled an ancient stellar\nsystem associated with the LMC, featuring structural properties in between the\nglobular clusters and the ultra-faint dwarf galaxies of the Local Group. These\ndiscoveries significantly contribute to our understanding of the MCs' evolution\nand their complex interaction history.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
