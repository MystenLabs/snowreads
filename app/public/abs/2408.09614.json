HD\n73344 also hosts a compact inner planetary system, including a transiting\nsub-Neptune HD 73344 b ($P_{b}=15.61\\ \\mathrm{days}$,\n$r_{b}=2.88^{+0.08}_{-0.07}\\ \\mathrm{R_{\\oplus}}$) and a non-transiting\nSaturn-mass planet ($P_{c}=65.936\\ \\mathrm{days}$,\n$m_{c}\\sin{i_c}=0.36^{+0.02}_{-0.02}\\ \\mathrm{M_{J}}$). By analyzing TESS light\ncurves, we identified a stellar rotation period of $9.03\\pm{1.3}$ days.\nCombining this with $v\\sin{i_*}$ measurements from stellar spectra, we derived\na stellar inclination of $63.6^{+17.4}_{-16.5}\\ \\rm{deg} $. Furthermore, by\ncombining radial velocities and Hipparcos-Gaia astrometric acceleration, we\ncharacterized the three-dimensional orbit of the outer giant planet and\nconstrained its mutual inclination relative to the innermost transiting planet\nto be $46 <\\Delta I_{bd}< 134\\ \\rm{deg}\\ (1\\sigma)$ and $20 <\\Delta I_{bd}<\n160\\ \\rm{deg}\\ (2\\sigma)$, strongly disfavoring coplanar architectures. Our\nanalytical calculations and N-body simulation reveal that the two inner planets\nare strongly coupled with each other and undergo nodal precession together\naround the orbital axis of the giant planet. During nodal precession, the\norbital inclination of inner planets oscillate with time and therefore become\nmisaligned relative to the stellar spin axis. The formation of such systems\nsuggests a history of planet-planet scattering or misalignment between the\ninner and outer components of protoplanetary disks. The upcoming release of\nGaia DR4 will uncover more systems similar to HD 73344 and enable the study of\nthe flatness of exoplanet systems with a mixture of inner and outer planetary\nsystems on a statistical level.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p-S9aQBelnv1f8d8UxjYIOUAUAlyc_NFqglGDh51RsI","pdfSize":"7133661"}
