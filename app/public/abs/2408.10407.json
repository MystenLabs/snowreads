In this study, we investigate the magneto-optical\nproperties of the G4V centers under high compressive hydrostatic pressures up\nto 180~GPa. The spin-orbit splitting for the electronic ground and excited\nstates and the hyperfine tensors are calculated by means of plane wave\nsupercell density functional theory as unique fingerprints of these defects. To\nthis end, we developed a theory for calculating the hyperfine tensors when the\nelectronic states are subject to Jahn--Teller effect. We find that the\nzero-phonon-line energy increases with adding hydrostatic pressures where the\ncoupling strength increases from SiV($-$) to PbV($-$). On the other hand, the\ncalculated photoionization threshold energies indicate that the operation of\nPbV($-$) based quantum sensor is limited up to 30~GPa of hydrostatic pressure\nwhereas SnV($-$), GeV($-$) and SiV($-$) remain photostable up to 180~GPa of\nhydrostatic pressure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
