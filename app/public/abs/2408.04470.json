However, these findings primarily relied on idealized\nnumerical experiments, which do not fully capture the realistic conditions of\nsubhalo evolution within a hierarchical cosmological context. Based on the\nAquarius simulations, we identify clear segregation in the population of\nsurviving and disrupted subhalos, which corresponds to two distinct acquisition\nchannels of subhalos. We find that all of the first-order subhalos accreted\nafter redshift 2 survive to the present time without suffering from artificial\ndisruption. On the other hand, most of the disrupted subhalos are sub-subhalos\naccreted at high redshift. Unlike the first-order subhalos, sub-subhalos\nexperience pre-processing and many of them are accreted through major mergers\nat high redshift, resulting in very high mass loss rates. We confirm these high\nmass loss rates are physical through both numerical experiments and\nsemi-analytical modeling, thus supporting a physical origin for their rapid\ndisappearance in the simulation. Even though we cannot verify whether these\nsubhalos have fully disrupted or not, their extreme mass loss rates dictate\nthat they can at most contribute a negligible fraction to the very low mass end\nof the subhalo mass function. We thus conclude that current state-of-the-art\ncosmological simulations have reliably resolved the subhalo population.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
