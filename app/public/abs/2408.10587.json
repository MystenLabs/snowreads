By the separation\ntheorem for convex sets, we get the representation theorems for this convex\nexpectation and conditional convex expectation. Based on these results, we\nobtain the variational equation for cost functional by weak convergence and\ndiscretization methods. Furthermore, we establish the maximum principle which\nis sufficient under usual convex assumptions. Finally, we study the linear\nquadratic control problem by using the obtained maximum principle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
