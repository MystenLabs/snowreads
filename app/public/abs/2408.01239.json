The nanodevices face size and\npower constraints that produce erroneous raw data for localization purposes.\nOn-body anchors receive this data, and use it to derive the locations of\ndiagnostic events of interest. Different Machine Learning (ML) approaches have\nbeen recently proposed for this task, yet they are currently restricted to a\nreference bloodstream of a resting patient. As such, they are unable to deal\nwith the physical diversity of patients' bloodstreams and cannot provide\ncontinuous monitoring due to changes in individual patient's activities. Toward\naddressing these issues for the current State-of-the-Art (SotA) flow-guided\nlocalization approach based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), we propose a\npipeline for GNN adaptation based on individual physiological indicators\nincluding height, weight, and heart rate. Our results indicate that the\nproposed adaptions are beneficial in reconciling the individual differences\nbetween bloodstreams and activities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
