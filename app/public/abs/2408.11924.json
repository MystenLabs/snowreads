We treat self-adjoint\noperators and degenerate cases. We apply the bounds to the eigenvector\ncontinuation method, which consists in creating the reduced space by using\nbasis vectors extracted from perturbation theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
