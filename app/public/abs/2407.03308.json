This work aims to enhance\ntemporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstruction using an\nimproved deep learning method. The training-optimized methods and five\nclassical neural networks were applied on the 2-fold and 4-fold under-sampling\nk-space data to reconstruct the temperature maps. The enhanced training modules\nincluded offline/online data augmentations, knowledge distillation, and the\namplitude-phase decoupling loss function. The heating experiments were\nperformed by a FUS transducer on phantom and ex vivo tissues, respectively.\nThese data were manually under-sampled to imitate acceleration procedures and\ntrained in our method to get the reconstruction model. The additional dozen or\nso testing datasets were separately obtained for evaluating the real-time\nperformance and temperature accuracy. Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were\nfound for 2 times and 4 times k-space under-sampling strategies and the\nResUNet-based deep learning reconstruction performed exceptionally well. In\n2-fold acceleration scenario, the RMSE of temperature map patches provided the\nvalues of 0.888 degree centigrade and 1.145 degree centigrade on phantom and ex\nvivo testing datasets. The DICE value of temperature areas enclosed by 43\ndegree centigrade isotherm was 0.809, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed a\nbias of -0.253 degree centigrade with the apart of plus or minus 2.16 degree\ncentigrade. In 4 times under-sampling case, these evaluating values decreased\nby approximately 10%. This study demonstrates that deep learning-based\nreconstruction can significantly enhance the accuracy and efficiency of MR\nthermometry for clinical FUS thermal therapies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
