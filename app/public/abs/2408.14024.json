Research policy makers and academic leaders frequently call for\ncloser collaboration between academia and societal stakeholders to address the\ngrand challenges of our time. This bibliometric study evaluates progress in\ncollaboration between academia and three societal stakeholders: industry,\ngovernment, and nonprofit organisations. It analyses the level of co-publishing\nbetween academia and these societal stakeholders over the period 2013-2022. We\nfound that research collaboration between academia and all stakeholder types\nstudied grew in absolute terms. However, academia-industry collaboration\ndeclined 16% relative to overall academic output while academia-government and\nacademia-nonprofit collaboration grew at roughly the same pace as academic\noutput. Country and field of research breakdowns revealed wide variance. In\nlight of previous work, we consider potential explanations for the gap between\npolicymakers' aspirations and the real global trends. This study is a useful\ndemonstration of large scale, quantitative bibliometric techniques for research\npolicymakers to track the impact of decisions related to funding, intellectual\nproperty law, and nonprofit support.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
