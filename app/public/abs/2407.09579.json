A Gravastar is an astronomically\nhypothetically condensed object which is a gravitationally dark vacuum star or\na gravitational vacuum condensate star, which is singularity free, spherically\nsymmetric and also super compact. The current study concerns about the model of\nthe Gravastar in the modified $f(R,L_{m}, T)$ gravity considering the form\n$f(R,L_{m},T) = R + {\\alpha}TL_{m} $. From Mazur-Mottola\n\\cite{Mazur}-\\cite{Mottola}, we get to know that a Gravastar model has three\ndistinct regions having various Equations of State (EoS). We have inquired into\nthe interior portion with the space-time considering $ \\rho = - p $, for the\ndark sector of the interior region, here the negative matter-energy density\nexerting a repulsive force on the immediate thin shell with the EoS $ \\rho = p\n$ where it is considered as an ultra-relativistic fluid. We have studied the\nproperties such as energy density, proper length, total energy and entropy.\nNext comes the vacuum exterior region of the Gravastar which is being described\nby the Schwarzschild-de-Sitter solution. And also from Darmois-Israel\nformalism, we have probed the junction connecting the inner and the outer\nsurfaces of the Gravastar.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
