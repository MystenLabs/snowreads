During the finite element\nanalysis, it is necessary to determine the far-field DtN conditions at virtual\nboundaries where both displacements and tractions are unknown. In this study,\nfirstly, the scattered waves at the virtual boundaries are represented by a\nsuperposition of guided waves with unknown scattered coefficients. Secondly,\nutilizing the mode orthogonality, the unknown tractions at virtual boundaries\nare expressed in terms of the unknown scattered displacements at virtual\nboundaries via scattered coefficients. Thirdly, this relationship at virtual\nboundaries can be finally assembled into the global DtN-FEM matrix to solve the\nproblem. This method is simple and elegant, which has advantages on dimension\nreduction and needs no absorption medium or perfectly matched layer to suppress\nthe reflected waves compared to traditional FEM. Furthermore, the reflection\nand transmission coefficients of each guided mode can be directly obtained\nwithout post-processing. This proposed DtN-FEM will be compared with boundary\nelement method (BEM), and finally validated for several benchmark problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
