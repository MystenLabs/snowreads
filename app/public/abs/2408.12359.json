It has already been\nwidely deployed by large providers and the adoption rate is getting to a\ncritical point. Almost half of all the global prefixes are now covered by RPKI\nand measurements show that 27% of networks are already using RPKI to validate\nBGP announcements. Over the past 10 years, there has been much research effort\nin RPKI, analyzing different facets of the protocol, such as software\nvulnerabilities, robustness of the infrastructure or the proliferation of RPKI\nvalidation. In this work we compile the first systemic overview of the\nvulnerabilities and misconfigurations in RPKI and quantify the security\nlandscape of the global RPKI deployments based on our measurements and\nanalysis. Our study discovers that 56% of the global RPKI validators suffer\nfrom at least one documented vulnerability. We also do a systematization of\nknowledge for existing RPKI security research and complement the existing\nknowledge with novel measurements in which we discover new trends in\navailability of RPKI repositories, and their communication patterns with the\nRPKI validators. We weave together the results of existing research and our\nstudy, to provide a comprehensive tableau of vulnerabilities, their sources,\nand to derive future research paths necessary to prepare RPKI for full global\ndeployment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
