The main novelty of this paper is two-fold: First, for the Cauchy\nproblem and Dirichlet problem, we prove that a strong or smooth solution exists\nglobally, provided that the vorticity of velocity satisfies Serrin's condition\nand the maximum norm of the divergence of the velocity is bounded. Second, for\nthe Navier-slip boundary condition, we show that if both the maximum norm of\nthe vorticity of velocity and the maximum norm of the divergence of velocity\nare bounded, then the solution exists globally. In particular, this criterion\nextends the well-known Beale-Kato-Majda's blowup criterion for the 3D\nincompressible Euler equations (Comm. Math. Phys. 94(1984):61-66) to the 3D\nbarotropic compressible Navier-Stokes equations, and can be regarded as a\ncomplement for the work by Huang-Li-Xin (Comm. Math. Phys. 301(2011):23-35).\nThe vacuum is allowed to exist here.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
