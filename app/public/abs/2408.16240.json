The submodule $\\langle E_M(N)\\rangle$ generated by the envelope $E_M(N)$\nof $N$ is instrumental in studying rings and modules that satisfy the radical\nformula. We show that: 1) the semiprime radical is an invariant on all the\nsubmodules which are respectively generated by envelopes in the ascending chain\nof envelopes of a given submodule; 2) for rings that satisfy the radical\nformula, $\\langle E_M(0)\\rangle$ is an idempotent radical and it induces a\ntorsion theory whose torsion class consists of all nil $R$-modules and the\ntorsionfree class consists of all reduced $R$-modules; 3) Noetherian uniserial\nmodules satisfy the semiprime radical formula and their semiprime radical is a\nnil module; and lastly, 4) we construct a sheaf of nil $R$-modules on\n$\\text{Spec}(R)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
