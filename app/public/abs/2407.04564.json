Single-crystal XRD has characterized the material\nand belongs to a monoclinic structure with a C2 space group. Functional groups\nwere determined using Fourier-transformed infrared spectroscopy. The optical\nquality of the generated crystal was evaluated using UV-Vis NIR spectral\nanalysis, which is transparent in the range of 300-1500 nm. We report the\noptical properties using terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) and THz\ngeneration using crystal.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
