GAPS is the largest dataset of real guitar audio,\ncontaining 14 hours of freely available audio-score aligned pairs, recorded in\ndiverse conditions by over 200 performers, together with high-resolution\nnote-level MIDI alignments and performance videos. These enable us to train a\nstate-of-the-art model for automatic transcription of solo guitar recordings\nwhich can generalise well to real world audio that is unseen during training.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
