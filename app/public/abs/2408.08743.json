The rf driving current was applied to\nNiFe foils of different shapes. In rectangular samples with a close-to-uniform\nflow of the applied current along the long edge of the sample we find the\nresonance field to follow a simple 'cos' dependence on the angle between the\ncurrent and external dc magnetic field. We argue that this behavior cannot be\nexplained by the in-plane demagnetizing field of the rectangular foil. In\ntriangular samples where the current partially flows along all three sample\nedges we observed three independent 'cos' features. The latter suggests\nindividual contributions from different areas with different current\ndirections. We were able to switch off one of these contributions by covering\none edge of the triangular sample with a conducting overlayer and thereby\neffectively short-circuiting the corresponding current path. Our findings\nhighlight the significance of driving current distributions in ferromagnetic\nresonance experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
