Additionally, it provides enhanced security through fundamental\nprinciples like the measurement postulate and the no-cloning theorem, enabling\nsecure protocols such as quantum teleportation and quantum key distribution.\nWhile advancements in secure quantum machine learning are notable, the\ndevelopment of secure and distributed quantum analogues of kernel-based machine\nlearning techniques remains underexplored.\n  In this work, we present a novel approach for securely computing common\nkernels, including polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and Laplacian\nkernels, when data is distributed, using quantum feature maps. Our methodology\nintroduces a robust framework that leverages quantum teleportation to ensure\nsecure and distributed kernel learning. The proposed architecture is validated\nusing IBM's Qiskit Aer Simulator on various public datasets.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P8GHTloqSTPvBZEJKr1zZ66SNyFnWYJtmighdbz3Bbs","pdfSize":"611226"}
