The study traces the evolution of\nLLMs from their foundational technologies to the latest developments in\ndomain-specific models and multimodal integration. It explores the technical\nprogression from encoder-based models requiring fine-tuning to sophisticated\napproaches that integrate textual, visual, and auditory data, thereby\nfacilitating comprehensive AI solutions in healthcare. The paper discusses both\nthe opportunities these technologies present for enhancing clinical efficiency\nand the challenges they pose in terms of ethics, data privacy, and\nimplementation. Additionally, it critically evaluates the deployment strategies\nof LLMs, emphasizing the necessity of open-source models to ensure data privacy\nand adaptability within healthcare environments. Future research directions are\nproposed, focusing on empirical studies to evaluate the real-world efficacy of\nLLMs in healthcare and the development of open datasets for further research.\nThis review aims to provide a comprehensive resource for both newcomers and\nmultidisciplinary researchers interested in the intersection of AI and\nhealthcare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yAQwD5y24XzJYwCnHCL-Khbm3oUSDuT6nH4dyDtfiXc","pdfSize":"383010"}
