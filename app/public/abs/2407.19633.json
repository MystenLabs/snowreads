However, most such problems are still solved\nheuristically by hand rather than optimally by state-of-the art solvers because\nthe expertise required to formulate and solve these problems limits the\nwidespread adoption of optimization tools and techniques. We introduce a Large\nLanguage Model (LLM)-based system designed to formulate and solve (mixed\ninteger) linear programming problems from their natural language descriptions.\nOur system is capable of developing mathematical models, writing and debugging\nsolver code, evaluating the generated solutions, and improving efficiency and\ncorrectness of its model and code based on these evaluations. OptiMUS-0.3\nutilizes a modular structure to process problems, allowing it to handle\nproblems with long descriptions and complex data without long prompts.\nExperiments demonstrate that OptiMUS-0.3 outperforms existing state-of-the-art\nmethods on easy datasets by more than 12% and on hard datasets (including a new\ndataset, NLP4LP, released with this paper that features long and complex\nproblems) by more than 8%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qxEQgywvmsaJXcI9nw8IkANVcRD5yvd-jtqEiO4y2ds","pdfSize":"2364086"}
