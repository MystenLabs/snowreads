That is, we introduce a\ncollection of true equations among Toffoli-Hadamard circuits on three qubits\nthat is sufficient to derive any other true equation between such circuits. To\nobtain this equational theory, we first consider circuits over the Toffoli-K\ngate set { X, CX, CCX, K }, where K = HxH. The Toffoli-Hadamard and Toffoli-K\ngate sets appear similar, but they are crucially different on exactly three\nqubits. Indeed, in this case, the former generates an infinite group of\noperators, while the latter generates the finite group of automorphisms of the\nwell-known E8 lattice. We take advantage of this fact, and of the theory of\nautomorphism groups of lattices, to obtain a sound and complete collection of\nequations for Toffoli-K circuits. We then extend this equational theory to one\nfor Toffoli-Hadamard circuits by leveraging prior work of Li et al. on\nToffoli-Hadamard operators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5rpWy5BayhEXVp1YHYHoxAwuMwFU7UhW9pB5avFDtuk","pdfSize":"420715"}
