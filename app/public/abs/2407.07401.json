The notion of size multipartite Ramsey\nnumber has been introduced by Burger and Vuuren in 2004. It is worth noting\nthat, this concept is derived by using the idea of the original classical\nRamsey number, multipartite Ramsey number and the size Ramsey number. In this\npaper, we focus on mj(H, G) and find a lower bound for mj (H, G) based on the\nchromatic number of H and the order of G. Also, for graphs G with large maximum\ndegree, we obtain a tight lower bound for mj(Km, G). Furthermore, we determine\nthe order of magnitude of mj(Km, K1,n), for j >= m >= 3 and n >= 2. Then we\nspecify the exact values of mj(Km, K1,n) for the cases m = j, m = 3 and j = 0\nor m-2 (mod m-2).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
