Biological materials may exhibit remarkable\ncompressibility when under large deformations, and we take this factor into\naccount for accurate predictions of their morphoelastic changes. The\nmorphoelastic shell model combines the growth model of Rodriguez et al. and a\nnovel shell model developed by us. We start from the three-dimensional (3D)\nmorphoelastic model and construct the optimal shell energy based on a series\nexpansion around the middle surface. A two-step variational method is applied\nthat retains the leading-order expansion coefficient while eliminating the\nhigher-order ones. The main outcome is a two-dimensional (2D) shell energy\ndepending on the stretching and bending strains of the middle surface. The\nderived morphoelastic shell model is asymptotically consistent with\nthree-dimensional morphoelasticity and can recover various shell models in\nliterature. Several examples are shown for the verification and illustration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
