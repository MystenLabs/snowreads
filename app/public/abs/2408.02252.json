The proofs rely on (1) a physical space\ntransformation theory between the Teukolsky equations and the Regge-Wheeler\nequations on Schwarzschild-Anti de Sitter backgrounds and (2) novel energy and\nCarleman estimates handling the coupling of the two Teukolsky equations through\nthe boundary conditions thereby generalising earlier work of \\cite{Hol.Smu13}\nfor the covariant wave equation. Specifically, we also produce purely physical\nspace Carleman estimates.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
