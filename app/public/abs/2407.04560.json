We are developing a system that can\nidentify and transform facial expressions into emojis to provide immediate\nfeedback.The project consists of two components. Initially, we will employ\nsophisticated image processing techniques and neural networks to construct a\ndeep learning model capable of precisely categorising facial expressions. Next,\nwe will develop a basic application that records live video using the camera on\nyour device. The app will utilise a sophisticated model to promptly analyse\nfacial expressions and promptly exhibit corresponding emojis.Our objective is\nto develop a dynamic tool that integrates deep learning and real-time video\nprocessing for the purposes of online education, virtual events, gaming, and\nenhancing user experience. This tool enhances interactions and introduces novel\nemotional intelligence technologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
