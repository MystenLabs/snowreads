For example, researchers\nuse log data to develop systems that can provide students with personalized\nproblem recommendations based on their knowledge level. However, anomalies in\nthe students log data, such as cheating to solve programming problems, could\nintroduce a hidden bias in the log data. As a result, these systems may provide\ninaccurate problem recommendations, and therefore, defeat their purpose.\nClassical cheating detection methods, such as MOSS, can be used to detect code\nplagiarism. However, these methods cannot detect other abnormal events such as\na student gaming a system with multiple attempts of similar solutions to a\nparticular programming problem. This paper presents a preliminary study to\nanalyze log data with anomalies. The goal of our work is to overcome the\nabnormal instances when modeling personalizable recommendations in programming\nlearning environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"fHJoPT7tHSL5nrDRfKFGx5AUByhMHiOIu-vqqCz1oHM","pdfSize":"771510"}
