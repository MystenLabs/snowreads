In the first part of the article, we consider\nBrezis-Oswald problem involving the mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace\noperator and establish existence, uniqueness, boundedness and strong maximum\nprinciple. Further, for some mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace type\nequations, we obtain Sturmian comparison theorem, prove some comparsion\nresults, nonexistence results, establish weighted Hardy type inequality and\nstudy a system of singular mixed anisotropic and nonlocal $p$-Laplace\nequations. One of the key ingredient is the combination of Picone identity\nalready available in the separate local and nonlocal cases. In the second part\nof the article, we are mainly concerned with regularity estimates. To this end,\nin the elliptic setting, we establish weak Harnack inequality and\nsemicontinuity results. Further, we consider a class of doubly nonlinear mixed\nanisotropic and nonlocal equations and prove semicontinuity results and\npointwise behavior of solutions. These are based on suitable energy estimates\nand De Giorgi type lemmas and expansion of positivity. Finally, we establish\nvarious energy estimates which may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
