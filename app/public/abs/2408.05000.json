This search targets $t\\bar{t}$ production, in which\nboth top quarks decay into a bottom quark and a $W$ boson, where one of the $W$\nbosons decays hadronically and the other decays into an electron or muon and a\nheavy neutral lepton. The heavy neutral lepton is identified through a decay\ninto an electron or muon and another $W$ boson, resulting in a pair of\nsame-charge same-flavor leptons in the final state. This paper presents the\nfirst search for heavy neutral leptons in the mass range of 15$-$75 GeV using\n$t\\bar{t}$ events. No significant excess is observed over the background\nexpectation, and upper limits are placed on the signal cross-sections. Assuming\na benchmark scenario of the phenomenological type-I seesaw model, these\ncross-section limits are then translated into upper limits on the mixing\nparameters of the heavy Majorana neutrino with Standard Model neutrinos.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BqfllaqI02V3cK47Yc_dwyA0UlKaQc543qG6eFCj22c","pdfSize":"2118846"}
