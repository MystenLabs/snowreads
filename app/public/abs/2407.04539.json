We provide analytical and geometric characterizations\nof integrability for differential $q$-forms, $q=0,1,2,n-1,n$ (in dimension\n$n$), vectors, bivectors, symmetric $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$ tensors, as well as\ncomplex-diagonalizable and nilpotent tensors of type $(1,1)$. In most cases,\nintegrability is equivalent to algebraic constancy of $\\Theta$ coupled with the\nvanishing of one or more suitably defined Nijenhuis-type tensors, depending on\n$\\Theta$ via a quasilinear first-order differential operator. For\n$(p,q)=(1,1)$, they include the ordinary Nijenhuis tensor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
