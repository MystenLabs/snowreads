Our pattern detection criterion is a quantitative extension\nof the criterion that Zaffora Blando used to characterize the algorithmically\nrandom (i.e., Martin-L\\\"of random) sequences. Our proof uses Lutz's and\nMayordomo's respective characterizations of algorithmic dimension in terms of\ngales and Kolmogorov complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
