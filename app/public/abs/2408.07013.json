We study the symplectic\naction on X of a group G of order 4 that contains i, and the natural involution\ninduced on Y (the two groups give two different results). We classify the\nirreducible components of the moduli space of X and Y in the projective case,\ngiving some explicit examples. We give lattice-theoretic criteria that a\nNikulin-type orbifold N has to satisfy to admit a symplectic involution that\ndeforms to an induced one.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
