Rubin Observatory will\ndeliver high-quality, temporally-sparse observations of millions of Solar\nSystem objects on an unprecedented scale. Such datasets will likely enable the\nprecise estimation of small body properties on a population-wide basis. In this\nwork, we consider the possible applications of photometric data points from the\nLSST to the characterisation of Jupiter-family comet (JFC) nuclei. We simulate\nsparse-in-time lightcurve points with an LSST-like cadence for the orbit of a\nJFC between 2024-2033. Convex lightcurve inversion is used to assess whether\nthe simulation input parameters can be accurately reproduced for a sample of\nnucleus rotation periods, pole orientations, activity onsets, shapes and sizes.\nWe find that the rotation period and pole direction can be reliably constrained\nacross all nucleus variants tested, and that the convex shape models, while\nlimited in their ability to describe complex or bilobed nuclei, are effective\nfor correcting sparse photometry for rotational modulation to improve estimates\nof nucleus phase functions. Based on this analysis, we anticipate that LSST\nphotometry will significantly enhance our present understanding of the\nspin-state and phase function distributions of JFC nuclei.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
