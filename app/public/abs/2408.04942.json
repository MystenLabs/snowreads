In this paper, we use matrices of\nsize $(2m+1) \\times (2k+1)$ to completely determine the local antimagic\nchromatic number of the join of null graphs, $O_m, m\\ge 1,$ and 1-regular\ngraphs of odd components, $(2k+1)P_2$, $k\\ge 1$. Consequently, we obtained\ninfinitely many (possibly disconnected or regular) tripartite graphs with local\nantimagic chromatic number 3.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"D8riWignn_fEktWjQ4CFwJTIeXLWKZ6jgmmelpWqMdc","pdfSize":"357937"}
