This paper aims to implement a multi-fidelity Bayesian neural network\nmodel that applies transfer learning to fuse data generated by models at\ndifferent fidelities. Bayesian neural networks use probability distributions\nover network weights, enabling them to provide predictions along with estimates\nof their confidence. This approach harnesses the predictive and data fusion\ncapabilities of neural networks while also quantifying uncertainty. The results\ndemonstrate that the multi-fidelity Bayesian model outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art Co-Kriging in terms of overall accuracy and robustness on\nunseen data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
