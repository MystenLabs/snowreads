Matar","authorsParsed":[["Matar","Samir F.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 29 Aug 2024 08:23:57 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-30","timestamp":1724919837000,"abstract":"  Two mechanisms of changes from 2D to 3D (D = dimensionality) involving 2D\nC(sp2) trigonal paving to C(sp3) tetrahedral stacking are proposed through\npuckering of the 2D layers on one hand and interlayer insertion of extra C on\nthe other hand. Such transformations, led to original 3D hexagonal C12 and C18\nallotropes respectively characterized by lon and bac topologies. Using density\nfunctional theory DFT calculations, the two allotropes were found cohesive and\nstable both mechanically (elastic properties) and dynamically (phonons).\nComparisons of the physical properties with known uni C6 were established\nletting identify ranges of large Vickers hardness: HV (uni C6) = 89 GPa, HV\n(lon C12) = 97 GPa, and HV (bac C18) = 70 GPa. Whilst C6 was identified with\nacoustic phonons instability, C12 and C18 were found stable dynamically\nthroughout the acoustic and optic frequency ranges. Furthering on the thermal\nproperties the allotropes were characterized with a temperature dependence\ncurve of the specific heat CV close to experimental data of diamond with best\nfit for novel C18. The electronic band structures reveal a small band gap of 1\neV for uni C6 and larger direct band gap of 3 eV for the two other 3D\nallotropes. Such modulations of the electronic and physical properties should\nopen scopes of carbon research.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aXCH_vHIq2vFhM1ygbeCfNReEK4h8LTlrbjxXYic71g","pdfSize":"666832"}
