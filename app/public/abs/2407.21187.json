We build upon the simplified fixed\nHessian approach for linear and ridge regression and adapt our novel LFFR\nalgorithm, initially designed for single-output logistic regression, to handle\nmultiple outputs. We further refine the constant simplified Hessian method for\nthe multi-output context, ensuring computational efficiency and robustness.\nEvaluations on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour multi-output LFFR algorithm, highlighting its capability to maintain\nprivacy while achieving high predictive accuracy. Normalizing both data and\ntarget predictions remains essential for optimizing homomorphic encryption\nparameters, confirming the practicality of our approach for secure and\nefficient multi-output regression tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
