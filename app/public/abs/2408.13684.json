Typically, these designers use A/B experiments to evaluate each\nintervention; however, it is costly and time consuming to run such studies. To\naddress this issue, we explore how computational models of learning might\nsupport designers in reasoning causally about alternative interventions within\na fractions tutor. We present an approach for automatically tuning models to\nspecific individuals and show that personalized models make better predictions\nof students' behavior than generic ones. Next, we conduct simulations to\ngenerate counterfactual predictions of performance and learning for two\nstudents (high and low performing) in different versions of the fractions\ntutor. Our approach makes predictions that align with previous human findings,\nas well as testable predictions that might be evaluated with future human\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
