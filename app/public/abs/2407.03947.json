In the low-energy limit, the effective\nfield equation for graphene is described by a Dirac equation with three\ndifferent degrees of freedom. We succeed to decouple the set of eight\ncomponents of the Dirac equation by using the spin projector \\hat{C} in the\ndisclinated geometry. As consequence, we obtain the Landau levels in this\nframework, in which we note the emergence of zero modes as edge states due to\nthe inversion symmetry breaking. We also note that for different sites in\nsublattices \\mathcal{A/B}, one can have different values of gap width.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
