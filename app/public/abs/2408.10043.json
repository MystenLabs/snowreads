In this\npaper, we investigate a SIM-aided integrated sensing and communications system,\nin which SIM is capable of generating a desired beam pattern for simultaneously\ncommunicating with multiple downlink users and detecting a radar target.\nSpecifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the spectrum\nefficiency, while satisfying the power constraint of the desired direction.\nThis requires jointly designing the phase shifts of the SIM and the power\nallocation at the base station. By incorporating the sensing power constraint\ninto the objective functions as a penalty term, we further simplify the\noptimization problem and solve it by customizing an efficient gradient ascent\nalgorithm. Finally, extensive numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed wave-domain precoder for automatically mitigating the\ninter-user interference and generating a desired beampattern for the sensing\ntask, as multiple separate data streams transmit through the SIM.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
