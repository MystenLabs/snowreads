We developed our scheme through representation\ntheory and ring theory to generalise non-Clifford interleaved benchmarking to\nqudit systems. By restricting to the qubit case, we recover the dihedral\nbenchmarking scheme. Our characterisation scheme provides experimental\nphysicists a practical method for characterising universal qudit gate sets and\nadvances randomised benchmarking research by providing the characterisation of\na complete qudit library.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
