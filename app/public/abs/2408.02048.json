Rather general arguments favor a\nlandscape selection of soft SUSY breaking terms tilted to large values, but\ntempered by the atomic principle: that the derived value of the weak scale in\neach pocket universe lie not too far from its measured value in our universe.\nBut that leaves (at least) three different paradigms for gaugino masses in\nnatural SUSY models: unified (as in nonuniversal Higgs models),\nanomaly-mediation form (as in natural AMSB) and mirage mediation form (with\ncomparable moduli- and anomaly-mediated contributions). We perform landscape\nscans for each of these, and show they populate different, but overlapping,\npositions in m(\\ell\\bar{\\ell}) and m(wino) space. The first of these may be\ndirectly measurable at high-lumi LHC via the soft opposite-sign dilepton plus\njets plus MET signature arising from higgsino pair production while the second\nof these could be extracted from direct wino pair production leading to\nsame-sign diboson production.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GFMbSlwak8RxIvW8gd_wcnoGUymsnen1VytAIC9AUGM","pdfSize":"1017558","txDigest":"6o2nyQ5SfK8BNzKRVdA7hfsq2mC4Asr2TWLiFbvRm4zs","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
