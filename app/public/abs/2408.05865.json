A connected graph $G$ is said to be\nstrongly conflict-free vertex-connection $k$-colorable if $G$ admits a vertex\n$k$-coloring such that any two distinct vertices of $G$ are connected by a\nconflict-free $shortest$ path.\n  Among others, we show that deciding whether a given graph is strongly\nconflict-free vertex-connection $3$-colorable is NP-complete even when\nrestricted to $3$-colorable graphs with diameter $3$, radius $2$ and domination\nnumber $3$, and, assuming the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH), cannot be\nsolved in $2^{o(n)}$ time on such restricted input graphs with $n$ vertices.\nThis hardness result is quite strong when compared to the ordinary $3$-COLORING\nproblem: it is known that $3$-COLORING is solvable in polynomial time in graphs\nwith bounded domination number, and assuming ETH, cannot be solved in\n$2^{o(\\sqrt{n})}$ time in $n$-vertex graphs with diameter $3$ and radius $2$.\nOn the positive side, we point out that a strong conflict-free\nvertex-connection coloring with minimum color number of a given split graph or\na co-bipartite graph can be computed in polynomial time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
