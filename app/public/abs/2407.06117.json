Indeed, methods that rely\non the background expansion of the Universe tend to suggest negative neutrino\nmasses. In this work, we contribute to the quest for accurately constraining\nneutrino mass using cosmological probes. By conducting a full-shape analysis on\ndata from BOSS, eBOSS, and synthetic power spectra, we showed that projection\neffects can significantly influence constraints on neutrino mass, rendering\nthese measurements largely unreliable. Our results highlight the need for\nbetter techniques to measure the neutrino mass accurately. Based on the\nlarge-scale structure suppression, we identified a critical blind spot in the\nfull-shape analysis. By splitting the galaxy power spectrum into broadband and\nwiggles, we noticed that information on neutrino mass is primarily extracted\nfrom the suppressed wiggles rather than broadband suppression. This opens the\npossibility of developing alternative methods based only on the wiggles of the\npower spectrum that can be more robust than those heavily reliant on background\nevolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cqsvnLbRCX0J4ZIOK9VRbPRJ3Dnj263jRqiVLSCwGJw","pdfSize":"1099676"}
