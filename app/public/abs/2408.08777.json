The first, relevant for traps with decent plasma\nparameters, considers the line-tying effects to be responsible for the drive as\nwell as for the dissipation of the angular momentum. Meanwhile, in long and\nthin traps with low plasma parameters or developed turbulence the radial\ntransport of the angular momentum becomes its primary loss channel. The\nmomentum flux goes into the scrape-off layer; that makes conditions there\npartially responsible for the achievable rotation limits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
