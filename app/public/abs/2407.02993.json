We\nprovide a general Callias-type Theorem, which allows to compute the index (or\nthe spectral flow, or abstractly the K-theory class) of Dirac-Schr\\\"odinger\noperators from their restriction to a compact hypersurface. Furthermore, if the\nzero eigenvalue is isolated in the spectrum of the Dirac operator, we relate\nthe index (or spectral flow) of Dirac-Schr\\\"odinger operators to the index (or\nspectral flow) of corresponding Toeplitz-type operators. Our results generalise\nvarious known results from the literature, while presenting these results in a\ncommon unified framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
