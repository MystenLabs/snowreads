Our approach employs a Bayesian\nmethod that integrates the CAMEL (Combined ASTER MODIS Emissivity over Land)\nemissivity database with a land cover map. The solution is derived as a convex\ncombination of high-resolution Huang profiles using the Bayesian framework. We\ntest our method on IASI (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) data and\nfind that it outperforms the linear spline interpolation of the CAMEL data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
