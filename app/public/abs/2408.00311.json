We aim to\nbridge the gap between imaging and genomics data by leveraging transformer\nnetworks, allowing for accurate genomic profile predictions from CT/MRI images.\nPresently most studies rely on the use of whole slide images (WSI) for the\nassociation, which are obtained via invasive methodologies. We propose using\nonly available CT/MRI images to predict genomic sequences. Our transformer\nbased approach is able to efficiently generate associations between multiple\nsequences based on CT/MRI images alone. This work paves the way for the use of\nnon-invasive imaging modalities for precise and personalized healthcare,\nallowing for a better understanding of diseases and treatment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
