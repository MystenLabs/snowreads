We find sizable contributions to\nboth the real and the imaginary part of the potential. The calculation involves\nboth loop diagrams calculated in the Hard Thermal Loop (HTL) effective theory\nand power corrections to the HTL Lagrangian calculated in QCD. We compare our\nresults with recent lattice data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pNuHxSRIchku7Ft8oLIgOiqSAmm5fvND5bpSPUbK3JY","pdfSize":"443565"}
