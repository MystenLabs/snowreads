We also show how the other properties in\nthe synchronisation hierarchy naturally fit inside this framework. This\ncombinatorial description allows for more efficient computational tools, and we\ndeduce that every spreading permutation group of degree at most $8191$ is a\n$\\mathbb{Q}$I-group. We also consider design-orthogonality more generally for\nnoncommutative homogeneous coherent configurations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
