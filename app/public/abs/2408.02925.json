In this\nproblem, customer behavior is crucial for making optimal location decisions. We\nexplore a general class of customer choice models, known as the cross-nested\nlogit (CNL) model, which is recognized for its flexibility and generality in\npredicting people's choice behavior. To explore the problem, we first\ndemonstrate that it is NP-hard, even when there is only one customer class. We\nfurther show that this hardness result is tight, as the facility location\nproblem under any simpler choice models (such as the logit or nested logit) is\npolynomial-time solvable when there is one customer class. To tackle the\nresulting facility location problem, we demonstrate that the objective function\nunder a general cross-nested structure is not concave. Interestingly, we show\nthat by a change of variables, the objective function can be converted to a\nconvex program (i.e., a maximization problem with a concave objective and\nconvex constraints), enabling it to be solved to optimality via an\nouter-approximation algorithm. Extensive experiments show the efficiency of our\napproach and provide analyses on the benefits of using the cross-nested model\nin the facility location context.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
