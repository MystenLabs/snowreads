The task aimed\nto evaluate the ability of automated systems to resolve word ambiguity and\nidentify locations mentioned in Arabic text. We provided participants with\nnovel datasets, including a sense-annotated corpus for WSD, called SALMA with\napproximately 34k annotated tokens, and the IDRISI-DA dataset with 3,893\nannotations and 763 unique location mentions. These are challenging tasks. Out\nof the 38 registered teams, only three teams participated in the final\nevaluation phase, with the highest accuracy being 77.8% for WSD and the highest\nMRR@1 being 95.0% for LMD. The shared task not only facilitated the evaluation\nand comparison of different techniques, but also provided valuable insights and\nresources for the continued advancement of Arabic NLU technologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"oGZwTY6gaH8022Mbzr4vzQPPhIXCEq4Cjl6unQl2PiA","pdfSize":"815250"}
