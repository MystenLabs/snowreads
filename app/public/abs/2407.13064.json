In this paper, the authors\nargue for the creation of a subset of rights that allows open source\ncontributors to force users to (i) update to the most recent version of a\nmodel, (ii) accept new use case restrictions, or even (iii) cease using the\nsoftware entirely. While this would be a departure from the traditional open\nsource approach, the legal, reputational and moral risks related to\nopen-sourcing AI models could justify contributors having more control over\ndownstream uses. Recent legislative changes have also opened the door to\nliability of open source contributors in certain cases. The authors believe\nthat contributors would welcome the ability to ensure that downstream users are\nimplementing updates that address issues like bias, guardrail workarounds or\nadversarial attacks on their contributions. Finally, this paper addresses how\nthis license category would interplay with RAIL licenses, and how it should be\noperationalized and adopted by key stakeholders such as OSS platforms and\nscanning tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
