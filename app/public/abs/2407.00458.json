The condensates,\nwhich take the form of vortices or rotating polar packets, can absorb a finite\nfraction of the particles in the system, and keep a finite or slowly growing\nsize as their mass increases. Our results are obtained both at particle and\ncontinuous levels. We consider both ferromagnetic and nematic alignment, and\nboth identical and disordered chiralities. Condensation implies\nsynchronization, even though our systems are in 2D and bear strictly local\ninteractions. We propose a phenomenological theory based on observed mechanisms\nthat accounts qualitatively for our results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
