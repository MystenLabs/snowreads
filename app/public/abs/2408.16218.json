Our goal is to identify both direct and\nindirect causes within a system, thereby efficiently regulating the target\nvariable when the difficulty and cost of intervening on each causal variable\nvary. Our method employs a neural network trained to identify causality through\nsupervised learning on simulated data. By implementing a local-inference\nstrategy, we achieve linear complexity with respect to the number of variables,\nefficiently scaling up to thousands of variables. Empirical results demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method in identifying causal relationships within\nlarge-scale gene regulatory networks, outperforming existing causal discovery\nmethods that primarily focus on direct causality. We validate our model's\ngeneralization capability across novel graph structures and generating\nmechanisms, including gene regulatory networks of E. coli and the human K562\ncell line.
