We also show with easy examples\nthat the groups $\\mathbb{Z}/2, \\mathbb{Z}/3$ do effectively occur.\n  Respectively, in the case where $Aut_{\\mathbb{Z}}(S)$ is infinite, we give\nthe sharp upper bound 2 for the number of its connected components.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
