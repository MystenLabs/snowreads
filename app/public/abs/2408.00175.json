Some of the more widespread reaction formalisms\nemployed in the analysis of these reactions are briefly introduced, including\nvarious recent developments. We put special emphasis on the\ncontinuum-discretized coupled-channel (CDCC) method and its extensions to\nincorporate core and target excitations as well as its application to\nthree-body projectiles. The role of the continuum for one-nucleon transfer\nreactions is also discussed. The problem of the evaluation of inclusive breakup\ncross sections is addressed within the Ichimura-Austern-Vincent (IAV) model.\nOther methods, such as those based on a semiclasical description of the\nscattering process, are also briefly introduced and some of their applications\nare discussed and a brief discussion on topics of current interest, such as\nnucleon-nucleon correlations, uncertainty evaluation and non-locality is\npresented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
