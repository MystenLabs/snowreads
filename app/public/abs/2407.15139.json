This letter proposes a novel\ninterface for the co-simulation of the SFEMT model and the traditional EMT\nmodel. The general form of SFEMT modeling and the principle of analytical\nsignal construction are first derived. Then, an interface for the co-simulation\nof EMT and SFEMT simulation is proposed based on rotational invariance\ntechniques. Theoretical analyses and test results demonstrate the effectiveness\nof the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
