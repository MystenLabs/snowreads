In the case of CP violation, the concrete expression of\nthe Bell inequality for entangled neutral meson pairs is derived. The violation\nof Bell inequality in the oscillations of $B_d^0-\\bar{B}_d^0$,\n$B_s^0-\\bar{B}_s^0$, $D^0-\\bar{D}^0$ and $K^0-\\bar{K}^0$ meson pair systems are\nfound at certain evolution time including the latest experimental data. Our\nstudy is helpful for studying CP-violating involved flavor entanglement and\ntesting Bell inequality violation in the current and future high energy\nexperiment facilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fhgJoB0TNIn969asAMr5CZjFV5U4Uet8r9lnVLEFJYc","pdfSize":"1187215"}
