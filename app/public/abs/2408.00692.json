A potential conceptual link,\nadmittedly short in mathematical rigor, between their manifestations is made by\nwhat's called Cheshire Cat Principle. Put in terms taken ``dual\" to QCD\nvariables, going to very high density exposes quantum Hall droplets -- or\npancakes -- at which the dilaton-limit fixed point with $g_A\\to 1$, $f_\\pi\\to\nf_\\chi$ -- where $f_\\pi$ and $f_\\chi$ are respectively the pion and dilaton\ndecay constants -- and the baryon parity-doubling are reached. This scenario\nsuggests a thus-far totally unexplored structure of dual baryonic matter at\nhigh density which does neither require nor rule out (rapid) first-order phase\ntransitions from hadrons to quarks in the core of compact stars on the verge of\ngravitational collapse.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
