In a previous study, a stochastic Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation\n(SSE) has been applied to describe the transport process of heavy quarks, where\nan external field with random phases is used to simulate the thermal medium. In\nthis work, we study the connection between the SSE and the Boltzmann equation\n(BE) approach in the Keldysh Green's function formalism. By comparing the\nGreen's function of the heavy quark from the SSE and the Keldysh Green's\nfunctions leading to the Boltzmann equation, we demonstrate that the SSE is\nconsistent with the Boltzmann equation in the weak coupling limit. We\nsubsequently confirm their consistency through numerical calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
