Convergence diagnostics, such as traceplots, the\nGelman-Rubin potential scale reduction factor, and effective sample size, are\nused to visualize mixing and determine how long to run the sampler. However,\nthese classic diagnostics can be ineffective when the sample space of the\nalgorithm is highly discretized (eg. Bayesian Networks or Dirichlet Process\nMixture Models) or the sampler uses frequent non-Euclidean moves. In this\narticle, we develop novel generalized convergence diagnostics produced by\nmapping the original space to the real-line while respecting a relevant\ndistance function and then evaluating the convergence diagnostics on the mapped\nvalues. Simulated examples are provided that demonstrate the success of this\nmethod in identifying failures to converge that are missed or unavailable by\nother methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZJ3Cfnbn0GpvSvcjuAkJ5ckETdRCGSDBfHIrRHh5kDA","pdfSize":"666931"}
