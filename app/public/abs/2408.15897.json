The evolution eventually leads to a highly\nasymmetric state, no matter how weak the symmetry breaking term is. This\nsuggests a potential mechanism for strong asymmetry in the production of\nparticles with almost identical characteristics. The model's integrability also\nallows us to obtain exact Kibble-Zurek exponents for the scaling of the number\nof nonadiabatic excitations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nqhi8-X9a0WZvJ5ZZWwiUFAdwIvG8WX8t6mpQ8LmBSo","pdfSize":"1186901"}
