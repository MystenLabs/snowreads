These conditions capture several\nwell-studied graphs, such as (percolation on) the complete graph $K_n$, the\nbinary hypercube $Q^d$, $d$-regular expanders, and random $d$-regular graphs.\nIn particular, this serves as a unified proof for these (and other) cases.\n  Suppose that $G$ is a $d$-regular graph on $n$ vertices, with $d=\\omega(1)$.\nLet $\\epsilon>0$ be a small constant, and let $p=\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{d}$. Let\n$y(\\epsilon)$ be the survival probability of a Galton-Watson tree with\noffspring distribution Po$(1+\\epsilon)$. We show that if $G$ satisfies a (very)\nmild edge expansion requirement, and if one has fairly good control on the\nexpansion of small sets in $G$, then typically the percolated random subgraph\n$G_p$ contains a unique giant component of asymptotic order $y(\\epsilon)n$, and\nall the other components in $G_p$ are of order $O(\\log n/\\epsilon^2)$.\n  We also show that this result is tight, in the sense that if one asks for a\nslightly weaker control on the expansion of small sets in $G$, then there are\n$d$-regular graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices, where typically the second largest\ncomponent is of order $\\Omega(d\\log (n/d))=\\omega(\\log n)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EF_AJ6ocXki-eIraAI0OeBVa3IY9xqNiPo-TrpWnr0k","pdfSize":"267994"}
