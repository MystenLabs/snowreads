We oversee a marketplace that is nuanced by geography, diversity of\nhomes, and guests with a variety of preferences. Crafting an efficient search\nsystem that can accommodate diverse guest needs, while showcasing relevant\nhomes lies at the heart of Airbnb's success. Airbnb search has many challenges\nthat parallel other recommendation and search systems but it has a unique\ninformation retrieval problem, upstream of ranking, called location retrieval.\nIt requires defining a topological map area that is relevant to the searched\nquery for homes listing retrieval. The purpose of this paper is to demonstrate\nthe methodology, challenges, and impact of building a machine learning based\nlocation retrieval product from the ground up. Despite the lack of suitable,\nprevalent machine learning based approaches, we tackle cold start,\ngeneralization, differentiation and algorithmic bias. We detail the efficacy of\nheuristics, statistics, machine learning, and reinforcement learning approaches\nto solve these challenges, particularly for systems that are often unexplored\nby current literature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
