Now, there is a growing demand for RPLAs that\nrepresent Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), \\ie, Internet celebrities who shape the\ntrends and opinions in their domains. However, research in this line remains\nunderexplored. In this paper, we hence introduce MINDECHO, a comprehensive\nframework for the development and evaluation of KOL RPLAs. MINDECHO collects\nKOL data from Internet video transcripts in various professional fields, and\nsynthesizes their conversations leveraging GPT-4. Then, the conversations and\nthe transcripts are used for individualized model training and inference-time\nretrieval, respectively. Our evaluation covers both general dimensions (\\ie,\nknowledge and tones) and fan-centric dimensions for KOLs. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of MINDECHO in developing and evaluating KOL RPLAs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
