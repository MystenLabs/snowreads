Existing LDP\nsolutions all assume a uniform data distribution within each domain partition,\nwhich may not align with real-world scenarios where data distribution is\nvaried, resulting in inaccurate estimates. To address this problem, we\nintroduce PriPL-Tree, a novel data structure that combines hierarchical tree\nstructures with piecewise linear (PL) functions to answer range queries for\narbitrary distributions. PriPL-Tree precisely models the underlying data\ndistribution with a few line segments, leading to more accurate results for\nrange queries. Furthermore, we extend it to multi-dimensional cases with novel\ndata-aware adaptive grids. These grids leverage the insights from marginal\ndistributions obtained through PriPL-Trees to partition the grids adaptively,\nadapting the density of underlying distributions. Our extensive experiments on\nboth real and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority\nof PriPL-Tree over state-of-the-art solutions in answering range queries across\narbitrary data distributions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
