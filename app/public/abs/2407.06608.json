In contrast, our scheme is interpretable because it corresponds\nto the minimization of a series of convex problems. For each problem in the\nseries, a mask is generated based on the previous solution to refine the\nregularization strength spatially. In this way, the model becomes progressively\nattentive to the image structure. For the underlying update operator, we prove\nthe existence of a fixed point. As a special case, we investigate a mask\ngenerator for which the fixed-point iterations converge to a critical point of\nan explicit energy functional. In our experiments, we match the performance of\nstate-of-the-art learned variational models for the solution of inverse\nproblems. Additionally, we offer a promising balance between interpretability,\ntheoretical guarantees, reliability, and performance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nSw4rftaaS-GmMgJH1WFWXg-R5Wg2UPgi1tB8wDQz4c","pdfSize":"7896205"}
