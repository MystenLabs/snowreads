Also, the expansion of\ngenome sequencing technology has greatly increased crop genomic resources,\ndeepening our understanding of genetic variation and enhancing desirable crop\ntraits to optimize performance in various environments. There is increasing\ninterest in using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) algorithms for\ngenotype-to-phenotype prediction due to their excellence in capturing complex\ninteractions within large, high-dimensional datasets. In this work, we propose\na new LSTM autoencoder-based model for barley genotype-to-phenotype prediction,\nspecifically for flowering time and grain yield estimation, which could\npotentially help optimize yields and management practices. Our model\noutperformed the other baseline methods, demonstrating its potential in\nhandling complex high-dimensional agricultural datasets and enhancing crop\nphenotype prediction performance.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
