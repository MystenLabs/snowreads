It has a\nhigh-level, extensible interface for model parametrization; setting up,\nrunning, and analyzing simulations natively in established software packages;\nand gradient-based optimization. We describe the design and implementation of\nrelentless in the context of relative entropy minimization, and we demonstrate\nits abilities to design pairwise interactions between particles that form\ntargeted structures. relentless aims to streamline the development of\ncomputational materials design methodologies and promote the transparency and\nreproducibility of complex workflows integrating molecular dynamics\nsimulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
