This method recursively applies\nquantum signal processing to the outputs of other quantum signal processing\nsteps, allowing polynomials to be easily achieved that would otherwise be\ndifficult to find analytically. We specifically show by using a squaring\nquantum signal processing routine, that multiplication of phase angles can be\napproximated and in turn that any bounded degree multi-variate polynomial\nfunction of a set of phase angles can be implemented using traditional QSP\nideas. We then discuss how these ideas can be used to construct phase functions\nrelevant for quantum simulation such as the Coulomb potential and also discuss\nhow to use these ideas to obviate the need for reversible arithmetic to compute\nsquare-root functions needed for simulations of bosonic Hamiltonians.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
