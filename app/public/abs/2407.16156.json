Since it is determined by the number of\nspecies in the effective field theory, we can find the close connection to the\ndistance conjecture, which predicts the lowering of the cutoff at the\nasymptotic limit of the moduli space caused by the descent of a tower of states\nfrom UV. Meanwhile, the same kind of the cutoff scale can be obtained from any\nnon-renormalizable interaction, in particular the interaction between the axion\nand the gauge field through the $\\theta F\\wedge F$ term. Demanding this `axion\nspecies scale' not to exceed the gravitational species scale, we obtain the\nbound $(8\\pi^2/g^2)f \\lesssim M_{\\rm Pl}$. This is quite similar to the axion\nweak gravity conjecture bound, but can be applied to any gauge as well as the\nstring interactions which are relevant to towers of states. We also investigate\nthe implications of the (axion) species scale and the axion weak gravity\nconjecture-like bound by considering the Peccei-Quinn charge reduction of black\nhole through the interaction between black hole and the string or wormhole.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sXE7Ezhz8NbdXn-hw0OAa5U6a-rdCgsH2JftBlkTeJY","pdfSize":"301189","objectId":"0x9d312b8886fdb4c865e62e05e622492518deff668e3b4f15ac7ab56bf6ebf26d","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
