To address the issue of predicting\ntoxicity and solubility in the lead compounds, represented in Simplified\nMolecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) notation. Among the different\napproaches that work on SMILES data, the proposed model was built using a\nsequence-based approach. The proposed Bi-Directional Long Short Term Memory\n(BiLSTM) is a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) that processes input\nmolecular sequences for the comprehensive examination of the structural\nfeatures of molecules from both forward and backward directions. The proposed\nwork aims to understand the sequential patterns encoded in the SMILES strings,\nwhich are then utilised for predicting the toxicity of the molecules. The\nproposed model on the ClinTox dataset surpasses previous approaches such as\nTrimnet and Pre-training Graph neural networks(GNN) by achieving a ROC accuracy\nof 0.96. BiLSTM outperforms the previous model on FreeSolv dataset with a low\nRMSE value of 1.22 in solubility prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
