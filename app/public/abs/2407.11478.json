Due to the\nperception and modeling errors, assuming an exact time for establishing contact\nwith the environment is unrealistic. On the other hand, handling uncertainties\nin contact timing is notoriously difficult as it gives rise to either handling\nuncertain complementarity systems or solving combinatorial optimization\nproblems at run-time. This work presents a novel optimal control formulation to\nfind robust control policies under contact timing uncertainties. Our main\nnovelty lies in casting the stochastic problem to a deterministic optimization\nover the uncertainty set that ensures robustness criterion satisfaction of\ncandidate pre-contact states and optimizes for contact-relevant objectives.\nThis way, we only need to solve a manageable standard nonlinear programming\nproblem without complementarity constraints or combinatorial explosion. Our\nsimulation results on multiple simplified locomotion and manipulation tasks\ndemonstrate the robustness of our uncertainty-aware formulation compared to the\nnominal optimal control formulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CiF0a9lclfCBoWm71_QX8EoTaHZu8XFPBt7B8vfmK78","pdfSize":"1055200"}
