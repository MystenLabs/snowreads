However, without ground truth signed distances,\npoint normals or clean point clouds, current methods still struggle from\nlearning SDFs from noisy point clouds. To overcome this challenge, we propose\nto learn SDFs via a noise to noise mapping, which does not require any clean\npoint cloud or ground truth supervision. Our novelty lies in the noise to noise\nmapping which can infer a highly accurate SDF of a single object or scene from\nits multiple or even single noisy observations. We achieve this by a novel loss\nwhich enables statistical reasoning on point clouds and maintains geometric\nconsistency although point clouds are irregular, unordered and have no point\ncorrespondence among noisy observations. To accelerate training, we use\nmulti-resolution hash encodings implemented in CUDA in our framework, which\nreduces our training time by a factor of ten, achieving convergence within one\nminute. We further introduce a novel schema to improve multi-view\nreconstruction by estimating SDFs as a prior. Our evaluations under widely-used\nbenchmarks demonstrate our superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in\nsurface reconstruction from point clouds or multi-view images, point cloud\ndenoising and upsampling.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
