Inelastic neutron measurements reveal\nthe full spectrum of crystal field excitations and confirm that the Pr$^{4+}$\nground state wave function deviates significantly from the $\\Gamma_7$ limit\nrelevant to the Kitaev model. Single and two magnon excitations are observed in\nthe ordered state below $T_N=4.6$ K and are well described by non-linear spin\nwave theory from the N\\'eel state using a magnetic Hamiltonian with Heisenberg\nexchange $J=1$ meV and symmetric anisotropic exchange $\\Gamma/J=0.1$,\ncorresponding to an XY model. Intense two magnon excitations are accounted for\nby $g$-factor anisotropy $g_\\mathrm{z}/g_\\pm = 1.29$. A fluctuating moment\n$\\delta m^2 = 0.57(22)$ $\\mu_{\\rm B}^2/{\\rm Pr}$ extracted from the energy and\nmomentum integrated inelastic neutron signal is reduced from expectations for a\nlocal $J=1/2$ moment with average $g$-factor $g_{\\rm avg}\\approx 1.1$.\nTogether, the results demonstrate that the small moment in Na$_2$PrO$_3$ arises\nfrom crystal field and covalency effects and that the material does not exhibit\nsignificant quantum fluctuations..\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
