Comparably little is known about statistical testing of\nauto-calibration. Denuit et al.~(2024) recently published a test with an\nasymptotic distribution that is not fully explicit and its evaluation needs\nnon-parametric Monte Carlo sampling. In a simpler set-up, we present three test\nstatistics with fully known and interpretable asymptotic distributions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
