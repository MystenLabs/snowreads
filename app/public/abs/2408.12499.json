By leveraging previous research and\nstate-of-the-art technologies, the study addresses autonomy, safety, and\noperational efficiency in industrial environments. Motivated by the demand for\nautomation in hazardous and complex industries, the autonomous system\nintegrates sensors, actuators, advanced control algorithms, and communication\nsystems to enhance safety, streamline processes, and improve productivity. The\npaper covers system requirements, hardware architecture, software framework and\npreliminary results. This research offers insights into designing and\nimplementing autonomous capabilities in human-operated vehicles, with\nimplications for improving safety and efficiency in various industrial sectors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
