That approach, initially developed assuming protohaloes as random\noverdense regions in the linear density field, was extended to the more\nrealistic scenario that protohaloes are collapsing patches around peaks in the\nGaussian-smoothed linear density field. But that extension faced two\nfundamental issues: 1) the unknown mass of collapsing patches marked by\nGaussian peaks, and 2) the unknown ellipsoidal collapse time of those triaxial\npatches. Furthermore, the TTT strictly holds in linear regime only. This Paper\nis the first of a series of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately\ncalculating the halo angular momentum. In the present Paper we use the CUSP\nformalism fixing all those issues to deal with the TTT from a full peak model\nviewpoint, i.e. not only is the protohalo suffering the tidal torque identified\nto a peak, but the main mass fluctuation causing the tidal torque is also seen\nas a peak or a hole. This way we obtain a simple analytic expression for the\nLagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation\nmodels and be compared to the results of simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v-Cr8vtl9KvHuJtylpqbYHU0WGWivXFsU9bg8xOZBF4","pdfSize":"550142"}
