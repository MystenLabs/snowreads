Specifically, we focus on estimating the unknown\nfunction $f \\colon \\mathbb{R}^d \\to \\mathbb{R}^d$ that governs the system\ndynamics through the ODE $\\dot{u}(t) = f(u(t))$, where observations $Y_{j,i} =\nu_j(t_{j,i}) + \\varepsilon_{j,i}$ of solutions $u_j$ of the ODE are made at\ntimes $t_{j,i}$ with independent noise $\\varepsilon_{j,i}$.\n  We introduce two novel models -- the Stubble model and the Snake model -- to\nmitigate the issue of observation location dependence on $f$, an inherent\ndifficulty in nonparametric estimation of ODE systems. In the Stubble model, we\nobserve many short solutions with initial conditions that adequately cover the\ndomain of interest. Here, we study an estimator based on multivariate local\npolynomial regression and univariate polynomial interpolation. In the Snake\nmodel we observe few long trajectories that traverse the domain on interest.\nHere, we study an estimator that combines univariate local polynomial\nestimation with multivariate polynomial interpolation.\n  For both models, we establish error bounds of order $n^{-\\frac{\\beta}{2(\\beta\n+1)+d}}$ for $\\beta$-smooth functions $f$ in an infinite dimensional function\nclass of H\\\"older-type and establish minimax optimality for the Stubble model\nin general and for the Snake model under some conditions via comparison to\nlower bounds from parallel work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
