We investigate the analogous process in\nfully kinetic plasma turbulence by using high-resolution, direct numerical\nsimulations in two spatial dimensions. We observe the formation of long-living\nvortices with a profile typical of macroscopic, magnetically dominated\nforce-free states. Inspired by the Harris pinch model for inhomogeneous\nequilibria, we describe these metastable solutions with a self-consistent\nkinetic model in a cylindrical coordinate system centered on a representative\nvortex, starting from an explicit form of the particle velocity distribution\nfunction. Such new equilibria can be simplified to a Gold-Hoyle solution of the\nmodified force-free state. Turbulence is mediated by the long-living\nstructures, accompanied by transients in which such vortices merge and form\nself-similarly new metastable equilibria. This process can be relevant to the\ncomprehension of various astrophysical phenomena, going from the formation of\nplasmoids in the vicinity of massive compact objects to the emergence of\ncoherent structures in the heliosphere.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
