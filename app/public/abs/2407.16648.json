We use this to characterize when one dynamic information\nstructure is more valuable to an agent than another, irrespective of what other\ndynamic sources of information the agent may possess. Notably, this robust\ndominance is equivalent to an intuitive dynamic version of Brooks, Frankel, and\nKamenica (2022)'s reveal-or-refine condition.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
