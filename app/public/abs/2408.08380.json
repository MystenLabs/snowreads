For an integer $d$, the $d$-Ortho-Dim$_\\mathbb{R}$ problem asks to\ndecide whether the orthogonality dimension of a given graph over $\\mathbb{R}$\nis at most $d$. We prove that for every integer $d \\geq 3$, the\n$d$-Ortho-Dim$_\\mathbb{R}$ problem parameterized by the vertex cover number $k$\nadmits a kernel with $O(k^{d-1})$ vertices and bit-size $O(k^{d-1} \\cdot \\log\nk)$. We complement this result by a nearly matching lower bound, showing that\nfor any $\\varepsilon > 0$, the problem admits no kernel of bit-size\n$O(k^{d-1-\\varepsilon})$ unless $\\mathsf{NP} \\subseteq \\mathsf{coNP/poly}$. We\nfurther study the kernelizability of orthogonality dimension problems in\nadditional settings, including over general fields and under various structural\nparameterizations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"03eiyYzD0eTG2x4q7ZjPsCTIsh0wuUOLyK7xsiHM9-A","pdfSize":"308210"}
