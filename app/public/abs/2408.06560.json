We assumed two types of\npoint defects: interstitial oxygen and silicon vacancies. We found that the\nphotoabsorption efficiency increased with defect density in both cases owing to\nthe color center. These defects distorted the crystal structure, thereby\nrelaxing the selection rules and changing the indirect gap to direct. At low\nlaser intensities, the defect states dominated the absorption process. However,\nas the laser intensity increased, the excitation efficiency approached that of\ncrystalline silicon. In addition, we observed that the excitation efficiency\ndid not scale linearly with the pulse length. Notably, in the case of Si\nvacancies, saturable absorption significantly reduced photoabsorption. Our\nresults suggest that the existence of a defect and its density could be\ndetected by even-order high-harmonics generation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
