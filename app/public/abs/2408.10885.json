This study addresses a new task of unsupervised detection of low-quality\nimages. We propose a method that not only detects low-quality images with\nvarious types of degradation but also provides visual clues of them based on an\nobservation that partial reconstruction by hierarchical variational\nautoencoders fails for low-quality images. The experiments show that our method\noutperforms several unsupervised out-of-distribution detection methods and also\ngives visual clues for low-quality images that help humans recognize them even\nin thumbnail view.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
