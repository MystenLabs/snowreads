We propose a highly efficient\nalgorithm that converts fermionic Gaussian states to matrix product states. It\ncan be formulated for finite-size systems without translation invariance, but\nbecomes particularly appealing when applied to infinite systems with\ntranslation invariance. If the ground states of a topologically ordered system\non infinite cylinders are expressed as matrix product states, then the fixed\npoints of the transfer matrix can be harnessed to filter out the anyon\neigenbasis, also known as minimally entangled states. This allows for efficient\ncomputation of universal properties such as entanglement spectrum and modular\nmatrices. The potential of our method is demonstrated by numerical calculations\nin two chiral spin liquids that have the same topological orders as the bosonic\nLaughlin and Moore-Read states, respectively. The anyon eigenbasis for the\nfirst one has been worked out before and serves as a useful benchmark. The\nanyon eigenbasis of the second one is, however, not transparent and its\nsuccessful construction provides a nontrivial corroboration of our method.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sXPu3aEwolcRJvNTV6Sp1BFxJDmie75T03gkHaxR_8s","pdfSize":"5267959","txDigest":"BVSTgct3bngWh5WZzL8EPSdG1qySxkarXZR5xSbpyVYe","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
