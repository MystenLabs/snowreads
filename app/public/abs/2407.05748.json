In cases where no expression exists, we raise the level instead of the\nweight, meaning our eta quotients are always holomorphic. Of the forms we\nexamine, we find expressions for all but 4. We also present methods to find\nexpressions with relatively few terms, and how these expressions can be used to\ndemonstrate zeroes of modular forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
