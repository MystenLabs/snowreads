Despite considerable work and\nimprovement in delineating organs from CT and MR modalities, the existing\nstandards do not transfer well and produce quality results in PET related\ntasks. Particularly, contemporary methods fail to accurately consider the\nintensity-based scaling applied by the physicians during manual annotation of\ntumour contours. In this paper, we observe that the prostate-localised uptake\nthreshold ranges are beneficial for suppressing outliers. Therefore, we utilize\nthe intensity threshold values, to implement a new custom-feature-clipping\nnormalisation technique. We evaluate multiple, established U-Net variants under\ndifferent normalisation schemes, using the nnU-Net framework. All models were\ntrained and tested on multiple datasets, obtained with two radioactive tracers:\n[68-Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 and [18-F]PSMA-1007. Our results show that the U-Net models\nachieve much better performance when the PET scans are preprocessed with our\nnovel clipping technique.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
