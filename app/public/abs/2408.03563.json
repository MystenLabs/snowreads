Furthermore,\nit does not need an initial rank estimate. To solve the SLRQA model, a\nnonconvex proximal linearized ADMM (PL-ADMM) algorithm is proposed. %where only\none variable is linearized. Furthermore, the global convergence analysis of the\nPL-ADMM under mild assumptions is presented. When the observation is\nnoise-free, an SLRQA-NF model of the limiting case of the SLRQA is proposed.\nSubsequently, a nonconvex proximal linearized ADMM (PL-ADMM-NF) algorithm for\nthe SLRQA-NF is given. % Extensive numerical experimental results show the\nrobustness and effectiveness of quaternion representation. In numerical\nexperiments, we verify the effectiveness of quaternion representation.\nFurthermore, for color image denoising and color image inpainting problems,\nSLRQA and SLRQA-NF models demonstrate superior performance both quantitatively\nand visually when compared with some state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
