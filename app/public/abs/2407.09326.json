A rich literature links the fundamental features of teams, such as\ntheir size and diversity, to academic success. However, such analyses fail to\ncapture temporal patterns, treating each group of co-authors as a distinct unit\nand neglecting the existence of persistent collaborations. By contrast, teams\nare dynamical entities, made of core members who consistently work together,\nsurrounded by transient members who sporadically participate. Leveraging on a\nlarge dataset of over 205 million scientific papers published since 1900, we\nextract 511,550 core teams of statistically significant persistent\ncollaborations of pairs and larger groups of scientists. We look into `team\ncareers' investigating their trajectories in time, characterizing their\nformation, productivity and eventual dissolution. We characterize team\ncomposition along multiple dimensions, including age, academic affiliation and\nscientific disciplines. Finally, we investigate the academic impact of\npersistent collaborations, hallmarking the key compositional features\nunderlying their success. Our work sheds light on the nature of persistent\nteams, informing researchers, institutions and funding agencies about the\ndynamics of their formation, evolution and success.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
