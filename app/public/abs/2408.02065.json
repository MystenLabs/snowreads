However, the presence of confounding effects\nposes challenges in achieving an unbiased estimate of the uplift effect. We\nintroduce a consumer subsidizing system to capture relationships between\nsubsidy propensity and the treatment effect, which proves effective while\nmaintaining a lightweight online environment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
