These models range from a few to\nthousands of parameters depending on the complexity of the biological system\nmodeled, potentially making the task of fitting parameters to the model\ndifficult - especially when new experimental data cannot be gathered. We\ndemonstrate a method that uses structural biology predictions to augment\nsystems biology models to improve systems biology models' predictions without\nhaving to gather more experimental data. Additionally, we show how systems\nbiology models' predictions can help evaluate novel structural biology\nhypotheses, which may also be expensive or infeasible to validate.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uj-xqtZ3lxNtdCwimRJ0PYtCwQ2oe82NjZf106eiZWc","pdfSize":"1766098","objectId":"0xad3632e321b58ed6bb402b46ccc87a3222276ed6e7603ee641afe98452efd9cb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
