In this study, for the first time, we systematically examine the\nmethod against an unentangled melt of the Kremer-Grest type chain. The\nsimulation results indicate that as the shear rate increases, the temperature\nand density become inhomogeneous. However, the average viscosity remains\nconsistent with the results obtained using the SLLOD method under homogeneous\ntemperature and density. We also confirm that the temperature-density\ninhomogeneity does not significantly affect polymer conformation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
