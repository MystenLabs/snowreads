Apparently successful computations are identified with\nunderlying boundary-value problems which are well-posed only in a weakened\nsense. In the absence of hyperbolicity in particular, prescribed boundary data\nsufficient to determine an a priori bound for an entropy weak solution need not\nsuffice to imply local uniqueness thereof. In this context, fluid flow models\nbased on stationary or self-similar reductions of Euler systems are\ndistinguished as particularly attractive for computational investigation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
