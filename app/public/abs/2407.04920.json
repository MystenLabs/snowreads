However, handling large volumetric datasets, which often exceed the\nmemory capacity of standard GPUs, require special attention when subjected to\ndeep learning efforts. This paper introduces qlty, a toolkit designed to\naddress these challenges through tensor management techniques. qlty offers\nrobust methods for subsampling, cleaning, and stitching of large-scale spatial\ndata, enabling effective training and inference even in resource-limited\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
