CRO commonly utilizes models such as contextual\ndeep bandits model to independently rank content at different positions, e.g.,\none optimizer dedicated to organic search results and another to sponsored\nresults. However, this regional optimization approach does not necessarily\ntranslate to whole page optimization, e.g., maximizing revenue at the top of\nthe page may inadvertently diminish the revenue of lower positions. In this\npaper, we propose a reinforcement learning based method for whole page ranking\nto jointly optimize across all positions by: 1) shifting from position level\noptimization to whole page level optimization to achieve an overall optimized\nranking; 2) applying reinforcement learning to optimize for the cumulative\nrewards instead of the instant reward. We formulate page level CRO as a\ncooperative Multi-agent Markov Decision Process , and address it with the novel\nMulti-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) model. MADDPG supports\na flexible and scalable joint optimization framework by adopting a \"centralized\ntraining and decentralized execution\" approach. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MADDPG scales to a 2.5 billion action space in the public\nMujoco environment, and outperforms the deep bandits modeling by 25.7% on the\noffline CRO data set from a leading e-commerce company. We foresee that this\nnovel multi-agent optimization is applicable to similar joint optimization\nproblems in the field of information retrieval.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
