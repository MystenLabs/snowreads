Characteristic spatiotemporal patterns, such as\ndisordered, aligned, swap, chiral-swap, and chiral phases, emerge depending on\nthe parameters. We classify the characteristic spatiotemporal patterns obtained\nin the numerical simulations by focusing on the spatiotemporal Fourier spectrum\nof the order parameters. We derive a reduced dynamical system by using the\nspatial Fourier series expansion. We analyze the bifurcation structure around\nthe fixed points corresponding to the aligned and chiral phases and explain the\ntransitions between them. The disordered phase is destabilized either to the\naligned phase or to the chiral phase by the Turing bifurcation or the wave\nbifurcation, and the aligned phase and the chiral phase are connected by the\npitchfork bifurcation.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
