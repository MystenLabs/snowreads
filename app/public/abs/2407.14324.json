This book\nchapter provides a comprehensive overview of the principles, developments,\nchallenges, and prospects of soft grippers that draw inspiration from\nbiological systems. Bio-inspired soft grippers have gained prominence due to\ntheir unique characteristics, including compliance, adaptability, and\nbiocompatibility. They have revolutionized the way we approach biomedical\ntasks, offering safer interactions with delicate tissues and enabling complex\noperations that were once inconceivable with rigid tools. The chapter delves\ninto the fundamental importance of soft grippers in biomedical contexts. It\noutlines their significance in surgeries, diagnostics, tissue engineering, and\nvarious medical interventions. Soft grippers have the capacity to mimic the\nintricate movements of biological organisms, facilitating minimally invasive\nprocedures and enhancing patient outcomes. A historical perspective traces the\nevolution of soft grippers in biomedical research, highlighting key milestones\nand breakthroughs. From early attempts to emulate the dexterity of octopus\ntentacles to the latest advancements in soft lithography and biomaterials, the\njourney has been marked by ingenuity and collaboration across multiple\ndisciplines. Motivations for adopting soft grippers in biomedical applications\nare explored, emphasizing their ability to reduce invasiveness, increase\nprecision, and provide adaptability to complex anatomical structures. The\nrequirements and challenges in designing grippers fit for medical contexts are\noutlined, encompassing biocompatibility, sterilization, control, and\nintegration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
