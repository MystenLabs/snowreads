The results are\ninspired in the work of A. Bufetov and B. Solomyak, where they previously\nestablished a log-H\\\"older modulus of continuity of one-dimensional\nself-similar tiling systems. We generalize this result to higher dimension in\nthe more general case of self-affine tilings systems. Futher analysis, leads to\nuniform estimates in the whole space of spectral parameters, allowing to deduce\nlogarithmic rates of weak mixing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
