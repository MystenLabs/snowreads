A NN formulation is introduced to preclude spurious\noscillations that violate solution boundedness or positivity. It is embedded in\nthe discretized equations as a machine learning closure and strictly\nconstrained, inspired by total variation diminishing (TVD) methods for\nhyperbolic conservation laws. The constraint is exactly enforced during\ngradient-descent training by rescaling the NN parameters, which maps them onto\nan explicit feasible set. Demonstrations show that the constrained NN closure\nmodel usefully recovers linear and nonlinear hyperbolic phenomena and\nanti-diffusion while enforcing the non-oscillatory property. Finally, the model\nis applied to subgrid-scale (SGS) modeling of a turbulent reacting flow, for\nwhich it suppresses spurious oscillations in scalar fields that otherwise\nviolate the solution boundedness. It outperforms a simple penalization of\noscillations in the loss function.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
