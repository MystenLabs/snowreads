This particularly holds for the\ndynamic field of emerging technologies. Hence, this article has two ambitions.\nFirst, it explains how the EU's new Artificial Intelligence Act (AIA) will be\nimplemented and enforced by various institutional bodies, thus clarifying the\ngovernance framework of the AIA. Second, it proposes a normative model of\ngovernance, providing recommendations to ensure uniform and coordinated\nexecution of the AIA and the fulfilment of the legislation. Taken together, the\narticle explores how the AIA may be implemented by national and EU\ninstitutional bodies, encompassing longstanding bodies, such as the European\nCommission, and those newly established under the AIA, such as the AI Office.\nIt investigates their roles across supranational and national levels,\nemphasizing how EU regulations influence institutional structures and\noperations. These regulations may not only directly dictate the structural\ndesign of institutions but also indirectly request administrative capacities\nneeded to enforce the AIA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"iCrDKNgQ4sXNFsMjMxvqmnpKoAI4ng4Oc5tBNwzhi5o","pdfSize":"522946"}
