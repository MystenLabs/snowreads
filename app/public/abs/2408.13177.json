Matched filtering for detecting gravitational\nwave signals requires searching through a large number of template waveforms,\nto find one which is highly correlated with segments of detector data. This\ncomputationally intensive task needs to be done quickly for low latency\nsearches in order to aid with follow-up multi-messenger observations. The\nvariational quantum algorithms we study for this task consist of quantum\nwalk-based generalizations of the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm\n(QAOA). We present results of classical numerical simulations of these quantum\nalgorithms using open science data from LIGO. These results show that the\ntested variational quantum algorithms are outperformed by an unstructured\nrestricted-depth Grover search algorithm, suggesting that the latter is optimal\nfor this computational task.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
