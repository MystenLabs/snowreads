Complications arise\nin particular when the coupling between a quantum system and an environment is\nnon-negligible, as the boundary between the two becomes blurred, making the\ndistinction between system and environment difficult to draw. The reaction\ncoordinate mapping can be used in such regimes to redraw the boundary between\nthe system and environment. Here we combine the reaction coordinate technique\nwith a two-point measurement protocol to compare two different definitions of\nheat: energetic changes in the full environment Hamiltonian (prior to the\nmapping), and energetic changes in the residual environment Hamiltonian (after\nthe mapping). We find that the latter definition displays behaviour more\nexpected of a thermal environment in the highly non-Markovian regime\nconsidered.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
