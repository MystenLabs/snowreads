We consider\nthe behavior of the balayage measure $\\nu:=\\mathrm{Bal}(\\mu,\\partial \\Omega)$\nnear a point $z_{0}\\in \\partial \\Omega$ at which $\\Omega$ has an\noutward-pointing cusp. Assuming that the order and coefficient of tangency of\nthe cusp are $d>0$ and $a>0$, respectively, and that $d\\mu(z) \\asymp\n|z-z_{0}|^{2b-2}d^{2}z$ as $z\\to z_0$ for some $b > 0$, we obtain the leading\norder term of $\\nu$ near $z_{0}$. This leading term is universal in the sense\nthat it only depends on $d$, $a$, and $b$. We also treat the case when the\ndomain has multiple corners and cusps at the same point. Finally, we obtain an\nexplicit expression for the balayage of the uniform measure on the tacnodal\nregion between two osculating circles, and we give an application of this\nresult to two-dimensional Coulomb gases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
