We introduce the first hierarchical semantic segmentation dataset\nwith subpart annotations for natural images, which we call SPIN\n(SubPartImageNet). We also introduce two novel evaluation metrics to evaluate\nhow well algorithms capture spatial and semantic relationships across\nhierarchical levels. We benchmark modern models across three different tasks\nand analyze their strengths and weaknesses across objects, parts, and subparts.\nTo facilitate community-wide progress, we publicly release our dataset at\nhttps://joshmyersdean.github.io/spin/index.html.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VvZ3NOVrKUSN6PFJ6sMK1alkWwi9Ct7KYaMnxYbBJYM","pdfSize":"2468024"}
