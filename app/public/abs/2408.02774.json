The Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation toolkit is\nwidely used to model backgrounds in nuclear and particle physics experiments.\nWhile its current modules for simulating (n, $\\gamma$) signals, GFNDL and\nG4PhotoEvaporation, are excellent for many applications, they do not reproduce\nknown gamma-ray lines and correlations relevant at 2-15 MeV. G4CASCADE is a new\ndata-driven Geant4 module that simulates (n, $\\gamma$) de-excitation pathways,\nwith options for how to handle shortcomings in nuclear data. Benchmark\ncomparisons to measured gamma-ray lines and level structures in the ENSDF\ndatabase show significant improvements, with decreased residuals and full\nenergy conservation. This manuscript describes the underlying calculations\nperformed by G4CASCADE, its various usage options, and benchmark comparisons.\nG4CASCADE for Geant4-10 is available on GitHub at\nhttps://github.com/UCRDarkMatter/CASCADE\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RYr8mqFUuWZUlATVdFM91pZICjjQG2k8HbMZa39kyrY","pdfSize":"502694"}
