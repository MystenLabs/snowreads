To\nprobe these dissociation and fragmentation reactions with femtosecond\nresolution requires the use of femtosecond lasers to induce ionization of the\npolyatomic molecules via electron rescattering. Here, we combine\nnon-commensurate fields with intensity-difference spectra using methanol as a\nmodel system. Experimentally, we find orders of magnitude enhancement in\nseveral product ions of methanol when comparing coherent vs incoherent\ncombinations of non-commensurate fields. This approach not only mitigates\nmulti-photon ionization and multi-cycle effects during ionization but also\nenhances tunnel ionization and electron rescattering energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"IwymT3hgjjdQ-f7B5OMayqtc4XWnoF-RzjRZiX83M3o","pdfSize":"2295122"}
