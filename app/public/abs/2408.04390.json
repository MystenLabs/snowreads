This needs to address the same multi-field\nrule-matching problem as legacy packet classification, but faces more serious\nscalability challenges. The demand of fast on-line updates makes most existing\nsolutions unfit, while the rest still lacks the scalability to either large\ndata sets or large number of fields to match for a rule. In this work, we\npropose TupleChain for fast OpenFlow table lookup with multifaceted\nscalability. We group rules based on their masks, each being maintained with a\nhash table, and explore the connections among rule groups to skip unnecessary\nhash probes for fast search. We show via theoretical analysis and extensive\nexperiments that the proposed scheme not only has competitive computing\ncomplexity, but is also scalable and can achieve high performance in both\nsearch and update. It can process multiple millions of packets per second,\nwhile dealing with millions of on-line updates per second at the same time, and\nits lookup speed maintains at the same level no mater it handles a large flow\ntable with 10 million rules or a flow table with every entry having as many as\n100 match fields.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
