In the\nabsence of an interspecies attraction, in the first type, a dipolar droplet\nsupersolid exists, whereas in the second type, there are no droplets in the\ndipolar component. To illustrate, we consider a $^{164}$Dy-$^{87}$Rb mixture,\nwhere the untrapped $^{87}$Rb supersolid sticks to the trapped $^{164}$Dy\nsupersolid due to the interspecies attraction and forms a symbiotic supersolid\nwith overlapping droplets. The first (second) type of symbiotic supersolid\nemerges for the scattering length $ a_1=85a_0$ ($a_1=95a_0$) of $^{164}$Dy\natom, while under an appropriate trap a dipolar droplet supersolid exists (does\nnot exist) for no interspecies interaction, where $a_0$ the Bohr radius. This\nstudy is based on the numerical solution of an improved binary mean-field\nmodel, where we introduce an intraspecies Lee-Huang-Yang interaction in the\ndipolar component, which stops a dipolar collapse and forms a dipolar\nsupersolid.To observe this symbiotic droplet supersolid, one should prepare the\ncorresponding fully trapped dipolar-nondipolar supersolid and then remove the\ntrap on the nondipolar atoms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
