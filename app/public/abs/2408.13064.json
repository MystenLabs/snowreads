We provide a set of conditions for the existence of\nsolutions in non-convex simply connected regions. We assume the boundary data\nis continuous and in the space of functions of bounded variation, and we are\ninterested in solutions that satisfy the boundary conditions in the trace\nsense. Our method relies on the equivalence of the least gradient problem and\nthe Beckman problem which allows us to use the tools of the optimal\ntransportation theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
