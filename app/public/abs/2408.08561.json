This training process is accelerated by combining LoRA\nwith pre-trained SDM and DreamBooth with pre-trained SDM, respectively. On the\nChinese Landscape Paintings Internet dataset used in this paper, this study\nfinds that SDM combined with DreamBooth exhibits superior performance,\noutperforming other models, including the generic pre-trained SDM and\nLoRA-based fine-tuning SDM. The SDM combined with DreamBooth achieves a FID of\n12.75 on the dataset and outperforms all other models in terms of expert\nevaluation, highlighting the model's versatility in the field of Chinese\nLandscape Paintings given the unique identifier, high fidelity and high\nquality. This study illustrates the potential of specialised fine-tuning method\nto improve the performance of SDM on domain-specific tasks, particularly in the\ndomain of Landscape Paintings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
