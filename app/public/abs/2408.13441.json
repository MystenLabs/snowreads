This\nframework is based upon a degenerate Clifford algebra, and it is the purpose of\nthis paper to delve deeper into its internal algebraic structure and extract\nmeaningful information for the purposes of PGA. This includes exploiting the\nsplit extension structure to realise the natural decomposition of elements of\nthis Clifford algebra into Euclidean and ideal parts. This leads to a beautiful\ndemonstration of how Playfair's axiom for affine geometry arises from the\nambient degenerate quadratic space. The highlighted split extension property of\nthe Clifford algebra also corresponds to a splitting of the group of units and\nthe Lie algebra of bivectors. Central to these results is that the degenerate\nClifford algebra $\\mathrm{Cl}(V)$ is isomorphic to the twisted trivial\nextension $\\mathrm{Cl}(V/\\langle e_0\\rangle)\\ltimes_\\alpha\\mathrm{Cl}(V/\\langle\ne_0\\rangle)$, where $e_0$ is a degenerate vector and $\\alpha$ is the\ngrade-involution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
