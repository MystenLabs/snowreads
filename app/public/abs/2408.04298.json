This studying is devoted to their applications to the\nplanetary restricted three-body problem (RTBP). Here we consider the Laplace\nmethod for determining perturbation in coordinates. We show that classical\ntheory of perturbation leads to a linear equation with periodic coefficients.\nThan we present a modification of Laplace method. This modification allows us\nto study motion over a longer time interval.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
