We first construct physical\nvertex operators that correspond to long strings. Due to the GSO projection,\nthey depend on the parity of the spectral flow parameter $w$. For a given $w$,\nwe construct the physical operators that have the lowest space-time weights in\nboth the NS and R sector. Then, we calculate three point correlators for each\npossible type of parities of spectral flows. We find that the recursion\nrelations of correlators in the bosonic SL$(2,\\mathbb{R})$ WZW model can be\nunderstood from the equivalence of these superstring correlators with different\npicture choices. Furthermore, after carefully mapping the vertex operators to\nappropriate operators in the dual CFT, we find that once the fermionic\ncontributions together with the picture changing effects are correctly taken\ninto account, some mathematical identities of covering maps lead to the\nmatching of the correlators of the two sides. We check this explicitly at the\nleading order in the conformal perturbation computation and conjecture that\nthis remains correct to all orders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
