I use the bicrossproduct\nbasis of $\\kappa$-Poincar\\'{e} algebra to describe photon propagation in\ndeSitter classical General Relativity. I show the Hopf algebraic aspects of\ndeSitter model, and give an explicit physical interpretation of\n$\\kappa$-Poincar\\'{e} Hopf algebraic features in spacetime. Such an approach\nallows to unravel some not yet known General Relativistic relations of deSitter\ncosmology, and reinterpret many future of Quantum Gravity phenomenology as\nclassical properties of maximally symmetric spacetime models.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
