Although the supercell technique is commonly used for\nstudying their surface effects, it falls short in sorting the states at two\nboundaries, differentiating surface states from bulk states, and demanding\nlarge computational resources. To overcome the limitations, we employ surface\nGreen's functions combined with two efficient algorithms to obtain the ideal\nsurface states for a semi-infinite system. They are further extended to more\ncomplex scenarios, such as coated structures, heterostructures, and sandwiched\nstructures. Photonic Chern insulators, valley photonic crystals, and acoustic\ntopological insulators are taken as examples for demonstration and\nverification. The surface spectra obtained from our approach can be directly\nused for comparison with experimental observables. Our approach enriches the\nefficient computational tools for topological photonics and acoustics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
