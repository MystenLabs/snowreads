We reformulate these models for complex\nGrassmannians in terms of simple supersymmetric Lagrangians with polynomial\ninteractions. For maximal isotropic Grassmannians we propose two types of\nequivalent Lagrangians, which make either supersymmetry or the geometry of\ntarget space manifest. These reformulations can be seen as current-current\ndeformations of curved $\\beta \\gamma$ systems. The $\\mathsf{CP}^{1}$\nsupersymmetric sigma model is our prototypical example.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
