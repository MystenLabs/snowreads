(2024). We extend \"Knothe's\nrearrangement\" Bonnotte (2013) and \"triangular transport\" Zech and Marzouk\n(2022a) to probabilistic graphical models, and use this counterfactual\napproach, referred to as sequential transport, to discuss individual fairness.\nAfter establishing the theoretical foundations of the proposed method, we\ndemonstrate its application through numerical experiments on both synthetic and\nreal datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V1l64qLpnrIwmTZjlynKcWNmQw2AvksT_b8SS1dTfa4","pdfSize":"1991781"}
