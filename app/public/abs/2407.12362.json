This higher-order model\ntakes into account the influence of the complete pressure tensor. A numerical\nscheme is developed for comparing the two models through numerical simulations\nof three-component diffusion. It is shown that the higher-order model preserves\nqualitative features of the diffusion process, but quantitative differences\nwere observed in the behavior of the mixture components.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
