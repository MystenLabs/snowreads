They are contained in both twin double\nposets and tree double posets, giving candidate sets for generalizations of\ncorner tree countings. We provide the generalization of an algorithm proposed\nby Even-Zohar/Leng to a class of tree double posets, thereby enlarging the\nspace of permutations that can be counted in O(n^{5/3}).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
