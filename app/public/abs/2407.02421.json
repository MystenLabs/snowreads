In some sense, space is lost in\nthe state space itself. Moreover, the relationship between the observables and\nthe physical properties they represent becomes relative. But we can verify that\nthey are not relative, and the spacetime structure is unique. I show that this\nimplies that not all structures isomorphic with observers can be observers,\ncontradicting Structural Realism and Physicalism. This indicates a strong\nconnection between spacetime and the sentience of the observers, as anticipated\nby some early contributors to Special and General Relativity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
