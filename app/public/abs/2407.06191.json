However, detailed edit and customization of 3D assets remains a\nlong-standing challenge. Specifically, 3D Generation methods lack the ability\nto follow finely detailed instructions as precisely as their 2D image creation\ncounterparts. Imagine you can get a toy through 3D AIGC but with undesired\naccessories and dressing. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel pipeline\ncalled Tailor3D, which swiftly creates customized 3D assets from editable\ndual-side images. We aim to emulate a tailor's ability to locally change\nobjects or perform overall style transfer. Unlike creating 3D assets from\nmultiple views, using dual-side images eliminates conflicts on overlapping\nareas that occur when editing individual views. Specifically, it begins by\nediting the front view, then generates the back view of the object through\nmulti-view diffusion. Afterward, it proceeds to edit the back views. Finally, a\nDual-sided LRM is proposed to seamlessly stitch together the front and back 3D\nfeatures, akin to a tailor sewing together the front and back of a garment. The\nDual-sided LRM rectifies imperfect consistencies between the front and back\nviews, enhancing editing capabilities and reducing memory burdens while\nseamlessly integrating them into a unified 3D representation with the LoRA\nTriplane Transformer. Experimental results demonstrate Tailor3D's effectiveness\nacross various 3D generation and editing tasks, including 3D generative fill\nand style transfer. It provides a user-friendly, efficient solution for editing\n3D assets, with each editing step taking only seconds to complete.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
