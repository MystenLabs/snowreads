Among\nthe numerous methodologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with\ncontrastive learning have been particularly successful. This study aims to\ndemonstrate that the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) can effectively replace\nthe Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) method in generative AI, particularly in the\nsubdomain of image-to-image translation, to achieve better generative quality.\nOur novel approach replaces the two-layer MLP with a two-layer KAN in the\nexisting Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT) model,\ndeveloping the KAN-CUT model. This substitution favors the generation of more\ninformative features in low-dimensional vector representations, which\ncontrastive learning can utilize more effectively to produce high-quality\nimages in the target domain. Extensive experiments, detailed in the results\nsection, demonstrate the applicability of KAN in conjunction with contrastive\nlearning and GANs in Generative AI, particularly for image-to-image\ntranslation. This work suggests that KAN could be a valuable component in the\nbroader generative AI domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
