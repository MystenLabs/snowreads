Despite efforts to reduce false positives and negatives,\nsignificant attacks persist, highlighting the need for advanced solutions.\nMachine Learning (ML) models show promise in enhancing NIDS. This study uses\nthe UGRansome dataset to train various ML models for zero-day and ransomware\nattacks detection. The finding demonstrates that Random Forest Classifier\n(RFC), XGBoost, and Ensemble Methods achieved perfect scores in accuracy,\nprecision, recall, and F1-score. In contrast, Support Vector Machine (SVM) and\nNaive Bayes (NB) models performed poorly. Comparison with other studies shows\nDecision Trees and Ensemble Methods improvements, with accuracy around 99.4%\nand 97.7%, respectively. Future research should explore Synthetic Minority\nOver-sampling Techniques (SMOTEs) and diverse or versatile datasets to improve\nreal-time recognition of zero-day and ransomware attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
