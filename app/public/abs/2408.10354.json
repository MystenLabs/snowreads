Beside the ~170 (min to max) decadal\nvariation in sunspot production there is a less-explored quasi-annual variation\nin the range of 25-50 sunspots/year in magnitude. In addition, there is there\nis a slower, ~80 year period, 10-50 variation in the sunspot number, that is\ncommonly referred to as the 'Gleissberg Cycle.' Using a suite of contemporary\nand historical observations we will illustrate these elements of our star's\nepisodic behavior and present a hypothesis that may provide a consistent\nphysical link between the observed 'climatic', 'decadal' and 'seasonal'\nmagnetic variation of our star.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
