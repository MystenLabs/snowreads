Geometric manipulations (braiding) of multiple wires can\nbe used to induce topologically robust transformations within the ground state\nsubspace. The mean-field ground states do not have a definite number of\nparticles and thus cannot describe an isolated system. Projecting such states\nonto fixed particle number gives a very good approximation to the true ground\nstate of an isolated superconductor. In previous work, we showed that so\nprojecting the prototypical Kitaev wave function of a single wire retains key\nfeatures of the mean-field description, such as the zero-energy single-particle\nspectral peaks near the wire edges. Here we consider the case of multiple wires\nwith conserved total charge. Again, using the projected Kitaev wave functions\nas the template, we identify the many-body counterparts of the mean-field\ntopologically degenerate ground states. We then demonstrate how the quantum\ngates equivalent to braiding of Majorana zero modes can be implemented, albeit\nwith reduced protection from noise and disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
