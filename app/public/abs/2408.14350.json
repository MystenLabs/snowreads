We discuss in this framework gauge coupling unification and proton\ndecay, as well as the appearance of superheavy quasistable strings with $G\\mu\n\\sim 10^{-8} - 10^{-5}$, where $\\mu$ denotes the dimensionless string tension\nparameter. We use Bayesian analysis to show that for $G\\mu$ values $\\sim 4\n\\times 10^{-7} - 10^{-5}$, the gravitational wave spectrum emitted from the\nquasistable strings is in good agreement with the recent pulsar timing array\ndata. Corresponding to $G \\mu$ values $\\sim 10^{-8} - 2 \\times 10^{-7}$, proton\ndecay is expected to occur at a rate accessible in the Hyper-Kamiokande\nexperiment. Finally, we present the gravitational wave spectrum emitted by\neffectively stable strings with $G\\mu\\approx 10^{-8}$ that have experienced a\ncertain amount of inflation. This can be tested with future detectors in the\n$\\mu$Hz frequency range.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
