Our composition, with significantly less Co than in an earlier\nstudy, shows discharge capacity close to 190 mAhg-1 and specific energy density\nexceeding 500 mWhg-1 in the 1.5 to 4.3 V range. The material also shows an\nimproved structural stability over similar materials. Such changes, between the\npristine phase (P63/mmc, P63 (OP4), or orthorhombic Cmcm) and the so-called Z\nphase, are endemic to other P2-type cathodes such as Na0.67Mn0.65Fe0.35O2\n(NMFO). We propose two equivalent circuit models of impedance spectroscopy to\nunderstand electrochemical processes in our cells with a sodium metal anode.\nOur equivalent circuit modeling, combined with an analysis of the initial\ngalvanostatic slope, reveals a significant reduction in the polarization and\ninterfacial charge-transfer resistance at the solid electrolyte interface. We\nreveal that the combined effects of crystal structure stability, lower internal\nresistance, relatively high specific energy density, and improved battery\nhealth make this low-cobalt P2-type cathode composition a very promising\ncandidate for new sodium-ion batteries.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
