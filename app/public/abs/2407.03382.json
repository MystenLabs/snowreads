This is achieved through the use of the\nThompson geometry of the semidefinite cone. We explore a particular geodesic\nspace structure in detail and establish several properties associated with it.\nFinally, we review a novel inductive mean of SPD matrices based on this\ngeometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
