With the introduction of an imaginary\ngauge field in the hopping parameter of a two-dimensional d-wave altermagnet,\nwe discover an inversion broken mixed phase featuring the coexistence of\nspin-momentum locked and unlocked spin polarized bands along with the\naltermagnetic order, without hosting exceptional points (EPs). By attaching a\nferromagnetic lead with d-wave altermagnet, we uncover the emergence of two\npairs of exceptional points, a hallmark signature of the non-Hermitian\ntopology. Further, we demonstrate that the application of a planar magnetic\nfield to the junction not only tune the location of the EPs but also can\nannihilate single pair or even all pairs of EPs depending on the field\ndirection. Finally, we establish that the spin expectation value coalesces at\nthe EPs, revealing its another fingerprint.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
