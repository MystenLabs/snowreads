Of particular focus is the case where the\nsmooth part has a nonlinear least-squares structure. We adapt two existing\napproaches for derivative-free optimization of nonsmooth compositions of smooth\nfunctions to this setting. Our main contribution is adapting our algorithm to\nhandle inexactly computed stationary measures, where the inexactness is\nadaptively adjusted as required by the algorithm (where previous approaches\nassumed access to exact stationary measures, which is not realistic in this\nsetting). Numerically, we provide two extensions of the state-of-the-art DFO-LS\nsolver for nonlinear least-squares problems and demonstrate their strong\npractical performance.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
