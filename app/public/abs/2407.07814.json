When obtaining these point evaluations is\ncostly, minimising the required sample size becomes crucial. Recently, an\nincreasing focus has been on employing adaptive sampling strategies to achieve\nthis. These strategies are based on linear spaces related to the nonlinear\nmodel class, for which the optimal sampling measures are known. However, the\nresulting optimal sampling measures depend on an orthonormal basis of the\nlinear space, which is known rarely. Consequently, sampling from these measures\nis challenging in practice. This manuscript presents a sampling strategy that\niteratively refines an estimate of the optimal sampling measure by updating it\nbased on previously drawn samples. This strategy can be performed offline and\ndoes not require evaluations of the sought function. We establish convergence\nand illustrate the practical performance through numerical experiments.\nComparing the presented approach with standard Monte Carlo sampling\ndemonstrates a significant reduction in the number of samples required to\nachieve a good estimation of an orthonormal basis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
