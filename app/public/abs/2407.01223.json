A proof of the validity\nof a topological classification based on the Green's function by explicit\nevaluation of the topological invariant is presented. Further, we show that due\nto entanglement between the in-gap modes and the substrate, the full physics of\nthe substrate that is contained in the Green's function is required. This is\ndone by considering a classification scheme derived from the reduced ground\nstate projector, for which we show that an uncritical handling produces\nerroneous changes in the topological index due to entanglement driven gap\nclosures. We illustrate our results by applying them to a tight-binding model\nof a spiral magnetic interface in a s-wave superconductor.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cczyR7JBd4Z16g8y6HW6WKDmmnOxK5cr8HJpdnQBMac","pdfSize":"6170300"}
