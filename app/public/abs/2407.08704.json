We construct and train\nhybrid models, blending spiking neural networks (SNNs) and artificial neural\nnetworks (ANNs) using PyTorch and Lava frameworks. Our hybrid architecture\nintegrates an SNN for temporal feature extraction and an ANN for\nclassification. We delve into the challenges of deploying such hybrid\nstructures on hardware. Specifically, we deploy individual components on\nIntel's Neuromorphic Processor Loihi (for SNN) and Jetson Nano (for ANN). We\nalso propose an accumulator circuit to transfer data from the spiking to the\nnon-spiking domain. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive performance analyses\nof hybrid SNN-ANN models on a heterogeneous system of neuromorphic and edge AI\nhardware, evaluating accuracy, latency, power, and energy consumption. Our\nfindings demonstrate that the hybrid spiking networks surpass the baseline ANN\nmodel across all metrics and outperform the baseline SNN model in accuracy and\nlatency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
