In this work, we\ncompare and contrast these methods: `the running coupling constant' where the\ntwo-body ground state energy is used as a renormalization condition, and two\neffective interaction approaches that include information about the ground as\nwell as excited states. In particular, we calculate the energies and densities\nof few-fermion systems in a harmonic oscillator with the configuration\ninteraction method, and compare the results based upon renormalized and bare\ninteractions. We find that the use of the running coupling constant instead of\nthe bare interaction improves convergence significantly. A comparison with an\neffective interaction, which is designed to reproduce the relative part of the\nenergy spectrum of two particles, showed a similar improvement. The effective\ninteraction provides an additional improvement if the center-of-mass\nexcitations are included in the construction. Finally, we discuss the\ntransformation of observables alongside the renormalization of the potential,\nand demonstrate that this might be an essential ingredient for accurate\nnumerical calculations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
