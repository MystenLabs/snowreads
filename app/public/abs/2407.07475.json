To bridge this gap, we propose a general\ncovert SemCom framework for wireless networks, reducing eavesdropping risk. Our\napproach transmits semantic information covertly, making it difficult for\nwardens to detect. Given the aim of maximizing covert SemCom performance, we\nformulate a power control problem in covert SemCom under energy constraints.\nFurthermore, we propose a learning-based approach based on the soft\nactor-critic algorithm, optimizing the power of the transmitter and friendly\njammer. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach effectively enhances\nthe performance of covert SemCom.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
