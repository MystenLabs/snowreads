Our model exhibits a quantum critical point, at which\nthe repulsive component of the electron interactions strongly enhances the\neffects of the quantum critical bosonic fluctuations on the electrons, leading\nto a breakdown of Fermi liquid physics and the formation of a strange metal\nwith `Planckian' ($\\mathcal{O}(k_B T/\\hbar)$) quasiparticle decay rates at low\ntemperatures $T\\rightarrow 0$. Furthermore, the eventual Mott transition that\noccurs as the repulsion is increased seemingly bounds the maximum decay rate in\nthe strange metal. Our results provide insight into low-temperature strange\nmetallicity observed in proximity to a Mott transition, as is observed, for\ninstance, in recent experiments on certain moir\\'{e} materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h9Vg4qubKRoo5U1xX7qxKxttegEcHi00Sh11DICters","pdfSize":"1606527"}
