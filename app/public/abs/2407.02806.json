In this work, we uncover two unique phenomena in\nFloquet systems caused by gain and loss. First, multiple topological\ntransitions from anomalous Floquet second-order topological insulators to\nanomalous Floquet first-order topological insulators and then to normal\ninsulators can be induced by gain and loss. Interestingly, the resulting\nanomalous Floquet insulators further carry hybrid skin-topological boundary\nmodes, which could either be fully localized or localized to different edges at\ndifferent time slices and traversing along all edges in a single driving\nperiod. The topological phase transitions are also shown to be detectable\nthrough studies of transmission properties in the setting of coupled ring\nresonators. Second, gain and loss are found to induce singularities in the\nFloquet spectral, around which anomalous transmissions at flat quasienergy\nbands are predicted. These discoveries not only enhanced our understanding of\ntopological matter and phase transitions in driven non-Hermitian systems, but\nalso promoted their experimental realizations in optical and acoustic settings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
