An Aerial Traffic Management System operates similarly as an\norganization but certainly in a more strict manner. Third party agencies ensure\nseveral aspects of their functionality, the utmost to be consider safety. Many\npeople take safety as granted but it is a pretty difficult part our daily\nfunctions. Thus, apart from digesting new things and habits of the new era,\nsimultaneously we have to ensure safety in every part of it. It is true that\nthe more data we produce, the more information we create and the more\nspecialization we must introduce in order to be effective in a reasonable time\nbasis. A Unmanned Aircraft System Traffic Management (UTM) is a system that\nconsists of miscellaneous modules where each of them needs its consideration\nregarding safety. In other words, a UTM is the state-of-the-art system that\ndemand a high quality of services and specialization, if we need to consider\nthem reliable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
