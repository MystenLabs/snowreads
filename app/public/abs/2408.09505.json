Specifically, we introduce a new mean-field liquidation game\ninvolving major and minor traders, where the major trader evaluates her\nstrategy against a periodic targeting strategy while a continuum of minor\nplayers trade against her. We establish the existence and uniqueness of an\nopen-loop Nash equilibrium. In addition, we prove an O(1/sqrt N) approximation\nrate of the mean-field solution to the Nash equilibrium in a major-minor game\nwith N minor players. In equilibrium, minor traders exhibit front-running\nbehaviors in both the periodic and trend components of their strategies,\nreducing the major trader's profit. Such strategic interactions diminish the\nstrength of periodicity in both overall trading volume and asset prices. Our\nmodel rationalizes observed periodic trading activities in the market and\noffers new insights into market dynamics.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Economics/Theoretical Economics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tPlcqkuPbNZpj2ASvjKXT69VM86lhdan0A-57QUFnkM","pdfSize":"1779438"}
