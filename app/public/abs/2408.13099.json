It can also\nfacilitate magnon-mediated current drag, the nonlocal electric current response\nof two normal metal layers separated by a magnetic insulator. In this article,\nwe present a theory of these two spintronic effects and their nonlinear\ncounterparts for time-dependent applied electric fields $E(\\omega)$, with\ndriving frequencies $\\omega$ up to the THz regime. We compare various\nmechanisms leading to a quadratic-in-$E$ response $-$ Joule heating,\nspin-torque diode effect, and magnonic unidirectional spin-Hall\nmagnetoresistance $-$ and show how these can be disentangled by their\ncharacteristic dependences on $\\omega$ and the magnetization direction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"atXJAk5vUrHf_rE0F9dh4hpasbaTK6CV-1xjl8DFNKg","pdfSize":"1222450"}
