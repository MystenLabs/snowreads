Two complementary examples are discussed, the\ncase of the $e^+e^- \\to W^+ W^-$ processes, with maximum mass and short\nlifetime for the particle pairs in the final state, and the case of electron\npositron annihilation into heavier charged lepton pairs, $e^+ e^- \\to \\mu^+\n\\mu^-$ and $e^+ e^- \\to \\tau^+ \\tau^-$. These bounds may be improved by the\nnext generation of electron-positron colliders, and are complementary to bounds\narising from direct graviton searches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
