However, the key technique of TDA, i.e., persistent\nhomology, is defined on point cloud data, which restricts its scope. In this\nwork, we propose persistent de Rham-Hodge Laplacian, or persistent Hodge\nLaplacian (PHL) for abbreviation, for the TDA on manifolds with boundaries, or\nvolumetric data. Specifically, we extended the evolutionary de Rham-Hodge\ntheory from the Lagrangian formulation to the Eulerian formulation via\nstructure-persevering Cartesian grids, and extended the persistent Laplacian on\npoint clouds to persistent (de Rham-)Hodge Laplacian on nested families of\nmanifolds with appropriate boundary conditions. The proposed PHL facilitates\nthe machine learning and deep learning prediction of volumetric data. For a\nproof-of-principle application of the proposed PHL, we propose a persistent\nHodge Laplacian learning (PHLL) algorithm for data on manifolds or volumetric\ndata. To this end, we showcase the PHLL prediction of protein-ligand binding\naffinities in two benchmark datasets. Our numerical experiments highlight the\npower and promise of PHLL.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
