This model is potentially relevant to\nunderstanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated\ninteraction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of\nspin-chirality duality, we derive a rich phase diagram of this model that\nincludes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange\n$J_\\perp<0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\\rm ch}<0$. The phase diagram consists of the\nrung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered\nphases. Furthermore, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with\ndifferent dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We\nperform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and\ncritical properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
