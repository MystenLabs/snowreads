Events are selected requiring exactly one or two\nopposite-charge electrons or muons. Data-driven corrections are applied to\nimprove the modelling of the $t\\bar{t}$+jets background in the regime with high\njet and $b$-jet multiplicities. These include a novel multi-dimensional\nkinematic reweighting based on a neural network trained using data and\nsimulations. An $H/A$-mass parameterised graph neural network is trained to\noptimise the signal-to-background discrimination. In combination with the\nprevious search performed by the ATLAS Collaboration in the multilepton final\nstate, the observed upper limits on the $t\\bar{t}H/A \\rightarrow\nt\\bar{t}t\\bar{t}$ production cross-section at 95% confidence level range\nbetween 14 fb and 5.0 fb for an $H/A$ with mass between 400 GeV and 1000 GeV,\nrespectively. Assuming that both the $H$ and $A$ contribute to the\n$t\\bar{t}t\\bar{t}$ cross-section, $\\tan\\beta$ values below 1.7 or 0.7 are\nexcluded for a mass of 400 GeV or 1000 GeV, respectively. The results are also\nused to constrain a model predicting the pair production of a colour-octet\nscalar, with the scalar decaying into a $t\\bar{t}$ pair.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fwIMgnXjFRpjPwhUoAnYpZ9n0DGoMGAmgXsi0xACAYo","pdfSize":"2143416"}
