This study provides a comparative analysis of five YOLOv5\nvariants, YOLOv5n6s, YOLOv5s6s, YOLOv5m6s, YOLOv5l6s, and YOLOv5x6s, for\nvehicle detection in various environments. The research focuses on evaluating\nthe effectiveness of these models in detecting different types of vehicles,\nsuch as Car, Bus, Truck, Bicycle, and Motorcycle, under varying conditions\nincluding lighting, occlusion, and weather. Performance metrics such as\nprecision, recall, F1-score, and mean Average Precision are utilized to assess\nthe accuracy and reliability of each model. YOLOv5n6s demonstrated a strong\nbalance between precision and recall, particularly in detecting Cars. YOLOv5s6s\nand YOLOv5m6s showed improvements in recall, enhancing their ability to detect\nall relevant objects. YOLOv5l6s, with its larger capacity, provided robust\nperformance, especially in detecting Cars, but not good with identifying\nMotorcycles and Bicycles. YOLOv5x6s was effective in recognizing Buses and Cars\nbut faced challenges with Motorcycle class.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kQH4P3wHeIKaF4sjFlVPV6_Vs5ykw7HzBZKBrRV7ghc","pdfSize":"1148061"}
