However, practically attaining\naccurate ground-state properties for bulk metals presents significant\nchallenges. In this work, we propose a novel scheme to reach the thermodynamic\nlimit of the total ground-state energy of metals using coupled cluster theory.\nWe demonstrate that the coupling between long-range and short-range\ncontributions to the correlation energy is sufficiently weak, enabling us to\nrestrict long-range contributions to low-energy excitations in a controllable\nway. Leveraging this insight, we calculate the surface energy of aluminum and\nplatinum (111), providing numerical evidence that coupled cluster theory is\nwell-suited for modeling metallic materials, particularly in surface science.\nNotably, our results exhibit convergence with respect to finite-size effects,\nbasis-set size, and coupled cluster expansion, yielding excellent agreement\nwith experimental data. This paves the way for more efficient coupled cluster\ncalculations for large systems and a broader utilization of the theory in\nrealistic metallic models of materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
