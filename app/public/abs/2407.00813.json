We establish two distinctive yet\ncomplementary portfolio liquidity measures: portfolio liquidity jump that\nquantifies the effect of liquidity adjustment in forecasting the conditional\ncovariance matrix, and portfolio liquidity diffusion that quantifies the effect\nof liquidity adjustment in estimating the posterior covariance matrix.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kYFg3lTY-BoYg-uCPvuEctoHjpTlpInqh6Z2mT2i4hk","pdfSize":"2516498","objectId":"0x8c1c938431ae47d82326157e9b2865dd2d642166fd2ab469ad175f57b1e09d46","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
