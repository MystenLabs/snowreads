Due to\nthe high volatility of acetone, the corresponding $n_{\\text{D}}$ measurements\nwere developed at 293.15 K and 298.15 K. The direct experimental data were used\nto determine the excess molar volumes, $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$, and the\nexcess refractive indices, $n_{\\text{D}}^{\\text{E}}$, at the working $T$.\nValues of the excess functions at 298.15 K, for the speed of sound,\n$c^{\\text{E}}$, the isentropic compressibility, $\\kappa_S^{\\text{E}}$ and for\nthe excess thermal expansion coefficient, $\\alpha_p^{\\text{E}}$, were also\ncalculated. The investigated systems are characterized by strong amide-ketone\ninteractions, which become weaker when the alkanone size is increased. This is\nsupported by negative $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$ values; by the dependence on\n$T$ and pressure of $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$, and by positive\n$P_{\\text{int}}^{\\text{E}}$ (excess internal pressure) values. Analysis of the\nsystems in terms of the Rao's constant indicates that there is no complex\nformation. In addition, negative $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$ values also reveal\nthe existence of structural effects, which largely contribute to the excess\nmolar enthalpy, $H_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$. $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$ and\n$H_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$ values increase with the chain length of the\n2-alkanone. It allows to conclude that the relative $V_{\\text{m}}^{\\text{E}}$\nvariation with the ketone size is closely related to that of the interactional\ncontribution to this excess function. Molar refraction values, $R_{\\text{m}}$,\nshow that dispersive interactions become more relevant for the systems\nincluding longer 2-alkanones.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
