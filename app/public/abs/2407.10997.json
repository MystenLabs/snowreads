These traces are then analyzed using a machine\nlearning approach to infer the carrier-sense relationship between network\nnodes. It also demonstrates an important application of this tool-detection of\nselfish carrier-sense behavior. This is based on identifying any asymmetry in\ncarrier-sense behavior between node pairs and finding multiple witnesses to\nraise confidence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach of\nestimating interference relations is significantly more accurate than simpler\nheuristics and quite competitive with active measurements.
