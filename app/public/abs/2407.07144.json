Such spins\nusually prefer a parallel or antiparallel configuration, but weakly\nnon-collinear alignments are possible due to the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya\ninteraction (DMI) that arises in the presence of relativistic spin-orbit\ncoupling. Here, we show that an effective DMI can emerge purely from\nsuperconducting correlations without any spin-orbit interaction. We give an\nanalytical proof and provide a numerical study which shows that DMI arises in\nmixed-parity superconductors solely from the superconducting pairing. These\nresults enable a way to engineer spin textures using the superconducting phase\ntransition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
