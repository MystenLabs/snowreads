We propose an extension to the Justice40 optimization model by\nadding storage and incorporating more realistic solar compensation mechanisms,\nsuch as net-billing, which allows for temporal revenue differentiation and the\neconomic viability of behind-the-meter energy storage devices. The extended\nmodel includes household-level PV plus storage co-deployment alongside existing\ninterventions, such as weatherization, rooftop PV only, community solar, and\ncommunity wind. From a modeling perspective, we propose a novel approximation\nmethod to represent storage operations and revenue streams without expanding\nthe temporal dimension of model, thus maintaining its computational efficiency.\nThe proposed model is validated using a case study in Wayne County, Michigan,\ninvolving 3,651 energy insecure households.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
