In this study, we present the\nresults of an analysis of the star formation (SF) properties of $z \\sim 0.87$\nclusters and groups from a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation Horizon Run\n5. We investigate the correlation between the quiescent galaxy fraction (QF) of\nthese model clusters/groups and their various internal or external properties.\nWe find that halo mass is one of the most important characteristics as higher\nmass clusters and groups have higher QFs. We also find that other properties\nsuch as stellar-mass ratio and Friends-of-Friends fraction, which measures the\nproportion of the area around a cluster occupied by dense structures, may\nmildly affect the QFs of clusters and groups. This may indicate that the\nevolutionary history as well as the large-scale environment of clusters and\ngroups also play a certain role in determining the SF status of high-redshift\ngalaxy clusters and groups.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
