Kyushu Institute of Technology and collaborators have\nlaunched a joint venture for a nanosatellite mission, VERTECS. The primary\nmission is to elucidate the formation history of stars by observing the\noptical-wavelength cosmic background radiation. The VERTECS satellite will be\nequipped with a small-aperture telescope and a high-precision attitude control\nsystem to capture the cosmic data for analysis on the ground. However,\nnanosatellites are limited by their onboard memory resources and downlink speed\ncapabilities. Additionally, due to a limited number of ground stations, the\nsatellite mission will face issues meeting the required data budget for mission\nsuccess. To alleviate this issue, we propose an on-orbit system to autonomously\nclassify and then compress desirable image data for data downlink\nprioritization and optimization. The system comprises a prototype Camera\nController Board (CCB) which carries a Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 which is\nused for classification and compression. The system uses a lightweight\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify and determine the\ndesirability of captured image data. The model is designed to be lean and\nrobust to reduce the computational and memory load on the satellite. The model\nis trained and tested on a novel star field dataset consisting of data captured\nby the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). The dataset is meant to simulate the\nexpected data produced by the 6U satellite. The compression step implements\nGZip, RICE or HCOMPRESS compression, which are standards for astronomical data.\nPreliminary testing on the proposed CNN model results in a classification\naccuracy of about 100\\% on the star field dataset, with compression ratios of\n3.99, 5.16 and 5.43 for GZip, RICE and HCOMPRESS that were achieved on tested\nFITS image data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
