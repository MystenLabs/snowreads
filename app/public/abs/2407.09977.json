The problem has long\nbeen recognized but there are no systematic solutions in practice. This study\nintroduces an innovative approach that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)\nalong with retrieval augmented generation and real-time search capabilities to\ncounteract interpretation biases, thereby enhancing the accuracy and\nreliability of geological analyses. By applying this framework to sedimentology\nand paleogeography, we demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating\ninterpretations biases through the generation and evaluation of multiple\nhypotheses for the same data, which can effectively reduce human bias. Our\nresearch illuminates the transformative potential of LLMs in refining\npaleoenvironmental studies and extends their applicability across various\nsub-disciplines of Earth sciences, enabling a deeper and more accurate\ndepiction of Earth's evolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
