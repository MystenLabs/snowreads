Various types of explainable recommender systems have\nbeen proposed including explainable graph-based recommender systems. This\nreview paper discusses state-of-the-art approaches of these systems and\ncategorizes them based on three aspects: learning methods, explaining methods,\nand explanation types. It also explores the commonly used datasets,\nexplainability evaluation methods, and future directions of this research area.\nCompared with the existing review papers, this paper focuses on explainability\nbased on graphs and covers the topics required for developing novel explainable\ngraph-based recommender systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
