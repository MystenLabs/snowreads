A long-standing question is to\ncalculate $M(n, k, p)$ for all values of $n,k,p$. This question has been\npartially addressed by several authors, primarily with the goal of answering\nasymptotic questions. The present paper focuses on obtaining exact expressions\nfor this probability. To this end, we provide closed-form formulas of\n$M(n,k,p)$ for $p$ near 0 as well as $p$ near 1.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
