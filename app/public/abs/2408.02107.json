This paper focuses on HNLs with masses\nsignificantly above the electroweak scale. It is challenging to test for the\npresence of such particles directly. However, they leave behind effective\ninteractions of Standard Model particles, leading in particular to charged\nlepton flavor violation (cLFV) processes. Non-observation of cLFV processes\nputs therefore constraints on the parameters of the HNLs. In this paper, we\nfind the relations between the effective operators in the realistic case when\nneutrino masses are non-zero and the HNLs are non-degenerate. This allows us to\nstrengthen the existing cLFV constraints. We also link the baryon asymmetry of\nthe Universe to the same higher-dimensional effective operators, providing\ncomplementary bounds on these parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
