Our research assesses the performance and effectiveness of\nthese models in a controlled setting. Through rigorous experimentation, we\nexamine each model's learning efficiency, strategy development, and\nadaptability under dynamic game conditions. The findings provide critical\ninsights into the practical applications of these models in game-based learning\nenvironments and contribute to the broader understanding of their capabilities.\nThe code is publicly available at github.com/Neilus03/DRL_comparative_study.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M8BeqgVnDcKyLhn6p3UatDto7NuQwpKrRSC_Uf6UWyg","pdfSize":"1673101"}
