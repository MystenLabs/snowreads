Particularly cone\nbeam computed tomography (CBCT) with defacto real time and mobility\ncapabilities plays an important role. However, CBCT images often suffer from\nartifacts, which pose challenges for accurate interpretation, motivating\nresearch in advanced algorithms for more effective use in clinical practice.\n  In this work we present CBCTLiTS, a synthetically generated, labelled CBCT\ndataset for segmentation with paired and aligned, high quality computed\ntomography data. The CBCT data is provided in 5 different levels of quality,\nreaching from a large number of projections with high visual quality and mild\nartifacts to a small number of projections with severe artifacts. This allows\nthorough investigations with the quality as a degree of freedom. We also\nprovide baselines for several possible research scenarios like uni- and\nmultimodal segmentation, multitask learning and style transfer followed by\nsegmentation of relatively simple, liver to complex liver tumor segmentation.\nCBCTLiTS is accesssible via\nhttps://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maximiliantschuchnig/cbct-liver-and-liver-tumor-segmentation-train-data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
