The dynamics of\ndeformation of a floating solid sheet are primarly governed by gravity, water\ndensity, and the flexural modulus, which depends on its mechanical properties,\nnamely the thickness, the Young's Modulus and the Poisson ratio. Non-invasive\nmethods from seismology can retrieve these three parameters from sheet\ndeformation dynamics. In this article, we developed another method to extract\nlocally the flexural modulus of a floating thin elastic sheet from the\nspatio-temporal deformations of the sheet. We perform laboratory experiment to\ntest the accuracy and the robustness of this method on silicon membranes of\ncontrolled mechanical properties. Using patches of different thicknesses and\nshapes, we eventually draw maps of sheet thickness, with a sub-wavelength\nspatial resolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
