These galaxies span a 3 dex stellar mass range of $10^7 <\nM_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot} < 10^{10}$, with an average SFR of $7.2 \\pm 1.2 M_{\\odot}\n{\\rm yr}^{-1}$ and an average metallicity of $12+{\\rm log(O/H)} = 7.91 \\pm\n0.08$. Our findings align with previous observations up to $z=8$ for the MZR\nand indicate no deviation from local universe FMR up to this redshift. Beyond\n$z=8$, we observe a significant deviation $\\sim 0.27$ dex) in FMR, consistent\nwith recent JWST findings. We also integrate CEERS (135 galaxies) and JADES (47\ngalaxies) samples with our data to study metallicity evolution with redshift in\na combined sample of 263 galaxies, revealing a decreasing metallicity trend\nwith a slope of $0.067 \\pm 0.013$, consistent with IllustrisTNG and EAGLE, but\ncontradicts with FIRE simulations. We introduce an empirical\nmass-metallicity-redshift (MZ-$z$ relation): $12+{\\rm log(O/H)}=6.29 + 0.237\n\\times{\\rm log}(M_{\\ast}/M_{\\odot}) - 0.06 \\times (1+z)$, which accurately\nreproduces the observed trends in metallicity with both redshift and stellar\nmass. This trend underscores the ``Grand Challenge'' in understanding the\nfactors driving high-redshift galactic metallicity trends, such as inflow,\noutflow, and AGN/stellar feedback -- and emphasizes the need for further\ninvestigations with larger samples and enhanced simulations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
