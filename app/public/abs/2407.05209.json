The translation is challenging due to the infinite\npossibilities and the diverse expectations of users. However, traditional\nmethods are often limited by the availability of training data. Therefore,\nVisioBlend, a unified framework supporting three-dimensional control over image\nsynthesis from sketches and strokes based on diffusion models, is proposed. It\nenables users to decide the level of faithfulness to the input strokes and\nsketches. VisioBlend achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of realism\nand flexibility, enabling various applications in image synthesis from sketches\nand strokes. It solves the problem of data availability by synthesizing new\ndata points from hand-drawn sketches and strokes, enriching the dataset and\nenabling more robust and diverse image synthesis. This work showcases the power\nof diffusion models in image creation, offering a user-friendly and versatile\napproach for turning artistic visions into reality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WkJjzeoUOUFjlUViODItRHzaelYSnTIf-n2fqIZc7c0","pdfSize":"1331741"}
