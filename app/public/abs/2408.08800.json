The aim is to elucidate the role of composition\nratio in the early-time wetting kinetics under the influence of long-range\nsurface potential. In our simulations, the attractive part of surface potential\nvaries as $V(z)= -\\epsilon_a/z^{n}$, with $\\epsilon_{a}$ being the\nsurface-potential strength. The surface prefers `$A$' species to form the\nwetting layer. Its thickness [$R_1(t)$] for the majority wetting (number of\n$A$-type particles [$N_A$] > number of $B$-type particles [$N_B$]), grows as a\npower-law with an exponent $1/(n+2)$. This is consistent with the early-time\nkinetics in the form of potential-dependent growth present in the Puri-Binder\nmodel. However, for minority wetting ($N_A$ < $N_B$), the growth exponent in\n$R_1(t)$ is less than $1/(n+2)$. Furthermore, on decreasing the field strength\n$\\epsilon_{a}$, we recover $1/(n+2)$ for a minority wetting case. We provide\nphenomenological arguments to explain the early-time wetting kinetics for both\ncases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
