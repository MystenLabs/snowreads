The most advanced recent\nmethods attempt to incorporate feedback from code execution into prompts to\nhelp guide LLMs in generating correct code, in an iterative process. While\neffective, these methods could be costly and time-consuming due to numerous\ninteractions with the LLM and the extensive token usage. To address this issue,\nwe propose an alternative approach named Evolutionary Prompt Engineering for\nCode (EPiC), which leverages a lightweight evolutionary algorithm to evolve the\noriginal prompts toward better ones that produce high-quality code, with\nminimal interactions with LLM. Our evaluation against state-of-the-art (SOTA)\nLLM-based code generation models shows that EPiC outperforms all the baselines\nin terms of cost-effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
