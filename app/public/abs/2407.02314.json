The creation of suspended structures is based\non the principle of gas-phase etching of amorphous silicon oxide in a mixture\nof hydrogen fluoride (HF) and ethanol gases. In the course of the experiments,\nit has been discovered that suspending micro-structures in the configuration of\na micro-bridge results in a slight reduction in superconducting\ncharacteristics, ranging from 10 to 15% of the initial parameters. It has also\nbeen demonstrated that the thermal coupling between the film and the substrate\nsignificantly affects the dissipation of thermal energy. The power dissipated\ninto the substrate at room temperature can vary by up to 250 times based on the\nvalue of the micro-bridge undercutting.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gpOUATJz8iGfWrwbCNSz1D7havESIIdIskU6zUFF-AU","pdfSize":"847807"}
