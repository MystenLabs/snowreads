Under rather general\nassumptions, these hypersurfaces are unique and provide foliations of $\\mathcal\nD$. As an application, we show that every maximal globally hyperbolic Cauchy\ncompact flat spacetime admits a foliation by hypersurfaces of constant scalar\ncurvature, generalizing to any dimension previous results of\nBarbot-B\\'eguin-Zeghib (for $n=2$) and Smith (for $n=3$).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_ttZpNNRBFk-heo7PpiHjdq-34D-7V9ndfeJGUXsYBE","pdfSize":"465122"}
