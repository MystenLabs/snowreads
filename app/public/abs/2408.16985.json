Using these\nconditions, we can prove that $1+2/Q$ separates the ranges of exponents of\nnonlinearities for the global-in-time solvability of the Cauchy problem\n(so-called the Fujita-exponent), where $Q=2N+2$ is the homogeneous dimension of\n$\\mathbb{H}^N$, and identify the optimal strength of the singularity of the\ninitial data for the local-in-time solvability. Furthermore, our conditions\nlead sharp estimates of the life span of solutions with nonnegative initial\ndata having a polynomial decay at the space infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
