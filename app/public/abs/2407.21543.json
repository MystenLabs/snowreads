It is known that when elements of the i.i.d. matrix have\nfinite fourth moment, then the outlier eigenvalues of the perturbed matrix are\nclose to the outlier eigenvalues of the error, as long as the perturbation is\nrelatively small. We first prove that under a merely second moment condition,\nfor a large class of perturbation matrix with bounded rank and bounded operator\nnorm, the outlier eigenvalues of perturbed matrix still converge to that of the\nperturbation. We then prove that for a matrix with i.i.d. Bernoulli $(d/n)$\nentries or Bernoulli $(d_n/n)$ entries with $d_n=n^{o(1)}$, the same result\nholds for perturbation matrices with a bounded number of nonzero elements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
