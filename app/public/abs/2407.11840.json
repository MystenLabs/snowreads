Additionally, unreliable densification\nprocesses and the calculation of depth through the accumulation of opacity can\ncompromise the detail of mesh extraction. To address this issue, we introduce\nMVG-Splatting, a solution guided by Multi-View considerations. Specifically, we\nintegrate an optimized method for calculating normals, which, combined with\nimage gradients, helps rectify inconsistencies in the original depth\ncomputations. Additionally, utilizing projection strategies akin to those in\nMulti-View Stereo (MVS), we propose an adaptive quantile-based method that\ndynamically determines the level of additional densification guided by depth\nmaps, from coarse to fine detail. Experimental evidence demonstrates that our\nmethod not only resolves the issues of rendering quality degradation caused by\ndepth discrepancies but also facilitates direct mesh extraction from dense\nGaussian point clouds using the Marching Cubes algorithm. This approach\nsignificantly enhances the overall fidelity and accuracy of the 3D\nreconstruction process, ensuring that both the geometric details and visual\nquality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
