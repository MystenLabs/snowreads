We aim to study chemically peculiar Am and Fm stars, distinguished by\ntheir unique abundance patterns, which are crucial for studying mixing\nprocesses in intermediate-mass stars. These stars provide a window into the\natomic diffusion in their stellar envelopes, the evolution-dependent changes in\nmixing, and the resulting effects on pulsation mechanisms. Methods. This study\nexamines the pulsation characteristics of the Am/Fm star group. Our analysis\nencompasses 1276 stars (available as catalogues on GitHub), utilising data from\nTESS and Gaia and focusing on stars from the Renson catalogue. Results. In our\nsample, 51% (649 stars) display no variability, thus categorised as constant\nstars. Among the remaining, 25% (318 stars) are pulsating Am/Fm and {\\rho}\nPuppis stars, including 20% (261 stars) that are exclusively Am/Fm stars.\nAdditionally, 17% (210 stars) show variability indicative of binarity and/or\nrotational modulation and 7% (93 stars) are eclipsing binaries. Of the\npulsating stars, 10% (32 stars) are {\\gamma} Doradus type, 54% (172 stars)\n{\\delta} Scuti type, and 36% (114 stars) are hybrids, underlining a diverse\npulsational behaviour of Am/Fm stars. Conclusions. Our findings indicate that\npulsating stars predominantly occupy positions near the red edge of the\nclassical instability strip, allowing us to ascertain the incidence of\npulsations in this stellar population.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-DuCxt4fFIhZnfoOwskLGOh5WwYny9DA0frIpDTryk4","pdfSize":"2310894"}
