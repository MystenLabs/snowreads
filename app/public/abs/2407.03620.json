The nulling-optimized mid-infrared camera (NOMIC) on the Large\nBinocular Telescope Interferometer (LBTI) has a low resolution (R$\\sim$200)\ngermanium grism that was previously installed but has not been characterized\nand commissioned for scientific observations. Using a 1.27 mm slit and\nbroadband filter in combination with the grism, the infrared window between\n8-13 $\\mu$m can be captured. We describe initial on sky testing of the\nLBTI/NOMIC grism mode with adaptive optics to study standard stars and\nbinaries. We discuss the impact of observational strategy and telluric\ncalibration on the spectral reduction process. We infer the impact of existing\nmid-infrared detectors on NOMIC's spectroscopic mode and discuss requirements\nto enable higher resolution 8-13 $\\mu$m spectroscopy on current and future\nfacilities.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"--cDdeXTnTHPhMaUWa9_U0NaW7xa1g3oVqYLHU56vt4","pdfSize":"2873870"}
