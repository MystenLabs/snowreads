However, existing traffic flow prediction models suffer from limitations\nin capturing the complex spatial-temporal dependencies within traffic networks.\nIn order to address this issue, this study proposes a multi-segment fusion\ntensor graph convolutional network (MS-FTGCN) for traffic flow prediction with\nthe following three-fold ideas: a) building a unified spatial-temporal graph\nconvolutional framework based on Tensor M-product, which capture the\nspatial-temporal patterns simultaneously; b) incorporating hourly, daily, and\nweekly components to model multi temporal properties of traffic flows,\nrespectively; c) fusing the outputs of the three components by attention\nmechanism to obtain the final traffic flow prediction results. The results of\nexperiments conducted on two traffic flow datasets demonstrate that the\nproposed MS-FTGCN outperforms the state-of-the-art models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
