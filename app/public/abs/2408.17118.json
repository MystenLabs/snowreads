It extends principal\ncomponent analysis (PCA) and can extract important and complicated components\nwith small variances. One of the major problems of ICA is that the uniqueness\nof the solution is not guaranteed, unlike PCA. That is because there are many\nlocal optima in optimizing the objective function of ICA. It has been shown\npreviously that the unique global optimum of ICA can be estimated from many\nrandom initializations by handcrafted thread computation. In this paper, the\nunique estimation of ICA is highly accelerated by reformulating the algorithm\nin matrix representation and reducing redundant calculations. Experimental\nresults on artificial datasets and EEG data verified the efficiency of the\nproposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EGTPFfzxaP-hgSdBNMRHahT5oNTu9B_ugpeGJg6NpA8","pdfSize":"784327"}
