Here we introduce a series of dynamic\ncircuit benchmarking routines based on interleaving dynamic circuit operation\nblocks $F$ in one-qubit randomized benchmarking sequences of data qubits. $F$\nspans between the set of data qubits and a measurement qubit and may include\nfeedforward operations based on the measurement. We identify six candidate\noperation blocks, such as preparing the measured qubit in $|0\\rangle$ and\nperforming a $Z$-Pauli on the data qubit conditioned on a measurement of `1'.\nImportantly, these blocks provide a methodology to accumulate readout\nassignment errors in a long circuit sequence. We also show the importance of\ndynamic-decoupling in reducing ZZ crosstalk and measurement-induced phase\nerrors during dynamic circuit blocks. When measured on an IBM Eagle device with\nappropriate dynamical decoupling, the results are consistent with measurement\nassignment error and the decoherence of the data qubit as the leading error\nsources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uZnGgUULJEMXfPqxCYmf380mMAFKs4AFqI4x3V4fq0E","pdfSize":"3897325"}
