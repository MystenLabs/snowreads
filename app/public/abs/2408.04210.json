Due\nto the limitation of fixed kernel functions, however, from the view point of\nfiltering they fail to automatically adjust the response according to the\nchange of signal to adapt to different signal characteristics. In this letter,\nwe integrate Wiener filter principle and the time-frequency filtering mechanism\nof CCTFD to design the least-squares adaptive filter method in the Wigner-Ville\ndistribution (WVD) domain, giving birth to the least-squares adaptive\nfilter-based CCTFD whose kernel function can be adjusted with the input signal\nautomatically to achieve the minimum mean-square error denoising in the WVD\ndomain. Some examples are also carried out to demonstrate that the proposed\nadaptive CCTFD outperforms some state-of-the-arts in noise suppression.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
