Here the focus is on dimension reduction to the principal\nsubspace, characterized by its projection matrix. The classical principal\nsubspace can be strongly affected by the presence of outliers. Traditional\nrobust approaches consider casewise outliers, that is, cases generated by an\nunspecified outlier distribution that differs from that of the clean cases. But\nthere may also be cellwise outliers, which are suspicious entries that can\noccur anywhere in the data matrix. Another common issue is that some cells may\nbe missing. This paper proposes a new robust PCA method, called cellPCA, that\ncan simultaneously deal with casewise outliers, cellwise outliers, and missing\ncells. Its single objective function combines two robust loss functions, that\ntogether mitigate the effect of casewise and cellwise outliers. The objective\nfunction is minimized by an iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS)\nalgorithm. Residual cellmaps and enhanced outlier maps are proposed for outlier\ndetection. The casewise and cellwise influence functions of the principal\nsubspace are derived, and its asymptotic distribution is obtained. Extensive\nsimulations and two real data examples illustrate the performance of cellPCA.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
