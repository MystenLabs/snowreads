Previous VIF methods\nusually employ a color space transformation to keep the hue and saturation from\nthe original visible image. However, for fast VIF methods, this operation\naccounts for the majority of the calculation and is the bottleneck preventing\nfaster processing. In this paper, we propose a fast fusion method, FCDFusion,\nwith little color deviation. It preserves color information without color space\ntransformations, by directly operating in RGB color space. It incorporates\ngamma correction at little extra cost, allowing color and contrast to be\nrapidly improved. We regard the fusion process as a scaling operation on 3D\ncolor vectors, greatly simplifying the calculations. A theoretical analysis and\nexperiments show that our method can achieve satisfactory results in only 7\nFLOPs per pixel. Compared to state-of-the-art fast, color-preserving methods\nusing HSV color space, our method provides higher contrast at only half of the\ncomputational cost. We further propose a new metric, color deviation, to\nmeasure the ability of a VIF method to preserve color. It is specifically\ndesigned for VIF tasks with color visible-light images, and overcomes\ndeficiencies of existing VIF metrics used for this purpose.
