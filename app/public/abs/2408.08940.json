Jaccard Similarity is the\nratio between the 1s (Intersection of two vectors) to 1s (Union of two\nvectors). This paper introduces a quantum algorithm for finding the Jaccard\nSimilarity 1s, in the Intersection and Union of two binary vectors. There are\ntwo sub-algorithms one for each. Measuring the register for respective\nalgorithm gives count of number of 1 s in binary format. Implementation on IBM\ncomposer is also included.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BgdzHw1OGkKoMscRk9mWf85R7W9HHIquW_xgqPqiD_E","pdfSize":"564755"}
