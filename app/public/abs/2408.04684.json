However, their use may also harm public perception of the police if\ndrones are refused. Therefore, police forces should consider the perception of\nbystanders and broader society to maximize drones' potential. This article\nexamines the concerns expressed by members of the public during a field trial\ninvolving 52 test participants. Analysis of the group interviews suggests that\ntheir worries go beyond airspace safety and privacy, broadly discussed in\nexisting literature and regulations. The interpretation of the results\nindicates that the perceived justice of drone use is a significant factor in\nacceptance. Leveraging the concept of organizational justice and data\ncollected, we propose a catalogue of guidelines for just operation of drones to\nsupplement the existing policy. We present the organizational justice\nperspective as a framework to integrate the concerns of the public and\nbystanders into legal work. Finally, we discuss the relevance of justice for\nthe legitimacy of the police's actions and provide implications for research\nand practice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"yHnOzCmxvSeQGU8S5JHM3_-OXL57pYKauUu3M3SWFcM","pdfSize":"4295122"}
