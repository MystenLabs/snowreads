It's hardness-intensity diagram\n(HID) displays a ''q''-like track including all the spectral states, along a\nunique loop in the hard state. The tracks observed in the HID is anticipated in\nthe evolution of the components responsible for Compton and reflection\nemission. This is substantiated by the relationship between the X-ray\nluminosity $L_\\mathrm{X}$ and photon index $\\Gamma$, as well as the\nrelationship between X-ray luminosity $L_\\mathrm{X}$ and the ratio of Compton\nto disk luminosities $L_\\mathrm{C}/L_\\mathrm{D}$. Both of these relationships\nexhibit a pattern reminiscent of HID. During the hard state, the hardness (also\n$\\Gamma$) is determined by either reflection component ($R_{f}>1$ ) or Compton\ncomponent ($R_{f}<1$) depending on the value reflection fraction $R_{f}$. So\nthe distinctive evolution of $R_{f}$ leads to the unique loop in the HID (also\nin the $L_\\mathrm{X}$--$\\Gamma$ plane) of hard state. Additionally, we found a\nnegative correlation between frequency of the type-C quasi-periodic oscillation\n(QPO) ($\\nu_{\\mathrm{C,QPO}}$) and the optical depth of the Compton emission\n($\\tau$), and a positive correlation between $\\nu_{\\mathrm{C,QPO}}$ and\n$\\Gamma$. These correlations strongly suggest a coupling between the QPO\nproperties and the underlying process responsible for Comptonization.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0vTyxu6Hs0LQeV6zpqRUvUft0aZZd9tiNzvm_LptHDA","pdfSize":"1396016"}
