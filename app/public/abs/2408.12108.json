We consider a single fermion whose dynamics is\ngoverned by the Dirac equation confined to move on a quantum torus surface. The\neffects of the geometry are take into account by using the tetrad formalism and\nthe spin connection. The Dirac equation gives rise to two coupled first-order\ndifferential equations for each spinor component. The eigenvalues and\neigenfunctions for each spinor component are computed numerically and the\nnon-hermitian phase transitions are investigated in terms of the geometric\nfeatures of the torus and the magnitude of the imaginary component of the mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4_jdohjdPrnOWtnpmEdUw2rgbVfWfKrtB-8nzEVUSbU","pdfSize":"20801476"}
