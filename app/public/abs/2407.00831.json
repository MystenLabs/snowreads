In this paper, we describe a full solution to this\nproblem for arbitrary generalized K\\\"ahler manifolds, which involves the new\nconcept of a holomorphic symplectic Morita 2-equivalence between double\nsymplectic groupoids, equipped with a Lagrangian bisection of its real\nsymplectic core. Essentially, any generalized K\\\"ahler manifold has an\nassociated holomorphic symplectic manifold of quadruple dimension and equipped\nwith an anti-holomorphic involution; the metric is determined by a Lagrangian\nsubmanifold of its fixed point locus. This finally resolves affirmatively a\nlong-standing conjecture by physicists concerning the existence of a\ngeneralized K\\\"ahler potential.\n  We demonstrate the theory by constructing explicitly the above Morita\n2-equivalence and Lagrangian bisection for the well-known generalized K\\\"ahler\nstructures on compact even-dimensional semisimple Lie groups, which have until\nnow escaped such analysis. We construct the required holomorphic symplectic\nmanifolds by expressing them as moduli spaces of flat connections on surfaces\nwith decorated boundary, through a quasi-Hamiltonian reduction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
