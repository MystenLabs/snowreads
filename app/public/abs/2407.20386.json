We consider the\nfavorable situation in which a researcher has two possible estimators to\nconstruct the confidence interval proposed in Imbens and Manski (2004) and\nStoye (2009), and one is more efficient than the other. While the literature\nshows that both estimators deliver asymptotically exact confidence intervals\nfor the parameter of interest, their inference in terms of statistical power is\nnot compared. One would expect that using the more efficient estimator would\nresult in more powerful inference. We formally prove this result.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
