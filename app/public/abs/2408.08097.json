Defined as the set of all points where the function's gradients are\nlinearly dependent, Jacobi sets extend the notion of critical point to\nmultifields. In practice, Jacobi sets for piecewise-linear approximations of\nsmooth functions can become very complex and large due to noise and numerical\nerrors. Existing methods that simplify Jacobi sets exist, but either do not\naddress how the functions' values have to change in order to have simpler\nJacobi sets or remain purely theoretical. In this paper, we present a method\nthat modifies 2D bivariate scalar fields such that Jacobi set components that\nare due to noise are removed, while preserving the essential structures of the\nfields. The method uses the Jacobi set to decompose the domain, stores the and\nweighs the resulting regions in a neighborhood graph, which is then used to\ndetermine which regions to join by collapsing the image of the region's cells.\nWe investigate the influence of different tie-breaks when building the\nneighborhood graphs and the treatment of collapsed cells. We apply our\nalgorithm to a range of datasets, both analytical and real-world and compare\nits performance to simple data smoothing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
