We introduce PsychoLex, a suite of resources designed\nto enhance LLMs' proficiency in psychological tasks in both Persian and\nEnglish. Key contributions include the PsychoLexQA dataset for instructional\ncontent and the PsychoLexEval dataset for rigorous evaluation of LLMs in\ncomplex psychological scenarios. Additionally, we present the PsychoLexLLaMA\nmodel, optimized specifically for psychological applications, demonstrating\nsuperior performance compared to general-purpose models. The findings\nunderscore the potential of tailored LLMs for advancing psychological research\nand applications, while also highlighting areas for further refinement. This\nresearch offers a foundational step towards integrating LLMs into specialized\npsychological domains, with implications for future advancements in AI-driven\npsychological practice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
