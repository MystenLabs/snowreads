The resulting images frequently exhibit issues\nsuch as incorrect numbers of fingers, unnatural twisting or interlacing of\nfingers, or blurred and indistinct hands. These issues stem from the inherent\ncomplexity of hand structures and the difficulty in aligning textual\ndescriptions with precise visual depictions of hands. To address these\nchallenges, we propose a novel approach named Hand1000 that enables the\ngeneration of realistic hand images with target gesture using only 1,000\ntraining samples. The training of Hand1000 is divided into three stages with\nthe first stage aiming to enhance the model's understanding of hand anatomy by\nusing a pre-trained hand gesture recognition model to extract gesture\nrepresentation. The second stage further optimizes text embedding by\nincorporating the extracted hand gesture representation, to improve alignment\nbetween the textual descriptions and the generated hand images. The third stage\nutilizes the optimized embedding to fine-tune the Stable Diffusion model to\ngenerate realistic hand images. In addition, we construct the first publicly\navailable dataset specifically designed for text-to-hand image generation.\nBased on the existing hand gesture recognition dataset, we adopt advanced image\ncaptioning models and LLaMA3 to generate high-quality textual descriptions\nenriched with detailed gesture information. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthat Hand1000 significantly outperforms existing models in producing\nanatomically correct hand images while faithfully representing other details in\nthe text, such as faces, clothing, and colors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
