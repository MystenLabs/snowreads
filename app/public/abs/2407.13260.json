However, a mechanistic understanding of\nthe sequence-dependence of the local unzipping of double-stranded DNA, the\nfirst step towards replication initiation, is lacking. Here, utilizing a Markov\nchain model that was created to address the directional nature of DNA unzipping\nand replication, we model the sequence dependence of local melting of\ndouble-stranded linear DNA segments. We show that generalized palindromic\nsequences with high nucleotide skews have a low kinetic barrier for local\nmelting near melting temperatures. This allows for such sequences to function\nas replication origins. We support our claim with evidence for high-skew\npalindromic sequences within the replication origins of mitochondrial DNA,\nbacteria, archaea and plasmids.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"P0qkfFxCR4RcjMVjuudbTwcT6x_7aTQtfBElVc2fbi8","pdfSize":"2625985","objectId":"0xb04df38f9029b00e6a2004721b5bb70c77ac6ee3c200e83e2bc3bd4872ac1f12","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
