A compressor performance test rig was designed\nto conduct the performance tests, with fast-response pressure sensors and\ndisplacement sensors capturing the P-V diagram and dynamic motion of the moving\ncomponents. Results show that the compressor efficiency degrades at high speeds\ndue to the dominant loss factors of leakage and discharge power loss.\nSupercharging effects become significant at speeds above 160Hz, and its net\neffects reduce the compressor efficiency, especially at high speeds. This study\nidentifies and analyzes the loss factors on the mass flow rate and power\nconsumption based on experimental data, and hypothesizes possible mechanisms\nfor each loss factor, which can aid in the design of a high-speed rotary\ncompressor with higher efficiency.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
