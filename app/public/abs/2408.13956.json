In this\nwork, we consider the two-dimensional Euler equations with a modulus of\ncontinuity for vorticity rougher than Dini continuous. We first show that the\ntwo-dimensional Euler equations propagate an explicit family of moduli of\ncontinuity for the vorticity that are rougher than Dini continuity. The main\ngoal of this work is to address the following question: Given a modulus of\ncontinuity for the 2D Euler equations, can we always propagate it? The answer\nto this question is \\textit{No}. We construct a family of moduli of continuity\nfor the 2D Euler equations that are \\textit{not} propagated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
