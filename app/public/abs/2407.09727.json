We address optimal water addition and bathtub design.\nFirst, we establish a water surface cooling model using Newton's law of cooling\nto simulate heat exchange between air and water. Without new heat sources, the\nwater temperature reaches a minimum in 40 minutes. We then simulate adding hot\nwater with a one-dimensional heat conduction model, including air cooling\neffects. We determine that the optimal heat input is 80 Joules and the optimal\nwater velocity is 0.042 m/s to maintain temperature and save water. The ideal\nbathtub dimensions are 1.5m length, 0.6m width, 0.42m depth, with rounded\ncorners. Using finite difference methods and MATLAB's Pdetool, we solve the\nheat conduction equation and verify numerical stability, discussing the model's\npros and cons and suggesting improvements.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
