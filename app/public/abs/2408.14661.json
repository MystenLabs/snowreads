They are a\nnatural choice when the data are lists recording individuals' positions in\nqueues in which queue order is constrained by a social hierarchy, as it may be\nappropriate to model the social hierarchy as a partial order and the lists as\nrandom linear extensions respecting the partial order. In this paper, we set up\na new prior model for partial orders incorporating ties by clustering tied\nactors using a Poisson Dirichlet process. The family of models is projective.\nWe perform Bayesian inference with different choices of noisy observation\nmodel. In particular, we propose a Mallow's observation model for our partial\norders and give a recursive likelihood evaluation algorithm. We demonstrate our\nmodel on the 'Royal Acta' (Bishop) list data where we find the model is favored\nover well-known alternatives which fit only total orders.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
