By virtue of variational methods, we establish the existence and\nnonexistence of least energy solutions for the purely cooperative case\n($\\beta_{ij}> 0$ for any $i\\neq j$) and the simultaneous cooperation and\ncompetition case ($\\beta_{i_{1}j_{1}}>0$ and $\\beta_{i_{2}j_{2}}<0$ for some\n$(i_{1}, j_{1})$ and $(i_{2}, j_{2})$). Moreover, it is shown that fully\nnontrivial ground state solutions exist when $\\beta_{ij}\\ge0$ and $N\\ge5$, but\n{\\bf NOT} in the weakly pure cooperative case ($\\beta_{ij}>0$ and small, $i\\neq\nj$) when $N=3,4$. We emphasize that this reveals that the existence of ground\nstate solutions differs dramatically between $N=3, 4$ and higher dimensions\n$N\\geq 5$. In particular, the cases of $N=3$ and $N\\geq 5$ are more complicated\nthan the case of $N=4$ and the proofs heavily depend on the dimension. Some\nnovel tricks are introduced for $N=3$ and $N\\ge5$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
