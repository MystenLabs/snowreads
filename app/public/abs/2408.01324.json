This author and Hartman\nshowed that this subgroup is either trivial or has order 2 and explicitly\nidentified a diffeomorphism that would represent the nontrivial element if this\nsubgroup is nontrivial. Here we show that the theta graph diffeomorphism is\nisotopic to this one possibly nontrivial element of the (1,2)-subgroup. To\nprove this relation we develop a diagrammatic calculus for working in the\nsmooth mapping class group of $S^4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"T6gknXiDoIJ1ScWzEwQUbmkVT8cNZPByZzdDaXy6EJk","pdfSize":"279826","txDigest":"9sL623nMK3rw7fRzfw1ti2BRT7HHfaM4wXzV3P2VUXBa","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
