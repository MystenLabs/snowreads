However, analyses of the horizontal\nmotions of nearly 1 million photospheric magnetic elements spanning the\nentirety of solar cycle 24 have revealed an unexpected dominant frequency,\n$\\approx$5 mHz, a frequency typically synonymous with the chromosphere. Given\nthe distinctly different physical properties of the magnetic elements examined\nin our statistical sample, when compared to largely quiescent solar plasma\nwhere $\\approx$3 mHz frequencies are omnipresent, we argue that the dominant\n$\\approx$5 mHz frequency is not caused by the buffeting of magnetic elements,\nbut instead is due to the nature of the underlying oscillatory driver itself.\nThis novel result was obtained by exploiting the unmatched spatial and temporal\ncoverage of magnetograms acquired by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI)\non board NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our findings provide a timely\navenue for future exploration of the magnetic connectivity between\nsub-photospheric, photospheric, and chromospheric layers of the Sun's dynamic\natmosphere.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
