It is a\nfundamental building block for implementing fault-tolerant services using\neither active (aka state-machine) or passive (aka primary-backup) replication.\nWe consider the problem of implementing reconfigurable atomic broadcast, which\nfurther allows users to dynamically alter the set of participating processes,\ne.g., in response to failures or changes in the load. We give a complete safety\nand liveness specification of this communication abstraction and propose a new\nprotocol implementing it, called Vertical Atomic Broadcast, which uses an\nauxiliary service to facilitate reconfiguration. In contrast to prior\nproposals, our protocol significantly reduces system downtime when\nreconfiguring from a functional configuration by allowing it to continue\nprocessing messages while agreement on the next configuration is in progress.\nFurthermore, we show that this advantage can be maintained even when our\nprotocol is modified to support a stronger variant of atomic broadcast required\nfor passive replication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"retHXf3ODcFdGKQ3Bg5jrJbnUqsrimtF9JABd5z9510","pdfSize":"1130617"}
