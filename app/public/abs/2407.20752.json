In this work, we theoretically predict an\nintrinsic second order spin current induced by spin-dependent Berry curvature\npolarizability based on time-independent perturbation theory. And we show other\ntwo second order spin conductivities contributed by the group velocity and\nspin-dependent Berry curvature dipole. A two-dimensional Rashba-Dresselhaus\nspin-orbit coupled system is studied as an example, and the value of intrinsic\nspin conductivity exhibits a maximum at zero chemical potential $\\mu$ and\ndecreases rapidly with increasing $\\mu$; while the extrinsic contribution\nremains unchanged in the region of $\\mu \\geqslant 0$. Thus, the dependence of\nspin conductivity on chemical potential is expected to distinguish the\nextrinsic and intrinsic contributions experimentally. Our calculation provides\na theoretical basis for understanding the nonlinear spin transport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
