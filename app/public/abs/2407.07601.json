Cantilever-like problems, where one end is\nsubjected to a fixed value and the other end is free, have been less studied in\nterms of their stability despite their abundance. In this article, we develop\nthe stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation\nof the energy functional using the generalized Jacobi condition. This involves\ncomputing conjugate points that are determined by solving a set of initial\nvalue problems from the linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these\nconditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved\nelastic cantilevers subject to a tip load. Kirchhoff rod theory is employed to\nmodel the elastic rod deformations. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing\ncomplex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly\nemphasized. This snap-back instability is demonstrated using various examples,\nhighlighting its dependence on various system parameters. The presented\nexamples illustrate the potential applications in the design of flexible soft\nrobot arms and innovative mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
