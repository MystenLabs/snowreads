We first give the Knuth-Netto formula\nand generating function for the subdiagonals on or below the main diagonal of\nthe Mahonian numbers of type $B$, then its combinatorial interpretations by\nlattice path/partition and tiling. Next, we propose a $q$-analogue of Mahonian\nnumbers of type $B$ by using a new statistics on the permutations of the\nhyperoctahedral group $B_n$ that we introduced, then we study their basic\nproperties and their combinatorial interpretations by lattice path/partition\nand tiling. Finally, we prove combinatorially that the $q$-analogue of Mahonian\nnumbers of type $B$ form a strongly $q$-log-concave sequence of polynomials in\n$k$, which implies that the Mahonian numbers of type $B$ form a log-concave\nsequence in $k$ and therefore unimodal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"woRCXEuz5ut286Vd_dtmFf3XgiLDUw-dhytXi26cAEY","pdfSize":"499285"}
