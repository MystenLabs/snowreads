We furthermore present a\none-shot diabatic Wannierisation procedure that aligns the phases of the Bloch\nfunctions, providing immediate Wannier localisation, which serves as an\nexcellent initial guess for optimisation. We test our Wannier localisation\nimplementation on a number of solid state systems, highlighting the\neffectiveness of the diabatic preparation, especially for localising core\nbands. Partial charges of Wannier functions generated using Bloch IAOs align\nwell with chemical intuition, which we demonstrate through the example of\nadsorption of CO on a MgO surface.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mfgPyHAGDs00a1c-Dv5hIka15iA8OwQOmCyZisVQRSM","pdfSize":"2977741"}
