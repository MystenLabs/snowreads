Here, we investigate the dynamics of the\nLipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, composed of $N$ all-to-all interacting spins $1/2$,\nunder a weak external monitoring. We derive a set of semiclassical stochastic\nequations describing the evolution of the expectation values of global spin\nobservables, which become exact in the thermodynamic limit. Our results shows\nthat the limit $N\\to\\infty$ does not commute with the long-time limit: while\nfor any finite $N$ the esamble average over the noise is expected to converge\ntowards a trivial steady state, in the thermodynamic limit a MIPT appears. The\ntransition is not affected by post-selection issues, as it is already visible\nat the level of ensemble averages, thus paving the way for experimental\nobservations. We derive a quantitative theoretical picture explaining the\nnature of the transition within our semiclassical picture, finding an excellent\nagreement with the numerics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
