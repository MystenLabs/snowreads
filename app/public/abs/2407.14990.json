As a consequence, we give results about the\ncompactness of the localization operator in $\\mathcal{S}_\\omega$, in relation\nwith the spaces of $\\omega$-multipliers and $\\omega$-convolutors of\n$\\mathcal{S}_\\omega$. Moreover, we provide several examples that complement our\ninvestigation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JXHJgKJDnTmNCdGjjbDnevzPbNEyDb5fkb8PEkdaypM","pdfSize":"338080"}
