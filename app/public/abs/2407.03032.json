However, Arabic readability\nassessment is a challenging task due to Arabic's morphological richness and\nlimited readability resources. In this paper, we present a set of experimental\nresults on Arabic readability assessment using a diverse range of approaches,\nfrom rule-based methods to Arabic pretrained language models. We report our\nresults on a newly created corpus at different textual granularity levels\n(words and sentence fragments). Our results show that combining different\ntechniques yields the best results, achieving an overall macro F1 score of 86.7\nat the word level and 87.9 at the fragment level on a blind test set. We make\nour code, data, and pretrained models publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
