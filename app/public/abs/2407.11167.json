The\nmain results are as follows: (i) The temperature-dependent susceptibility shows\na negligible in-plane response and the isothermal magnetization curves confirm\nthe easy axis along the $c$ axis. (ii) The specific heat measurements reveal\nthe absence of long-range magnetic order down to 60 mK, and the power-law\ntemperature dependence indicates the existence of the gapless magnetic\nexcitations in system. (iii) The ultralow-temperature thermal conductivity\nexhibits negligibly small residual term ($\\kappa_0/T$) and strong spin-phonon\nscattering effect, suggesting that the spin excitations are also involved. Our\nresults further demonstrate that PrMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ is a rare quantum spin\nliquid candidate with Ising-like anisotropy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
