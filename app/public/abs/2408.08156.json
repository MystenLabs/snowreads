We\nfocus on the properties of the individual polarization maps that comprise the\npatchwork and discuss the associated calibration residuals that are coherent on\nthose subpatches. We numerically simulate the polarization field modulated as a\nwhole patchwork and apply a suite of lensing analyses to reveal the response of\nthe reconstructed gravitational lensing potential and delensing efficiency. At\nsystematic error levels expected in the near future, we find that it is\npossible to accurately reconstruct the lensing potential on scales larger than\nthe subpatch size and that there is no severe degradation of the lensing\n$B$-mode removal efficiency in the subsequent delensing analysis.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
