Several explicit\nversions are derived here, depending on various modification functions. These\nmodels do not have instabilities from higher time derivatives, and a large\nsubset is compatible with gravitational waves and minimally coupled massless\nmatter fields travelling at the same speed. Interpreted as models of loop\nquantum gravity, covariant Hamiltonian constraints derived from the covariance\nconditions found in polarized Gowdy systems are more restricted than those in\nspherical symmetry, requiring new forms of holonomy modifications with an\nanisotropy dependence that has not been considered before. Assuming homogeneous\nspace, the models provide access to the full anisotropy parameters of modified\nBianchi I dynamics, in which case different fates of the classical singularity\nare realized depending on the specific class of modifications.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
