Here we show that colloidal systems of Quincke rollers which are\ndriven periodically can condense into active liquids and active crystals, in\nwhich waves can be excited. In active liquids, the waves propagate antiparallel\nto local density gradients via the splitting of dense bands, and cross over\neach other in collision as sound waves do. The waves in active crystals have a\nsharp front like that of shock waves, and propagate parallel to local density\ngradients. The shock waves annihilate or converge as they collide. Detailed\ninvestigations on microscopic dynamics reveal that in sound waves, the dynamics\nof rollers is dominated by electrostatic repulsions; in shock waves, the\ndynamics is encoded with a density-dependent collective memory. These findings\ndemonstrate a realization of excitable colloidal systems with tunable dynamics.\nThis is of great interests in exploring the principles of self-organization and\nthe fabrication of active functional materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
