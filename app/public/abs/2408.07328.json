The main results are on the structure of their\nmotives, and on comparison isomorphisms between their cohomological\nrealizations. In the center of these comparison isomorphisms, there is the\nspace of special functions $\\mathfrak{sf}(E)$ as defined by Gazda and the\nauthor in arXiv:1903.07302. We also provide a generalization of Anderson's\nresult on the equivalence of uniformizability of the Anderson module and rigid\nanalytic triviality of its associated motive.\n  We contribute results that are new even in the case of abelian Anderson\nmodules. For every non-zero prime ideal $\\mathfrak{p}$ of $A$, the relation of\nthe space of special functions to the $\\mathfrak{p}$-adic Tate module provides\na way to obtain $\\mathfrak{p}^{n+1}$-torsion as special values of\nhyperderivatives of these special functions. Using this result for\nuniformizable Anderson modules, we are able to describe the $\\mathfrak{p}$-adic\nGalois representation via a rigid analytic trivialization, and hence give a\ndirect link between the image of the $\\mathfrak{p}$-adic Galois representation\nand the motivic Galois group. This generalizes results of various authors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
