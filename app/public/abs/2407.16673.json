The objective of most learning techniques is to reconstruct\nthis dynamic transition law. This is a major shortcoming, as most dynamic\nproperties of interest are asymptotic properties such as an attractor or\ninvariant measure. Thus approximating the dynamical law may not be sufficient\nto approximate these asymptotic properties. This article presents a method of\nrepresenting a discrete-time deterministic dynamical system as the zero-noise\nlimit of a Markov process. The Markov process approximation is completely\ndata-driven. Besides proving a low-noise approximation of the dynamics the\nprocess also approximates the invariant set, via the support of its stationary\nmeasures. Thus invariant sets of arbitrary dynamical systems, even with\ncomplicated non-smooth topology, can be approximated by this technique. Under\nfurther assumptions, we show that the technique performs a convergent\nstatistical approximation as well as approximations of true orbits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
