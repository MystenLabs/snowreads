This study evaluates the current integration of VR\nin construction education and practice. Employing the Preferred Reporting Items\nfor Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, this review analyzed 36\npeer-reviewed journal articles from databases such as the Web of Science, ERIC,\nand Scopus. The methodology focused on identifying, appraising, and\nsynthesizing all relevant studies to assess the effectiveness of VR\napplications in construction-related fields. This review highlights that VR\nsignificantly enhances learning by providing immersive interactive simulations\nthat improve the understanding of every complex construction process, such as\nstructural elements or tunnel-boring machine operations. This review\ncontributes by systematically compiling and evaluating evidence on using VR in\nconstruction, which has seen a limited comprehensive analysis. It provides\npractical examples of how VR can revolutionize education and work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
