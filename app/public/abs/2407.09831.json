This paper tries to solve the problem from a fresh standpoint by aiming\nto predict the weekly movements, and introducing a novel benchmark of random\ntraders. This benchmark is independent of any ML model, thus making it more\nobjective and potentially serving as a commonly recognized standard. During\ntraining process, apart from the basic features such as technical indicators,\nscaling laws and directional changes are introduced as additional features,\nfurthermore, the training datasets are also adjusted by assigning varying\nweights to different samples, the weighting approach allows the models to\nemphasize specific samples. On back-testing, several trained models show good\nperformance, with the multi-layer perception (MLP) demonstrating stability and\nrobustness across extensive and comprehensive data that include upward,\ndownward and cyclic trends. The unique perspective of this work that focuses on\nweekly movements, incorporates new features and creates an objective benchmark,\ncontributes to the existing literature on stock market prediction.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
