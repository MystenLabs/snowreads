In this work, we first present a\ncomprehensive benchmarking of the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) across 11\nmedical image modalities and videos and point out its strengths and weaknesses\nby comparing it to SAM1 and MedSAM. Then, we develop a transfer learning\npipeline and demonstrate SAM2 can be quickly adapted to medical domain by\nfine-tuning. Furthermore, we implement SAM2 as a 3D slicer plugin and Gradio\nAPI for efficient 3D image and video segmentation.
