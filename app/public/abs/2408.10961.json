Due to their important applications in\nDNA storage and computational biology, insdel codes have recently become a\nfocal point of research in coding theory.\n  In this paper, we present several new combinatorial upper and lower bounds on\nthe maximum size of $q$-ary insdel codes. Our main upper bound is a\nsphere-packing bound obtained by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. It\nimproves upon previous results for cases when the distance $d$ or the alphabet\nsize $q$ is large. Our first lower bound is derived from a connection between\ninsdel codes and matchings in special hypergraphs. This lower bound, together\nwith our upper bound, shows that for fixed block length $n$ and edit distance\n$d$, when $q$ is sufficiently large, the maximum size of insdel codes is $\n\\frac{q^{n-\\frac{d}{2}+1}}{{n\\choose \\frac{d}{2}-1}}(1 \\pm o(1))$. The second\nlower bound refines Alon et al.'s recent logarithmic improvement on\nLevenshtein's GV-type bound and extends its applicability to large $q$ and $d$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
