In this\nwork, we present JungleGPT, the first compound AI system tailored for\nreal-world e-commerce applications. We outline the system's design and the\ntechniques used to optimize its performance for practical use cases, which have\nproven to reduce inference costs to less than 1% of what they would be with a\npowerful, monolithic LLM.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
