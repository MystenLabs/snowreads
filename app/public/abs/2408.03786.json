The present work investigates the TE behaviour of PbSe in the\ntemperature range 300-500 K. The transport properties of the sample have been\nstudied using the Abinit and BoltzTrap code. The experimentally observed value\nof \\textit{S} at 300 and 500 K is found to be $\\sim$ 198 and 266 $\\mu$V\nK$^{-1}$, respectively. The rate of increase in \\emph{S} from 300 to 460 (460\nto 500) K is found to be $\\sim$ 0.4 (0.09). The temperature dependent\nelectrical conductivity \\textit{($\\sigma$)} shows the increasing trend, with\nvalues of $\\sim $ 0.35 $\\times $ 10$^{3}$ and $\\sim$ 0.58 $\\times$ 10$^{3}$\n$\\Omega$$^{-1}$ m$^{-1}$ at 300 and 500 K, respectively. Further, the value of\nthermal conductivity \\textit{($\\kappa$)} at 300 (500) K is found to be 0.74\n(1.07) W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$. The value of \\textit{$\\kappa$} is found to be\nincreasing upto 460 K and then starts decreasing. The dispersion plot indicates\nthat PbSe is a direct band gap semiconductor with band gap value of 0.16 (0.27)\neV considering spin-orbit coupling (without SOC). The partial density of states\n(PDOS) plot shows that Pb 6p and Se 4p states have a major contribution in the\ntransport properties. The observed and calculated values of \\textit{S} gives a\ngood match for SOC case. The calculated \\textit{$\\sigma$} and electronic part\nof thermal conductivity (\\textit{$\\kappa{_e}$}) gives good match with the\nexperimental data. The maximum power factor (PF) value of $\\sim$ 4.3 $\\times$\n10$^{-5}$ W/mK$^{2}$ is observed at 500 K. This work helps in understanding the\nTE behaviour of PbSe through a novel and insightful alliance of experimental\nmeasurements and DFT approach.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
