This study examines the gut microbiome of\nhorses, donkeys, and their hybrids, mules and hinnies, to explore the role of\nmicrobiomes in hybrid vigor. We performed whole-genome sequencing on rectal\nmicrobiota from 18 equids, generating detailed microbiome assemblies. Our\nanalysis revealed significant differences between horse and donkey microbiomes,\nwith hybrids showing a pronounced maternal resemblance. Notably, Firmicutes\nwere more abundant in the horse-maternal group, while Fibrobacteres were richer\nin the donkey-maternal group, indicating distinct digestive processes.\nFunctional annotations indicated metabolic differences, such as protein\nsynthesis in horses and energy metabolism in donkeys. Machine learning\npredictions of probiotic species highlighted potential health benefits for each\nmaternal group. This study provides a high-resolution view of the equid gut\nmicrobiome, revealing significant taxonomic and metabolic differences\ninfluenced by maternal lineage, and offers insights into microbial\ncontributions to hybrid vigor.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
