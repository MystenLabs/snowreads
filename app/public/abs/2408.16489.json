We consider the case when Galilean invariance is\nbroken explicitly (by an external periodic potential) or spontaneously, as it\nhappens in a supersolid. In the first case, the presence of a stationary\ncurrent affects the propagation of sound (fourth sound) via an anomalous\nDoppler term proportional to the density derivative of the superfluid fraction.\nIn supersolids, where, according to Goldstone theorem, distinct sounds of\nhybrid superfluid and crystal nature can propagate, the Doppler effect can be\nvery different for each sound, including the possibility of being negative for\nthe lower phonon branch. We obtain analytical predictions within the\nhydrodynamic theories for superfluids and supersolids, which are compared with\nthe numerical results of time-dependent simulations for weakly interacting\natomic Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
