Given an edge-weighted undirected graph and a subset of the vertices,\ncalled terminals, the task is to compute a minimum-weight tree containing all\nterminals (and possibly further vertices). The best-known approximation\nalgorithms for Steiner tree involve enumeration of a (polynomial but) very\nlarge number of candidate components and are therefore slow in practice.\n  A promising ingredient for the design of fast and accurate approximation\nalgorithms for Steiner tree is the bidirected cut relaxation (BCR): bidirect\nall edges, choose an arbitrary terminal as a root, and enforce that each cut\ncontaining some terminal but not the root has one unit of fractional edges\nleaving it. BCR is known to be integral in the spanning tree case [Edmonds'67],\ni.e., when all the vertices are terminals. For general instances, however, it\nwas not even known whether the integrality gap of BCR is better than the\nintegrality gap of the natural undirected relaxation, which is exactly 2. We\nresolve this question by proving an upper bound of 1.9988 on the integrality\ngap of BCR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
