In this work we\ninvestigate the Higgs decay into such a light scalar plus a $Z$-boson and take\nthe aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM) as an example. This light long-lived\nscalar, with the dominant decay to tau leptons, will fly over a distance from\nthe production point and present a displaced vertex in an Inner Detector of a\ngenerally purposed experiment like ATLAS or CMS. In our study we focus on the\nLHC experiment and perform Monte Carlo simulations for the signal and\nbackgrounds. We demonstrate some benchmark points for the aligned 2HDM and find\nthe signal to be detectable when the luminosity is accumulated to 300\nfb$^{-1}$. So our study suggests an experimental search for this process in the\nongoing LHC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
