The theories considered are Fermi-Dirac\ntheory, thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory, two modifications of the thermal\nsingle-determinant approximation of Kaplan and Argyres, and first-order\nfinite-temperature many-body perturbation theory based on zero-temperature or\nthermal HF reference. The thermal full-configuration-interaction theory is used\nas the benchmark.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
