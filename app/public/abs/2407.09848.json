We formulate a variant of a minimax problem already proposed in [J.\nLottes, Optimal polynomial smoothers for multigrid V-cycles, Numer. Lin. Alg.\nwith Appl., 30 (2023), p. e2518, https://doi.org/10.1002/nla.2518] and define\nChebyshev polynomial of the 1st-kind as acceleration for a weighted-Jacobi\nsmoother; we also describe efficient GPU kernels for the application of the\npolynomial smoother and compare results with accelerators defined in [J.\nLottes, Optimal polynomial smoothers for multigrid V-cycles, Numer.
