We numerically demonstrate that\nguiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the\npopulation control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to\na hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin\noverlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate\nthe critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well\nas the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass\nsusceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent\nestimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address\nthe spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for\nthe workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with\nlarge weight at zero overlap.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
