For electric polarizability, the results are largely\nconsistent with those from the background field method and ChPT. In contrast,\nthere are significant differences for magnetic polarizability among the\nfour-point function method, the background field method, and ChPT. The\nsituation points to the potentially important role of disconnected diagrams for\na neutral pion. We elucidate a transparent quark decomposition in the\nfour-point function method that can be used to shed light on the issue.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
