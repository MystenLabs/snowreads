We\nprove a one-to-one correspondence between supports of measures from this family\nand zero sets of exponential polynomials with imaginary frequencies. This\nresult is the special case of a general result on measures whose supports\ncorrespond to zero sets of absolutely convergent Dirichlet series with bounded\nspectrum.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"_K8nIbYsYS7WtistNc59S8SZqGVVuWmPf_LAeWFnbAQ","pdfSize":"166817"}
