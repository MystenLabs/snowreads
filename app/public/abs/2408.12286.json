Surprisingly, the same cannot be\nsaid for Inflation-at-Risk where both tails, deflation and high inflation, are\nof key concern to policymakers, which has seen comparatively much less\nresearch. This paper will tackle this gap and provide estimates for\nInflation-at-Risk. The key insight of the paper is that inflation is best\ncharacterised by a combination of two types of nonlinearities: quantile\nvariation, and conditioning on the momentum of inflation.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
