An important\nproblem in coalition formation is coalition structure generation: partitioning\nagents into coalitions to optimize the social welfare. This is a challenging\nproblem that has been the subject of active research for the past three\ndecades. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm, SMART, for the problem\nbased on a hybridization of three innovative techniques. Two of these\ntechniques are based on dynamic programming, where we show a powerful\nconnection between the coalitions selected for evaluation and the performance\nof the algorithms. These algorithms use offline phases to optimize the choice\nof coalitions to evaluate. The third one uses branch-and-bound and integer\npartition graph search to explore the solution space. Our techniques bring a\nnew way of approaching the problem and a new level of precision to the field.\nIn experiments over several common value distributions, we show that the\nhybridization of these techniques in SMART is faster than the fastest prior\nalgorithms (ODP-IP, BOSS) in generating optimal solutions across all the value\ndistributions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
