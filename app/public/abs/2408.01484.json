We take into account several important\nphysical effects, such as gravitational clustering, coherent enhancement,\nneutron degeneracy and Pauli blocking. We find that the anomalous cooling of\nnearby neutron stars due to relic neutrino scattering might actually be\nobservable by current and future telescopes operating in the optical to\nnear-infrared frequency band, such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST),\nprovided there is a large local relic overdensity that is still allowed.\nSimilarly, the anomalous heating of neutron stars due to coherent scattering\nwith keV-scale sterile neutrino dark matter, could also be observed by JWST or\nfuture telescopes, which would probe hitherto unexplored parameter space in the\nsterile neutrino mass-mixing plane.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z64cuo8qEUeWr2dwenUPC8jZFrcYG3gqeN2N_LkeS48","pdfSize":"1010229"}
