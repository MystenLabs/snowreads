In this work we analyze their properties\nas measures on the spaces of quantum states and argue that their excess\nprovides useful characterization of a difference between two (i.e. pre-selected\nand post-selected) states, which shares certain features and in certain cases\ncan be identified as a metric. In particular, when applied to link complement\nstates that are associated to topological links via Chern-Simons theory, these\ngeneralized entropies and their excess provide a novel quantification of a\ndifference between corresponding links. We discuss the dependence of such\nentropy measures on the level of Chern-Simons theory and determine their\nasymptotic values for certain link states. We find that imaginary part of the\npseudo-entropy is sensitive to, and can diagnose chirality of knots. We also\nconsider properties of these entropy measures for simpler quantum mechanical\nsystems, such as generalized SU(2) and SU(1,1) coherent states, and tripartite\nGHZ and W states.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
