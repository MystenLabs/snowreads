The associated cardinal\nfunction $sn(X)$, where $e(X)\\leq sn(X)\\leq L(X)$, is used to establish new\ncardinal inequalities involving diagonal degrees. We show $|X|\\leq\nsn(X)^{\\Delta(X)}$ for a $T_1$ space $X$, giving a partial answer to a\nlong-standing question of Angelo Bella. Many further results are given using\nvariations of $sn(X)$. One result has as corollaries Buzyakova's theorem that a\nccc space with a regular $G_\\delta$-diagonal has cardinality at most\n$\\mathfrak{c}$, as well as three results of Gotchev. Further results lead to\nlogical improvements of theorems of Basile, Bella, and Ridderbos, a partial\nsolution to a question of the same authors, and a theorem of Gotchev,\nTkachenko, and Tkachuk. Finally, we define the Urysohn extent $Ue(X)$ with the\nproperty $Ue(X)\\leq\\min\\{aL(X),e(X)\\}$ and use the Erd\\H{o}s-Rado theorem to\nshow that $|X|\\leq 2^{Ue(X)\\overline{\\Delta}(X)}$ for any Urysohn space $X$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"urws7cJ5_Z2pyGB6ZeAL4fNM7dJkVWeWem0EeJNkpgs","pdfSize":"205331"}
