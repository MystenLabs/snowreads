The study extends the technology\nacceptance model (TAM) by incorporating artificial intelligence-specific\nfactors (conversational intelligence, task intelligence, and perceived\nnaturalness), user interface design factors (simplicity in information design\nand visual aesthetics), and user acceptance and loyalty. Using a purposive\nsampling method, we gathered data from 824 users in the US and analyzed the\nsample through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and\nfuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The findings reveal that\nall hypothesized relationships, including both direct and indirect effects, are\nsupported. Additionally, fsQCA supports the PLS-SEM findings and identifies\nthree configurations leading to high and low user acceptance. This research\nenriches the literature and provides valuable insights for system designers and\nmarketers of PIPAs, guiding strategic decisions to foster widespread adoption\nand long-term engagement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
