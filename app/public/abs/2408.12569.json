Our models natively support 1K high-resolution\ninference and are extremely easy to adapt for individual tasks by simply\nfine-tuning models pretrained on over 300 million in-the-wild human images. We\nobserve that, given the same computational budget, self-supervised pretraining\non a curated dataset of human images significantly boosts the performance for a\ndiverse set of human-centric tasks. The resulting models exhibit remarkable\ngeneralization to in-the-wild data, even when labeled data is scarce or\nentirely synthetic. Our simple model design also brings scalability -- model\nperformance across tasks improves as we scale the number of parameters from 0.3\nto 2 billion. Sapiens consistently surpasses existing baselines across various\nhuman-centric benchmarks. We achieve significant improvements over the prior\nstate-of-the-art on Humans-5K (pose) by 7.6 mAP, Humans-2K (part-seg) by 17.1\nmIoU, Hi4D (depth) by 22.4% relative RMSE, and THuman2 (normal) by 53.5%\nrelative angular error.
