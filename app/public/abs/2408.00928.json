A natural question to ask is: How much\nsecurity do restaked services \\emph{really} need to purchase? To answer this\nquestion, we expand a model of Durvasula and Roughgarden [DR24] that includes\nincentives and an expanded threat model consisting of strategic attackers and\nusers. Our model shows that an adversary with a strictly submodular profit\ncombined with strategic node operators who respond to incentives can avoid the\nlarge-scale cascading failures of~[DR24]. We utilize our model to construct an\napproximation algorithm for choosing token-based incentives that achieve a\ngiven security level against adversaries who are bounded in the number of\nservices they can simultaneously attack. Our results suggest that incentivized\nrestaking protocols can be secure with proper incentive management.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4fnWASl3SQHzLP0Gg1EPhPI6URPU1Z_hYbttXv7fxHE","pdfSize":"334328","txDigest":"Cjb1PyxPz3DMSfBk7NzHN9CaTV1LhEgeiRwZAadj5jXc","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
