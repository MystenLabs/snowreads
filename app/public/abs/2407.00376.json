We show that the electronic and\nmagnetic properties strongly depend on the distribution of transition-metal and\nLa/Sr ions in the lattice. Fe-Fe exchange is found to be antiferromagnetic,\nwhereas Co-Co and Fe-Co exchange is ferromagnetic. We find that Co spin states\ndepend on the distribution in both La/Sr and transition-metal ions. The most\nenergetically favorable configuration is ferromagnetic, whereas the majority of\nmetastable configurations are antiferromagnetic. LaSrCo$_{1/2}$Fe$_{1/2}$O$_4$\nwas synthesized using spray-pyrolysis method. Magnetization measurements\nrevealed antiferromgnetic behavior, thus indicating presence of metastable\nconfigurations in the synthesized material. In addition, we show that in\ncomplex systems, such as mixed-metal Ruddlesden-Popper phases, Hubbard $U$\nvalues have to be determined for each crystallographically non-equivalent site.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"obl4_tAQlNVsc4_EPAB9TRtOHFcXSYDmTIR3Yb2YVbs","pdfSize":"22501001"}
