However, GitHub\nlacks a direct link between issues and commits, making it difficult for\ndevelopers to understand how specific issues are resolved. Although GitHub's\nInsights page provides some visualization for repository data, the\nrepresentation of issues and commits related data in a textual format hampers\nquick evaluation of issue management. This paper presents a prototype web\napplication that generates visualizations to offer insights into issue\ntimelines and reveals different factors related to issues. It focuses on the\nlifecycle of issues and depicts vital information to enhance users'\nunderstanding of development patterns in their projects. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach through case studies involving three open-source\nGitHub repositories. Furthermore, we conducted a user evaluation to validate\nthe efficacy of our prototype in conveying crucial repository information more\nefficiently and rapidly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
