In\nliterature prior to AMY, the viscosity of an asymptotically hot QCD plasma was\nexpressed by a $q^2$ momentum transfer-weighted relaxation time approximation.\nRecent studies that compared numerical transport calculations and analytical\nexpressions for $\\eta$ demonstrated that asymptotically high temperatures and\ndensities induce anisotropic scatterings, which are exhibited in the\nquark-gluon plasma produced by relativistic heavy ion collisions. In these\nstudies, the QGP was treated as a Maxwell-Boltzmann-distributed gluon gas with\nadded (anti-)quark degrees of freedom. One such method used in the comparison\nwas the \"modified\" $q^2$ transport-weighted RTA. In this study, a comparison\nbetween the AMY formalism (both numerical calculations and next-leading-log\nexpression) and the modified RTA expression for $\\eta$ is made in 0-flavor\nSU(3) theory. The comparison between numerical AMY calculations and the\nmodified RTA method shows perfect agreement under the temperatures associated\nwith collider-produced QGP. Additionally, AMY is compared with the\nChapman-Enskog method, which is well understood to better describe anisotropic\ncollider-produced QGP.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
