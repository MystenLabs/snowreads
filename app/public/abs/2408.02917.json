Recently, Pook-Kolb, Zhao, Andersson,\nKrishnan, and Yau investigated the near horizon limit of the Wang--Yau\nquasi-local mass in binary black hole mergers in [12] and conjectured that the\noptimal embeddings approach the isometric embedding of the horizon into $\\R^3$.\nMoreover, the quasi-local mass converges to the total mean curvature of the\nimage. The vanishing of the norm of the mean curvature vector implies special\nproperties for the Wang--Yau quasi-local energy and the optimal embedding\nequation. We utilize these features to prove the existence and uniqueness of\nthe optimal embedding and investigate the minimization of the Wang--Yau\nquasi-local energy. In particular, we prove the continuity of the quasi-local\nmass in the near horizon limit.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
