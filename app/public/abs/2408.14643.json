The current consensus is that a point\nof maximal electron delocalization along the bonding axis separates the\ndifferent bonding regimes of reactants and products. This maximum transition\npoint has been investigated previously through the total position spread and\nthe bond-parallel components of the static polarizability tensor for describing\ncovalent bond breaking. In this paper, we report that the first-order change of\nthe Wiberg and Mayer bond index with respect to the reaction coordinate, the\nbond flux, is similarly maximized and is nearly equivalent with the bond\nbreaking points determined by the bond-parallel polarizability. We investigate\nthe similarites and differences between the two bonding metrics for breaking\nthe nitrogen triple bond, twisting around the ethene double bond, and a set of\nprototypical reactions in the hydrogen combustion reaction network. The\nWiberg-Mayer bond flux provides a simpler approach to calculating the point of\nbond dissociation and formation and can yield greater chemical insight through\nbond specific information for certain reactions where multiple bond changes are\noperative.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-2VyiFUYzt3rI86w7m2Pbn6pdhHPt-A08NG79xDgmkE","pdfSize":"2780354"}
