Based on the\nmaximal regularity property, we obtain the global existence and uniqueness of\nsolutions to the incompressible Navier-Stokes-Korteweg system with variable\nviscosity and capillary terms. By assuming the initial density $\\rho_0$ is\nclose to a positive constant, additionally, the initial velocity $u_0$ and the\ninitial density $\\nabla \\rho_0$ are small in critical space $\\dot\nB^{-1+d/p}_{p,1}(\\mathbb R^{d})$ $(1<p<d).$ This work relies on the maximal\nregularity property of the heat equation, of the Stokes equation, and of the\nLam\\'e equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
