A key challenge in SoS is\nad-hoc scalability, meaning the system size changes during operation by adding\nor removing CSs. This research focuses on an Unmanned Vehicle Fleet (UVF) as a\npractical SoS example, addressing uncertainties like mission changes, range\nextensions, and UV failures. The proposed solution involves a self-adaptive\nsystem that dynamically adjusts UVF architecture, allowing the Mission Control\nCenter (MCC) to scale UVF size automatically based on performance criteria or\nmanually by operator decision. A multi-agent environment and rule management\nengine were implemented to simulate and verify this approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
