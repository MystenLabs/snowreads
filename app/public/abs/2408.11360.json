Perturbations of the system cause these poles to\nshift in the complex frequency plane. In this work, we introduce a novel method\nfor calculating shifts in scattering matrix poles using generalized\nWigner-Smith operators. We link our method to traditional cavity perturbation\ntheory and validate its effectiveness through application to complex photonic\nnetworks. Our findings underscore the versatility of generalized Wigner-Smith\noperators for analyzing a broad spectrum of resonant systems and provides new\ninsight into resonant properties of non-Hermitian systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
