In this work, we extend the findings of [1]\nby incorporating the nonextensive nature of black hole entropy. Specifically,\nthe connection between black hole phase transitions and the winding number of\nRiemann surfaces derived through complex analysis is extended to the R\\'enyi\nentropy framework. This new geometrical and non-extensive formalism is employed\nto predict the phase portraits of charged-flat black holes within both the\ncanonical and grand canonical ensembles.\n  Furthermore, we elucidate novel relations between the number of sheets\ncomprising the Riemann surface of the Hawking-Page and Van der Waals\ntransitions and the dimensionality of black hole spacetimes. Notably, these new\nnumbers are consistent with those found for charged-AdS black holes in\nGibbs-Boltzmann statistics, providing another significant example of the\npotential connection between the cosmological constant and the nonextensive\nR\\'enyi parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V5JB27k8Pt954yp0qlM2owxWGzioFHbfBtTcAYc2vxs","pdfSize":"28213232"}
