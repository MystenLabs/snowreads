Here, we consider the planar version of both\nmodels within the framework of the optimized perturbation theory at the two\nloop level, in order to verify if the predicted equivalence emerges explicitly\nwhen different temperature and density regimes are considered. At vanishing\ndensities, our results indicate that both models indeed describe exactly the\nsame thermodynamics, provided that $N=1$. However, at finite chemical\npotentials we find that the $N=1$ Fierz equivalence no longer holds. After\nexamining the relevant free energies, we have identified the contributions\nwhich lead to this puzzling discrepancy. Finally, we discuss different\nframeworks in which this (so far open) problem could be further understood and\neventually circumvented.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
