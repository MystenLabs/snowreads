Streamliners are\nconstraints that narrow the search space, enhancing the speed and feasibility\nof solving complex problems. Traditionally, streamliners were crafted manually\nor generated through systematically combined atomic constraints with\nhigh-effort offline testing. Our approach uses LLMs to propose effective\nstreamliners. Our system StreamLLM generates streamlines for problems specified\nin the MiniZinc constraint programming language and integrates feedback to the\nLLM with quick empirical tests. Our rigorous empirical evaluation involving ten\nproblems with several hundreds of test instances shows robust results that are\nhighly encouraging, showcasing the transforming power of LLMs in the domain of\nconstraint programming.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
