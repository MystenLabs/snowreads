We study the growth rate of the monogenic regular\n$\\star$-monoid $\\mathbf{F}_1^\\star$, and prove that this growth rate is\nintermediate. In particular, we deduce that $\\mathbf{F}_r^\\star$ is not\nrational or automatic for any $r \\geq 1$, yielding the analogue of a result of\nCutting & Solomon for free inverse monoids. Next, for all ranks $r \\geq 1$ we\ndetermine the integral homology groups $H_\\ast(\\mathbf{F}_r^\\star,\n\\mathbb{Z})$, and by constructing a collapsing scheme prove that they vanish in\ndimension $3$ and above. As a corollary, we deduce that the free regular\n$\\star$-monoid $\\mathbf{F}_r^\\star$ of rank $r \\geq 1$ does not have the\nhomological finiteness property $\\operatorname{FP}_2$, yielding the analogue of\na result of Gray & Steinberg for free inverse monoids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
