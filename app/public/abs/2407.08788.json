However, bright quantum\ndots (QDs) emitting highly indistinguishable quantum states of light, such as\nInGaAs QDs, often emit photons in the near infrared thus necessitating\nfrequency conversion (FC) to the telecom band. Furthermore, the signal quality\nof quantum emissions is crucial for the effective performance of these\nnetworks. In this work we report a method for simultaneously implementing\nspectral purification and frequency shifting of single photons from QD sources\nto the C-band in a periodically poled Lithium Niobate waveguide. We consider\ndifference frequency generation in the counter-propagating configuration to\nimplement FC with the output emission bandwidth in units of GHz. Our approach\nestablishes a clear path to integrating high-performance single-emitter sources\nin a hybrid quantum network.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Aem4fii4OO-ssNjl7usS-CHx1xs6SzryA0ByHZxzTJ4","pdfSize":"762500","objectId":"0x6978fbb71e7c1063624ab945ff78f1ef1f2b265b14ecfcccd5f28a4a775647bf","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
