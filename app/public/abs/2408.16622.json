Recent studies have explored several regularization\nterms for the negative binomial model, such as the $\\ell_p$ quasi-norm with $0\n< p < 1$, $\\ell_1$ norm, and the total variation (TV) quasi-seminorm for\npromoting sparsity in signal recovery. These penalty terms have been shown to\nimprove image reconstruction outcomes. In this paper, we investigate the\n$\\ell_p$ quasi-seminorm, both isotropic and anisotropic $\\ell_p$ TV\nquasi-seminorms, within the framework of the negative binomial statistical\nmodel. This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, which we\nsolve using a gradient-based approach. We present comparisons between the\nnegative binomial and Poisson statistical models using the $\\ell_p$ TV\nquasi-seminorm as well as common penalty terms. Our experimental results\nhighlight the efficacy of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
