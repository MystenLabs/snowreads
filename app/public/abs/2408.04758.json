This framework covers credit risk\ntheory and life insurance. In this setting, we assume $\\mathbb{F}$ being\ngenerated by a Brownian motion $W$ and consider a vulnerable claim $\\xi$, whose\npayment's policy depends {\\it{essentially}} on the occurrence of $\\tau$. The\nhedging problems, in many directions, for this claim led to the question of\nstudying the linear reflected-backward-stochastic differential equations (RBSDE\nhereafter), \\begin{equation*} \\begin{split}\n&dY_t=f(t)d(t\\wedge\\tau)+Z_tdW_{t\\wedge{\\tau}}+dM_t-dK_t,\\quad Y_{\\tau}=\\xi,\\\\\n& Y\\geq S\\quad\\mbox{on}\\quad \\Lbrack0,\\tau\\Lbrack,\\quad\n\\displaystyle\\int_0^{\\tau}(Y_{s-}-S_{s-})dK_s=0\\quad P\\mbox{-a.s.}.\\end{split}\n\\end{equation*} This is the objective of this paper. For this RBSDE and without\nany further assumption on $\\tau$ that might neglect any risk intrinsic to its\nstochasticity, we answer the following: a) What are the sufficient minimal\nconditions on the data $(f, \\xi, S, \\tau)$ that guarantee the existence of the\nsolution to this RBSDE? b) How can we estimate the solution in norm using $(f,\n\\xi, S)$? c) Is there an $\\mathbb F$-RBSDE that is intimately related to the\ncurrent one and how their solutions are related to each other? This latter\nquestion has practical and theoretical leitmotivs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Co5fUQHtBB6Mn_CmhRMqCyqXA7QBSXeI_ZuY72NEv1A","pdfSize":"450046"}
