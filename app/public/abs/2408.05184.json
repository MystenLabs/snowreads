The goal of this subtask is to\ndistribute a given set of usages of a polysemous word from a newer time period\nbetween senses of this word from an older time period and clusters representing\ngained senses of this word. We propose and experiment with three new methods\nsolving this task. Our methods achieve SOTA results according to both official\nmetrics of the first substask. Additionally, we develop a model that can tell\nif a given word usage is not described by any of the provided sense\ndefinitions. This model serves as a component in one of our methods, but can\npotentially be useful on its own.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bMGAMZZ1Tjfot6u3jYebDVKjRW6Plb2DKwoyiDpVGU8","pdfSize":"791001"}
