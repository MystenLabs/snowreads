This has resulted in a number of tools for discovering\nschemas from a collection of data. Although such tools can be useful, existing\napproaches focus on the syntax of documents and ignore semantic information.\n  In this work, we explore the automatic addition of meaningful semantic\ninformation to discovered schemas similar to information that is added by human\nschema authors. We leverage large language models and a corpus of manually\nauthored JSON Schema documents to generate natural language descriptions of\nschema elements, meaningful names for reusable definitions, and identify which\ndiscovered properties are most useful and which can be considered \"noise\". Our\napproach performs well on existing metrics for text generation that have been\npreviously shown to correlate well with human judgement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
