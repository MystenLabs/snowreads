The large size and slow response make their\ndynamics suitable to be captured through simple diagnostic tools. Furthermore,\nas the charge on individual particles is significantly higher than the\nelectronic charge, the interaction amongst them can be in a strong coupling\nregime even at room temperatures and normal densities. Such charged dust\nparticles are often present in several industrial plasma-based processes and\ncan have a detrimental influence. For instance, in magnetrons, the sputtering\nphenomena may be affected by the accumulation of charged impurity clusters. The\nobjective here is to understand the transport behavior of these particles in\nthe presence of an externally applied magnetic field. For this purpose,\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are performed using an open-source\nlarge-scale atomic/molecular massively parallel simulator (LAMMPS). The\ndependence of the transport coefficient on the applied magnetic field and\nprevalent collisional processes has been discerned through simulations in\ndetail.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cwHuN3795iPRb7fb1PwyypkD39S3VxFH4NWnCLjPfYk","pdfSize":"2218182"}
