Focusing on basins, which are economically\nsignificant drilling regions, we model the latent production capacity of wells\nusing small-area estimation techniques. Our model accounts for well-level\nvariations within these basins, incorporating factors such as lateral length,\nwater usage, and sand usage. A key aspect of our methodology is the use of the\nMaidenhead Coordinate System to define small areas, enabling detailed regional\nanalysis. The model was developed and validated using data from the Eagle Ford\nregion, covering the years 2014 to 2019, and demonstrates strong predictive\nperformance, particularly in handling small sample sizes. We expand the model\nto accommodate temporal dynamics by introducing time-effect parameters,\nallowing for the analysis of production trends over time. Additionally, we\nexplore the impact of technological advancements by modeling water-sand\nintensity as a proxy for production efficiency. Our findings suggest that\nBayesian multilevel modeling provides robust and flexible tools for\nunderstanding and predicting oil and gas production at a granular level,\noffering valuable insights for energy production forecasting and resource\nmanagement.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
