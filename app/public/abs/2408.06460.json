To address them, researchers have\ndesigned various load hiding algorithms that manipulate the electricity\nconsumption measured. To compare how well these algorithms preserve privacy,\nvarious privacy measures have been proposed. However, there currently is no\nconsensus on which privacy measure is most appropriate to use. In this study,\nwe aim to identify the most effective privacy measure(s) for load hiding\nalgorithms. We have crafted a series of experiments to assess the effectiveness\nof these measures. found 20 of the 25 measures studied to be ineffective. Next,\nfocused on the well-known \"appliance usage\" secret, we have designed synthetic\ndata to find the measure that best deals with this secret. We observe that such\na measure, a variant of mutual information, actually exists.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
