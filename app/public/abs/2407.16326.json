Their\nrepresentations are known as embeddings. To measure the plausibility of\ntriplets, score functions are defined over embedding spaces. Despite wide\ndissemination of KGE in various tasks, KGE methods have limitations in\nreasoning abilities. In this paper we propose a mathematical framework to\ncompare reasoning abilities of KGE methods. We show that STransE has a higher\ncapability than TransComplEx, and then present new STransCoRe method, which\nimproves the STransE by combining it with the TransCoRe insights, which can\nreduce the STransE space complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
