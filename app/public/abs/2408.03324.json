This\nmerger-driven galaxy evolution scenario suggests that dust-obscured quasars\nexhibit higher Eddington ratios ($\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$) than those of unobscured\nquasars. However, their high dust obscuration poses challenges to accurately\nmeasuring their $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$ using commonly employed bolometric\nluminosity ($L_{\\rm bol}$) and black hole (BH) mass ($M_{\\rm BH}$) estimators\nbased on the ultraviolet (UV) or optical luminosity. Recently, Kim et al.\n(2023) established new estimators for $L_{\\rm bol}$ and $M_{\\rm BH}$ based on\nmid-infrared (MIR) continuum luminosity ($L_{\\rm MIR}$), which are less\naffected by dust obscuration. These estimators enable the study of a large\nnumber of dust-obscured quasars across a wide redshift range. In this study, we\nmeasure the $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$ values of 30 dust-obscured quasars at $z\n\\lesssim 1$, the largest sample size to date, using the $L_{\\rm MIR}$-based\n$L_{\\rm bol}$ and $M_{\\rm BH}$ estimators. Our findings reveal that\ndust-obscured quasars exhibit significantly higher $\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$ values\ncompared to unobscured quasars. Moreover, we confirm that the enhanced\n$\\lambda_{\\rm Edd}$ values of dust-obscured quasars maintain consistency across\nthe redshift span of 0 to 1. Our results strongly support the picture that\ndust-obscured quasars are in the earlier stage than unobscured quasars in the\nmerger-driven galaxy evolutionary track.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zDon9NL_1Bke6fR4tFUYDhaqWKMabtUe3miUhoMiyIY","pdfSize":"3000076"}
