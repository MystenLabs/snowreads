The result is based on recent multifrequency observations\nusing the Very Long Baseline Array and European VLBI Network, which reveal two\ncompact, variable, flat-spectrum, active nuclei within the elliptical host\ngalaxy of J1543-0757. Multiepoch observations from the VLBA also provide\nconstraints on the spectral index and proper motions of all components. The\nflat spectra of both N and S at both frequencies strongly support that these\nradio components are associated with two separate, accreting supermassive black\nholes (SMBHs). The two nuclei appear stationary, while the jets emanating from\nthe weaker of the two nuclei appear to move out and terminate in bright hot\nspots. The discovery of this system has implications for the number of close\ndual black holes that might be sources of gravitational radiation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
