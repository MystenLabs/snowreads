We construct a\ntraining dataset by labeling ionic liquids as suitable (+1) or unsuitable (-1)\nfor electrospray thrusters based on their density, viscosity, and surface\ntension. The ionic liquids are represented by their molecular descriptors\ncalculated using the Mordred package. We evaluate four machine learning\nalgorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest,\nand Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), with SVM demonstrating superior\npredictive performance. The SVM predicts 193 candidate propellants from a\ndataset of ionic liquids with unknown physical properties. Further, we employ\nShapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to assess and rank the impact of\nindividual molecular descriptors on model decisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
