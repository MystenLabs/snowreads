However, optical\nfrequency tracking remains necessary and can become a severe burden in future\ndeployment of multi-node quantum networks. Here, we resolve this problem by\nreferencing each user's laser to an absolute frequency standard and demonstrate\na practical post-measurement pairing QKD with excellent long-term stability. We\nconfirm the setup's repeater-like behavior and achieve a finite-size secure key\nrate (SKR) of 15.94 bit/s over 504 km fiber, which overcomes the absolute\nrepeaterless bound by 1.28 times. Over a fiber length 100 km, the setup\ndelivers an impressive SKR of 285.68 kbit/s. Our work paves the way towards an\nefficient muti-user quantum network with the local frequency standard.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
