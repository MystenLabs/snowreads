To this end,\nstandard implementations of cumulative step-size adaptation (CSA) and mutative\nself-adaptation ($\\sigma$SA) are investigated experimentally and theoretically\nby assuming large population sizes ($\\mu$) in relation to the search space\ndimensionality ($N$). The adaptation is characterized in terms of the\nscale-invariant mutation strength on the sphere in relation to its maximum\nachievable value for positive progress. %The results show how the different\n$\\sigma$-adaptation variants behave as $\\mu$ and $N$ are varied. Standard\nCSA-variants show notably different adaptation properties and progress rates on\nthe sphere, becoming slower or faster as $\\mu$ or $N$ are varied. This is shown\nby investigating common choices for the cumulation and damping parameters.\nStandard $\\sigma$SA-variants (with default learning parameter settings) can\nachieve faster adaptation and larger progress rates compared to the CSA.\nHowever, it is shown how self-adaptation affects the progress rate levels\nnegatively. Furthermore, differences regarding the adaptation and stability of\n$\\sigma$SA with log-normal and normal mutation sampling are elaborated.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
