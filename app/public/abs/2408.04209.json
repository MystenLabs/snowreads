In particular, the existence of diffusion\npresents a new challenge to conventional tensor network methods for\ndeterministic optimal control. To overcome the difficulty, we use a general\nregression-based formulation where the loss term is the Bellman consistency\nerror combined with a Sobolev-type penalization term. We propose two novel\nsketching-based subroutines for obtaining the tensor-network approximation to\nthe action-value functions and the value functions, which greatly accelerate\nthe convergence for the subsequent regression phase. We apply the proposed\napproach successfully to two challenging control problems with Ginzburg-Landau\npotential in 1D and 2D with 64 variables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
