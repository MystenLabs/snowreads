These dynamics on networked\npopulations (individuals occupying nodes of a graph) are mainly concerning on\nthe competition between to cooperate or to defect, by allowing some process of\nrevision of strategies. Cooperators avoid defectors by forming clusters in a\nprocess known as network reciprocity. This defense strategy is based on the\nfact that any individual interact only with its nearest neighbors. The minimum\ncluster, in turn, is formed by a set of three completely connected nodes and\nthe bulk of these triplets is associated with the transitivity property of a\nnetwork. Particularly, we show that the transitivity increases eventually\nassuming a constant behavior when observed as a function of the number of\ncontacts of an individual. We investigate the influence of the network\nreciprocity on that transitivity increasing regime on the promotion of a\ncooperative behavior. The dynamics on small-world networks are compared with\nthose random regular, and annealed networks, the later typically studied as the\nwell-mixed approach. We observe that the Snowdrift Game converge to an annealed\nscenario as randonness and coordination number increase, whereas the Prisoner's\nDilemma becomes more severe against the cooperative behavior under the regime\nof an increasing network reciprocity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
