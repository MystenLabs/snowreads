We study subradiance in the experimental setting of a\nBose-Einstein condensate positioned at the mode crossing of two optical\ncavities. In this setup, subradiance manifests in the form of metastable\ndensity structures that suppress emission into one cavity mode, thereby\npreventing relaxation to the stationary, superradiant grating that minimizes\nthe system's energy. We observe lifetimes of the subradiant states exceeding\nhundred milliseconds, far surpassing any characteristic dynamic time scale of\nthe system. Eventually, an instability triggers a rapid transition to the\nsuperradiant stationary pattern. We reproduce these dynamics by a quantum mean\nfield model, suggesting that subradiance shares characteristics with\nquasi-stationary states predicted in other long-range interacting systems such\nas astrophysical clusters and plasmas. This behavior highlights the potential\nof photon-mediated long-range forces as controllable and exploitable quantum\ncooperative phenomenon.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
