Within this setting, we prove the existence of optimal\nconfigurations under a volume constraint and show that the minimization problem\nis a natural generalization of that posed for regular domains.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
