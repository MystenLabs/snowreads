Specifically, we construct topological defects for the\n$R$-symmetry in 4d $\\mathcal{N}=1$ and 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ quantum field\ntheories holographically dual to Sasaki-Einstein compactifications. These are\nstudied using a universal consistent truncation to the gravity multiplet in the\nbulk theory. We furthermore check these constructions by identifying the\nobjects charged under them, and understanding their origin in the bulk theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
