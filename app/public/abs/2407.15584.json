First of\nall, we establish the large deviation principle for forward stochastic\ndifferential equations with reflecting boundaries under weak monotonicity\nconditions. Then based on the obtained result and the contraction principle,\nthe large deviation principle for the generalized backward stochastic\ndifferential equations is proved. As a by-product, we obtain a limit result\nabout parabolic partial differential equations with the nonlinear Neumann\nboundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
