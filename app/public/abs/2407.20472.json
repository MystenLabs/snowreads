These problems can be reduced\nto a concise formulation that extends the maximum weight closure problem for\ntwo problems: finding the minimum number of links that observe all OD pairs and\nfinding the maximum number of observed OD pairs with a budget-constrained\nnumber of links. Insights into the characteristics of cuts give superior upper\nbounds on the problem of finding the minimum number of links that observe all\nOD pairs. The proposed method is evaluated on the Sioux-Falls network. It shows\nthat it is possible to derive a solution equivalent to the optimal solution\nfound in previous studies in a very short computation time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
