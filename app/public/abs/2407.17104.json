The cracking elements used in the CEM can be\nconsidered as a special type of finite element implemented in the standard\nfinite element frameworks. One disadvantage of CEM is that it uses nonlinear\ninterpolation of the displacement field (Q8 or T6 elements), introducing more\nnodes and consequent computing efforts than the cases with elements using\nlinear interpolation of the displacement field. Aiming at solving this problem,\nwe propose a simple hybrid linear and non-linear interpolation finite element\nfor adaptive cracking elements method in this work. A simple strategy is\nproposed for treating the elements with $p$ edge nodes $p\\in\\left[0,n\\right]$\nand $n$ being the edge number of the element. Only a few codes are needed.\nThen, by only adding edge and center nodes on the elements experiencing\ncracking and keeping linear interpolation of the displacement field for the\nelements outside the cracking domain, the number of total nodes was reduced\nalmost to half of the case using the conventional cracking elements. Numerical\ninvestigations prove that the new approach inherits all the advantages of CEM\nwith greatly improved computing efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
