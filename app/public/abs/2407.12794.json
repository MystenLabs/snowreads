Rewriting logical and physical relational\nquery plans is proven to be an NP-hard sequential decision-making problem with\na search space exponential in the number of rewrite rules. In this paper, we\naddress the query rewrite problem by interleaving Equality Saturation and Graph\nReinforcement Learning (RL). The proposed system, Aurora, rewrites relational\nqueries by guiding Equality Saturation, a method from compiler literature to\nperform non-destructive graph rewriting, with a novel RL agent that embeds both\nthe spatial structure of the query graph as well as the temporal dimension\nassociated with the sequential construction of query plans. Our results show\nGraph Reinforcement Learning for non-destructive graph rewriting yields SQL\nplans orders of magnitude faster than existing equality saturation solvers,\nwhile also achieving competitive results against mainstream query optimisers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TrWXKYsQmaNAlCHfL5KkX2CRHXZeN6ZAFXZFjiuILic","pdfSize":"956803","objectId":"0x805e34b6a0ba944d33867e653a1ab48c7b6de8525bc77b535d2ce5b1426e8799","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
