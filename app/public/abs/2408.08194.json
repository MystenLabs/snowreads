In the large on-site\ninteractions region, spin-$1/2$ fermions may form into doublon bound state and\nundergoes doublon BOs in the present of tilted potential. Here we investigate\nthe impact of nearest-neighbor interaction $V$ on the multi-doublon BOs in a\nmass-imbalanced extended Fermi-Hubbard model. We derive a doublons effective\nHamiltonian, and show that a minor change of $V$ can alter the dynamic\nbehaviors of doublons qualitatively. Notably, at a resonance point, the\ndoublons act like free hard-core bosons. Under a tilted potential, the system\nmay exhibit different types of multi-doublon BOs at or deviation from the\nresonance point with different initial states. Numerical results are presented\nto demonstrate our conclusions in the one- and two-dimensional systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
