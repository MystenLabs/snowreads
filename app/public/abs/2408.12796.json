Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are a significant concern\nfor workers involved in manual lifting, and traditional methods for posture\ncorrection are often inadequate due to delayed feedback and lack of\npersonalized assessment. Our proposed solution integrates AI-driven posture\ndetection, detailed keypoint analysis, risk level determination, and real-time\nfeedback delivered through a user-friendly web interface. The system aims to\nimprove posture, reduce the risk of MSDs, and enhance user engagement. The\nresearch involves comprehensive data collection, model training, and iterative\ndevelopment to ensure high accuracy and user satisfaction. The solution's\neffectiveness is evaluated against existing methodologies, demonstrating\nsignificant improvements in real-time feedback and risk assessment. This study\ncontributes to the field by offering a novel approach to posture correction\nthat addresses existing gaps and provides practical, immediate benefits to\nusers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
