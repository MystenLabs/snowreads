While the traditional app life cycle involves incremental updates\nfor feature enhancements and issue resolution, some apps deviate from this norm\nby undergoing significant transformations in their use cases or market\npositioning. We define this previously unstudied phenomenon as 'app\nmetamorphosis'. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient multi-modal\nsearch methodology to identify apps undergoing metamorphosis and apply it to\nanalyse two snapshots of the Google Play Store taken five years apart. Our\nmethodology uncovers various metamorphosis scenarios, including re-births,\nre-branding, re-purposing, and others, enabling comprehensive characterisation.\nAlthough these transformations may register as successful for app developers\nbased on our defined success score metric (e.g., re-branded apps performing\napproximately 11.3% better than an average top app), we shed light on the\nconcealed security and privacy risks that lurk within, potentially impacting\neven tech-savvy end-users.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
