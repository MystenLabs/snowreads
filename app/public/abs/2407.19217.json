In order to deal\nwith the singularity of the stiffness matrix, the saddle point problem is first\nextended to a new one by a regularization of the pure Neumann problem. Then\nafter row permutations of the extended saddle point problem, a new block\ntriangular preconditioner is constructed based on an approximation of the Schur\ncomplement. We analyze the eigenvalue properties of the preconditioned matrix\nand provide eigenvalue bounds. Numerical results illustrate the efficiency of\nthe proposed preconditioning method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
