Such games arise, for example, when players' strategies are\nrepresented by the parameters of a neural network. Lack of access to gradients\nis common in reinforcement learning settings, where the environment is treated\nas a black box, as well as equilibrium finding in mechanisms such as auctions,\nwhere the mechanism's payoffs are discontinuous in the players' actions. To\ntackle this problem, we turn to zeroth-order optimization techniques that\ncombine pseudo-gradients with equilibrium-finding dynamics. Specifically, we\nintroduce a new technique that requires a number of utility function\nevaluations per iteration that is constant rather than linear in the number of\nplayers. It achieves this by performing a single joint perturbation on all\nplayers' strategies, rather than perturbing each one individually. This yields\na dramatic improvement for many-player games, especially when the utility\nfunction is expensive to compute in terms of wall time, memory, money, or other\nresources. We evaluate our approach on various games, including auctions, which\nhave important real-world applications. Our approach yields a significant\nreduction in the run time required to reach an approximate Nash equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
