The\ncoupler is composed of two parallel pixelated transmission lines. To validate\nthe designstrategy, the proposed MFBC is fabricated and measured. The measured\nresults demonstrate a forward coupler with 3 dB coupling, and a compact size of\n0.12 {\\lambda}g x 0.10{\\lambda}g. Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (BPSO)\ndesign methodology and flexibility of pixelation enable us to optimize the\nproposed MFBC with desired coupling level and operating frequency within a\nfixed dimension. Also, low sensitivity to misalignment between two coupled TLs\nmakes the proposed coupler a good candidate for near-field Wireless Power\nTransfer (WPT) application and sensors.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
