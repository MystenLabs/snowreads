Fairness is fundamental to stimulate\ncooperation in large populations, and plays an important role in traffic\nengineering, as it increases the well-being of users, improves driving safety\nby rule-adherence, and overcomes public resistance at legislative\nimplementation. Despite the importance of fairness, only a few works have\ntranslated fairness into the transportation domain, with a focus on\ntransportation planning rather than traffic engineering. This work highlights\nthe importance of fairness when solving conflicts of large populations for\nscare, public good, road-network resources with traffic engineering, and\nestablishes a connection to the modern fairness theories. Moreover, this work\npresents a fairness framework that serves when designing traffic engineering\nsolutions, when convincing in public debates with a useful, argumentative\ntool-set to confront equity considerations, and enables systematic research and\ndesign of control systems.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"IFg_3FZhm5tj71bJ42ISFhQaRZrp1eg60aj9Z4NgC4Y","pdfSize":"1045655"}
