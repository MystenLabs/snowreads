However, previous\nmulti-hop reasoning approaches are subject to two primary shortcomings. First,\nagents struggle to learn effective and robust policies at the early phase due\nto sparse rewards. Second, these approaches often falter on specific datasets\nlike sparse knowledge graphs, where agents are required to traverse lengthy\nreasoning paths. To address these problems, we propose a multi-hop reasoning\nmodel with dual agents based on hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL),\nwhich is named FULORA. FULORA tackles the above reasoning challenges by\neFficient GUidance-ExpLORAtion between dual agents. The high-level agent walks\non the simplified knowledge graph to provide stage-wise hints for the low-level\nagent walking on the original knowledge graph. In this framework, the low-level\nagent optimizes a value function that balances two objectives: (1) maximizing\nreturn, and (2) integrating efficient guidance from the high-level agent.\nExperiments conducted on three real-word knowledge graph datasets demonstrate\nthat FULORA outperforms RL-based baselines, especially in the case of\nlong-distance reasoning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
