Explicitly, we\ndefine $G, G'$ such that $\\mathcal{G} = G + G'$ with $[G, G']\\neq 0$. This\nnon-commutativity prevents a clean split of $\\exp(is \\mathcal{G})$, and\nrequires the Zassenhaus product formula. We compute all the infinite terms in\nthe product explicitly, and show $\\exp(is \\mathcal{G}) = \\exp( i s G ) \\exp( i\ns G' ) \\exp( f(s) [G, G'] )$ for a real function $f(s)$. We study the\nconsequences of this result through flow of local operators under $G$ and $G'$,\nand show that while in regions where $G'$ has no causal influence, the action\nof $G$ is indistinguishable from that of $\\mathcal{G}$; in the region where\nboth $G$ and $G'$ together create $\\mathcal{G}$, the action of $G$ is\nremarkably different. We conclude by discussing how our results can be applied\nto the island paradigm.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Eu_OntZPdT1ikTfWoSHMtHUcR4MUiyDd1TUf3r7J278","pdfSize":"534685","txDigest":"FyENcsKQ5XMykA9AqcaVGZDEXp8wpSyRKJtqsuKQcSwW","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
