If a Monte Carlo\nmodel for the detector response to photons impinging at various locations of a\npixel is available, the full statistics of the detector can be derived in a\nstraightforward manner. The purpose of this paper is to describe the method in\ndetail and to apply it to four types of realistic detectors: direct converting\ndetectors using CdTe and silicon, a CdTe photon counter with additional\ncoincidence counters and an optical counting system using LaBr3 as\nscintillator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
