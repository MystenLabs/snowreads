Here, we study these spaces, obtained through\nthe application of general coorbit theory, using the framework of decomposition\nspaces. This allows us to derive embedding relations between coorbit spaces\nassociated to different warping functions, and relate them to established,\nimportant smothness spaces. In particular, we show that we obtain\n$\\alpha$-modulation spaces and spaces of dominating mixed smoothness as special\ncases and, in contrast, that this is only possible for Besov spaces if $d=1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XU4vHXPEwqiQpTOPrEaadlRvafpgBX3sFwWyf1uTcxg","pdfSize":"837753","objectId":"0x82d107526e530bc66f57860e9d88cb4e597f8529c362ad8e2f748cd06161bb55","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
