Namely, they cannot\nbe deformed into axisymmetric stationary vacuum black holes with non-zero\nangular momentum. Other than axisymmetry, no assumptions are made on the\npossible deformations. The phenomenon occurs in particular for those MKN\nsolutions for which the distance along the axis between the two horizon's poles\nis sufficiently small compared to the square root of its area. The MKN\nsolutions, sometimes called periodic Schwarzschild, are physically regular but\nasymptotically Kasner.\n  The static rigidity presented here appears to be the first in the literature\nof General Relativity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
