Super-RDI combines frame selection\nand signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) optimization techniques with a large multi-year\nreference point spread function (PSF) library to achieve optimal PSF\nsubtraction at small angular separations. We compile a $\\sim$7000 frame\nreference PSF library based on a set of 288 new Keck/NIRC2 $L'$ sequences of\n237 unique targets acquired between 2015 and 2019 as part of two planet-search\nprograms, one focusing on nearby young M dwarfs and the other targeting members\nof the Taurus star-forming region. For our dataset, synthetic companion\ninjection-recovery tests reveal that frame selection with the mean-squared\nerror (MSE) metric combined with KLIP-based PSF subtraction using 1000-3000\nframes and $<$500 principal components yields the highest average S/N for\ninjected synthetic companions. We uniformly reduce targets in the young M-star\nsurvey with both Super-RDI and angular differential imaging (ADI). For the\ntypical parallactic angle rotation of our dataset ($\\sim$10$^\\circ$), Super-RDI\nperforms better than a widely used implementation of ADI at separations\n$\\lesssim$0.4\" ($\\approx$5 $\\lambda$/$D$) gaining an average of 0.25 mag in\ncontrast at 0.25\" and 0.4 mag in contrast at 0.15\". This represents a\nperformance improvement in separation space over RDI with single-night\nreference star observations ($\\sim$100 frame PSF libraries) applied to a\nsimilar Keck/NIRC2 dataset in previous work. We recover two known brown dwarf\ncompanions and provide detection limits for 155 targets in the young M-star\nsurvey. Our results demonstrate that increasing the PSF library size with\ncareful selection of reference frames can improve the performance of RDI with\nthe Keck/NIRC2 vortex coronagraph in $L'$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
