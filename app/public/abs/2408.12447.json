Due to the obstacle of computational\ncomplexity, many state-of-the-art models are trained on short time intervals.\nDuring testing, while these models can effectively process information over\nshort time steps, they struggle to maintain consistent perception over\nprolonged time sequences, leading to inconsistencies in the resulting semantic\nsegmentation masks. To address this challenge, we take a step further in this\nwork by leveraging the tracking capabilities of the newly introduced Segment\nAnything Model version 2 (SAM-v2) to enhance the temporal consistency of the\nreferring object segmentation model. Our method achieved a score of 60.40\n\\mathcal{J\\text{\\&}F} on the test set of the MeViS dataset, placing 2nd place\nin the final ranking of the RVOS Track at the ECCV 2024 LSVOS Challenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
