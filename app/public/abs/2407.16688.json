In\nthis article, we determine the local cohomological dimension\n$\\textrm{lcd}(\\mathbb{P}^N,\\Sigma)$ of this embedding, as well as the\ngeneration level of the Hodge filtration on the topmost non-vanishing local\ncohomology module $\\mathcal{H}^{q}_{\\Sigma}(\\mathcal{O}_{\\mathbb{P}^N})$, i.e.,\nwhen $q=\\textrm{lcd}(\\mathbb{P}^N,\\Sigma)$. Additionally, we show that $\\Sigma$\nhas quotient singularities (in which case the equality\n$\\textrm{lcd}(\\mathbb{P}^N,\\Sigma)=\\textrm{codim}_{\\mathbb{P}^N}(\\Sigma)$ is\nknown to hold) if and only if $X\\cong\\mathbb{P}^1$. We also provide a complete\nclassification of $(X,L)$ for which $\\Sigma$ has ($\\mathbb{Q}$-)Gorentein\nsingularities. As a consequence, we deduce that if $\\Sigma$ is a local complete\nintersection, then either $X$ is isomorphic to $\\mathbb{P}^1$, or an elliptic\ncurve.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
