In [11, Theorem\n11] I proved that for finite groups and prime C*-algebras (not necessarily\nseparable), the two notions are equivalent. I also proved that for finite\nabelian groups this is equivalent to other relevant properties of the action\n[11 Theorem 14]. In this paper I add other properties to the list in [11,\nTheorem 14].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
