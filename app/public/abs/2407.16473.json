Popular signing key management services (e.g., custodial\nwallets), however, either introduce a trusted party or burden users with\nmanaging signing key shares, posing the same usability challenges. TEEs\n(Trusted Execution Environments) are a promising technology to avoid both, but\npractical implementations of TEEs suffer from various side-channel attacks that\nhave proven hard to eliminate.\n  This paper explores a new approach to side-channel mitigation through\neconomic incentives for TEE-based cryptocurrency wallet solutions. By taking\nthe cost and profit of side-channel attacks into consideration, we designed a\nStick-and-Carrot-based cryptocurrency wallet, CrudiTEE, that leverages\npenalties (the stick) and rewards (the carrot) to disincentivize attackers from\nexfiltrating signing keys in the first place. We model the attacker's behavior\nusing a Markov Decision Process (MDP) to evaluate the effectiveness of the\nbounty and enable the service provider to adjust the parameters of the bounty's\nreward function accordingly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
