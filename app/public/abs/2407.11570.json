However, the non-intuitive nature of these concepts poses a\nchallenge to understanding them. Here, we present an entangled photon system\nwhich can perform a Bell test, i.e. the CHSH inequality, and can obtain the\ncomplete tomography of the two-photon state. The proposed setup is versatile,\ncost-effective and allows for multiple classroom operating modes. We present\ntwo variants, both facilitating the measurement of Bell inequalities and\nquantum state tomography. Experimental results showcase successful manipulation\nof the quantum state of the photons, achieving high-fidelity entangled states\nand significant violations of Bell's inequalities. Our setup's simplicity and\naffordability enhances accessibility for less specialized laboratories,\nallowing students to familiarize themselves with quantum physics concepts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
