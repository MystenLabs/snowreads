In this paper, a multi task\ndigital twin (DT) VEC network is established. By using DT to develop offloading\nstrategies and resource allocation strategies for multiple tasks of each\nvehicle in a single slot, an optimization problem is constructed. To solve it,\nwe propose a multi-agent reinforcement learning method on the task offloading\nand resource allocation. Numerous experiments demonstrate that our method is\neffective compared to other benchmark algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
