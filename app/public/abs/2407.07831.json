Actually such\nextension fits into a boarder context: the universal construction of a site\ncontaining all continuous maps between topological spaces and whose arrows are\nsmooth in the generalized sense. As an application we prove the existence of\nnon singular generalized tangent vector fields on spheres of any dimension,\nshowing how this result is coherent with the non existence of smooth vector\nfields on spheres of even dimension. Many other applications are outlined or\nsuggested, some of which are under development by the author.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"coshNVYDz0oaKv3xODIJI_lJKkmKiuDzd1Ye_p5YoFk","pdfSize":"1658263"}
