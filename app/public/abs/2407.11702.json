The longtime behaviors has been proved to be governed\nby a spreading-vanishing dichotomy in \\cite{LL}, and when spreading happens,\nthe spreading speed is determined in \\cite{LLW}. In this paper, by constructing\nsome subtle upper and lower solutions, as well as employing some detailed\nanalysis, we improve the results in \\cite{LLW} and obtain the sharp asymptotic\nspreading profiles, which show the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition and\nNeumann boundary condition imposed at the fixed boundary $x=0$ lead to the same\nasymptotic behaviors of $h(t)$ and $(u,v)$ near the spreading front $h(t)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
