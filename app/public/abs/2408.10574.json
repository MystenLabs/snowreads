For CTQW related to our\nforms of multi-dimensional birth and death chains, we obtain the time scaled\nindependence between multiple dimensions about the transition probability of\nCTQW. By using this feature, we analyze CTQW on the path graph, which is\nrelated to 1-dimensional Ehrenfest model. We also have a random variable which\nis related to our models and converges to the standard Gaussian distribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"V7fgZjNuV-Dp5XZ7sflrMiiUgrVnSpW-PX26Mz-Y7Is","pdfSize":"170005"}
