We propose a photonic-based decision-making algorithm to address one\nof the most fundamental problems in MARL, called the competitive multi-armed\nbandit (CMAB) problem. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that chaotic\noscillations and cluster synchronization of optically coupled lasers, along\nwith our proposed decentralized coupling adjustment, efficiently balance\nexploration and exploitation while facilitating cooperative decision-making\nwithout explicitly sharing information among agents. Our study demonstrates how\ndecentralized reinforcement learning can be achieved by exploiting complex\nphysical processes controlled by simple algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
