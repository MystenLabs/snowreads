We construct two neural networks $\nu_{NN}(x;\\theta )$ and $f_{NN}(x;\\psi)$ to approximate the solution $u^{*}(x)$\nand the forcing term $f^{*}(x)$ of the fractional Poisson equation. To optimize\nthese two neural networks, we use the Monte Carlo sampling method mentioned in\nMC-fPINNs and define a new loss function combining measurement data and the\nunderlying physical model. Meanwhile, we present a comprehensive error analysis\nfor this method, along with a prior rule to select the appropriate parameters\nof neural networks. Several numerical examples are given to demonstrate the\ngreat precision and robustness of this method in solving high-dimensional\nproblems up to 10D, with various fractional order $\\alpha$ and different noise\nlevels of the measurement data ranging from 1$\\%$ to 10$\\%$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
