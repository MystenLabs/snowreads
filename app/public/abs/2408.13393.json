It emphasizes the importance of\nex ante prediction accuracy, ensemble approaches, and forecasting not only the\nvalues of the dependent variable but also a function of these values, such as\ntotal income or median loss. It proposes a method for selecting a strategy for\npredicting the vector of functions of the dependent variable using various ex\nante accuracy measures. The final decision is made through voting, where the\ncandidates are prediction strategies and the voters are diverse prediction\nmodels with their respective prediction errors. Because the method is based on\na Monte Carlo simulation, it allows for new scenarios, not previously observed,\nto be considered. The first part of the article provides a detailed theoretical\ndescription of the proposed method, while the second part presents its\npractical use in managing a portfolio of communication insurance. The example\nuses data from the Polish insurance market. All calculations are performed\nusing the R programme.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XCUCPDMeKi4iYfF3cErme2QEA4isdYu7PfaFUT9Aya8","pdfSize":"1774318"}
