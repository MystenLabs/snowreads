Utilizing the\ncovariant form of variation $\\delta g_{MN} = \\nabla_M \\xi_N + \\nabla_N \\xi_M$,\nwe derive the nonlinear transformation rules for the metric fields in the\nunitary gauge. As an off-shell symmetry, diffeomorphism governs the interaction\nstructure by connecting the neighboring orders of bulk action expansions. Our\nanalysis unveils that an on-shell diffeomorphism exists prior to radion\nstabilization, but is broken by the Goldberger-Wise mechanism. This on-shell\nsymmetry enforces a mass-related equation $F'- A' G =0$ to eliminate one degree\nof freedom, while ensuring the 5D action invariant up to a surface term.\nTherefore, we conjecture that the on-shell diffeomorphism actually protects the\nradion field from acquiring mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
