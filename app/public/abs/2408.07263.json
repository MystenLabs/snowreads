Existing traffic analysis\nattacks mainly target TCP/IP layers or are limited to the closed-world\nassumption, where all possible apps and actions have been involved in the model\ntraining. To overcome these limitations, we propose MACPrint, a novel system\nthat infers mobile apps and in-app actions based on WiFi MAC layer traffic in\nthe open-world setting. MACPrint first extracts rich statistical and contextual\nfeatures of encrypted wireless traffic. Then, we develop Label Recorder, an\nautomatic traffic labeling app, to improve labeling accuracy in the training\nphase. Finally, TCN models with OpenMax functions are used to recognize mobile\napps and actions in the open world accurately. To evaluate our system, we\ncollect MAC layer traffic data over 125 hours from more than 40 apps. The\nexperimental results show that MAC-Print can achieve an accuracy of over 96%\nfor recognizing apps and actions in the closed-world setting, and obtains an\naccuracy of over 86% in the open-world setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
