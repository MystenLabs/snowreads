{"id":"2407.16903","title":"US-China perspectives on extreme AI risks and global governance","authors":"Akash Wasil, Tim Durgin","authorsParsed":[["Wasil","Akash",""],["Durgin","Tim",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 23 Jun 2024 17:31:27 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-25","timestamp":1719163887000,"abstract":"  The United States and China will play an important role in navigating safety\nand security challenges relating to advanced artificial intelligence. We sought\nto better understand how experts in each country describe safety and security\nthreats from advanced artificial intelligence, extreme risks from AI, and the\npotential for international cooperation. Specifically, we compiled\npublicly-available statements from major technical and policy leaders in both\nthe United States and China. We focused our analysis on advanced forms of\nartificial intelligence, such as artificial general intelligence (AGI), that\nmay have the most significant impacts on national and global security. Experts\nin both countries expressed concern about risks from AGI, risks from\nintelligence explosions, and risks from AI systems that escape human control.\nBoth countries have also launched early efforts designed to promote\ninternational cooperation around safety standards and risk management\npractices. Notably, our findings only reflect information from publicly\navailable sources. Nonetheless, our findings can inform policymakers and\nresearchers about the state of AI discourse in the US and China. We hope such\nwork can contribute to policy discussions around advanced AI, its global\nsecurity threats, and potential international dialogues or agreements to\nmitigate such threats.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
