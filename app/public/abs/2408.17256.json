After determining the\nnitrogen gas concentration that produces the highest superconducting critical\ntemperature for each process, we characterize the dependence of the critical\ntemperature on film thickness. The optimal nitrogen concentration is higher for\nHiPIMS than for DC sputtering, and HiPIMS produces higher critical temperatures\nfor all thicknesses studied. We attribute this to the HiPIMS process enabling\nthe films to get closer to optimal stoichiometry before beginning to form a\nhexagonal crystal phase that reduces the critical temperature, along with the\nextra kinetic energy in the HiPIMS process enabling greater adatom mobility and\nimproving crystallinity. We also study the effects of an aluminum nitride\nbuffer layer and substrate heating on the critical temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
