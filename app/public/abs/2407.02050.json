The switching capability is facilitated by the phase change\nmaterial and the structure is optimized by machine learning. Our design not\nonly advances the machine-learning-based development of metamaterials but also\nhas the potential to significantly reduce carbon emissions and contribute to\nthe goal of achieving carbon neutrality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
