Consider N people moving between M rooms as follows: at each\nstep, simultaneously, the smartest person in each room moves to a different\nroom of their choice, while no one else moves. The process repeats. Let G(N,M)\nbe the directed graph with vertices representing the M^N possible\nconfigurations and edges representing possible moves. We classify the pairs\n(N,M) such that every configuration can be reached from every other. More\nprecisely, we prove that the graph G(N,M) is strongly connected if and only if\nM>=N+1 (one extra room for maneuvering is both required and sufficient). In the\ncase M<=N, we explicitly describe strongly and weakly connected components.\nProofs are either impossibility arguments, or explicit algorithms based on\nsubgroups generated by derangements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
