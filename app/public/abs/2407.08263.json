In this paper, we first integrate buoyancy and\nhydrodynamics models into a modern Reinforcement Learning framework to reduce\ntraining time. Next, we show how system identification coupled with domain\nrandomization improves the RL agent performance and narrows the sim-to-real\ngap. Real-world experiments for the task of capturing floating waste show that\nour approach lowers energy consumption by 13.1\\% while reducing task completion\ntime by 7.4\\%. These findings, supported by sharing our open-source\nimplementation, hold the potential to impact the efficiency and versatility of\nASVs, contributing to environmental conservation efforts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
