We employ quadrature rules that satisfy the\nMarcinkiewicz--Zygmund property to construct hyperinterpolation for\napproximating the product of the continuous kernel and the solution, in terms\nof spherical harmonics. By leveraging this property, we significantly expand\nthe family of candidate quadrature rules and establish a connection between the\ngeometrical information of the quadrature points and the error analysis of the\nmethod. We then utilize product integral rules to evaluate the singular\nintegral with the integrand being the product of the singular kernel and each\nspherical harmonic. We derive a practical $L^{\\infty}$ error bound, which\nconsists of two terms: one controlled by the best approximation of the product\nof the continuous kernel and the solution, and the other characterized by the\nMarcinkiewicz--Zygmund property and the best approximation polynomial of this\nproduct. Numerical examples validate our numerical analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
