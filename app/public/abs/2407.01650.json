However, for current and\nfuture large surveys like the ZTF, DES, HSC or LSST, the photometric\ncalibration uncertainties are almost comparable to statistical uncertainties in\nthe error budget of type Ia cosmology analysis, which limits our ability to use\ntype Ia supernovae for precision cosmology. The knowledge of the bandpasses of\nthe survey filters at the per-mill level can help reach the sub-percent\nprecision for magnitudes. We show how a misknowledge of the bandpasses central\nwavelengths or of the presence of out-of-band leakages leads to biased\ncosmological measurements. Then, we present how to measure the filter\nthroughputs at the required precision with a Collimated Beam Projector.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kZs6l2Dr4J59zWSuzuVikBokgn6fjnQ-fwEX5lWeQgc","pdfSize":"755787","objectId":"0xc84e25ec962458baf17d9cdaa2176f983c3346408b444d5c68773391bd4a753f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
