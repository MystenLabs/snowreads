The\nstochastic version of the Skorokhod problem replaces $f$ by the paths of\nBrownian motion. It is known that there exists a unique solution to the\nSkorokhod problem if the spectral radius of $|Q|$ is less than 1, where $Q=I-R$\nand $|Q|$ is the matrix whose entries are the absolute values of the\ncorresponding entries of $Q$. The first result of this paper shows pathwise\nuniqueness for the stochastic version of the Skorokhod problem holds if the\nspectral radius of $|Q|$ is equal to 1. The second result of this paper settles\nthe remaining open cases for uniqueness for the deterministic version when the\ndimension $d$ is two.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
