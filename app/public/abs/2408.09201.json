The stationary behaviour of these models changes when model\nparameters are varied, making the study of their phase diagrams particularly\ninteresting. The block approximation method, also known in this context as the\nlocal structure approach, is a powerful tool for studying the main features of\nthese diagrams, improving upon Mean Field results. This work considers systems\nwith multiple stationary states, aiming to understand how their interactions\ngive rise to the structure of the phase diagram. Additionally, it shows how a\nsimple algorithmic implementation of the block approximation allows for the\neffective study of the phase diagram even in the presence of several absorbing\nstates.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
