These stories\nintegrate visual aids, such as highlighted bars and lines in charts, along with\ntextual annotations explaining insights. However, creating such stories\nrequires a deep understanding of the data and meticulous narrative planning,\noften necessitating human intervention, which can be time-consuming and\nmentally taxing. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in various NLP tasks,\ntheir ability to generate coherent and comprehensive data stories remains\nunderexplored. In this work, we introduce a novel task for data story\ngeneration and a benchmark containing 1,449 stories from diverse sources. To\naddress the challenges of crafting coherent data stories, we propose a\nmultiagent framework employing two LLM agents designed to replicate the human\nstorytelling process: one for understanding and describing the data\n(Reflection), generating the outline, and narration, and another for\nverification at each intermediary step. While our agentic framework generally\noutperforms non-agentic counterparts in both model-based and human evaluations,\nthe results also reveal unique challenges in data story generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kmdeL1i96F5qi8_LigJ0mep8BFD5fBOD4dIzU-_oWLQ","pdfSize":"21147061"}
