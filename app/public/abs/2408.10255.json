To overcome these challenges, we\nintroduce the Large Investment Model (LIM), a novel research paradigm designed\nto enhance both performance and efficiency at scale. LIM employs end-to-end\nlearning and universal modeling to create an upstream foundation model capable\nof autonomously learning comprehensive signal patterns from diverse financial\ndata spanning multiple exchanges, instruments, and frequencies. These \"global\npatterns\" are subsequently transferred to downstream strategy modeling,\noptimizing performance for specific tasks. We detail the system architecture\ndesign of LIM, address the technical challenges inherent in this approach, and\noutline potential directions for future research. The advantages of LIM are\ndemonstrated through a series of numerical experiments on cross-instrument\nprediction for commodity futures trading, leveraging insights from stock\nmarkets.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
