Prior research in the digital\nworkplace assistant domain requires users to input their occupation information\nfor effective support. However, as many individuals switch between multiple\noccupations daily, current solutions falter without continuous user input. To\naddress this, this study introduces WorkR, a framework that leverages passive\nsensing to capture pervasive signals from various task activities, addressing\nthree challenges: the lack of a passive sensing architecture, personalization\nof occupation characteristics, and discovering latent relationships among\noccupation variables. We argue that signals from application usage, movements,\nsocial interactions, and the environment can inform a user's occupation. WorkR\nuses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to derive latent features for training\nmodels to infer occupations. Our experiments with an anonymized, context-rich\nactivity and task log dataset demonstrate that our models can accurately infer\noccupations with more than 91% accuracy across six ISO occupation categories.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
