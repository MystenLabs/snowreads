These scenarios are coined as Graph Inverse Problems (GRIP). In this\nwork, we introduce a framework leveraging GNNs to solve GRIPs. The framework is\nbased on a combination of likelihood and prior terms, which are used to find a\nsolution that fits the data while adhering to learned prior information.\nSpecifically, we propose to combine recent deep learning techniques that were\ndeveloped for inverse problems, together with GNN architectures, to formulate\nand solve GRIP. We study our approach on a number of representative problems\nthat demonstrate the effectiveness of the framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
