Berg and Song (2023) introduced a least-squares shape-constrained\nestimation approach for the autocovariance function by projecting an initial\nestimate onto a shape-constrained space using an $\\ell_2$ projection. While the\nleast-squares objective is commonly used in shape-constrained regression, it\ncan be suboptimal due to correlation and unequal variances in the input\nfunction. To address this, we propose a weighted least-squares method that\ndefines a weighted norm on transformed data. Specifically, we transform an\ninput autocovariance sequence into the Fourier domain and apply weights based\non the asymptotic variance of the sample periodogram, leveraging the asymptotic\nindependence of periodogram ordinates. Our proposal can equivalently be viewed\nas estimating a spectral density function by applying shape constraints to its\nFourier series. We demonstrate that our weighted approach yields strongly\nconsistent estimates for both the spectral density and the autocovariance\nsequence. Empirical studies show its effectiveness in uncertainty\nquantification for Markov chain Monte Carlo estimation, outperforming the\nunweighted moment LS estimator and other state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tzXzQv-2KIqJOpQwSH346Q2FNSdk2dBWVIcn7JgYndA","pdfSize":"630569"}
