While the solution-space of this problem is dominated by\nisolated configurations, it is also solvable for a certain range of constraint\ndensity $\\alpha$ and threshold $\\kappa$. We provide in this paper a statistical\nmeasure probing sequences of solutions, where two consecutive elements shares a\nstrong overlap. After simplifications, we test its predictions by comparing it\nto Monte-Carlo simulations. We obtain good agreement and show that connected\nstates with a Markovian correlation profile can fully decorrelate from their\ninitialization only for $\\kappa>\\kappa_{\\rm no-mem.\\, state}$ ($\\kappa_{\\rm\nno-mem.\\, state}\\sim \\sqrt{0.91\\log(N)}$ for $\\alpha=0.5$ and $N$ being the\ndimension of the problem). For $\\kappa<\\kappa_{\\rm no-mem.\\, state}$, we show\nthat decorrelated sequences still exist but have a non-trivial correlations\nprofile. To study this regime we introduce an $Ansatz$ for the correlations\nthat we label as the nested Markov chain.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gmRgolG35XRq4xV047c_bXXN2LoFuxb4Mw3UFNsGMMI","pdfSize":"19653587"}
