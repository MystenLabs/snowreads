The method utilizes the solution to a fourth-order nonlinear PDE\ninvolving the Laplacian for data reconstruction. Evolution equations are\nintroduced to solve this fourth-order nonlinear equation. Numerical experiments\nshow that the new filter preserves discontinuities while filtering out noise.\nThe restored data are piecewise linear and avoid the staircase effect commonly\nobserved with total variation denoising methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
