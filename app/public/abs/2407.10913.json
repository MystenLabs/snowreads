We\nreduce uncertainties compared to our earlier computation by $40\\%$,\narXiv:2002.12347. We perform simulations on finer lattices allowing for an even\nmore accurate continuum extrapolation. We also include a small, long-distance\ncontribution obtained using input from experiments in a low-energy regime where\nthey all agree. Combined with other standard model contributions our result\nleads to a prediction that differs from the measurement of $a_\\mu$ by only 0.9\nstandard deviations. This provides a remarkable validation of the standard\nmodel to 0.37ppm.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
