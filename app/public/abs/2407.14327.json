Drawing on a\nnarrative analysis of three case studies, I find three possible drivers: (1)\nexit to DAO is motivated by both financial and stewardship goals which it\nsimultaneously promises to realize via the issuance of tokens; (2) exit to DAO\nadds an additional layer of ownership and governance rights via tokens, without\nrequiring existing rights to be relinquished, thus making it a lucrative\nstrategy; and (3) markets, laws and social norms underpinning the broader\nenvironment in which exits to DAO occur, seem to play an important role in\ndriving the decision. This paper contributes to the academic literature by\nsituating DAOs as a hybrid (and perhaps incomplete) entrepreneurial exit\nstrategy and identifying plausible drivers of the phenomenon which warrant\nfurther dedicated research.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qlLsip4lLQcrZ96EiPMafzZkRgo_LvRb-bBirjU7PK4","pdfSize":"225790"}
