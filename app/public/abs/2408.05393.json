However, its\nbroader application is often hindered by the substantial computational demands\narising from the non-smooth quantile loss function. In this paper, we introduce\na novel algorithm named fastkqr, which significantly advances the computation\nof quantile regression in reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. The core of\nfastkqr is a finite smoothing algorithm that magically produces exact\nregression quantiles, rather than approximations. To further accelerate the\nalgorithm, we equip fastkqr with a novel spectral technique that carefully\nreutilizes matrix computations. In addition, we extend fastkqr to accommodate a\nflexible kernel quantile regression with a data-driven crossing penalty,\naddressing the interpretability challenges of crossing quantile curves at\nmultiple levels. We have implemented fastkqr in a publicly available R package.\nExtensive simulations and real applications show that fastkqr matches the\naccuracy of state-of-the-art algorithms but can operate up to an order of\nmagnitude faster.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xmCUjGpBRDISAOMbuaFVO1QkrHrwiJ4d6CTQuPrmwe0","pdfSize":"769222"}
