Such quantum-vacuum-induced edge\npolaritons could be achieved in a system of spinful fermionic lattice under\nappropriate interaction with a single photonic mode. In the absence of the\nlight-matter coupling, the system is shown to be topologically trivial, which\nconsequently does not support edge modes. By employing Floquet theory, the\nsystem is also found to be topologically trivial in the classical light limit,\ni.e., at very small light-matter coupling but very large number of photons. On\nthe other hand, by treating both the fermionic and photonic degrees of freedom\nquantum mechanically, the system becomes topologically nontrivial in the full\n(fermionic+photonic) Hilbert space, which manifests itself as a pair of\ntopological (almost) zero energy eigenstates localized near each lattice's edge\nand with very small mean photon number. Finally, the robustness of such\nquantum-vacuum-induced edge polaritons against spatial disorder and\ncounterrotating coupling effect is explicitly demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
