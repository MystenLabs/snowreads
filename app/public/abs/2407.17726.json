Recent advancements\nin data collection techniques have paved the way for enhancing survival\npredictions by integrating information from multiple modalities. However,\nreal-world scenarios often present challenges with incomplete data,\nparticularly when dealing with censored survival labels. Prior works have\naddressed missing modalities but have overlooked incomplete labels, which can\nintroduce bias and limit model efficacy. To bridge this gap, we introduce a\nnovel framework that simultaneously handles incomplete data across modalities\nand censored survival labels. Our approach employs advanced foundation models\nto encode individual modalities and align them into a universal representation\nspace for seamless fusion. By generating pseudo labels and incorporating\nuncertainty, we significantly enhance predictive accuracy. The proposed method\ndemonstrates outstanding prediction accuracy in two survival analysis tasks on\nboth employed datasets. This innovative approach overcomes limitations\nassociated with disparate modalities and improves the feasibility of\ncomprehensive survival analysis using multiple large foundation models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
