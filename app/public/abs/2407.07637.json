In\nthis paper, we focus on point processes living on linear networks and, from\ndistinct points of view, propose several marked summary characteristics that\nare of great use in studying the average association and dispersion of the\nfunction-valued marks. Through a simulation study, we evaluate the performance\nof our proposed marked summary characteristics, both when marks are independent\nand when some sort of spatial dependence is evident among them. Finally, we\nemploy our proposed mark summary characteristics to study the spatial structure\nof urban cycling profiles in Vancouver, Canada.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
