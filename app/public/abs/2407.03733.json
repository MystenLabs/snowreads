We find that a damping value of 0.01 used in the dielectric\nfunction calculation is the optimal for calculating the solar cell efficiency\nof Si. Our calculations indicate that the solar cell efficiency of a 100 {\\mu}m\nthick Si slab is 27.4% while the efficiency of BP for the same thickness is\n2.33% and 1.94% for light polarized along the zigzag and armchair directions,\nrespectively. For 100 nm thick materials, we obtain that Si presents a 0.8%\nsolar cell efficiency and BP exhibits a 0.14% and 1.02% efficiency for light\npolarized along the the zigzag and armchair directions, respectively,\nindicating that BP performs better than Si at these small scales. Our results\nunderscore the important effect of the material thickness on solar cell\nefficiencies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
