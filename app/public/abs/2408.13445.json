Specifically, we leverage simultaneous usage of\nnanostructured subwavelength metamaterial waveguides and excitation of standing\nwave rather than traveling wave whispering gallery mode (WGM) resonances. This\nenables the mode volume to be reduced by factors greater than 10 to 100\ncompared to a diffraction-limited silicon microring resonator. We also\nhighlight how a combination of diffractive mode volume scaling and\nsub-diffractive near-field intensity scaling indicates a lower limit for the\nsub-diffractive all-dielectric mode volume, $V_{\\text{min}}'$, which scales in\nproportion to the mode order times the refractive index raised to the seventh\npower, i.e., $V_{\\text{min}}' \\sim m n^{-7}$. Through both numerical modeling\nand experimental characterization, we systematically investigate the modal\nproperties of metawaveguide ring resonators comprised of Si and SiO$_2$. The\nsub-diffractive devices are experimentally shown to support standing wave\nresonances with high intrinsic quality factors, on the order of $10^4$ to\n$10^5$. These metamaterial ring resonators present a promising WGM platform for\ninterfacing wavelength-scale optics with sub-wavelength matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
