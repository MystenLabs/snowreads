As such, they share\nthe inherent limitations and problems of deep learning, especially regarding\nthe issues of explainability and trustworthiness. We propose $\\mu\\mathcal{G}$,\nan original domain-specific language for the specification of graph neural\nnetworks that aims to overcome these issues. The language's syntax is\nintroduced, and its meaning is rigorously defined by a denotational semantics.\nAn equivalent characterization in the form of an operational semantics is also\nprovided and, together with a type system, is used to prove the type soundness\nof $\\mu\\mathcal{G}$. We show how $\\mu\\mathcal{G}$ programs can be represented\nin a more user-friendly graphical visualization, and provide examples of its\ngenerality by showing how it can be used to define some of the most popular\ngraph neural network models, or to develop any custom graph processing\napplication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
