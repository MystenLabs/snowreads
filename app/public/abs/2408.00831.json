An intriguing conceptual and practical question is whether\njoint quantum measurements on separated systems can be performed without\nbringing them together. Remarkably, by using shared entanglement, this can be\nachieved perfectly when disregarding the post-measurement state. However,\nexisting localization protocols typically require unbounded entanglement. In\nthis work, we address the fundamental question: \"Which joint measurements can\nbe localized with a finite amount of entanglement?\" We develop finite-resource\nversions of teleportation-based schemes and analytically classify all two-qubit\nmeasurements that can be localized in the first steps of these hierarchies.\nThese include several measurements with exceptional properties and symmetries,\nsuch as the Bell state measurement and the elegant joint measurement. This\nleads us to propose a systematic classification of joint measurements based on\nentanglement cost, which we argue directly connects to the complexity of\nimplementing those measurements. We illustrate how to numerically explore\nhigher levels and construct generalizations to higher dimensions and\nmultipartite settings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
