Our solution is mainly based on two\nmethods, BERT and GCN, and combines the reasoning results of BERT and GCN in\nthe final submission to achieve complementary performance. In the BERT\nsolution, we focus on processing the fragments that appear in the references of\nthe paper, and use a variety of operations to reduce the redundant interference\nin the fragments, so that the information received by BERT is more refined. In\nthe GCN solution, we map information such as paper fragments, abstracts, and\ntitles to a high-dimensional semantic space through an embedding model, and try\nto build edges between titles, abstracts, and fragments to integrate contextual\nrelationships for judgment. In the end, our solution achieved a remarkable\nscore of 0.47691 in the competition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
