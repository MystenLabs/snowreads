The nonabelianization map uses\nthe datum of a spectral network on $C$. It gives new formulas for Virasoro\nblocks as regularized Fredholm determinants of integral operators, with kernel\ngiven by an appropriate free-fermion two-point function on $\\widetilde{C}$. The\nnonabelianization map also intertwines with the action of Verlinde loop\noperators, and can be used to construct eigenblocks. This leads to new\nKyiv-type formulas and Fredholm determinant formulas for $\\tau$-functions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
