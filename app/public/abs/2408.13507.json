In this paper,\nwe develop a physical card-based protocol called Tatami printer that can help\nverify solutions of Tatami puzzles. We also use the Tatami printer to construct\nphysical zero-knowledge proof protocols for two such puzzles: Tatamibari and\nSquare Jam. These protocols enable a prover to show a verifier the existence of\nthe puzzles' solutions without revealing them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
