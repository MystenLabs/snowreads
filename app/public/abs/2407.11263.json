As an example, we present the\nsearch for the primordial gravitational waves, based on the evolving DE. The\njoint analysis of recent BICEP/Keck cosmic microwave background (CMB) B-mode\npolarization data with Planck18 CMB, DESI baryon acoustic oscillations and\nPantheonPlus data shows that the bestfit tensor-to-scalar ratio is\n$r_{0.05}\\sim 0.01$, and the lower bound of $r_{0.05}$ is $\\sim 2\\sigma$\nnon-zero.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
