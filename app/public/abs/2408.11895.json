This includes X-ray\ndata from XMM-Newton, NICER, and Swift, and radio detections of FRB 20220912A\nfrom CHIME/Pulsar and Effelsberg. We detect no significant X-ray emission at\nthe time of 30 radio bursts with upper limits on $0.5-10.0$ keV X-ray fluence\nof $(1.5-14.5)\\times 10^{-10}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ (99.7% credible interval,\nunabsorbed) on a timescale of 100 ms. Translated into a fluence ratio\n$\\eta_{\\text{ x/r}} = F_{\\text{X-ray}}/F_{\\text{radio}}$, this corresponds to\n${\\eta}_{\\text{ x/r}} < 7\\times10^{6}$. For persistent emission from the\nlocation of FRB 20220912A, we derive a 99.7% $0.5-10.0$ keV isotropic flux\nlimit of $8.8\\times 10^{-15}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$ (unabsorbed) or an\nisotropic luminosity limit of 1.4$\\times10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at a distance of\n362.4 Mpc. We derive a hierarchical extension to the standard Bayesian\ntreatment of low-count and background-contaminated X-ray data, which allows the\nrobust combination of multiple observations. This methodology allows us to\nplace the best (lowest) 99.7% credible interval upper limit on an FRB\n${\\eta}_{\\text{ x/r}}$ to date, ${\\eta}_{\\text{ x/r}} < 2\\times10^6$, assuming\nthat all thirty detected radio bursts are associated with X-ray bursts with the\nsame fluence ratio. If we instead adopt an X-ray spectrum similar to the X-ray\nburst observed contemporaneously with FRB-like emission from Galactic magnetar\nSGR 1935+2154 detected on 2020 April 28, we derive a 99.7% credible interval\nupper limit on ${\\eta}_{\\text{ x/r}}$ of $8\\times10^5$, which is only 3 times\nthe observed value of ${\\eta}_{\\text{ x/r}}$ for SGR 1935+2154.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
