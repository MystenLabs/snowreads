While useful, an ROC\ncurve can cross the chance line, either by having an S-shape or a hook at the\nextreme specificity. These non-concave ROC curves are sub-optimal according to\ndecision theory, as there are points that are superior than those corresponding\nto the portions below the chance line with either the same sensitivity or\nspecificity. We extend the literature by proposing a novel placement\nvalue-based approach to ensure concave curvature of the ROC curve, and utilize\nBayesian paradigm to make estimations under both a parametric and a\nsemiparametric framework. We conduct extensive simulation studies to assess the\nperformance of the proposed methodology under various scenarios, and apply it\nto a pancreatic cancer dataset.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
