Conventional\nKnowledge Tracing (KT) models have mainly focused on binary responses (i.e.,\ncorrect and incorrect answers) to questions. Unfortunately, they largely\noverlook the essential information in students' actual answer choices,\nparticularly for Multiple Choice Questions (MCQs), which could help reveal each\nlearner's misconceptions or knowledge gaps. To tackle these challenges, we\npropose the Concept map-driven Response disentanglement method for enhancing\nKnowledge Tracing (CRKT) model. CRKT benefits KT by directly leveraging answer\nchoices--beyond merely identifying correct or incorrect answers--to distinguish\nresponses with different incorrect choices. We further introduce the novel use\nof unchosen responses by employing disentangled representations to get insights\nfrom options not selected by students. Additionally, CRKT tracks the student's\nknowledge state at the concept level and encodes the concept map, representing\nthe relationships between them, to better predict unseen concepts. This\napproach is expected to provide actionable feedback, improving the learning\nexperience. Our comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate\nCRKT's effectiveness, achieving superior performance in prediction accuracy and\ninterpretability over state-of-the-art models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"WHVf1FFKM7Jbg-oI1R7qfwqMeTuyTy23e1Na4JnWp7U","pdfSize":"2277485"}
