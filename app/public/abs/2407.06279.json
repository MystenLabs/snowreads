In this respect, Wigner is often\nreferred to as a \"superobserver\" who has the supreme technological ability to\nkeep the friend's laboratory coherent. As such, it is often argued that he has\nthe \"correct\" description of the state. Here we show that the situation is more\nsymmetrical than is usually thought: there are different types of information\nthat each of the observers has that the other fundamentally cannot have - they\nreside in different \"bubbles\" (in Calvalcanti's terminology). While this can\nexplain why the objectivity of the state assignment is only relative to the\nbubble, we consider more elaborated situations in form of a game in which the\nplayers can switch between bubbles. We find that, in certain circumstances,\nobservers may be entitled to adopt and verify the state assignment from another\nbubble if they condition their predictions on all information that is in\nprinciple available to them.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
