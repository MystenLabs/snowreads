We use {\\it network} loops created in a\nphase transition, and {\\it artificial} loops formed by either crossing\nstraight-boosted or curved-static infinite strings. Loops decay via both\nparticle and GW emission, on time scales $\\Delta t_{\\rm dec} \\propto L^p$,\nwhere $L$ is the loop length. For particle production, we find $p \\simeq 2$ for\nartificial loops and $p \\lesssim 1$ for network loops, whilst for GW emission,\nwe find $p \\simeq 1$ for all loops. We find that below a critical length,\nartificial loops decay primarily through particle production, whilst for larger\nloops GW emission dominates. However, for network loops, which represent more\nrealistic configurations, particle emission always dominates, as supported by\nour data with length-to-core ratios up to $L/r_\\text{c} \\lesssim 3500$. Our\nresults indicate that the GW background from a local string network should be\ngreatly suppressed compared to estimations that ignore particle emission.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
