If one\nreplaces $\\mathbb{C}$ with a field $K$ of characteristic $p$, then the\nconclusion fails; we provide numerous examples showing the complexity of the\nproblem over a field of positive characteristic. We advance a modified\nconjecture regarding polynomials $f$ and $g$ which admit two orbits with\ninfinite intersection over a field of characteristic $p$. Then we present\nvarious partial results, along with connections with another deep conjecture in\nthe area, the dynamical Mordell-Lang conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cCRJmvordJQ3CNa5ZkqOOkdznRwZOMJUnsqDpI3unR0","pdfSize":"222919"}
