The Kronecker coefficients and all power formulas of\nirreducible representations of $S_6$ are computed using the character theory of\nfinite groups. In addition, by direct sum decomposition of tensor products of\ndifferent irreducible representations of $S_6$, we characterise generators of\nthe representation ring $\\mathcal{R}(S_6)$, show that its unit group\n$U(\\mathcal{R}(S_6))$ is a Klein four-group and related results on the\nstructure of primitive idempotents. Furthermore, we introduce Harrison center\ntheory to study the representation ring and show that the Harrison center of\nthe cubic form induced by the generating relations of $\\mathcal{R}(S_6)$ is\nisomorphic to itself. Finally, we conclude with some open problems for future\nconsideration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
