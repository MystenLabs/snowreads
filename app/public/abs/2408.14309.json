Recent work on the\nParabolic-Elliptic PKS model have shown that when the repulsion is modeled by a\nnonlinear diffusion term $\\rho \\nabla \\rho^{m-1}$ with $m>2$, this competition\nleads to phase separation phenomena. Furthermore, in some asymptotic regime\ncorresponding to a large population observed over a long enough time, the\ninterface separating regions of high and low density evolves according to the\nHele-Shaw free boundary problem with surface tension. In the present paper, we\nconsider the counterpart of that model, namely the Elliptic-Parabolic PKS model\nand we prove that the same phase separation phenomena occurs, but the motion of\nthe interface is now described (asymptotically) by a volume-preserving\nmean-curvature flow.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"c3fbhjK-fXh2hSAf30cV-ja0MTMBPsVxh-AF1jyzM40","pdfSize":"739205"}
