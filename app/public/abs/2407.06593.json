In this article we\nconstruct an explicit successful non co-adapted coupling of Brownian motions on\n$\\mathbb{G}_n$. We use this construction to obtain gradient inequalities for\nthe heat semi-group on all the homogeneous step $2$ Carnot groups. Comparing\nthe first coupling time and the first exit time from a domain, we also obtain\ngradient inequalities for harmonic functions on $\\mathbb{G}_n$. These results\ngeneralize the coupling strategy by Banerjee, Gordina and Mariano on the\nHeisenberg group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
