SuperBIT acquired multi-band images of\ngalaxy clusters to study the properties of dark matter using weak gravitational\nlensing. We provide an overview of the instrument and its various subsystems.\nWe then present the instrument performance from the flight, including the\ntelescope and image stabilization system, the optical system, the power system,\nand the thermal system. SuperBIT successfully met the instrument's technical\nrequirements, achieving a telescope pointing stability of 0.34 +/- 0.10\narcseconds, a focal plane image stability of 0.055 +/- 0.027 arcseconds, and a\nPSF FWHM of ~ 0.35 arcseconds over 5-minute exposures throughout the 45-night\nflight. The telescope achieved a near-diffraction limited point-spread function\nin all three science bands (u, b, and g). SuperBIT served as a pathfinder to\nthe GigaBIT observatory, which will be a 1.34-meter near-ultraviolet to\nnear-infrared balloon-borne telescope.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MP-DNBYgrrdHg7wROOUi4TZzQgZTxL06J_SAjUA_L38","pdfSize":"2496332"}
