We study the\nasymptotic behavior of the first return time to a small neighborhood of the\nstarting point. We establish results of almost everywhere convergence, and of\nconvergence in distribution with respect to any probability measure absolutely\ncontinuous with respect to the infinite invariant measure. In particular, our\nresults apply to geodesic flows on $\\mathbb{Z}$-cover of compact smooth\nsurfaces of negative curvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
