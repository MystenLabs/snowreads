Distributions of horizontal wind speeds can be fitted to Weibull\ndistributions with shape and scale parameters varying weakly with the vertical\nheight separation. Kullback-Leibler divergences between distributions at\ndifferent heights change with the squared logarithm of the height ratio.\nCross-correlations between time derivates of wind speeds are long-term\nanticorrelated and their correlations functions satisfy sum rules.\nDistributions of horizontal wind speed increments change from a tent-like shape\nto a Gaussian with rising increment lag. A surprising peak occurs in the left\ntail of the increment distributions for lags in a range $10-200\\,{\\rm km}$\nafter applying the Taylor's hypothesis locally to transform time lags into\ndistances. The peak is decisive in order to obtain an expected and observed\nlinear scaling of third-order structure functions with distance. This suggests\nthat it is an intrinsic feature of atmospheric turbulence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
