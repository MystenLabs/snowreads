Indeed, this \"stasis\" behavior has\nbeen found to arise generically in many BSM theories containing large towers of\nstates, and even serves as a cosmological attractor. However, all previous\nstudies of stasis took place within non-thermal environments, or more\nspecifically within environments in which thermal effects played no essential\nrole in realizing or sustaining the stasis. In this paper, we demonstrate that\nstasis can emerge and serve as an attractor even within thermal environments,\nwith thermal effects playing a critical role in the stasis dynamics. Moreover,\nwithin such environments, we find that no towers of states are needed -- a\nsingle state experiencing two-body annihilations will suffice. This work thus\nextends the stasis phenomenon into the thermal domain and demonstrates that\nthermal effects can also generally give rise to an extended stasis epoch, even\nwhen only a single matter species is involved.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
