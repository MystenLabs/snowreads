This is a theory of convexity where the\nambient space is the rational tropicalization of a cluster variety, as opposed\nto an ambient vector space. In this theory, line segments are replaced by\nbroken line segments, and we adopt the notion of convexity in [CMN21]. We state\nand prove broken line convex geometry versions of many standard results from\nusual convex geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
