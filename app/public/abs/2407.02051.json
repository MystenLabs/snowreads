Specifically, we investigate the conditions under which\nthese functions can be uninorms on bounded lattices when $q\\in\n(0,\\mathfrak{e})\\cup I_{\\mathfrak{e}}^{\\varrho}$ and $q\\in\nI_{\\varrho}^{\\mathfrak{e}}$ (or $p\\in (\\mathfrak{e},1)\\cup\nI_{\\mathfrak{e}}^{\\sigma}$ and $p\\in I_{\\sigma}^{\\mathfrak{e}}$), respectively.\nMoreover, some illustrative examples and figures are provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
