This\nstudy addresses the issue of class imbalance, using the `Liking' label in the\nDEAP dataset as an example. Such imbalances are often overlooked by prior\nresearch, which typically focuses on the more balanced arousal and valence\nlabels and predominantly uses accuracy metrics to measure model performance. To\ntackle this issue, we adopt numerical optimization techniques aimed at\nmaximizing the area under the curve (AUC), thus enhancing the detection of\nunderrepresented classes. Our approach, which begins with a linear classifier,\nis compared against traditional linear classifiers, including logistic\nregression and support vector machines (SVM). Our method significantly\noutperforms these models, increasing recall from 41.6\\% to 79.7\\% and improving\nthe F1-score from 0.506 to 0.632. These results highlight the efficacy of AUC\nmaximization via numerical optimization in managing imbalanced datasets,\nproviding an effective solution for enhancing predictive accuracy in detecting\nminority but crucial classes in out-of-sample datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
