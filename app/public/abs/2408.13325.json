Monte\nCarlo molecular simulations of curve-shaped rods show the propensity of such\nshapes to polymorphism revealing both smectic and nematic phases. The nematic\nexhibits a nanoscale modulated local structure characterized by a unique,\npolar, $\\rm{C}_2$-symmetry axis that tightly spirals generating a\nmirror-symmetry-breaking orgnization of the achiral rods-form chirality. A\ncomprehensive characterization of the polarity and its symmetries in the\nnematic phase confirms that the nanoscale modulation violates splay- and\ntwist-bend continuum elasticity. Instead it is shown that, analogous to the\nisotropic-to-nematic transition, entropy stabilizes the roto-translating polar\ndirector in the polar-twisted nematic phase. The conflation of macroscale form\nchirality in ferroelectric nematics with that in the twist-bend nematic stems\nfrom the misattribution of the nanoscale modulation in the lower temperature\nnematic ''$\\rm{N_X}$ phase'' found in CB7CB dimers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
