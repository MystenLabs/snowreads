These bases provide analogs of the dual\ncanonical bases which have long been anticipated in cluster theory. Moreover,\nwhen the generalized Cartan matrices are symmetric, these cluster algebras and\nbases are quasi-categorified.\n  We employ a unified approach based on the flexibility of cluster algebras,\nintroducing and investigating various cluster operations for this purpose.\n  We obtain fruitful byproducts. First, we prove A=U for these quantum cluster\nalgebras. Furthermore, we discover rich structures of the locally compactified\nquantum cluster algebras arising from double Bott-Samelson cells: T-systems,\nstandard bases, Kazhdan-Lusztig type algorithms, and, in type ADE, monoidal\ncategorifications. The monoidal categories appearing are associated with\npositive braids and consist of modules of quantum affine algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
