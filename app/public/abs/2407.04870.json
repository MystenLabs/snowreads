The Glauber dynamics is a simple single-site update Markov chain.\nJerrum (1995) proved an optimal $O(n\\log{n})$ mixing time bound for Glauber\ndynamics whenever $k>2\\Delta$ where $\\Delta$ is the maximum degree of the input\ngraph. This bound was improved by Vigoda (1999) to $k > (11/6)\\Delta$ using a\n\"flip\" dynamics which recolors (small) maximal 2-colored components in each\nstep. Vigoda's result was the best known for general graphs for 20 years until\nChen et al. (2019) established optimal mixing of the flip dynamics for $k >\n(11/6 - \\epsilon ) \\Delta$ where $\\epsilon \\approx 10^{-5}$. We present the\nfirst substantial improvement over these results. We prove an optimal mixing\ntime bound of $O(n\\log{n})$ for the flip dynamics when $k \\geq 1.809 \\Delta$.\nThis yields, through recent spectral independence results, an optimal\n$O(n\\log{n})$ mixing time for the Glauber dynamics for the same range of\n$k/\\Delta$ when $\\Delta=O(1)$. Our proof utilizes path coupling with a simple\nweighted Hamming distance for \"unblocked\" neighbors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
