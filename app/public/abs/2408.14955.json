We explore the GEMINI++ code and estimate its ability to account\nfor the de-excitation processes of highly excited $^{11}$B$^*$ and\n$^{15}$N$^*$, which can be created in the liquid scintillator and water\nCherenkov detectors respectively. It is found that GEMINI++ can not describe\nthe nuclear experimental data of $^{11}$B$^*$ and $^{15}$N$^*$ well. To improve\nits performance for de-excitations of light nuclei, we modify GEMINI++ and then\ndevelop a code of GEMINI++4$\\nu$, which can give the best predictions compared\nwith experimental measurements among some widely used statistical model codes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
