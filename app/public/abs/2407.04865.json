Here, we leverage recent breakthroughs in deep\nlearning to develop a fully differentiable variant of the Gillespie algorithm.\nThe differentiable Gillespie algorithm (DGA) approximates discontinuous\noperations in the exact Gillespie algorithm using smooth functions, allowing\nfor the calculation of gradients using backpropagation. The DGA can be used to\nquickly and accurately learn kinetic parameters using gradient descent and\ndesign biochemical networks with desired properties. As an illustration, we\napply the DGA to study stochastic models of gene promoters. We show that the\nDGA can be used to: (i) successfully learn kinetic parameters from experimental\nmeasurements of mRNA expression levels from two distinct $\\textit{E. coli}$\npromoters and (ii) design nonequilibrium promoter architectures with desired\ninput-output relationships. These examples illustrate the utility of the DGA\nfor analyzing stochastic chemical kinetics, including a wide variety of\nproblems of interest to synthetic and systems biology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ekJLTpKc550w8c5ww8VrhI--W0_H2pHbDWn5qRQXldk","pdfSize":"3282478"}
