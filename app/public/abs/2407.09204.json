By exact diagonalization calculations, we find highly excited\nstates in the middle of the spectrum that display unexpected density\ndistribution and pair correlation. We show that these exceptional excited\nstates contain tightly bound electron bubbles with local filling $\\nu = 1$ that\nform various ordered structures. Remarkably, these bubble excited states are\nshown to exist for both the $1/r$ Coulomb interaction and the $1/r^3$ dipole\ninteraction. The experimental realization of bubble excited states in moir\\'e\nmaterials under a magnetic field is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
