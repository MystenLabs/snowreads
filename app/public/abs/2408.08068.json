To better understand how personal (self-efficacy), social\n(reputational gains, trust between colleagues), and software-related\n(codification effort) variables influence spreadsheet KS intention, we\nconducted a multiple regressions analysis based on survey data from spreadsheet\nusers (\\textit{n}=100) in administrative and finance roles. We found that high\nlevels of spreadsheet self-efficacy and a perception that sharing would result\nin reputational gains predicted higher KS intention, but individuals who found\nknowledge codification effortful showed lower KS intention. We also observed\nthat regardless of occupation, users tended to report a lower sense of\nself-efficacy in their general spreadsheet proficiency, despite also reporting\nhigh self-efficacy in spreadsheet use for job-related contexts. Our findings\nsuggest that acknowledging and designing for these social and personal\nvariables can help avoid situations where experienced individuals refrain\nunnecessarily from sharing, with implications for spreadsheet design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
