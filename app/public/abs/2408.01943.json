Simulating nuclear processes and state preparation poses significant\nchallenges, even for traditional supercomputers. This study demonstrates the\nfeasibility of a complete simulation of a nuclear transition, including the\npreparation of both ground and first excited states. To tackle the complexity\nof strong interactions between two and three nucleons, the states are modeled\non the tritium nucleus. Both the initial and final states are represented using\nquantum circuits with variational quantum algorithms and inductive biases.\nDescribing the spin-isospin states requires four qubits, and a parameterized\nquantum circuit that exploits a total of 16 parameters is initialized. The\nestimated energy has a relative error of approximately 2% for the ground state\nand about 10% for the first excited state of the system. The quantum computer\nsimulation estimates the transition probability between the two states as a\nfunction of the dipole polarization angle. This work marks a first step towards\nleveraging digital quantum computers to simulate nuclear physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-T_zst8ZWfWeobDI6aD9poycjcjRiY4uWbKJX6tUrKo","pdfSize":"1720101"}
