We show that simple ansatze\nfor asymptotically AdS solutions in these systems fully determine the potential\nfor the scalars, and we construct the black hole geometries which generalize\nthe solutions known in gauged supergravities to an arbitrary number of\ndimensions. We also construct branes and brane intersections supported by an\narbitrary number of higher--form fluxes and a correlated number of scalars.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
