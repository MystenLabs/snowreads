We design an integrated bio-economic agent-based model, informed by\nhistorical data from the French agricultural sector, to project future\nbiodiversity trends and evaluate policy interventions. Our model predicts\nfurther biodiversity decline under a business-as-usual scenario, primarily due\nto intensified land consolidation. We evaluate two policy options: reducing\npesticide use and subsidizing small farmers. While pesticide reduction rapidly\nbenefits biodiversity in the beginning, it eventually leads to increased land\nconsolidation and further biodiversity loss. In contrast, subsidizing small\nfarmers by reallocating a small fraction of existing subsidies, stabilizes farm\nsizes and enhances biodiversity in the long run. The most effective strategy\nresults from combining both policies, leveraging pesticide reduction alongside\ntargeted subsidies to balance economic pressures and consistently improve\nbiodiversity.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
