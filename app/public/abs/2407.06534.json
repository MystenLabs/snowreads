It is found that the Lamb shift\nsignificantly alters the energy levels. In particular, it is shown that the\nheat current will approach an upper bound if the Lamb shift isn't considered,\nwhile the heat current will break the upper bound if the Lamb shift is\nconsidered. This finding can deepen our understanding of Lamb shift in the\nquantum thermodynamic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
