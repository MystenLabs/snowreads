Typically, experiments are performed either with a single\nisolated NV center or with an unresolved ensemble of many NV centers, resulting\nin a trade-off between measurement speed and spatial resolution or control over\nindividual defects. In this work, we introduce an experimental platform that\nbypasses this trade-off by addressing multiple optically resolved NV centers in\nparallel. We perform charge- and spin-state manipulations selectively on\nmultiple NV centers from within a larger set, and we manipulate and measure the\nelectronic spin states of 10 NV centers in parallel. Further, we show that the\nhigh signal-to-noise ratio of the measurements enables the detection of\nshot-to-shot pairwise correlations between the spin states of 10 NV centers,\ncorresponding to the simultaneous measurement of 45 unique correlation\ncoefficients. We conclude by discussing how our platform can be scaled to\nparallel experiments with thousands of individually resolved NV centers. These\nresults enable high-throughput experiments with individual spin defects, and\nprovide a natural platform for the application of recently developed correlated\nsensing techniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
