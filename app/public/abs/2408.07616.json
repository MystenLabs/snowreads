We establish that\nthe competitive ratio between the expected optimal performance of the online\ndecision maker compared to that of a prophet, who uses the average of the top\n$\\ell$ items, must be greater than $\\ell/c_{\\ell}$, with $c_{\\ell}$ the\nsolution to an integral equation. We prove that this lower bound is larger than\n$1-1/(\\exp(\\ell)-1)$. This implies that the bound converges exponentially fast\nto $1$ as $\\ell$ grows. In particular, the bound for $\\ell=2$ is $2/c_{2}\n\\approx 0.966$ which is much closer to $1$ than the classical bound of $0.745$\nfor $\\ell=1$. Additionally, the proposed algorithm can be extended to a more\ngeneral scenario, where the decision maker is permitted to select $k$ items.\nThis subsumes the $k$ multi-unit i.i.d. prophet problem and provides the\ncurrent best asymptotic guarantees, as well as enables broader understanding in\nthe more general framework. Finally, we prove a nearly tight competitive ratio\nwhen only static threshold policies are allowed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
