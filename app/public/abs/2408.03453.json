This work introduces\nand evaluates a novel personalized context-aware method for modeling users'\nproxemics preferences during human-robot interactions. Using an interactive\naugmented reality interface, we collected a set of user-preferred distances\nfrom the robot and employed an active transfer learning approach to fine-tune a\nspecialized deep learning model. We evaluated this approach through two user\nstudies: 1) a convenience population study (N = 24) to validate the efficacy of\nthe active transfer learning approach; and 2) a user study involving older\nadults (N = 15) to assess the system's usability. We compared the data\ncollected with the augmented reality interface and with the physical robot to\nexamine the relationship between proxemics preferences for a virtual robot\nversus a physically embodied robot. We found that fine-tuning significantly\nimproved model performance: on average, the error in testing decreased by\n26.97% after fine-tuning. The system was well-received by older adult\nparticipants, who provided valuable feedback and suggestions for future work.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
