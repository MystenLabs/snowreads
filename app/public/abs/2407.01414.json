We achieve\nthis through constructing a style-aware encoder and a well-organized style\ndataset called StyleGallery. With dedicated design for style learning, this\nstyle-aware encoder is trained to extract expressive style representation with\ndecoupling training strategy, and StyleGallery enables the generalization\nability. We further employ a content-fusion encoder to enhance image-driven\nstyle transfer. We highlight that, our approach, named StyleShot, is simple yet\neffective in mimicking various desired styles, i.e., 3D, flat, abstract or even\nfine-grained styles, without test-time tuning. Rigorous experiments validate\nthat, StyleShot achieves superior performance across a wide range of styles\ncompared to existing state-of-the-art methods.
