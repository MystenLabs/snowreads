As an\napplication, we characterize the spherically symmetric metrics of scalar\ncurvature. We construct a Berwald frame for a spherically symmetric Finsler\nsurface and calculate some associated geometric objects. Several examples are\nprovided and discussed. Finally, we give a note on a certain general\n$(\\alpha,\\beta)$-metric that appears in the literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
