We study known (and some new) solutions of the time-symmetric\ninitial-data problem escribing an arbitrary number of those black holes, some\nof them with primary scalar hair. We show how one can distinguish between\ninitial data corresponding to dynamical situations in which the black holes\n(one or many) are not in equilibrium and initial data which are just\nconstant-time slices of a static solution of the full equations of motion\ndescribing static black holes using (self-)interaction energies. For a single\nblack hole, non-vanishing self-interaction energy is always related to primary\nscalar hair and to a dynamical black hole. Removing the self-interaction\nenergies in multi-center solutions we get interaction energies related to the\nattractive and repulsive forces acting on the black holes. As shown by Brill\nand Lindquist, for widely separated black holes, these take the standard\nNewtonian and Coulombian forms plus an additional interaction term associated\nwith the scalar charges which is attractive for like charges.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
