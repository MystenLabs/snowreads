Scr. 99 (2024) 085013] showed that the\ntropospheric stratified fluid flows may be unstable by the effects of the\nnegative temperature gradient and the temperature-dependent density\ninhomogeneity arising from the thermal expansion. They also predicted that the\nmodification in the Brunt-V\\\"ais\\\"al\\\"a frequency by the density inhomogeneity\ncan lead to Rayleigh-B\\'enard convective instability in the tropospheric\nunbounded layers. The purpose of the present work is to revisit the\nRayleigh-B\\'enard convective instability in more detail by considering both\nunbounded and bounded tropospheric layers. We show that the conditions for\ninstability in these two cases significantly differ. The critical values of the\nRaleigh numbers and the expressions for the instability growth rates of thermal\nwaves in the two cases are obtained and analyzed. In the case of the bounded\nregion, we also derive the necessary boundary conditions and note that the\nvertical wave number is quantified, and the corresponding eigenvalue problem is\nwell-set.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"sN6kKUj3eJ5roBMXws3qyEyWHm-FQ-ACj36PL4xwv1o","pdfSize":"700701"}
