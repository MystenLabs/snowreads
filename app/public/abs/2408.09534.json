Conventional CBF approaches often struggle with feasibility issues\nand stringent assumptions when addressing input constraints. Unlike these\nmethods, our approach converts the input-constraint problem into an\noutput-constraint CBF design. This transformation simplifies the Quadratic\nProgramming (QP) formulation and enhances compatibility with the CBF framework.\nWe design an adaptive CBF-based controller to manage the mismatched\nuncertainties introduced by this transformation. Our method systematically\naddresses the challenges of complex, time-varying, and state-dependent input\nconstraints. The efficacy of the proposed approach is validated using numerical\nexamples.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0d1tEH7OqAUYnUVQXjsDi1hETqEjnaFpfmf5s1tBC1c","pdfSize":"670940"}
