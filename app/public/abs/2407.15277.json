We quantify the gap in terms of coverage induced by the correlations in\nthe data (compared to exchangeable data). This gap strongly depends on the\nmixing properties of the underlying Markov chain, and we prove that it\ntypically scales as $\\sqrt{t_\\mathrm{mix}\\ln(n)/n}$ (where $t_\\mathrm{mix}$ is\nthe mixing time of the chain). We also derive upper bounds on the impact of the\ncorrelations on the size of the prediction set. Finally we present $K$-split\nCP, a method that consists in thinning the calibration dataset and that adapts\nto the mixing properties of the chain. Its coverage gap is reduced to\n$t_\\mathrm{mix}/(n\\ln(n))$ without really affecting the size of the prediction\nset. We finally test our algorithms on synthetic and real-world datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
