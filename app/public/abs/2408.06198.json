We identify a family of flat connections coming\nfrom certain solutions to the equations for which the conformal limit exists\nand admits the structure of an oper. We call this new class of opers appearing\nin the conformal limit $\\Theta$-positive opers. The two families involved are\nparameterized by the same base space. This space is a generalization of the\nbase of Hitchin's integrable system in the case when the structure group is a\nsplit real group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
