However, the reliability of its results is challenged by cutoff\nartifacts, which emerge if temperature or chemical potential are of the order\nof the cutoff energy scales. In this work, we generalize an idea from [Braun et\nal. SciPost Phys., 6:056, 2019], which is based on the requirement of\nrenormalization-group (RG) consistency and has successfully been applied to the\ntwo-flavor Quark-Meson-Diquark model, to the NJL model for electrically and\ncolor-neutral three-flavor color-superconducting quark matter. To this end, we\nanalyze the medium divergences of the model and eliminate them by appropriate\ncounterterms, introducing three different schemes. We show that the\nRG-consistent treatment removes the cutoff artifacts of the conventional\nregularization and enables the investigation of CSC matter at higher densities\nby the model. Our studies reveal the emergence of a so-called dSC phase within\nthe melting pattern of the Color-Flavor Locked (CFL) phase at high chemical\npotentials, consistent with earlier Ginzburg-Landau analyses.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
