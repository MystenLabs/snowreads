This paper\npresents a comprehensive case study on the implementation and evaluation of RAG\nfor Arabic text. The work focuses on exploring various semantic embedding\nmodels in the retrieval stage and several LLMs in the generation stage, in\norder to investigate what works and what doesn't in the context of Arabic. The\nwork also touches upon the issue of variations between document dialect and\nquery dialect in the retrieval stage. Results show that existing semantic\nembedding models and LLMs can be effectively employed to build Arabic RAG\npipelines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
