The SELA was designed\nto use open hardware and software, making it widely known by society. The\nsecurity of the auditing process is guaranteed by the application of a\nFingerprint Algorithm, a Hash Function. This system is robust and requires\nminimal modifications to the Electronic Voting Machine. In this paper, SELA is\ndescribed, and its use during the election process is analyzed. A comparison\nbetween SELA and the use of thermal printers as a secondary voting record\nsystem is also presented. The authors recommend a pilot implementation of SELA\nfor the 2002 Brazilian Elections.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"9KnFiSUdTSSPbi9xeg52R2WvVJ0Ps99sFz9XCJz3GrE","pdfSize":"125200"}
