Our objective is to\nconstruct a data-driven model for state estimation without the underlying\ndynamics. Instead of directly modeling the observation operator with noisy\nobservation, we establish the state space model of the denoised observation.\nThrough data assimilation techniques, the denoised observation information\ncould be used to recover the original model state. Takens' theorem shows that\nan embedding of the partial and denoised observation is diffeomorphic to the\nattractor. This gives a theoretical base for estimating the model state using\nthe reconstruction map. To realize the idea, the procedure consists of offline\nstage and online stage. In the offline stage, we construct the surrogate\ndynamics using dynamic mode decomposition with noisy snapshots to learn the\ntransition operator for the denoised observation. The filtering distribution of\nthe denoised observation can be estimated using adaptive ensemble Kalman\nfilter, without knowledge of the model error and observation noise covariances.\nThen the reconstruction map can be established using the posterior mean of the\nembedding and its corresponding state. In the online stage, the observation is\nfiltered with the surrogate dynamics. Then the online state estimation can be\nperformed utilizing the reconstruction map and the filtered observation.\nFurthermore, the idea can be generalized to the nonparametric framework with\nnonparametric time series prediction methods for chaotic problems. The\nnumerical results show the proposed method can estimate the state distribution\nwithout the physical dynamical system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
