First of all, we generalise the notions of overlay\nfunctionals and quotient sets to the case of probability graphons. Furthermore,\nwe characterise the convergence of probability graphons in terms of these\nglobal quantities. In particular, we show the equivalence of these two notions\nof convergence with the unlabelled cut-metric convergence (and thus also with\nthe homomorphism densities convergence and the subgraph sampling convergence).\nIn other words, we prove the equivalence of the 'left convergence' and the\n'right convergence' views on probability graphons convergence, generalising the\ncorresponding result for (real-valued) graphons (the classical continuum\nrepresentation for simple graphs).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
