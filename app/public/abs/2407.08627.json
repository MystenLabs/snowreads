In this work, we study the linear response of the scalar field\ndistribution around a screened (point-like) object subject to a long range\nexternal scalar field perturbation for the Dirac-Born-Infeld theory. We find\nthat, for regular boundary conditions at the position of the particle, some\nmultipoles have vanishing response for a lacunar series of the multipole order\n$\\ell$ for any dimension. Some multipoles also exhibit a logarithmic running\nwhen the number of spatial dimensions is even. We construct a ladder operator\nstructure, with its associated ladder symmetries, formed by two sets of ladders\nthat are related to the properties of the linear response and the existence of\nconserved charges. Our results exhibit a remarkable resemblance with the Love\nnumbers properties of black holes in General Relativity, although some\nintriguing differences subsist.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
