Here, we investigate skewness sensitivity of T-odd\nleading twist GTMDs considering a momentum transfer to longitudinal as well as\ntransverse direction and present a detailed study of the spin-transverse\nmomentum correlation through Sivers and Boer-Mulders Wigner Distributions in\nboost invariant longitudinal position space. The $\\sigma$-space distributions\nof T-odd sector show oscillatory patterns sensitive to square of the total\nmomentum transfer $-t$, analogous to the diffraction scattering of wave in\nOptics. An additional effect on the diffraction pattern is reported caused by\ninterference between transverse momentum transfer $\\bfd$ to the transverse\nmomentum $\\bfp$ of quarks.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
