Unlike\ntraditional computational approaches that struggle with the computational\nintensity and complexity of such problems, our method offers a robust,\nefficient, and accurate solution mechanism, using a physics inspired design of\nthe learning structure. We demonstrate that the proposed physics-guided\noperator learning method (FIE-NO) achieves superior performance in addressing\nBVPs. Notably, our approach can generalize across multiple scenarios, including\nthose with unknown equation forms and intricate boundary shapes, after being\ntrained only on one boundary condition. Experimental validation demonstrates\nthat the FIE-NO method performs well in simulated examples, including Darcy\nflow equation and typical partial differential equations such as the Laplace\nand Helmholtz equations. The proposed method exhibits robust performance across\ndifferent boundary conditions. Experimental results indicate that FIE-NO\nachieves higher accuracy and stability compared to other methods when\naddressing complex boundary value problems with varying numbers of interior\npoints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
