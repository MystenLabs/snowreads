Through comprehensive experimentation, we investigate\nthe impact of various adversarial attack strategies on model performance\nmetrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Our findings,\nhighlighting how prone those techniques are to simple attacks, are alarming,\nand the inconsistency in the attacks' effect on different algorithms promises\nways for attack mitigation. We examine the effectiveness of different\nmitigation strategies, including adversarial training and enhanced feature\nselection, in enhancing model robustness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Q3NHNwMkUU9oyB8BUKvccyOSA7qsPBCkOzwNt9ZxPFw","pdfSize":"402196"}
