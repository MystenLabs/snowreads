Chemistry is crucial for understanding the\ndriving mechanism and dynamics of the outflow, as it is the small-scale\nchemical process of dust formation that launches the large-scale stellar\noutflow. However, exactly how dust condenses from the gas phase and grows is\nstill unknown: an astrochemical problem with consequences for stellar\nevolution. Disagreements between observations and the predictions of chemical\nmodels drive the development of these models, helping to understand the link\nbetween dynamics and chemistry and paving the way to a 3D hydrochemical model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
