Each of these two\nflows has a unique global solution. In particular, these global existence and\nuniqueness results do not require an exit condition proposed by Bai et al in a\nrecent work [2]. As applications, these two Ricci flows are applied to\ncommunity detection for complex networks, including Karate Club, American\nfootball games, Facebook, as well as artificial networks. In our algorithms,\nunlike in [5,15], there is no need to perform surgery at every iteration, only\none surgery needs to be performed after the last iteration. From three commonly\nused criteria for evaluating community detection algorithms, ARI, NMI and Q, we\nconclude that our algorithms outperform existing algorithms, including\nOllivier's Ricci flow [5], normalized Ollivier's Ricci flow and normalized\nLin-Lu-Yau's Ricci flow [15].
