We prove a rigid Hawking singularity theorem\nfor positive cosmological constant, which sharpens known results. In\nparticular, it implies that any spacetime with $\\operatorname{Ric} \\geq -ng$ in\ntimelike directions and containing a compact Cauchy hypersurface with mean\ncurvature $H \\geq n$ is timelike incomplete. We also study the properties of\ncosmological time and volume functions, addressing questions such as: When do\nthey satisfy the regularity condition? When are the level sets Cauchy\nhypersurfaces? What can one say about the mean curvature of the level sets?\nThis naturally leads to consideration of Hawking type singularity theorems for\nCauchy surfaces satisfying mean curvature inequalities in a certain weak sense.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
