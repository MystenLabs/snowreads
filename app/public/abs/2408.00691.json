However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties\nhas been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study\nintroduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT),\nwhich efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states.\nThis approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the\nquantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic\nenergy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the\ncorrelations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying\nspectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay\nin the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong\ncorrelations between the NMEs of $0\\nu\\beta\\beta$ decay and the excitation\nenergy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although\nthese correlations vary significantly among nuclei. The Bayesian analysis\nyields the NMEs $4.34^{+0.09}_{-0.10}$ for $^{136}$Xe and\n$5.51^{+0.24}_{-0.26}$ for $^{150}$Nd. This work also paves the way for\nrefining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
