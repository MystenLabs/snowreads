We also investigated\nthe rotational magnetocaloric effect and evaluated an entropy change in this\nphase pocket. The present findings demonstrate that multipole degrees of\nfreedom give rise to a magnetic-field-induced exotic order in\nPrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$, suggesting the possibility of switching between the order\nparameters or emergence of a multiple-$q$ order of quadrupoles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PFHmh5bF_89nwabJ4bIY0uUwwEhw3XqPSGcYegCripE","pdfSize":"874989"}
