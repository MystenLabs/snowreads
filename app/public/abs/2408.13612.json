However, the presence of anisotropic cosmic birefringence\ncan bias the reconstructed CMB lensing power spectrum using CMB polarization\nmaps, particularly at small scales, and affect the constraints on these\nparameters. Upcoming experiments, which will be dominated by the polarization\nlensing signal, are especially susceptible to this bias. We identify the\ndominant contribution to this bias as an $N_L^{(1)}$-like noise, caused by\nanisotropic rotation instead of lensing. We show that, for an CMB-S4-like\nexperiment, a scale-invariant anisotropic rotation field with a standard\ndeviation of 0.05 degrees can suppress the small-scale lensing power spectrum\n($L\\gtrsim 2000$) at a comparable level to the effect of massive neutrino with\n$\\sum_i m_{\\nu_{i}}=50~\\rm{meV}$, making rotation field an important source of\ndegeneracy in neutrino mass measurement for future CMB experiments. We provide\nan analytic expression and a simulation-based estimator for this\n$N_L^{(1)}$-like noise, which allows for efficient forecasting and mitigation\nof the bias in future experiments. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of a\nnon-scale-invariant rotation power spectrum on the reconstructed lensing power\nspectrum and find that an excess of power in the small-scale rotation power\nspectrum leads to a larger bias. Our work provides an effective numeric\nframework to accurately model and account for the bias caused by anisotropic\nrotation in future CMB lensing measurements.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"SzTNCyKF0cGEETILJgakEO6NNUSi9PM27OSxCYRoUxk","pdfSize":"546802"}
