We performed the density functional theory DFT\ncalculations under the mBJ-GGA approximation. In addition, we applied the\nnorm-conserving pseudo-potentials without spin-orbit coupling (SOC)\napproximations. In addition, we used the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof generalized\ngradient approximation (GGA-PBE) to deduce the physical properties of these\nalloys. Moreover, the Time-Dependent Density Functional Theory (TDDFT) method\nhas been performed to deduce the optical properties, in an excited state, of\nthe studied Sodium Based Cubic Fluoro-perovskites: NaBF$_3$ (B= Ca, Mg or Zn)\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
