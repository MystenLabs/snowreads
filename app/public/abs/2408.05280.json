Addressing the challenge of inhomogeneous frequency shifts in\nsuch systems, our scheme mitigates primary contributors, namely the electric\nquadrupole shift (QPS) and the linear Zeeman shift (LZS). Based on\n$^{88}$Sr$^+$ ions, we implement a QCDD scheme in linear chains of up to 7 ions\nand demonstrate a significant suppression of the shift by more than three\norders of magnitude, leading to relative frequency inhomogeneity below\n$7\\cdot10^{-17}$. Additionally, we evaluate the associated systematic shift\narising from the radiofrequency (RF) drive used in the QCDD scheme, showing\nthat, in the presented realization, its contribution to the systematic relative\nfrequency uncertainty is below $10^{-17}$, with potential for further\nimprovement. These results provide a promising avenue toward implementing\nmulti-ion clocks exhibiting an order of magnitude or more improvement in\nstability while maintaining a similar high degree of accuracy to that of\nsingle-ion clocks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
