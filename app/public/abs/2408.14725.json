It turns\nout that a moon of less than a third of the lunar mass was capable of producing\na sufficient initial triaxiality. The asymmetry of the initial tidal shape of\nthe equator depends on timing: the initial asymmetry is much stronger if the\nsynchronous moon shows up already at the magma-ocean stage. From the moment of\nsynchronisation of Mars' rotation with the moon's orbital motion, and until the\nmoon was eliminated (as one possibility, by an impact in the beginning of the\nLHB), the moon was sustaining an early value of Mars' rotation rate.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SA91QeL_WfZUHHjW-Ep5_TsuPx0CRrvT9SE1HocrSro","pdfSize":"417505"}
