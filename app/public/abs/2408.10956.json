In\ntype $A$, we introduce equivariantly deformed symmetric functions called the\nK-theoretic double $k$-Schur functions as the Schubert bases. The functions are\nconstructed by Demazure operators acting on equivariant parameters. As an\napplication, we provide a Ginzburg-Peterson type realization of the\ntorus-equivariant K-homology ring of $\\mathrm{Gr}_{{SL}_n}$ as the coordinate\nring of a centralizer family for $PGL_n(\\mathbb{C})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
