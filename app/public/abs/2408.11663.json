However, the selection\nof appropriate systems to implement such photonic devices remains a topic of\ndebate. In this work, we demonstrate that a perovskite crystal, characterized\nby its easy and low-cost manufacturing, when placed between two distributed\nBragg reflectors with an air gap, can form a natural double microcavity. This\nconstruction shows promising properties for the realisation of novel, tunable\nnon-Hermitian photonic devices through strong light-matter coupling. We reveal\nthat such a system exhibits double-coupled polariton modes with dispersion\nincluding multiple inflection points. Owing to its non-Hermiticity, our system\nexhibits nonreciprocal properties and allows for the observation of exceptional\npoints. Our experimental studies are in agreement with the theoretical analysis\nbased on coupled mode theory and calculations based on transfer matrix method.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
