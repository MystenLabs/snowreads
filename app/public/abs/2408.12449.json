These decentralized approaches come with their own tradeoffs,\nand therefore multiple architectures exist. In this paper, we conduct the first\nlarge-scale analysis of Bluesky, a prominent decentralized microblogging\nplatform. In contrast to alternative approaches (e.g. Mastodon), Bluesky\ndecomposes and opens the key functions of the platform into subcomponents that\ncan be provided by third party stakeholders. We collect a comprehensive dataset\ncovering all the key elements of Bluesky, study user activity and assess the\ndiversity of providers for each sub-components.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
