In this work,\nwe describe an optical testbed that enables simultaneous measurements of\ntransmission and reflection properties of various radiation absorbing\ndielectric materials, essential components in the reduction of undesired\noptical loading. To demonstrate the performance of the testbed, we have\nmeasured the reflection response of five absorbers commonly used for such\napplications: TKRAM, carbon- and iron-loaded Stycast, HR10, AN72, and an\nin-house 3D printed absorber across a frequency range of 100 to 500 GHz, for\nboth S- and P-polarization, with incident angles varying from 15 to 45 degrees.\nWe present results on both the specular and scattered reflection response of\nthese absorbers.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sUe3IPLZ07kcqWseI_GhRMqpiEaUe7Isv_7xcKrWuDs","pdfSize":"1068519"}
