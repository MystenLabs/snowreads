We refer to them as spherical\nFourier multipliers. We study certain sufficient conditions under which they\nare bounded. Then, under the hypothesis of compactness of the underlying group\nand under certain summability conditions, we obtain the belonging of the\nspherical Fourier multipliers to some Schatten-von Neumann classes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
