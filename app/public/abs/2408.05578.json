The case of zero\non-site Coulomb interaction in the thermodynamic limit, confirms this mechanism\nthrough the analytical solution. In this study, we go further and\nsystematically investigate this mechanism for a strongly correlated fermionic\nHubbard model, now with finite on-site interaction, on a square lattice with an\nextended set of hopping parameters. We explore the behaviors of different\npairing channels when one of them is suppressed, utilizing density matrix\nrenormalization group calculations. Our findings provide numerical evidence\nsupporting the existence of \\emph{order by projection} in the strongly\ncorrelated system we studied. We also investigate the effect of the strength of\nHubbard $U$, next-nearest neighbor $t'$, hole-doping, as well as finite-size\nscaling approaching the thermodynamic limit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
