For the smooth Wasserstein distance, an error bound between two\ntempered stable distributions is also derived. As examples, we discuss the\napproximation of a tempered stable to normal and variance gamma distributions.\nAs corollaries, the corresponding limit theorem follows\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
