Using the frame of toroidal and\npoloidal fields we construct the othogonal decomposition of the Stokes\neigenvalue problem in problems for toroidal and poloidal eigenfunctions. This\nprovides the proof of the completeness of a system of explicitly calculated\nStokes eigenfunctions given by one of the authors in 1999, [14].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
