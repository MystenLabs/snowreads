Experiments were conducted using this\nplatform to optimize plasma discharge parameters and procedures specific to\ncopper cavities. The results indicate that the \"Ar/O + Ar/H method\"\nsignificantly enhances the work function of the copper surface while reducing\nfield enhancement effects induced by surface burrs. Consequently, this study\nconfirms that in-situ plasma cleaning effectively mitigates field emission\nwithin copper cavities, thereby enhancing the stability and acceleration\ngradient of the accelerator system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
