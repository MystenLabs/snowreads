In\nconventional models, the field oscillation during the recombination epoch leads\nto a cancellation of the birefringence effect and significantly suppresses the\nEB spectrum of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization. By\nintroducing an asymmetric potential to the axion, this cancellation becomes\nincomplete, and a substantial EB spectrum can be produced. This mechanism also\nresults in a washout of the EE spectrum, which can be probed in future CMB\nobservations. Our findings suggest the possibility that an axion-like field\nresponsible for isotropic cosmic birefringence can also account for a\nsignificant fraction of dark matter.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
