For the reanalysis grid node closest to the observatory, vertical\nprofiles of the structural constant of the air refractive index turbulent\nfluctuations $C^2_n$ were obtained. The calculated $C^2_n(z)$ vertical profiles\nare compared with the vertical distribution of turbulence intensity obtained\nfrom tomographic measurements with Shack-Hartmann sensor. The Fried parameter\nr0 at the location of Terskol Peak Observatory was estimated. Using combination\nof atmospheric models and scheme paramaterization of turbulence, $C^2_n(z)$\nprofiles at Mt. Kurapdag were obtained. The r0 values at the Peak Terskol\nObservatory are compared with estimated values of this length at the ten\nastronomical sites including Ali, Lenghu and Daocheng.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l1C_NKKftVMSz-CnQwYKdpySsceOO-90RGCXsQGs8W0","pdfSize":"7099451"}
