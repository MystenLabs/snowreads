Its\ncomplementary set, when Dirac cones are absent, is the set of magic angles. We\nshow the stability of magic angles obtained in the chiral limit by\ndemonstrating that the perfectly flat bands transform into quadratic band\ncrossings when perturbing away from the chiral limit. Moreover, using the\ninvariance of Euler number, we show that at magic angles there are more band\ncrossings beyond these quadratic band crossings. This is the first result\nshowing the existence of magic angles for the full Bistritzer--MacDonald\nHamiltonian and solves Open Problem No.2 proposed in the recent survey\narXiv:2310.20642.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
