The existing solution involves fine-tuning LLMs, which\nresults in significant time and computational resource consumption. This paper\nproposes a method that enables LLMs to achieve stable tool calling capabilities\nusing only prompt engineering and some ingenious code design. We conducted\nexperiments on multiple LLMs that lack tool calling capabilities across various\ntool calling tasks, achieving a success rate of 100%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
