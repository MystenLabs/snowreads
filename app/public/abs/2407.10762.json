For this purpose, a Neural Radiance Field is trained from synthetic\nimages and exploited to generate an augmented set. Our method enriches the\ninitial set by enabling the synthesis of images with (i) unseen viewpoints,\n(ii) rich illumination conditions through appearance extrapolation, and (iii)\nrandomized textures. We validate our augmentation method on the challenging\nuse-case of spacecraft pose estimation and show that it significantly improves\nthe pose estimation generalization capabilities. On the SPEED+ dataset, our\nmethod reduces the error on the pose by 50% on both target domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
