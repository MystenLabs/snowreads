Betti matching loss builds on techniques from\ntopological data analysis, specifically persistent homology. A major challenge\nis the computational cost of computing persistence barcodes. In response to\nthis challenge, we propose a new, highly optimized implementation of Betti\nmatching, implemented in C++ together with a python interface, which achieves\nsignificant speedups compared to the state-of-the-art implementation Cubical\nRipser. We use Betti matching 3D to train segmentation networks with the Betti\nmatching loss and demonstrate improved topological correctness of predicted\nsegmentations across several datasets.
