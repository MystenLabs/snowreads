For this to happen, we argue that there is a strong need to\nappl LLMs for the mobile ecosystem. We therefore provide a research roadmap for\nguiding our fellow researchers to achieve that as a whole. In this roadmap, we\nsum up six directions that we believe are urgently required for research to\nenable native intelligence in mobile devices. In each direction, we further\nsummarize the current research progress and the gaps that still need to be\nfilled by our fellow researchers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
