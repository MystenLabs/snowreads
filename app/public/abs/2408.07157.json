In this setting, the primary sensor experiences a higher noise\nintensity in tracking the object than the source sensor. To improve the\nestimation accuracy of the primary sensor, we propose a framework that\nintegrates Bayesian transfer learning into an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) and\na Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF). In this approach, the parameters of the\npredicted observations in the source sensor are transferred to the primary\nsensor and used as an additional prior in the filtering process. Our simulation\nresults show that the transfer learning approach significantly outperforms the\nconventional isolated UKF and CKF. Comparisons to a form of measurement vector\nfusion are also presented.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
