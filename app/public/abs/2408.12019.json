In\nanalogy with orthogonality in the Euclidean space $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a\nwell-studied notion of \"ultrametric orthogonality\" in $\\mathcal{K}^n$. In this\npaper, motivated by a question of Erd{\\H{o}}s in the real case, given integers\n$k \\geq \\ell \\geq 2$, we investigate the maximum size of a subset $S \\subseteq\n\\mathcal{K}^n \\setminus\\{{\\bf 0}\\}$ satisfying the following property: for any\n$E \\subseteq S$ of size $k$, there exists $F \\subseteq E$ of size $\\ell$ such\nthat any two distinct vectors in $F$ are orthogonal. Other variants of this\nproperty are also studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-pMjmD2KUVEX6ybVuxxGgLDhekEsXIloEA1plamFF_w","pdfSize":"306993"}
