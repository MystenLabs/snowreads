Our\nmodel consists of a light pseudoscalar and an extra Higgs doublet in addition\nto the field content of the Standard Model. We consider a landscape of vacua\nwith varying values of the electroweak vacuum expectation value (VEV). The\nvacuum energy in our model peaks in a region of the landscape where the\nelectroweak VEV is non-zero and much smaller than the cutoff. During inflation,\ndue to exponential expansion, such regions of the landscape with maximal vacuum\nenergy, dominate the universe in volume, thus explaining the smallness of the\nelectroweak scale with respect to the cutoff. The pseudoscalar potential in our\nmodel is that of a completely generic pseudogoldstone boson$-$not requiring the\nclockwork mechanism$-$and its field value never exceeds its decay constant or\nthe Planck scale. Our mechanism is robust to the variation of other model\nparameters in the landscape along with the electroweak VEV. It also predicts a\nprecise and falsifiable relationship between the masses and couplings of the\ndifferent Higgs boson mass-eigenstates. Moreover, the pseudoscalar in our model\ncan account for the observed dark matter relic density.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
