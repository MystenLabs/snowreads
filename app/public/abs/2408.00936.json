Compared with RF bunchers, magnetic compressors do not\nintroduce additional timing jitter and can be configured to minimize timing\njitter due to upstream energy fluctuation. In this work we discuss the\nprinciples of designing magnetic compressors for MeV-UED. Start-to-end\nsimulation of a dogleg compressor is presented. Results show a bunch length of\n11 fs and arrival time jitter of 8 fs can be achieved at 100 fC charge with\nsmall emittance growth.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kQSjPh-CeGB46C_IW5dW43xJEtys4pbHL7ilr1L0XL0","pdfSize":"752374"}
