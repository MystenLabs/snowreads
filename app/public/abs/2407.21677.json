Here we prove a sharp stability inequality for the standard\nlens; hence strengthening the local minimality of the lens partition in a\nquantitative form. As an application of this stability result we consider a\nnonlocal perturbation of an isoperimetric problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
