Despite O-RAN's\nefforts, the creation of xApps remains a complex and time-consuming endeavor,\naggravated by the sometimes fragmented, outdated, or deprecated documentation\nfrom the O-RAN Software Community (OSC). These challenges hinder academia and\nindustry from developing and validating solutions and algorithms on O-RAN\nnetworks. This tutorial addresses this gap by providing the first comprehensive\nguide for developing xApps to manage the O-RAN ecosystem from theory to\npractice. We provide a thorough theoretical foundation of the O-RAN\narchitecture and detail the functionality offered by Near Real-Time RAN\nIntelligent Controller (Near-RT RIC) components. We examine the xApp design and\nconfiguration. We explore the xApp lifecycle and demonstrate how to deploy and\nmanage xApps on a Near-RT RIC. We address the xApps' interfaces and\ncapabilities, accompanied by practical examples. We provide comprehensive\ndetails on how xApps can control the RAN. We discuss debugging strategies and\ngood practices to aid the xApp developers in testing their xApps. Finally, we\nreview the current landscape and open challenges for creating xApps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
