The competition comprises three sub-challenges: Valence\nArousal (VA) estimation, Expression (Expr) classification, and Action Unit (AU)\ndetection. To tackle these challenges, we employ state-of-the-art models to\nextract powerful visual features. Subsequently, a Transformer Encoder is\nutilized to integrate these features for the VA, Expr, and AU sub-challenges.\nTo mitigate the impact of varying feature dimensions, we introduce an affine\nmodule to align the features to a common dimension. Overall, our results\nsignificantly outperform the baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
