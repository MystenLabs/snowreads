The GLCT enables\nadjustable smoothing modes, enhancing alignment with graph signals. Leveraging\ntraditional fractional domain time-frequency analysis, we investigate\nvertex-frequency analysis in the graph linear canonical domain, aiming to\novercome limitations in capturing local information. Filter design methods,\nincluding optimal design and learning with stochastic gradient descent, are\nanalyzed and applied to image classification tasks. The proposed GLCT and\nvertex-frequency analysis present innovative approaches to signal processing\nchallenges, with potential applications in various fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
