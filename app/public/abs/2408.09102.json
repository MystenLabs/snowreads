The construction uses a pair of\nbitangents of the quartics. We prove that the higher Chow cycles generate a\nrank 2 subgroup in the indecomposable part of the higher Chow group for very\ngeneral members, by using a specialization argument and an explicit computation\nof the regulator map.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E1fsppoDEpCyV_I7fdUfB-QwcrgfPBY8TcwqqRQjAJU","pdfSize":"1051305"}
