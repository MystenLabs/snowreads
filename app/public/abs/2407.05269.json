To date, there is no fundamental\nunderstanding of how geometrical confinement orchestrates active turbulence and\nalters its physical properties. Here, by combining large-scale experiments,\ncomputer modeling, and analytical theory, we have discovered a generic sequence\nof transitions occurring in bacterial suspensions confined in cylindrical wells\nof varying radii. With increasing the well's radius, we observed that\npersistent vortex motion gives way to periodic vortex reversals, four-vortex\npulsations, and then well-developed active turbulence. Using computational\nmodeling and analytical theory, we have shown that vortex reversal results from\nthe nonlinear interaction of the first three azimuthal modes that become\nunstable with the radius increase. The analytical results account for our key\nexperimental findings. To further validate our approach, we reconstructed\nequations of motion from experimental data. Our findings shed light on the\nuniversal properties of confined bacterial active matter and can be applied to\nvarious biological and synthetic active systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
