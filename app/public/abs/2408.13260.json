A variety of approaches have been\nused to explore the concept of domination in fuzzy graphs. This study uses the\nconcept of strong domination, considering the weights of the strong edges. We\nintroduce the strong-neighbors Roman domination number of a fuzzy graph and\nestablish some correlations with the Roman domination in graphs. The\nstrong-neighbors Roman domination number is determined for specific fuzzy\ngraphs, including complete and complete bipartite fuzzy graphs. Besides,\nseveral general bounds are given. In addition, we characterize the fuzzy graphs\nthat reach the extreme values with particular attention to fuzzy strong cycles\nand paths.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
