Assuming a certain invariant $\\eta(A) \\in\n\\mathrm{Pic}(\\mathfrak{C})[2]$ vanishes, and fixing a certain choice of signs,\nwe show that there is a universal tensor functor $\\Phi \\colon \\mathfrak{C} \\to\n\\mathfrak{D}$ for which $\\Phi(A)$ splits. We apply this when\n$\\mathfrak{C}=\\underline{\\mathrm{Rep}}(\\mathbf{Sp}_t(\\mathbf{F}_q))$ is the\ninterpolation category of finite symplectic groups and $A$ is a certain twisted\ngroup algbera in $\\mathfrak{C}$, and we show that the splitting category\n$\\mathfrak{D}$ is S. Kriz's interpolation category of the oscillator\nrepresentation. This construction has a number advantages over previous ones;\ne.g., it works in non-semisimple cases. It also brings some conceptual clarity\nto the situation: the existence of Kriz's category is tied to the\nnon-triviality of the Brauer group of $\\mathfrak{C}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
