The adiabatic hyperspherical representation is\nutilized to solve the $N$-body Schr$\\ddot{\\mathrm{o}}$dinger equation for the\nthree- and four-body systems, treating both $^{6}{\\mathrm{He}}$ and\n$^{7}{\\mathrm{He}}$ nuclei. A simplified central potential model for the\n$^{4}{\\mathrm{He}}-n$ interaction is used in conjunction with a spin-dependent\nthree-body interaction to reproduce $^{6}{\\mathrm{He}}$ bound-state and\nresonance properties as well as properties for the $^{8}{\\mathrm{He}}$ nucleus\nin its ground-state. With this Hamiltonian, the adiabatic hyperspherical\nrepresentation is used to compute bound and scattering states for both\n$^{6}{\\mathrm{He}}$ and $^{7}{\\mathrm{He}}$ nuclei. For the $^{6}{\\mathrm{He}}$\nsystem, the electric quadrupole transition between the $0^{+}$ and $2^{+}$\nstate is investigated. For the $^{7}{\\mathrm{He}}$ system,\n$^{6}{\\mathrm{He}}+n$ elastic scattering is investigated along with the\nfour-body recombination process\n$^{4}{\\mathrm{He}}+n+n+n\\rightarrow$$^{6}{\\mathrm{He}}+n$ and breakup process\n$^{6}{\\mathrm{He}}+n\\rightarrow$$^{4}{\\mathrm{He}}+n+n+n$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
