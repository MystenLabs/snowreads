Woolhouse formulated the Cotton-Spinning problem. This problem\nboils down to the following. A piecer works at a spinning mule and walks back\nand forth to repair broken threads. The question is how far the piecer is\nexpected to walk when the threads break at random. This problem can neatly be\nsolved using process modelling and quantitative model checking, showing that\nWoolhouse's model led to an overestimation of the walking distance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
