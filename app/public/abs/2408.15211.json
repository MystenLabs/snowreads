As climate\nchange accelerates and its impacts become increasingly severe, the need for\nsustainable and resilient socioeconomic systems is increasingly pressing. In\nresponse to this global challenge, the ten articles of this special issue seek\nto explore how advances in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science can drive\nthe energy transition and enhance environmental sustainability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"UanMrfUi9q6biuootirywh7srh4RY61ostuJzut74RY","pdfSize":"189599"}
