In this work, we\ninvestigate the continuous spatiotemporal translation symmetry of ST-MMs with\nuniform modulation velocity. Using Noether theorem, we demonstrate that such\nsymmetry entails the conservation of the energy-momentum. We highlight how\nenergy-momentum conservation imposes constraints on the range of allowed\nlight-matter interactions within ST-MMs, as illustrated with examples of the\ncollision of electromagnetic and modulation pulses. Furthermore, we discuss the\nsimilarities and differences between the conservation of energy-momentum and\nrelativistic effects. We believe that our work provides a step forward in\nclarifying the fundamental theory underlying ST-MMs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
