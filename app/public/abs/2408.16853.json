However, low\nspectral efficiency and short-range communication capabilities, along with the\nultra-low power nature of the tags, create significant challenges for reliable\nand practical applications of BTTNs. To address these challenges, this paper\nintroduces integrating an indoor reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) into\nBTTN and studying RIS's impact on the system's performance. To that end, we\nfirst derive compact analytical expressions of the probability density function\n(PDF) and cumulative distribution function (CDF) for the received\nsignal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver tag by exploiting the moment\nmatching technique. Then, based on the derived PDF and CDF, we further derive\nanalytical expressions of outage probability (OP), bit error rate (BER), and\naverage capacity (AC) rate. Eventually, the Monte Carlo simulation is used to\nvalidate the accuracy of the analytical results, revealing that utilizing RIS\ncan greatly improve the performance of BTTNs in terms of AC, BER, OP, and\ncoverage region relative to traditional BTTNs setups that do not incorporate\nRIS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
