We\nalso give internal properties of (i,j)-Baire bilocales which are not translated\nfrom properties of (i,j)-Baireness in bispaces. It turns out (i,j)-Baire\nbilocales are conservative in bilocales, in the sense that a bitopological\nspace is almost (i,j)-Baire if and only if the bilocale it induces is\n(i,j)-Baire. Furthermore, in the class of Noetherian bilocales, (i,j)-Baireness\nof a bilocale coincides with (i,j)-Baireness of its ideal bilocale. We also\nconsider relative versions of (i,j)-Baire where we show that a bilocale is\n(i,j)-Baire only if the subbilocale induced by the Booleanization is\n(i,j)-Baire. We use the characterization of (i,j)-Baire bilocales to introduce\nand characterize (\\tau_{i},\\tau_{j})-Baireness in the category of\ntopobilocales.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"U_MNPC1hKHXhbO0xckGJKxlwIUANz4o-q5JZYQIoGp4","pdfSize":"206525"}
