We classify the maximal reductive subgroups of\nmaximal rank in any classical simple algebraic $k$-group in terms of\ncombinatorial data associated to their indices. This result complements [S,\n2022], which does the same for the exceptional groups. We determine which of\nthese subgroups may be realised over a finite field, the real numbers, or over\na $\\mathfrak{p}$-adic field. We also look at the asymptotics of the number of\nsuch subgroups as the rank grows large.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KlZ6mJsN0LRh3h_Cyzx19Qh8QVwEl_KpS1Hof6GzBZk","pdfSize":"644480","objectId":"0xf201fde521e68749214395b7da3961e6f821f45eeb633c35718ff1350a0156e6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
