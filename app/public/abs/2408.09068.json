Geographically\nvarying the duty cycle of satellite transmission allows for reduced resource\nwastage as satellite capacity is matched to non-uniform user demands. Total\nfeasible active beam combinations is given by $2^n$ for $n$ beams. With in\nservice satellite systems operating in excess of 100 beams, complete\nenumeration of optimum illumination patterns is not tractable. Developing\nefficient optimization methods which minimize resource wastage is essential to\nrealising the benefits of modern BH systems. We present a computationally\nefficient pattern generation method which uses the binary logarithm to\ndecompose beam demands into common powers of two. This method is shown to\nproduce feasible patterns within 0.047 and 0.31 seconds for systems using 49\nand 132 beams respectively and within 19.109 seconds for a 1085 beam system.\nWhen averaged across all testing configurations, this method reduced capacity\nerror by 94% compared to a conventional even data distribution. To facilitate\nalgorithm comparison, two integer linear programming formulations are\ndeveloped. Even though they can only solve problems of modest sizes to proven\noptimality, they provide valuable insights in the optimality gap for our\nproposed heuristic approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
