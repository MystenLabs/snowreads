However, its\nblack box nature presents significant ethical challenges related to bias and\ntransparency. AI applications are hugely impacted by biases, presenting\ninconsistent and unreliable findings, leading to significant costs and\nconsequences, highlighting and perpetuating inequalities and unequal access to\nresources. Hence, developing safe, reliable, ethical, and Trustworthy AI\nsystems is essential.\n  Our team of researchers working with Trustworthy and Responsible AI, part of\nthe Transdisciplinary Scholarship Initiative within the University of Calgary,\nconducts research on Trustworthy and Responsible AI, including fairness, bias\nmitigation, reproducibility, generalization, interpretability, and\nauthenticity. In this paper, we review and discuss the intricacies of AI\nbiases, definitions, methods of detection and mitigation, and metrics for\nevaluating bias. We also discuss open challenges with regard to the\ntrustworthiness and widespread application of AI across diverse domains of\nhuman-centric decision making, as well as guidelines to foster Responsible and\nTrustworthy AI models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1Tmh0qBTfSsReDWJGGxeFd4kyzNoFmDIzM8hS_utxw4","pdfSize":"788268"}
