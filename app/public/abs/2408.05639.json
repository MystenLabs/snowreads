Conventional numerical systems often fall\nshort of meeting the efficiency requirements of these applications concerning\narea, time, and power consumption. Innovative approaches like residue number\nsystems (RNS) and redundant number systems have been introduced to surmount\nthis challenge, markedly elevating computational efficiency. This paper\nexamines from multiple perspectives how the fusion of redundant number systems\nwith RNS (termed R-RNS) can diminish latency and enhance circuit\nimplementation, yielding substantial benefits in practical scenarios. We\nconduct a comparative analysis of four systems - RNS, redundant number system,\nBinary Number System (BNS), and Signed-Digit Redundant Residue Number System\n(SD-RNS)-and appraise SD-RNS through an advanced Deep Neural Network (DNN)\nutilizing the CIFAR-10 dataset. Our findings are encouraging, demonstrating\nthat SD-RNS attains computational speedups of 1.27 times and 2.25 times over\nRNS and BNS, respectively, and reduces energy consumption by 60% compared to\nBNS during sequential addition and multiplication tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
