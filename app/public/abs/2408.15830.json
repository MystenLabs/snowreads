This order is of key importance due to its role\nin resolving the long-standing infrared problem of finite-temperature field\ntheory within a dimensionally reduced effective field theory setup. By\nsystematically applying linear transformations of integration variables, or\nmomentum shifts, we resolve equivalences between different representations of\nFeynman sum-integrals. on the integrand level, transforming those into a\ncanonical form. At the order $g^6$, this results in reducing a sum of O(100000)\ndistinct sum-integrals which are produced from all four-loop vacuum diagrams\ndown to merely 21. Furthermore, we succeed to map 11 of those onto known\nlower-loop structures. This leaves only 10 genuine 4-loop sum-integrals to be\nevaluated, thereby bringing the finalization of three decades of theoretical\nefforts within reach.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
