In this paper, we introduce a common\ngeneralization of super-stability and strong stability, which we call\nnon-uniform stability. First, we prove that we can determine the existence of a\nnon-uniformly stable matching in polynomial time. Next, we give a polyhedral\ncharacterization of the set of non-uniformly stable matchings. Finally, we\nprove that the set of non-uniformly stable matchings forms a distributive\nlattice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
