The aim is to see if the quantum effects arising in an expanding\nuniverse, such as the cosmological particle production, could facilitate the\ncommunication between two distant parts or if they provide an additive noisy\neffect. By considering a perfect cosmic fluid, the resulting expansion turns\nout to increase the classical capacity of the protocol. This increasing occurs\nfor all the cosmological expansions unless the latter is sharpened just before\nthe receiver's detector interacts with the field. Moreover, the classical\ncapacity turns out to be sensible to the barotropic parameter $w$ of the\nperfect fluid and to the coupling between the field and the scalar curvature\n$\\xi$. As a consequence, by performing this protocol, one can achieve\ninformation about the cosmological dynamics and its coupling with a background\nquantum field.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
