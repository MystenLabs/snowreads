When the edge weights\nsatisfy certain conditions, we show that the distributions of the locations of\ncertain types of dimers near the right boundary converge to the spectra of\nindependent GUE minor processes. The proof is based on new quantitative\nanalysis of a formula to compute Schur functions at general points discovered\nin \\cite{ZL18}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sK28H2EJXbMqLVeOrAtWSheY56m3dHugFAacaRdQNoA","pdfSize":"676867"}
