In this paper, we propose an\nend-to-end optimization strategy for an optical surface mesh. Our formulation\nleverages a novel differentiable rendering model, and is directly driven by the\ndifference between the resulting light distribution and the target\ndistribution. We also enforce geometric constraints related to fabrication\nrequirements, to facilitate CNC milling and polishing of the designed surface.\nTo address the issue of local minima, we formulate a face-based optimal\ntransport problem between the current mesh and the target distribution, which\nmakes effective large changes to the surface shape. The combination of our\noptimal transport update and rendering-guided optimization produces an optical\nsurface design with a resulting image closely resembling the target, while the\nfabrication constraints in our optimization help to ensure consistency between\nthe rendering model and the final physical results. The effectiveness of our\nalgorithm is demonstrated on a variety of target images using both simulated\nrendering and physical prototypes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gz16_rkjcDEV7igqpTDN0NPPKgAMXRXZh4yMaCvzzO8","pdfSize":"39778420"}
