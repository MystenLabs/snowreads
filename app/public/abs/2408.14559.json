This potential is even greater when\nsynthetic data is used for training along with a small number of real images\nfrom domains other than the test domain. We find that this potential varies\ndepending on (i) the number of cross-domain real images and (ii) the test set\non which the trained model is evaluated. We introduce two new metrics, the\ntrain2test distance and $\\text{AP}_\\text{t2t}$, to evaluate the ability of a\ncross-domain training set using synthetic data to represent the characteristics\nof test instances in relation to training performance. Using these metrics, we\ndelve deeper into the factors that influence the potential of synthetic data\nand uncover some interesting dynamics about how synthetic data impacts training\nperformance. We hope these discoveries will encourage more widespread use of\nsynthetic data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
