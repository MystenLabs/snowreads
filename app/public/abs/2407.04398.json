Given its widespread adoption in\nrepresenting and exchanging structured data online, JSON-LD could be an\neffective format for WoT. Nevertheless, its verbose nature may present\nchallenges for resource-constrained IoT devices with limited bandwidth and\nmemory capacities.\n  In this paper, we present a novel approach to compactly represent JSON-LD\ndata using the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) and bitmaps. Our\nproposed method is named as CBL which stands for CBOR, Bitmap and List of\nKey-value pairs. CBL leverages the ideas from CBOR and HDT to achieve an\nefficient encoding of JSON-LD data.\n  Results demonstrate that our approach provides savings up to 95.1% in terms\nof network overhead. This could be especially beneficial for IoT devices\nexchanging data over wireless networks. Moreover, our approach is more\nefficient than the current approach known as CBOR-LD, which is used to compact\nJSON-LD data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
