The characteristic rimless wheels in the AsguardIV\nrover allow it to overcome challenging terrains. However, steep slopes or\ndifficult maneuvers can cause the rover to tip over and threaten the completion\nof a mission. This work focuses on identifying early signs or initial stages\nfor potential tip-over events to predict and detect these critical moments\nbefore they fully occur, possibly preventing accidents and enhancing the safety\nand stability of the rover during its exploration mission. Inertial Measurement\nUnits (IMU) readings are used to develop compact, robust, and efficient\nAutoencoders that combine the power of sequence processing of Long Short-Term\nMemory Networks (LSTM). By leveraging LSTM-based Autoencoders, this work\ncontributes predictive capabilities for detecting tip-over risks and developing\nsafety measures for more reliable exploration missions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
