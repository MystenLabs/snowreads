Recently Schmidt et al.\n[Phys. Rev. B 108, 174415 (2023)] reported that a ferromagnetic ordered state\nis actually induced by a small Ni substitution for Co of $x$ = 0.02 in\nSr(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ where antiferromagnetic ordered phase also\nappears by further Ni-substitution with $x = 0.06-0.35$. Here, using nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) measurements on $^{31}$P nuclei, we have investigated\nhow the magnetic properties change by the Ni substitution in\nSr(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ from a microscopic point of view, especially\nfocusing on the evolution of magnetic fluctuations with the Ni substitution and\nthe characterization of the magnetically ordered states. The temperature\ndependences of $^{31}$P spin-lattice relaxation rate divided by temperature\n($1/T_1T$) and Knight shift ($K$) for SrCo$_2$P$_2$ are reasonably explained by\na model where a double-peak structure for the density of states near the Fermi\nenergy is assumed. Based on a Korringa ratio analysis using the $T_1$ and $K$\ndata, ferromagnetic spin fluctuations are found to dominate in the\nferromagnetic Sr(Co$_{1-x}$Ni$_x$)$_2$P$_2$ as well as the antiferromagnets\nwhere no clear antiferromagnetic fluctuations are observed. We also found the\ndistribution of the ordered Co moments in the magnetically ordered states from\nthe analysis of the $^{31}$P NMR spectra exhibiting a characteristic\nrectangular-like shape.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
