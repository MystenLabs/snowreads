At\nthe core of our EasyInv is a refined strategy for approximating inversion\nnoise, which is pivotal for enhancing the accuracy and reliability of the\ninversion process. By prioritizing the initial latent state, which encapsulates\nrich information about the original images, EasyInv steers clear of the\niterative refinement of noise items. Instead, we introduce a methodical\naggregation of the latent state from the preceding time step with the current\nstate, effectively increasing the influence of the initial latent state and\nmitigating the impact of noise. We illustrate that EasyInv is capable of\ndelivering results that are either on par with or exceed those of the\nconventional DDIM Inversion approach, especially under conditions where the\nmodel's precision is limited or computational resources are scarce.\nConcurrently, our EasyInv offers an approximate threefold enhancement regarding\ninference efficiency over off-the-shelf iterative optimization techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
