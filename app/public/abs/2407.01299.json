Due to absence of\ntrue degradation models in real-world scenarios, previous methods learn\ndistinct representations by distinguishing different degradations in a batch.\nHowever, the most significant degradation differences may provide shortcuts for\nthe learning of representations such that subtle difference may be discarded.\nIn this paper, we propose an alternative to learn degradation representations\nthrough reproducing degraded low-resolution (LR) images. By guiding the\ndegrader to reconstruct input LR images, full degradation information can be\nencoded into the representations. In addition, we develop an energy distance\nloss to facilitate the learning of the degradation representations by\nintroducing a bounded constraint. Experiments show that our representations can\nextract accurate and highly robust degradation information. Moreover,\nevaluations on both synthetic and real images demonstrate that our ReDSR\nachieves state-of-the-art performance for the blind SR tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
