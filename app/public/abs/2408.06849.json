However, the inherent complexity of causal problems and causal theory\nposes challenges in accurately describing them in natural language, making it\ndifficult for LLMs to comprehend and use them effectively. Causal methods are\nnot easily conveyed through natural language, which hinders LLMs' ability to\napply them accurately. Additionally, causal datasets are typically tabular,\nwhile LLMs excel in handling natural language data, creating a structural\nmismatch that impedes effective reasoning with tabular data. This lack of\ncausal reasoning capability limits the development of LLMs. To address these\nchallenges, we have equipped the LLM with causal tools within an agent\nframework, named the Causal Agent, enabling it to tackle causal problems. The\ncausal agent comprises tools, memory, and reasoning modules. In the tools\nmodule, the causal agent applies causal methods to align tabular data with\nnatural language. In the reasoning module, the causal agent employs the ReAct\nframework to perform reasoning through multiple iterations with the tools. In\nthe memory module, the causal agent maintains a dictionary instance where the\nkeys are unique names and the values are causal graphs. To verify the causal\nability of the causal agent, we established a benchmark consisting of four\nlevels of causal problems: variable level, edge level, causal graph level, and\ncausal effect level. We generated a test dataset of 1.3K using ChatGPT-3.5 for\nthese four levels of issues and tested the causal agent on the datasets. Our\nmethodology demonstrates remarkable efficacy on the four-level causal problems,\nwith accuracy rates all above 80%.
