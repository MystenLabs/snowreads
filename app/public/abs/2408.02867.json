As\nis typical with many movies of this genre, in order to enjoy them one must\nsuspend their disbelief when it comes to the laws of physics. While there are a\nplethora of examples of violations of basic principles (the square-cube law\nbeing the prime example) the idea of a \"gravity inversion\" occurring inside of\nthe \"Hollow Earth\" is among the most debated as well as the most relevant to\nthe storylines of the recent movies. The intent of this paper is to show that,\nwhile typical scientific arguments refuting the possibility of such an\ninversion are definitely completely correct, a slight modification of the\nconditions assumed to exist inside the planet in these arguments may allow for\nthe inversion to actually occur.\n","subjects":["Physics/Popular Physics","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"pjX3pC639nwMeUJbyl6uujxCDPdJHisEVTVdjiiHvec","pdfSize":"333778"}
