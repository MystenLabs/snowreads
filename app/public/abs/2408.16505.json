In this\nwork, a sequential construction of effective Hamiltonians drives the definition\nof approximate model functions and energies in a multi-state\nRayleigh-Schr\\\"odinger perturbative scheme. A second step takes advantage of an\nupdated partitioning of the Hamiltonian to perform a state-specific\nBrillouin-Wigner energy correction based on a well-tempered perturbation\nexpansion. The multi-step RSBW method is exemplified on model-Hamiltonians to\nstress its robustness, efficiency and applicability to spectroscopy\ndetermination.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
