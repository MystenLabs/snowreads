To achieve error-resistant quantum memory, one would like to store\nthe information in a quantum superposition of degenerate states engineered in\nsuch a way that local sources of noise cannot change one state into another,\nthus preventing quantum decoherence. One promising concept is that of fracton\norder -- a phase of matter with a large ground state degeneracy that grows\nsubextensively with the system size. Unfortunately, the models realizing\nfractons are not friendly to experimental implementations as they require\nunnatural interactions between a substantial number (of the order of ten) of\nqubits. We demonstrate how this limitation can be circumvented by leveraging\nthe long-range quantum entanglement created using only pairwise interactions\nbetween the code and ancilla qubits, realizable in programmable tweezer arrays\nof Rydberg atoms. We show that this platform also allows to detect and correct\ncertain types of errors en route to the goal of true error-resistant quantum\nmemory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
