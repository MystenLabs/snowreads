In this work, we focus on sharp Sobolev\nand Adams-Trudinger-Moser embeddings for radial functions in hyperbolic spaces,\nconsidering both bounded and unbounded domains. One of the main features of our\napproach is that we do not assume boundary zero condition for symmetric\nfunctions on geodesic balls or the entire hyperbolic space. Our main results\ninclude Theorems 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, which establish weighted Sobolev embedding\ntheorems, and Theorems 1.5 together with 1.6, which present\nAdams-Trudinger-Moser type of embedding theorems. In particular, a key result\nis Theorem 1.1 which is a highly nontrivial comparison result between norms of\nthe higher order covariant derivatives and higher order derivatives of the\nradial functions. Higher order asymptotic behavior of radial functions on\nhyperbolic spaces are established to prove our main theorems. This approach\nincludes novel radial lemmata and decay properties of higher order radial\nSobolev functions defined in hyperbolic space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
