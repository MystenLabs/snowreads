The search\ntargets dark photons resulting from the exotic decay of the Standard Model\nHiggs boson, assuming its production via the dominant gluon-gluon fusion mode.\nThe analysis is based on 140 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected with the ATLAS\ndetector at the Large Hadron Collider from proton-proton collisions at a\ncenter-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Events with collimated pairs of electrons or\nmuons are analysed and background contributions are estimated using data-driven\ntechniques. No significant excess in the data above the Standard Model\nbackground is observed. Upper limits are set at 95% confidence level on the\nbranching ratio of the Higgs boson decay into dark photons between 0.001% and\n5%, depending on the assumed dark photon mass and signal model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
