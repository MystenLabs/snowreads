This search uses\n$\\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV proton-proton collision data with an integrated luminosity of\n140 fb$^{-1}$ recorded by the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The\nanalysis relies on the identification of charm-quark-containing jets, and\nadopts an approach based on Gaussian process regression to model the\nnon-resonant di-photon background. The observed (expected, assuming the\nStandard Model signal) upper limit at the 95% confidence level on the\ncross-section for producing a Higgs boson and at least one charm quark is found\nto be 10.4 pb (8.6 pb). The observed (expected) measured cross-section for this\nprocess is $5.2 \\pm 3.0 ~\\text{pb}$ ($2.9 \\pm 2.8 ~\\text{pb}$).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7XDx_sgVUqkjSyFzU68u0z93LxcHDkdzq39guKzn1G0","pdfSize":"1611035"}
