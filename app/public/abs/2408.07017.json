We prove each such minimal semisimple Hessenberg variety is a union\nRichardson varieties and compute this set of Richardson varieties explicitly.\nOur methods leverage the notion of matrix Hessenberg schemes to answer\nquestions about the geometry of minimal semisimple Hessenberg varieties using\ncommutative algebra and known results on Schubert determinantal ideals. In\nparticular, we show that all type A minimal semisimple matrix Hessenberg\nschemes are reduced.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rBiDsr49S-cYmqT15EajINfum4JcJ4HZc_cuaN3n7d0","pdfSize":"218892"}
