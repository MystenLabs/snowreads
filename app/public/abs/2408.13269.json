The purpose of the\nbenchmark is to support fault diagnosis research by providing data and a model\nof an industrially relevant system. Data has been collected from an internal\ncombustion engine test bench operated in both nominal and faulty modes. A\nstate-of-the-art model of the air path through an internal combustion engine\nwith unknown parameters is provided. This benchmark has previously been used in\na competition at the 12th IFAC Symposium on Fault Detection, Supervision and\nSafety for Technical Processes (Safe Process) 2024, Ferrara, Italy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FDvBiujWFKAxkHJ8_rTEdK68x9Kc2euH2hAgysPGlBM","pdfSize":"2391701"}
