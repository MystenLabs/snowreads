We divide temporal message passing mechanisms from literature into two\nmain types: global and local, and establish Weisfeiler-Leman characterisations\nfor both. This allows us to formally analyse expressive power of temporal\nmessage-passing models. We show that global and local temporal message-passing\nmechanisms have incomparable expressive power when applied to arbitrary\ntemporal graphs. However, the local mechanism is strictly more expressive than\nthe global mechanism when applied to colour-persistent temporal graphs, whose\nnode colours are initially the same in all time points. Our theoretical\nfindings are supported by experimental evidence, underlining practical\nimplications of our analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S-ghQUzxWUFGQAIo_5JZt416APYv7FXCsJXdL_U8tdU","pdfSize":"290893"}
