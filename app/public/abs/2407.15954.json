We discover a new delocalization mechanism attributed\nto a residue imaginary (part of) velocity $\\operatorname{Im}(v)$, feasible for\nground states or low-temperature states of non-Hermitian quantum systems under\nperiodic boundary conditions. Interestingly, a disorder field contributing to\n$\\operatorname{Im}(v)$ may allow strong-disorder-limit delocalization when\n$\\operatorname{Im}(v)$ prevails over the Anderson localization. We demonstrate\nsuch delocalization with correlation and entanglement behaviors, as well as its\nmany-body nature and generalizability to finite temperatures and interactions.\nThus, the nontrivial physics of $\\operatorname{Im}(v)$ significantly enriches\nour understanding of delocalization and breeds useful applications, e.g., in\nquantum adiabatic processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
