In this paper, we\ninvestigate the role of rotation in a matter-wave interferometer, where we show\nthat imparting angular momentum along the direction of a defect, such as one\npresent in the nitrogen-vacancy centre of a nanodiamond can cause an\nenhancement in spin contrast for a wide-ranging value of the angular momentum,\ne.g. $10^{3}-10^{6}$~Hz for a mass of order $10^{-14}-10^{-17}$ Kg nanodiamond.\nFurthermore, the imparted angular momentum can enhance the spatial\nsuperposition by almost a factor of two and possibly average out any potential\npermanent dipoles in the nanodiamond.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
