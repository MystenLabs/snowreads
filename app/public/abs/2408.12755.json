We prove a Fra\\\"iss\\'e\ncorrespondence for those spaces and make links with the notion of\n$\\omega$-categoricity from continuous logic, showing that $\\omega$-categorical\nBanach spaces are a natural source of guarded Fra\\\"iss\\'e Banach spaces. Using\nthose results, we prove that for many values of $(p, q)$, the Banach space\n$L_p(L_q)$ has a $G_\\delta$ isometry class; we precisely characterize those\nvalues.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
