Using the low-energy two-nucleon scattering observables\nfrom lattice QCD available at $m_\\pi=300$, 450, 510, and 806 MeV, the\nleading-order $nn\\rightarrow ppee$ transition matrix elements are predicted\nwith a precision of 10\\%-20\\% and their volume dependence is investigated. This\nis possible thanks to the fact that the leading-order $nn\\rightarrow ppee$\ntransition matrix elements can be properly renormalized in the relativistic\npionless EFT without the uncertain $nn\\rightarrow pp ee$ contact term, in\ncontrast to the nonrelativistic case. The predictions for the $nn\\rightarrow\nppee$ transition matrix elements can be directly matched to the LQCD\ncalculations of the $nn\\rightarrow ppee$ process at the same pion masses.\nTherefore, the present results are expected to play a crucial role in the\nbenchmark between the nuclear EFTs and the upcoming LQCD calculations of the\n$nn\\rightarrow pp ee$ process, which would provide a nontrivial test on the\npredictive power of nuclear EFTs on neutrinoless double-beta decay.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
