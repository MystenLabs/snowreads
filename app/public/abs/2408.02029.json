The task of association rule mining successfully discovers\nregular patterns in item sets and substructures. Still, to our best knowledge,\nthis concept has not yet been extended to path patterns in large property\ngraphs. In this paper, we introduce the problem of path association rule mining\n(PARM). Applied to any \\emph{reachability path} between two vertices within a\nlarge graph, PARM discovers regular ways in which path patterns, identified by\nvertex attributes and edge labels, co-occur with each other. We develop an\nefficient and scalable algorithm PIONEER that exploits an anti-monotonicity\nproperty to effectively prune the search space. Further, we devise\napproximation techniques and employ parallelization to achieve scalable path\nassociation rule mining. Our experimental study using real-world graph data\nverifies the significance of path association rules and the efficiency of our\nsolutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ostcDVpRI_W1yY4tJHzNzxcmZu2Wghi7Nwr9VZwcVOI","pdfSize":"7601495"}
