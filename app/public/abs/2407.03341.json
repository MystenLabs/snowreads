This universal property\noccurs in media such as rocks, unconsolidated sediments, and human tissue.\nAbsorption is due to relaxation processes at atomic scale up to the sub-micron\nscale of biological materials, and we argue that these processes are thermally\nactivated. Unusual for ultrasonics and seismics, we can therefore express\nabsorption as an integral over an activation energy landscape weighted by an\nenergy distribution. The universal power-law property corresponds to a flat\nactivation energy landscape corresponding to maximal randomness.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
