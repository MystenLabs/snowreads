To achieve this,\nsoftware developers should understand potential vulnerabilities and apply\nsecure coding practices. To prepare these skilled professionals, it is\nimportant that cybersecurity concepts are included in programming courses\ntaught at universities. Objective: To present a comprehensive and unbiased\nliterature review on teaching of cybersecurity concepts in programming courses\ntaught at universities. Method: We perform a Systematic Mapping Study. We\npresent six research questions, define our selection criteria, and develop a\nclassification scheme. Results and Conclusions: We select 24 publications. Our\nresults show a wide range of research contributions. We also outline guidelines\nand identify opportunities for future studies. The guidelines include coverage\nof security knowledge categories and evaluation of contributions. We suggest\nthat future studies should cover security issues, negative impacts, and\ncountermeasures, as well as apply evaluation techniques that examine students'\nknowledge. The opportunities for future studies are related to advanced\ncourses, security knowledge frameworks, and programming environments.\nFurthermore, there is a need of a holistic security framework that covers the\nsecurity concepts identified in this study and is suitable for education.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
