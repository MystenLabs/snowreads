We describe the current\nstatus of the framework as for version 0.2.9. In detail, the two new backends\nfor Clifford and tensor networks simulation are presented and benchmarked\nagainst the state-of-the-art.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
