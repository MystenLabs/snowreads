In stark contrast with the existing literature, our\nscheme exploits the always-on longitudinal ZZ coupling. The latter, combined\nwith specific driving frequencies, enables the reach of a blockade regime,\nwhich plays a pivotal role in the computing scheme.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
