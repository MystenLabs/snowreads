Though it is popular to neglect these two\naberration types for their minute effect on the wavefront, a test of this\nnegligence has been carried out in an extreme scenario of high phase noise. The\nrelationship between phase noise and fringe visibility has been analysed,\nresulting in the discovery of an upper bound for allowed phase noise in LISA.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s3klu2HTj4HP3oJB_7EtgaggnRbwXRMkVUjXAR31ZOc","pdfSize":"954704"}
