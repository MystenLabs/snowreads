In this\nwork, we examine the dynamics of political messaging and voter behavior on\nTwitter during the 2022 Italian general elections. Specifically, we focus on\nvoters who changed their political preferences over time (swing voters),\nidentifying significant patterns of migration and susceptibility to propaganda\nmessages. Our analysis reveals that during election periods, the popularity of\npoliticians increases, and there is a notable variation in the use of\npersuasive language techniques, including doubt, loaded language, appeals to\nvalues, and slogans. Swing voters are more vulnerable to these propaganda\ntechniques compared to non-swing voters, with differences in vulnerability\npatterns across various types of political shifts. These findings highlight the\nnuanced impact of social media on political opinion in Italy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
