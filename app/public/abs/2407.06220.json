Since then, RNA secondary structures have\nbeen explored according to many different structural characteristics, for\ninstance, helices, components and loops by Hofacker, Schuster and Stadler,\norders by Nebel, saturated structures by Clote, the $5^{\\prime}$-$3^{\\prime}$\nend distance by Clote, Ponty and Steyaert, and the rainbow spectrum by Li and\nReidys. However, the majority of the contributions are asymptotic results, and\nit is harder to derive explicit formulas. In this paper, we obtain exact\nformulas counting RNA secondary structures with a given number of helices as\nwell as a given joint size distribution of helices and loops, while some\nrelated asymptotic results due to Hofacker, Schuster and Stadler have been\nknown for about twenty years. Our approach is combinatorial, analyzing a recent\nbijection between RNA secondary structures and plane trees discovered by the\nfirst author and proposing a variation of Chen's bijective approach of counting\ntrees by forests of simple trees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
