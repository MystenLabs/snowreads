In this work,\nwe introduce a data-driven methodology for airfoil generation using a diffusion\nmodel. Trained on a dataset of preexisting airfoils, our model can generate an\narbitrary number of new airfoils from random vectors, which can be conditioned\non specific aerodynamic performance metrics such as lift and drag, or geometric\ncriteria. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion model effectively produces\nairfoil shapes with realistic aerodynamic properties, offering substantial\nimprovements in efficiency, flexibility, and the potential for discovering\ninnovative airfoil designs. This approach significantly expands the design\nspace, facilitating the synthesis of high-performance aerodynamic shapes that\ntranscend the limitations of traditional methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"q3nomgyZapqvFUskFeD2wqWl2DqBvXeiXBb4x9zsR80","pdfSize":"1763935"}
