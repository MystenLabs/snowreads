With the objective\nto automatize the search of PG symmetry operations of generic atomic clusters,\nwe present a new algorithm called Symmetry Operation FInder (SOFI). SOFI\naddresses the problem of identifying PG symmetry by framing it as a degenerate\nshape-matching problem, where the multiple solutions correspond to distinct\nsymmetry operations. The developed algorithm is compared against three other\nalgorithms dedicated to PG identification, on a large set of atomic clusters.\nThe results, along with some illustrative use cases, showcase the effectiveness\nof SOFI. The SOFI algorithm is released as part of the IRA library, accessible\nat https://github.com/mammasmias/IterativeRotationsAssignments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
