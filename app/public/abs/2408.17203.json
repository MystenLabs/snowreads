Building on Efimov's approach\nusing Hodge theory, we prove that very general L-equivalent K3 surfaces are\nD-equivalent, leveraging the Derived Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces. Our main\ntechnical contribution is that two distinct lattice structures on an integral,\nirreducible Hodge structure are related by a rational endomorphism of the Hodge\nstructure. We partially extend our results to hyperk\\\"ahler fourfolds and\nmoduli spaces of sheaves on K3 surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
