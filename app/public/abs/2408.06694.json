We collect such a textbook-version light curve sample of $30$ GRBs, and\nderive the jet properties from our joint fit to their X-ray and optical\nafterglow light curves. It is found that the distributions of the isotropic\ninitial Lorentz factors ($\\Gamma_0$), the deceleration radii ($R_{\\rm dec}$),\nand the magnetic field strength ($B_0$) are log-normal, but the distributions\nof the isotropic kinetic energy ($E_{\\rm k, iso}$), medium density ($n_{0}$),\nand the magnetization parameter ($\\sigma_{B}\\equiv\\epsilon_B/\\epsilon_e$) are\ntentatively bimodal. A tight $R_{\\rm dec}\\mbox{-}B_{0}\\mbox{-}\\sigma_{B}$\nrelation is found. It infers a universal $\\epsilon_e E_{\\rm k,iso}$ among\nbursts, plausibly supporting the previous argument of a universal GRB radiation\nenergy among GRBs. A jet break is required for modeling the light curves of\n$26$ GRBs. The distributions of the jet opening angles and the jet-corrected\nkinetic energies log-normally center at $\\log \\theta_{\\rm j,c}/{\\rm rad}=-1.51$\n(standard deviation $\\sigma=0.27$) and $\\log (E_{\\rm k, j,c}/{\\rm erg})=51.78$\n($\\sigma=0.54$), respectively. Those GRBs ($19$ GRBs), whose prompt gamma-ray\nemission is well estimated with broad energy-band observations, satisfy the\npreviously discovered $L_{\\rm \\gamma, p, iso}-E_{\\rm p,z}-\\Gamma_{0}$ relation,\nand their gamma-ray radiation efficiencies log-normally distribute in the range\nfrom $0.04\\%$ to $10\\%$ with a central value of $0.42\\%$. Such a low efficiency\nfavors the baryonic fireball model, and the distribution of their baryon mass\nloading in the GRB ejecta log-normally centers at $\\log (M_{\\rm fb,c}/M_{\\rm\nsun})=-5$ ($\\sigma=0.75$).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
