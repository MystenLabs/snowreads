We impose\ndifferent shear rates and follow the time evolution of the stress. For\nsufficiently large shear rates, an intermediate stress overshoot is measured\nbefore reaching the steady state. We evidence self-similarity of the stress\novershoot as a function of the applied shear rate for samples with various\ndistances from the gel point, which is related to the elastic energy stored by\nthe samples, as for dense systems close to the jamming transition. In\nconcordance with the findings for glassy and jammed systems, we also measure\nthat the stress after flow cessation decreases as a power law with time with a\ncharacteristic relaxation time that depends on the shear rate previously\nimposed. These features revealed in non-linear rheology could be the signature\nof a mesoscopic dynamics, which would depend on the extent of gelation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
