A novel\nproperty is that any cocommutative post-Hopf algebra gives rise to a\nsub-adjacent Hopf algebra with a generalized Grossman-Larson product. By\ntwisting the post-Hopf product, we provide a combinatorial antipode formula for\nthe sub-adjacent Hopf algebra of the universal enveloping algebra of a post-Lie\nalgebra. Relating to such a sub-adjacent Hopf algebra, we also obtain a closed\ninverse formula for the Oudom-Guin isomorphism in the context of post-Lie\nalgebras. Especially as a byproduct, we derive a cancellation-free antipode\nformula for the Grossman-Larson Hopf algebra of ordered trees through a\nconcrete tree-grafting expression.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"f9s66vyloLxsS_7yyg9Z4WuxCFvIAvI34QeoTA_VymM","pdfSize":"277844","txDigest":"LxQSoy984U2gGKK8tnacdmJzQ84uToSBedK2K51mDP6","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
