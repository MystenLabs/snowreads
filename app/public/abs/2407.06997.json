This is done in a unified manner, using what we\ncall flexible classes of rank-one transformations. Our main result is that\nevery flexible class contains an element which is Shannon orbit equivalent to\nthe universal odometer. Since a typical example of flexible class is $\\{T\\}$\nwhen $T$ is an odometer, our work generalizes a recent result by Kerr and Li,\nstating that every odometer is Shannon orbit equivalent to the universal\nodometer. When the flexible class is a singleton, the rank-one transformation\ngiven by the main result is explicit. This applies to odometers, Chacon's map\nand irrational rotations for almost every angle. We also prove that strongly\nmixing systems, or systems with a given eigenvalue form flexible classes. In\nparticular, strong mixing, rationality or irrationality of the eigenvalues are\nnot preserved under Shannon orbit equivalence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
