We first present a general argument which relates\neach term in the expansion to a non-deformed amplitude containing additional\npropagators with mass $M>\\kappa$. We then show the same thing more\npragmatically, by reducing the singularity structure of the coefficients in the\nexpansion of the $\\kappa$-deformed amplitude, to the singularity structure of\nnon-deformed loop amplitudes, by using algebraic and analytic identities. We\nwill explicitly show this up to second order in $1/\\kappa$, but the technique\ncan be generalized to higher orders in $1/\\kappa$. Both the abstract and the\nmore direct approach easily generalize to different deformed theories. We will\nthen compute the full imaginary part of the $\\kappa$-deformed 1-loop correction\nto the propagator in a specific model, up to second order in the expansion in\n$1/\\kappa$, highlighting the usefulness of the approach for the phenomenology\nof deformed models. This explicitly confirms previous qualitative arguments\nconcerning the behaviour of the decay width of unstable particles in the\nconsidered model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
