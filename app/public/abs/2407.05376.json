Despite extensive studies on it,\nthere is a noticeable gap in understanding the operation of such models within\na closed-loop planning setting. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel\nclosed-loop planning framework compatible with neural networks engaged in joint\nprediction and planning. The framework contains two running modes, namely\nplanning and safety monitoring, wherein the neural network performs Motion\nPrediction and Planning (MPP) and Conditional Motion Prediction (CMP)\ncorrespondingly without altering architecture. We evaluate the efficacy of our\nframework using the nuPlan dataset and its simulator, conducting closed-loop\nexperiments across diverse scenarios. The results demonstrate that the proposed\nframework ensures the feasibility and local stability of the planning process\nwhile maintaining safety with CMP safety monitoring. Compared to other\nlearning-based methods, our approach achieves substantial improvement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
