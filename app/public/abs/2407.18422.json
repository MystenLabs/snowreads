A typical view of defining black swan events is heavily assumed to\noriginate from an unpredictable time-varying environments; however, the\ncommunity lacks a comprehensive definition of black swan events. To this end,\nthis paper challenges that the standard view is incomplete and claims that\nhigh-risk, statistically rare events can also occur in unchanging environments\ndue to human misperception of their value and likelihood, which we call as\nspatial black swan event. We first carefully categorize black swan events,\nfocusing on spatial black swan events, and mathematically formalize the\ndefinition of black swan events. We hope these definitions can pave the way for\nthe development of algorithms to prevent such events by rationally correcting\nhuman perception.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C-JcXjRvP_FfLQ8EwEc7_W0KKMr9W94UR-2JuDL-UkQ","pdfSize":"810439"}
