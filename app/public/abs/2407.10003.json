For this problem, we propose a randomized\nalgorithm that, in expectation, obtains a $(1-O(\\epsilon),\nO(\\epsilon^{-1}))$-bicriteria approximation using polylogarithmic query\ncomplexity per update.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
