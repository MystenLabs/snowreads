Including $C_{n2p}$ will enhances the\nagreement with experimental results with higher yield ratios, yet it does not\nchange the energy dependence of the yield ratio. Since there is no first-order\nphase transition or critical physics in the AMPT model, our work fails to\nreproduce the experimental energy-dependent peak around $\\sqrt{s_\\text{NN}} =\n$20-30 GeV. Our work might offer a baseline for investigating critical physics\nphenomena using the light nuclei production as a probe.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
