Since the inception of the first such\nalgorithm, ADAPT-VQE, many improvements have appeared in the literature. We\ncombine the key improvements along with a novel operator pool -- which we term\nCoupled Exchange Operator (CEO) pool -- to assess the cost of running\nstate-of-the-art ADAPT-VQE on hardware in terms of measurement counts and\ncircuit depth. We show a dramatic reduction of these quantum resources compared\nto the early versions of the algorithm. We also find that our state-of-the-art\nCEO-ADAPT-VQE outperforms UCCSD, the most widely regarded static VQE ansatz, in\nall relevant metrics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
