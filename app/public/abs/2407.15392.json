In this paper, we provide an overview of our detector\nnoise characterization test bench that uses delta-doped, photon counting,\nElectron-multiplying CCDs (EMCCDs) to understand the fundamental noise\nproperties relevant to all silicon CCDs and CMOS arrays. This work attempts to\nidentify the source of the dark current plateau that has been previously\nmeasured with photon-counting EMCCDs and is known to be prevalent in other\nsilicon-based arrays. It is suspected that the plateau could be due to a\ncombination of detectable photons in the tail of blackbody radiation of the\nambient instrument, low-level light leaks, and a non-temperature-dependent\ncomponent that varies with substrate voltage. Our innovative test setup\ndelineates the effect of the ambient environment during dark measurements by\nindependently controlling the temperature of the detector and surrounding\nenvironment. We present the design of the test setup and preliminary results.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
