Newton-Okounkov bodies and tropical\ngeometry are two such combinatorial theories. As shown by Kaveh and Manon,\nthere is a certain correspondence between these two. Building on this\ncorrespondence, and exploiting the link of both theories to toric\ndegenerations, Harada and Escobar obtained their wall-crossing result for prime\ncones. This result states that moving between two adjacent prime maximal cones\nin a tropical variety corresponds to a mutation between the associated\nNewton-Okounkov bodies of these cones. In this thesis, we provide a method for\napplying the wall-crossing result to non-prime cones. Our approach uses a\nprocedure developed by Bossinger, Lamboglia, Mincheva and Mohammadi in order to\ncompute an embedding which changes a tropical variety in such a way that a\nnon-prime cone becomes prime. Assuming that adjacent cones stay adjacent, the\nwall-crossing result can then be applied in this new embedding. Building on\ncomputations by Clarke, Mohammadi and Zaffalon, we show that for Gr(3,6), this\napproach works. We compute the new embedding and its tropicalization in this\ncase, and study the relation between cones in the new embedding and the\noriginal embedding.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
