In this\npaper, we propose to employ convolutional neural networks to model the\nnon-linear relationship between the risk of lung cancer and the lungs'\nmorphology revealed in the CT images. We apply a mini-batched loss that extends\nthe Cox proportional hazards model to handle the non-convexity induced by\nneural networks, which also enables the training of large data sets.\nAdditionally, we propose to combine mini-batched loss and binary cross-entropy\nto predict both lung cancer occurrence and the risk of mortality. Simulation\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of both the mini-batched loss with and\nwithout the censoring mechanism, as well as its combination with binary\ncross-entropy. We evaluate our approach on the National Lung Screening Trial\ndata set with several 3D convolutional neural network architectures, achieving\nhigh AUC and C-index scores for lung cancer classification and survival\nprediction. These results, obtained from simulations and real data experiments,\nhighlight the potential of our approach to improving the diagnosis and\ntreatment of lung cancer.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
