Building on prior work, it\naddresses the multi-robot communication-aware trajectory planning problem using\na general optimisation framework that imposes linear constraints on changes in\nrobot positions to ensure communication performance and collision avoidance. In\nthis paper, the optimisation problem is solved distributively by separating the\ncommunication performance constraint through an economic approach. Here, the\ncurrent communication budget is distributed equally among the robots, and the\nrobots are allowed to trade parts of their budgets with each other. The\nseparated optimisation problem is then solved using the consensus alternating\ndirection method of multipliers. The method was verified through simulation in\nan inspection task problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
