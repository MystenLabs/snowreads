Intent-based management emerges as a solution to attain high level\nof automation, enabling human operators to solely communicate with the network\nthrough high-level intents. The intents consist of the targets in the form of\nexpectations (i.e., latency expectation) from a service and based on the\nexpectations the required network configurations should be done accordingly. It\nis almost inevitable that when a network action is taken to fulfill one intent,\nit can cause negative impacts on the performance of another intent, which\nresults in a conflict. In this paper, we aim to address the conflict issue and\nautonomous management of intent-based networking, and propose an online\nlearning method based on the hierarchical multi-armed bandits approach for an\neffective management. Thanks to this hierarchical structure, it performs an\nefficient exploration and exploitation of network configurations with respect\nto the dynamic network conditions. We show that our algorithm is an effective\napproach regarding resource allocation and satisfaction of intent expectations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
