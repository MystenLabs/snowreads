The results thereby obtained do hold and seem to be largely\nnew even for several interesting kernels in classical and modern potential\ntheory, which looks promising for possible applications. As an example of such\napplications, we analyze how the total mass of a measure varies under its\nbalayage with respect to fractional Green kernels.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aAgFqecElceuuh5RHTtI8dcsWok97UQH84TWbsWqutk","pdfSize":"259592"}
