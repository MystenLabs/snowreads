It turns\nout that the above Kirchhoff equation has no ground state solution.\nNonetheless, by establishing some global compact lemma and constructing a\nsuitable minimax value $c$ at a higher energy level where so called\nPalais-Smale condition holds, we succeed to obtain a positive solution for such\na problem whenever $V$ and the hole $\\mathbb{R}^{3}\\setminus\\Omega$ are\nsuitable small in some senses. To the best of our knowledge, there are few\nsimilar results published in the literature concerning the existence of\npositive solutions for Kirchhoff equation in exterior domains. Our result also\nholds true in the case $\\Omega=\\mathbb R^3$, particularly, if $a=1$ and $b=0$,\nwe improve some existing results (such as Benci, Cerami, Existence of positive\nsolutions of the equation $-\\Delta u+a(x)u=u^{(N+2)/(N-2)}$ in $\\emph{R}^{N}$,\nJ.
