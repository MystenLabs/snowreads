Using a blow up argument,\nwe prove a codimension and a cylindrical estimate, where in regions of high\ncurvature, the submanifold becomes approximately codimension one,\nquantitatively, and is weakly convex and moves by translation or is a self\nshrinker. With a decay estimate, the rescaling converges smoothly to a totally\ngeodesic limit in infinite time, without using Stampacchia iteration or\nintegral analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
