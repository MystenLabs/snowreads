In this study, we introduce $\\textbf{Fusion-LLM}$, a novel\nintegration of Large Language Models (LLMs) with classical reservoir computing\nparadigms tailored to address challenges in Inertial Confinement Fusion\n($\\texttt{ICF}$). Our approach offers several key contributions: Firstly, we\npropose the $\\textit{LLM-anchored Reservoir}$, augmented with a fusion-specific\nprompt, enabling accurate forecasting of hot electron dynamics during\nimplosion. Secondly, we develop $\\textit{Signal-Digesting Channels}$ to\ntemporally and spatially describe the laser intensity across time, capturing\nthe unique characteristics of $\\texttt{ICF}$ inputs. Lastly, we design the\n$\\textit{Confidence Scanner}$ to quantify the confidence level in forecasting,\nproviding valuable insights for domain experts to design the $\\texttt{ICF}$\nprocess. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our\nmethod, achieving 1.90 CAE, 0.14 $\\texttt{top-1}$ MAE, and 0.11\n$\\texttt{top-5}$ MAE in predicting Hard X-ray ($\\texttt{HXR}$) energies of\n$\\texttt{ICF}$ tasks, which presents state-of-the-art comparisons against\nconcurrent best systems. Additionally, we present $\\textbf{Fusion4AI}$, the\nfirst $\\texttt{ICF}$ benchmark based on physical experiments, aimed at\nfostering novel ideas in plasma physics research and enhancing the utility of\nLLMs in scientific exploration. Overall, our work strives to forge an\ninnovative synergy between AI and plasma science for advancing fusion energy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
