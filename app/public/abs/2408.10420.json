We apply the approach along the prescription in\n[Phys. Rev. C {\\bf 105}, 044329 (2022)] used to describe $K$-isomers in the\nactinide and transfermium mass regions. The calculations allow us to identify\nthe regions where proton or neutron configurations or their mixture may be\nresponsible for the $K$-isomer formation. The obtained results provide a\ndetailed test for the Skyrme SIII interaction used and outline the limits of\napplicability of the overall SHFBCS approach in the regions of well deformed\nnuclei. The study suggests that similar systematic analysis can be implemented\nin the heavier mass regions whenever enough data are available.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"dolZnmFuVVxNZTNZ_OaANpSJzLwrjhMI3DILM7mQl_g","pdfSize":"743889"}
