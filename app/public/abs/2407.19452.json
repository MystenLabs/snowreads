However, results are sometimes still inaccurate, at\nthe wrong level, or using notations and definitions not appropriate for a\nparticular course. A possible solution is augmenting the prompts with\ncourse-specific reference materials. Also, for feedback on homework solutions\nand grading exams, the problem text and the sample solution or grading rubric\ncan be injected into the prompts. Project Ethel at ETH Zurich aims to construct\na virtual teaching assistant using these practices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
