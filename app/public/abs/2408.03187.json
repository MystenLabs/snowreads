A comprehensive analysis is presented on the influence of advection and\nheterogeneous reactions, based on various values of the advection rate $c$.\nDenote by $c_m$ and $c_b$ the spreading speeds of KPP and bistable reactions,\nrespectively. When $c>-c_m$, it is shown that propagation can always occur with\nleftward spreading speed $c_m+c$ and rightward spreading speed\n$\\min\\big(\\max(c_b-c,0),c_m-c\\big)$. Moreover, a logarithmic delay of the level\nsets in the left direction is discovered. When $c \\le -c_m$, propagation\nphenomena are determined by the initial data and by the sign of $c_b$. In\nparticular, when $c_b>0$, the leftward propagation speed is $c_b+c$ if the\ninitial population is \"large enough\"; whereas extinction occurs if the initial\nvalue is located in the bistable region and is \"relatively small\". In addition,\nthe attractiveness of the bistable traveling wave is obtained when the leftward\nspreading speed is $c_b+c$ and/or when the rightward spreading speed is\n$c_b-c$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
