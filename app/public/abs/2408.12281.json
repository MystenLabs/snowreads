The new data are utilized to study\nisospin symmetry breaking phenomena}using Coulomb displacement energy (CDE) and\ntriplet displacement energy (TDE) as probes. The new mass data, either measured\nfor the first time or with greatly improved accuracy, removed several\npreviously found ``anomalies\" in the systematical behavior in the $fp$ shell.\nRemarkably, more regular odd-even staggering patterns can be established in\nboth CDE and TDE, calling for a uniform explanation in terms of\nisospin-nonconserving (INC) forces across the $sd$, $f_{7/2}$, and upper $fp$\nshells. By extending the large-scale shell-model calculation [Phys. Rev. Lett.\n\\textbf{110}, 172505 (2013)] to the upper $fp$-shell region, we found that, in\norder to describe the new data, the same INC force is required as previously\nused for the $f_{7/2}$ shell. Especially, we propose the $T=1$ TDE for those\ntriplet nuclei, that have $pp$, $nn$, and $pn$ pairs on top of a common\neven-even $N=Z$ core, to be a good indicator for the isotensor component of\nisospin violating interactions, which is estimated here to be 150 keV.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
