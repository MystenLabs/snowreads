Extracting this critical information is challenging due\nto the unstructured nature of these reports, with varied linguistic styles and\ninconsistent formatting. While proprietary LLMs like GPT-4 are effective, they\nare costly and raise privacy concerns when handling protected health\ninformation. This study presents a pipeline for developing an in-house LLM to\nextract clinical information from radiology reports. We first use GPT-4 to\ncreate a small labeled dataset, then fine-tune a Llama3-8B model on it.\nEvaluated on clinician-annotated reports, our model achieves an average F1\nscore of 84.6%, which is on par with GPT-4. Our findings demonstrate the\nfeasibility of developing an in-house LLM that not only matches GPT-4's\nperformance but also offers cost reductions and enhanced data privacy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
