The\nmodel features smoking gun signals involving same-sign di-leptons and jets that\nmay be the primary observable channel in certain regions of the parameter\nspace. The flavour composition of final-state charged leptons in the minimal\nmodel is related to the origin of neutrino masses and is correlated with other\nrare processes, such as neutrinoless double beta decay. We review existing\ncollider limits and provide sensitivity estimates from LNV signals at upcoming\nruns of the LHC, for zero and non-zero mass splittings between the scalar\ntriplet components.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
