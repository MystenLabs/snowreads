We show that given any degrees $d_1,d_2\\geq2$, outside a\nZariski closed subset of the space of pairs of rational maps $(f,g)$ of degree\n$d_1$ and $d_2$ respectively, the maps $f$ and $g$ share at most a uniformly\nbounded number of common preperiodic points. This generalizes a result of\nDeMarco and Mavraki to maps of possibly different degrees. Our main\ncontribution is the use of H\\\"older properties of the Green function of a\nrational map to obtain height estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
