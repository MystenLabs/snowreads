We show that two entire maps fixing the origin\nshare the set of preperiodic points, whenever these maps generate a semigroup\nwhich contains neither free nor free abelian non-cyclic subsemigroups and one\nof the maps has the origin as a superattracting fixed point. We show that a\nsubgroup of formal series generated by rational elements is amenable, whenever\ncontains no free non-cyclic subsemigroup generated by rational elements. We\nprove that a left-amenable semigroup S of entire maps admits a invariant\nprobability measure for a continuous extension of S on the Stone-Cech\ncompactification of the complex plane. Finally, given an entire map f, we\nassociate a semigroup S such that f admits no ergodic fixed point of the Ruelle\noperator, whenever every finitely generated subsemigroup of S admits a\nleft-amenable Ruelle representation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
