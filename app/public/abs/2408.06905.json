To this end, we first\ndetermine the analytic expression of the spectral function of the unstable\nstate, which allows for an accurate evaluation of $P(t)$. As expected, for\nshort and long times $P(t)$ shows deviations from the exponential law: a `Zeno'\nregion occurs at extremely short times (up to $\\sim 0.3$ attosec, followed by a\nlonger `anti-Zeno' domain (up to $\\sim 50$ attosec); at long times above $125\n\\tau$, the decay law scales as $t^{-4}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
