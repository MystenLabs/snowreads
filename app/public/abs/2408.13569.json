The transverse momentum dependent parton distributions\n(TMDs) of the $\\rho$ meson are derived from the overlap representations of the\nLFWFs. We investigate the $\\bm{k}_{\\perp}$-weighted moments and the\n$x$-dependent average transverse momentum $\\langle\nk_{\\perp}^n(x)\\rangle_{\\alpha}$ of $\\rho$ meson TMDs, $\\langle\nk_{\\perp}^n(x)\\rangle_{\\alpha}$ shows the typical transverse momenta of quark\nTMDs in our model. Our findings indicate that the average transverse momenta of\n$\\langle k_{\\perp}(x)\\rangle_{\\alpha}$ fall within the range of $[0.3, 0.45]$\nGeV, while $\\langle k_{\\perp}^2(x)\\rangle_{\\alpha}$ are in the region of\n$[0.15, 0.30]$ GeV. Our TMDs and parton distribution function (PDFs) satisfy\nthe positive constraints very well. The spin densities inside the $\\rho$ meson\nin the transverse momentum space are investigated, the results show that the\nquark and the target polarized in the longitudinal or in the transverse\ndirections the distribution are axially symmetric. The unpolarized symmetric\ndistribution when the quark is longitudinally polarized and the target is\ntransversely polarized, or on the contrary exhibit the dipolar distortions. The\nresults of TMDs from LFWFs and the covariant approach are compared. The results\nshow that TMDs from LFWFs satisfy the positive constraints better than TMDs\nfrom the covariant approach. The $x$-moments of $\\rho$ meson PDFs, $\\langle\nx\\rangle_{g_L}$ is larger than the covariant approach. In addition, the quark\nspin densities of the $\\rho$ meson, particularly the $\\rho_{\\uparrow\n\\downarrow}\\left(k_x,k_y\\right)=f-\\frac{1}{3}f_{LL}-g_L$ in the covariant\napproach it is negative, but $\\rho_{\\uparrow \\downarrow}\\left(k_x,k_y\\right)$\nfrom LFWFs is positive.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ybvpvNwwvKv6o0CA_O6sLN4R402MIrTnr_zboML00UQ","pdfSize":"8285480"}
