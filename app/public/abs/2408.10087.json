As in prior work, the results obtained\noften depend fundamentally on the choice between NP$_1$ and NP$_2$ product\nadjacencies. We explore algebraic properties of digital H-spaces preserved\nunder digital homotopy equivalence, and we give a general construction that\nproduces examples of digital H-spaces which are not homotopy-equivalent to\ndigital topological groups in both categories. Further, we show that this\nconstruction essentially classifies all NP$_2$-digital H-spaces. In a short\nappendix, we resolve a question that was left unresolved in [17], and complete\nthe full classification of digital topological groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
