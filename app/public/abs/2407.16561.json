We investigate the qubit objects\ncorresponding to number projection operators in the standard Jordan-Wigner\nfermion-to-qubit mapping, and prove a number of their properties. This reveals\nconnections between these operators and the generalised binomial coefficients\noriginally introduced by Kravchuk in his research on orthogonal polynomials.\nThe generalized binomial coefficients are visualized in a Pascal's pyramid\nstructure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZvZ_0Lwu2xacpM-xuCVjHcl6566nBLQXrBD_58ycyuI","pdfSize":"1453928"}
