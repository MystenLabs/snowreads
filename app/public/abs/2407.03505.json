Here, the dressing of an\nimpurity in a one-dimensional dipolar supersolid with the excitations of the\nsupersolid is studied. The ground-state energy of the supersolid polaron is\ncalculated using a variational path integral approach, which obtained accurate\nresults for other polaron systems within the Bogoliubov and Fr\\\"ohlich\napproximations. A divergence is observed at the superfluid-supersolid phase\ntransition. The polaron radius is also computed, showing that for strong\nimpurity-atom interactions, the polaron can become localized to a single\ndroplet, behaving like a small solid-state polaron.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
