Here for the first time we propose\nand investigate the possibility of probing the spin of Sgr A* with two or more\npulsars that are in orbits with larger orbital periods, $P_b\\sim 2- 5\\,{\\rm\nyr}$, which represents a more realistic situation from population estimates. We\ndevelop a novel method for directly determining the spin of Sgr A* from the\ntiming observables of two pulsars and it can be readily extended for combining\nmore pulsars. With extensive mock data simulations, we show that combining a\nsecond pulsar improves the spin measurement by $2-3$ orders of magnitude in\nsome situations, which is comparable to timing a pulsar in a very tight orbit.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ayHKfow_NXW5eIZP8huX639prkjj0e3VNNr1G4ZIyvs","pdfSize":"353491"}
