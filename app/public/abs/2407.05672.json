By\ntuning the phase difference between the two coupling points to match the\npropagation phase at the driving frequency, chiral cavity-waveguide\ninteractions are achieved, enabling the deterministic generation of photons\nwith nontrivial statistics only for a single incident direction. This\nnontrivial-statistical photons can be produced even in the strong dissipation\nregime due to the interference between reflected and transmitted photons\npropagating between the coupling points. Our investigation encompasses a broad\nrange of distances between the coupling points, incorporating non-Markovian\neffects. Notably, at a phase difference of $\\pi/2$, the system's dynamics\nbecome exactly Markovian, while the output field retains non-Markovian\ncharacteristics. Under these conditions, we analyze nonreciprocal dissipative\nphase transitions driven by a strong external field and elucidate the influence\nof the non-Markovian effect. Our results offer valuable insights for the\nadvancement of nonreciprocal photon devices and deterministic photon\ngenerations, providing a deeper understanding of dissipative phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
