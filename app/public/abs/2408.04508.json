We analyze the effect of tightness on wages by combining social security\ndata with unusually rich information on vacancies and job seekers. Instrumental\nvariable regressions reveal positive elasticities between 0.004 and 0.011,\nimplying that higher tightness explains between 7 and 19 percent of the real\nwage increase. We report greater elasticities for new hires, high-skilled\nworkers, the Eastern German labor market, and the service sector. In\nparticular, tightness raised wages at the bottom of the wage distribution,\ncontributing to the decline in wage inequality over the last decade.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
