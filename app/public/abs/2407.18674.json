When the fibre ends are left open to\natmosphere, this loss feature dissipates over time. The loss matches the\nabsorption spectrum of gaseous (molecular) chlorine and, given enough time, the\ntransmission spectrum of the fibre recovers to that expected from the\nmorphological structure of the fibre. Our measurements indicate an initial\nchlorine concentration of 0.45 $\\mu$ mol/cm$^{3}$ in the hollow core,\nequivalent to 1.1 mol% Cl$_{2}$ at atmospheric pressure.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
