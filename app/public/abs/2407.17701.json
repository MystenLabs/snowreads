Our main result is then that this chaos occurs in the first case\nas either on an isolated or non-isolated singularity. In the first case this\nchaos is either boundary chaos or spherical chaos which is what happens also in\nthe non-singular case. In the case of an isolated singular geometry one has\nchaos which can either be boundary, spherical or tubular chaos. We furthermore\nprove that the prime numbers display quantum behaviour.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
