This article is written for both quantum chemists and\nquantum information theorists. In particular, we attempt to summarize the\ndomain of quantum chemistry problems as well as the chemical intuition that is\napplied to solve them within concrete statements (such as a classical heuristic\ncost conjecture and a classification of different avenues for quantum\nadvantage) in the hope that this may stimulate future analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
