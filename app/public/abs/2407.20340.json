This WZW term, unlike its familiar cousin\nin QCD, does not match any chiral anomaly, so its microscopic origin is not\nobviously QCD-like. We find that generalised symmetries provide a key to\nunlocking a UV completion. The $S^2$ winding number bestows the theory with a\n1-form symmetry, and the WZW term intertwines this with the $\\mathrm{SU}(N)^2$\nflavour symmetry into a 2-group global symmetry. Like a 't Hooft anomaly, the\n2-group symmetry should match between UV and IR, precluding QCD-like\ncompletions that otherwise give the right pion manifold. We instead construct a\nweakly-coupled UV completion that matches the 2-group symmetry, in which an\nabelian gauge field connects the QCD baryon number current to the winding\nnumber current of a $\\mathbb{C}P^1$ model, and explicitly show how the mixed\nWZW term arises upon flowing to the IR. The coefficient is fixed to be the\nnumber of QCD colours and, strikingly, this matching must be 'tree-level exact'\nto satisfy a quantization condition. We discuss generalisations, and elucidate\nthe more intricate generalised symmetry structure that arises upon gauging an\nanomaly-free subgroup of $\\mathrm{SU}(N)_{L+R}$. This WZW term may even play a\nphenomenological role as a portal to a dark sector, that determines the relic\nabundance of dark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2ad-A72bfjIbSeYUwWi778DpdZRiKs-J78d-m9WFGt0","pdfSize":"721641"}
