In particular, the electromagnetic field, temperature field and\nmechanical deformation interact with each other during quench of high-field\nmagnets. Accurate analysis of coupling behaviours becomes the key to designing\nmagnets and quench protection. In this paper, a multi-physics coupling model is\nproposed based on T-A formulation with Neumann boundary conditions. It is\nconvenient to analyse the effects of deformation and temperature on the\nelectromagnetic field, as well as the redistribution of the current between the\ndifferent layers during quench.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
