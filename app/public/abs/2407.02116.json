Specifically, we prove a Maz'ya-type result, where we\ncharacterize the space of Hardy weights for $ p $-Schr\\\"odinger operators via a\ngeneralized capacity. The novel ingredient in the proof is the demonstration\nthat the simplified energy of the $ p $-Schr\\\"odinger energy functional is\ncompatible with certain normal contractions. As a consequence, we obtain a\nnecessary integrability criterion for Hardy weights. Finally, using some tools\nof criticality theory, we investigate the existence of minimizers in the Hardy\ninequalities and discuss relations to Cheeger type estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
