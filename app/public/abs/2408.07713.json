There is one serious limitation of the simulations conducted by\nLuebbert and Pachter, and two flaws that compromise their findings. The\nreported R-squared value of Srinivasan. et al. is within the expected range, as\nfar as that can be determined given the limitations of the available data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FafeV3LLU54k7caMLqiquH8H0erZHp1Zr5V1Wfge8Nw","pdfSize":"310220"}
