A signed Roman dominating function (SRDF) on a graph $G$ is a function\n$f: V \\rightarrow \\{-1, 1, 2\\}$ that satisfies two conditions: (i) $\\sum_{y\\in\nN[x]} f(y)\\geq1$ for each $x\\in V$, where the set $N[x]$ is the closed\nneighborhood of $x$ consisting of $x$ and vertices of $V$ that are adjacent to\n$x$, and (ii) each vertex $x\\in V$ where $f(x) = -1$ is adjacent to at least\none vertex $y\\in V$ where $f(y)=2$. The weight of a SRDF is the sum of its\nfunction values over all vertices. The signed Roman domination number of $G$,\ndenoted by $\\gamma_{SR}(G)$, is the minimum weight of a SRDF on $G$. In this\npaper, we investigate the signed Roman domination number of the Ladder graph\n$LG_n$, the circular Ladder graph $CL_n$ and their complements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
