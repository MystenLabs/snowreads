In this context, we study the surface adsorption\nprofiles of a symmetric binary liquid confined to a slit pore by means of\nmolecular dynamics simulations; the latter naturally entails that mass and\nconcentration are locally conserved. Near a bulk consolute point, where the\nliquid exhibits a demixing transition with the local concentration as the order\nparameter, we determine the order parameter profiles and characterise the\nrelevant critical scaling behaviour, in the regime of strong surface\nattraction, for a range of pore widths and temperatures. The obtained order\nparameter profiles decay monotonically near the surfaces, also in the presence\nof a pronounced layering in the number density. Overall, our results agree\nqualitatively with recent theoretical predictions from a mesoscopic\nfield-theoretical approach for the canonical ensemble.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
