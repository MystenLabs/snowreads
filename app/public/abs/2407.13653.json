The ensuing semiorthogonal decompositions are compatible with the\nBruhat order on Weyl groups. The terms of full exceptional collections are a\npriori complexes of coherent sheaves; the question whether they are actually\ncoherent sheaves is to be investigated further. The construction builds upon\nthe foundational results on $B$-modules from the works of Mathieu, Polo, and\nvan der Kallen, and upon properties of the Steinberg basis of the\n$T$-equivariant $\\sf K$-theory of $G/B$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
