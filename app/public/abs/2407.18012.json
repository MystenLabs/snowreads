As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that\nresolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at\nwhich magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on\napproximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we\noutline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the\nmany issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical\nimplementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding\ncrucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future\nnumerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star\nparameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under\nextreme conditions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"81MLWPHDaWb7qRIzUq6KHfImu74gVr1eI_aUND07Bo0","pdfSize":"281036"}
