We introduce PaveCap, a novel\nframework for automated pavement condition assessment. The framework consists\nof two main parts: a Single-Shot PCI Estimation Network and a Dense Captioning\nNetwork. The PCI Estimation Network uses YOLOv8 for object detection, the\nSegment Anything Model (SAM) for zero-shot segmentation, and a four-layer\nconvolutional neural network to predict PCI. The Dense Captioning Network uses\na YOLOv8 backbone, a Transformer encoder-decoder architecture, and a\nconvolutional feed-forward module to generate detailed descriptions of pavement\nconditions. To train and evaluate these networks, we developed a pavement\ndataset with bounding box annotations, textual annotations, and PCI values. The\nresults of our PCI Estimation Network showed a strong positive correlation\n(0.70) between predicted and actual PCIs, demonstrating its effectiveness in\nautomating condition assessment. Also, the Dense Captioning Network produced\naccurate pavement condition descriptions, evidenced by high BLEU (0.7445), GLEU\n(0.5893), and METEOR (0.7252) scores. Additionally, the dense captioning model\nhandled complex scenarios well, even correcting some errors in the ground truth\ndata. The framework developed here can greatly improve infrastructure\nmanagement and decision18 making in pavement maintenance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AcALJbGjiSMRl0BVtOzbHC0qEXrIWcSSGZ-JFSzeJZU","pdfSize":"2068204"}
