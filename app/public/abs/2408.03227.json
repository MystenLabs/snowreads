The\nLHCb collaboration reported the results of direct CP asymmetry measurements in\n$D^0\\to K^+ K^-$ and $D^0\\to \\pi^+\\pi^-$ decays with unprecedented accuracy:\n$a_{\\rm{CP}}(K^+ K^-)=(7.7\\pm5.7)\\times 10^{-4}$ and\n$a_{\\rm{CP}}(\\pi^+\\pi^-)=(23.2\\pm6.1)\\times 10^{-4}$, with the latter quantity\ninferred from the precise measurement of $\\Delta a_{\\rm{CP}} =\\,\na_{\\rm{CP}}(K^+ K^-) -a_{\\rm{CP}}(\\pi^+\\pi^-) =\\, (-15.7\\pm2.9)\\times 10^{-4}$.\nWhen interpreted within the Standard Model, these values indicate a breakdown\nof the approximate $U$-spin symmetry of QCD. If, however, this symmetry holds\nand the data stem from new physics, other CP asymmetries should be enhanced as\nwell. We derive CP asymmetry sum rules based on $\\rm{SU}(3)$ flavor symmetry\nfor $D$ meson decays into a pair of pseudoscalar mesons as well as a pair of a\npseudoscalar and a vector meson for two generic scenarios, with $\\Delta U=0$\nand $|\\Delta U|=1$ interactions, respectively. The correlations implied by the\nsum rules can be used to check the consistency between different measurements\nand to discriminate between these scenarios with future data. For instance, we\nfind $a_{\\mathrm{CP}}(\\pi^{+}K^{* 0}) + a_{\\mathrm{CP}}(K^{+}\\overline{K}^{*\n0}) = 0$ for $\\Delta U=0$ new physics and the opposite relative sign for the\n$|\\Delta U|=1$ case. One sum rule, connecting four decay modes, holds in both\nscenarios. We further extend our sum rules to certain differences of CP\nasymmetries from which the $D$ production asymmetries drop out.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
