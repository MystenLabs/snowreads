This paper proposes an\nenhanced RPL routing mechanismby integrating the Tabu Search optimization\nalgorithm to address theseissues. The proposed approach focuses on optimizing\nthe parent and childselection process in the RPL protocol, leveraging a\ncomposite cost func-tion that incorporates key parameters including Residual\nEnergy, Trans-mission Energy, Distance to Sink, Hop Count, Expected\nTransmissionCount (ETX), and Link Stability Rate. Through extensive\nsimulations,we demonstrate that our method significantly improves link\nstability, re-duces energy consumption, and enhances the packet delivery ratio,\nleadingto a more efficient and longer-lasting IoT network. The findings\nsuggestthat Tabu Search can effectively balance the trade-offs inherent in\nIoTrouting, providing a practical solution for improving the overall\nperfor-mance of RPL-based networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
