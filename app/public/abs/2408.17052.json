One effective solution to enhance this\nability is to train the models with manually-blended data, which we termed\n\"blendfake\", encouraging models to learn generic forgery artifacts like\nblending boundary. Interestingly, current SoTA methods utilize blendfake\nwithout incorporating any deepfake data in their training process. This is\nlikely because previous empirical observations suggest that vanilla hybrid\ntraining (VHT), which combines deepfake and blendfake data, results in inferior\nperformance to methods using only blendfake data (so-called \"1+1<2\").\nTherefore, a critical question arises: Can we leave deepfake behind and rely\nsolely on blendfake data to train an effective deepfake detector? Intuitively,\nas deepfakes also contain additional informative forgery clues (e.g., deep\ngenerative artifacts), excluding all deepfake data in training deepfake\ndetectors seems counter-intuitive. In this paper, we rethink the role of\nblendfake in detecting deepfakes and formulate the process from \"real to\nblendfake to deepfake\" to be a progressive transition. Specifically, blendfake\nand deepfake can be explicitly delineated as the oriented pivot anchors between\n\"real-to-fake\" transitions. The accumulation of forgery information should be\noriented and progressively increasing during this transition process. To this\nend, we propose an Oriented Progressive Regularizor (OPR) to establish the\nconstraints that compel the distribution of anchors to be discretely arranged.\nFurthermore, we introduce feature bridging to facilitate the smooth transition\nbetween adjacent anchors. Extensive experiments confirm that our design allows\nleveraging forgery information from both blendfake and deepfake effectively and\ncomprehensively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
