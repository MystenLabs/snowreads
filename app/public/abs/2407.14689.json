Using the\ncorner-transfer-matrix renormalization group (CTMRG) method, we demonstrate\nthat the boundary correlation function exhibits power-law decay with\nquasi-periodic oscillation, while the bulk correlation function always decays\nexponentially. On the basis of the geometric relation between the bulk\ncorrelation path and distance along the outer edge boundary, we find that\nscaling dimensions for the boundary correlation function can be well explained\nby the combination of the bulk correlation length and background curvatures\ninherent to the hyperbolic lattice. We also investigate the cutoff effect of\nthe bond dimension in CTMRG, revealing that the long-distance behavior of the\nboundary spin correlation is accurately described even with a small bond\ndimension. In contrast, the sort-distance behavior rapidly loses its accuracy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
