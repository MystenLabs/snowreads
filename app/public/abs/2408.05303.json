Thus, it is important to fully identify the\nhard X-ray sky source population to accurately characterize the individual\ncontribution of different AGNs to the overall CXB emission. We present a\nfollow-up analysis of all the 218 sources marked as unidentified in our\nprevious revision of the third release of the Palermo Swift-BAT hard X-ray\ncatalog (3PBC) based on our multifrequency classification scheme. These 218\nsources were classified as unidentified in our previous analyses because they\nlack an assigned low-energy counterpart. We searched for soft X-ray\ncounterparts of these 218 3PBC sources in archival Swift-XRT observations\nobtained between 2005 January 1st and 2018 August 1st. In particular, we found\n1213 archival Swift-XRT observations for 192 of the 218 unidentified sources.\nWe found 93 possible Swift-XRT counterparts inside of the Swift-BAT positional\nuncertainty regions. These correspond to 73 3PBC sources, where 60 have only a\nsingle Swift-XRT detection, and 13 sources have multiple detections. We present\na catalog of all the detected possible counterparts of the yet unidentified\nhard X-ray sources to the community as a catalog for future spectroscopic\nfollow-up targets, together with a short catalog of our classification of the\nten sources for which we found available spectra.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
