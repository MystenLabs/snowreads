This discussion included much debated\nscenarios about the imminent rise of so-called \"super-human\" AI, i.e., AI\nsystems that are orders of magnitude smarter than humans. In the spirit of Alan\nTuring, there is no doubt that current state-of-the-art language models already\npass his famous test. Moreover, current models outperform humans in several\nbenchmark tests, so that publicly available LLMs have already become versatile\ncompanions that connect everyday life, industry and science. Despite their\nimpressive capabilities, LLMs sometimes fail completely at tasks that are\nthought to be trivial for humans. In other cases, the trustworthiness of LLMs\nbecomes much more elusive and difficult to evaluate. Taking the example of\nacademia, language models are capable of writing convincing research articles\non a given topic with only little input. Yet, the lack of trustworthiness in\nterms of factual consistency or the existence of persistent hallucinations in\nAI-generated text bodies has led to a range of restrictions for AI-based\ncontent in many scientific journals. In view of these observations, the\nquestion arises as to whether the same metrics that apply to human intelligence\ncan also be applied to computational methods and has been discussed\nextensively. In fact, the choice of metrics has already been shown to\ndramatically influence assessments on potential intelligence emergence. Here,\nwe argue that the intelligence of LLMs should not only be assessed by\ntask-specific statistical metrics, but separately in terms of qualitative and\nquantitative measures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
