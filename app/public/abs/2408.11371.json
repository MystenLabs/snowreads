In this paper, we introduce the\npossibility to encode decision theory problems with Probabilistic Answer Set\nProgramming under the credal semantics via decision atoms and utility\nattributes. To solve the task we propose an algorithm based on three layers of\nAlgebraic Model Counting, that we test on several synthetic datasets against an\nalgorithm that adopts answer set enumeration. Empirical results show that our\nalgorithm can manage non trivial instances of programs in a reasonable amount\nof time.
