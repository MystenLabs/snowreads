We\ncombine our radio observation with archival optical and infrared data to\ninvestigate the star formation and AGN population within $R_{200}$ ($R = $ 0.8\nMpc) of the cluster centre. Using three selection criteria; the radio\nluminosity, the far-infrared radio ratio ($q_{\\rm{IR}}$) and the mid-infrared\ncolour, we distinguish galaxies with radio emission predominantly powered by\nstar formation from that powered by AGNs. We selected 24 cluster members within\n$R_{\\rm{200}}$ in the MeerKAT image based on either their photometric or\nspectroscopic redshift. We classified 12/24 ($50\\%$) as galaxies whose radio\nemission is dominated by star-formation activity, 6/24 ($25\\%$) as intermediate\nstar-forming galaxies and 6/24 ($25\\%$) as AGN-dominated galaxies. Using the\nradio continuum luminosities of the star-forming cluster galaxies, we estimated\nan integrated star formation rate (SFR) value of 1700 $\\pm$ 330\nM$_{\\odot}$yr$^{-1}$ within $R_{200}$. We derived a mass-normalized integrated\nSFR value of $(570 \\pm 110) \\times 10^{-14}$ yr$^{-1}$. This supports previous\nobservational and theoretical studies that indicated a rapid increase in star\nformation activity within the core of high-redshift clusters. We also show that\nthe high AGN fraction within the cluster core is consistent with previous\ncluster observations at $z >$ 1.5.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
