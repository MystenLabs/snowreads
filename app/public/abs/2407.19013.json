This discrepancy arises from a fundamental difference\nbetween QH droplets and Coulomb gases (CGs): the former are incompressible\nliquids subject to area-preserving deformations, while the latter are governed\nby electrostatics and thus involve conformal transformations. We illustrate\nthis QH/CG mismatch across various examples and show its impact on physical\nquantities, measurable in both solid-state samples and quantum simulators.\nSpecifically, we discuss fluctuations of local observables and their connection\nto state-of-the-art microwave absorption experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
