Recent\nnumerical investigations uncovered the occurrence of a Hyper-Auxetic Transition\n(HAT) ($\\nu=-1$) for low-crosslinked hydrogels at low temperature, accompanied\nby a critical-like behavior. Here, we perform extensive numerical simulations\nto unveil the relation between these two transitions. We find that the HAT\noccurs at different temperatures $T$ up to a maximum value of the crosslinker\nconcentration $c$, thus being clearly distinct from the VPT, taking place at\nfixed $T$ and for all $c$. Our results provide novel fundamental insights on\nthe interplay between network collapse and mechanical properties of these\nfascinating materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l1k7U2ojtT1ZMqiKbOa3i4sotnicOG3DTZXKQtGW_rA","pdfSize":"1458662"}
