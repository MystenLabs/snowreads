In soft matter, the most commonly observed\nquasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares\nand triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings\nnearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an\nadditional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus\ndefects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a\nnovel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to\nallow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that\nrhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the\nquasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the\ncritical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
