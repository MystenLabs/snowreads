Here,\nwe have a partially unknown data of the system, and the problem consists in\nfinding controls such that a specific functional is insensitive for small\nperturbations of the initial data. More precisely, the functional considered\nhere depends on the norm of the state in a subset of the bulk together with the\nnorm of the tangential gradient of the state on the boundary. This problem is\nequivalent to a (relaxed) null controllability problem for an optimality system\nof cascade type, with a zeroth-order coupling term in the bulk and a\nsecond-order coupling term on the boundary. To achieve this result, we\nlinearize the system around the origin and analyze it by the duality approach\nand we prove a new Carleman estimate for the corresponding adjoint system.\nThen, a local null controllability result for the nonlinear system is proven by\nusing an inverse function theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
