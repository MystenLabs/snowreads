Novel methodologies are\nconstructed for constructing k-uniform mixed states with the highest possible\npurity. By using the orthogonal partition of orthogonal arrays, a series of new\n$k$-uniform mixed states is derived. Consequently, an infinite number of\nhigher-dimensional k-uniform mixed states, including those with highest purity,\ncan be generated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EA7Dnf3RNhSaAq0hXwRjgIOH4webCJndat62o79yj6Q","pdfSize":"240313"}
