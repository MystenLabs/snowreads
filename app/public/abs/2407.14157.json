For instance, the motion of\nsolutes through biological channels is facilitated by specialized proteins that\ncreate water-filled channels and valuable insights can be obtained by studying\nthe transition paths of particles through a channel and gathering statistics on\ntheir lifetimes within the channel or their exit probabilities. In a similar\nvein, we consider a one-dimensional model of channel-facilitated transport\nwhere a diffusive particle is subject to attractive interactions with the walls\nwithin a limited region of the channel. We study the statistics of conditional\nand unconditional escape times, in the presence of resetting--an intermittent\ndynamics that brings the particle back to its initial coordinate randomly. We\ndetermine analytically the physical conditions under which such resetting\nmechanism can become beneficial for faster escape of the particles from the\nchannel thus enhancing the transport. Our theory has been verified with the aid\nof Brownian dynamics simulations for various interaction strengths and extent.\nThe overall results presented herein highlight the scope of resetting-based\nstrategies to be universally promising for complex transport processes of\nsingle or long molecules through biological membranes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nV16RVQSQD8BVLhjdSW4rlzSXRj1doiNHCGNcsPY7_I","pdfSize":"1720416"}
