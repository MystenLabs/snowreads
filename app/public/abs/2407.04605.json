It can be viewed as a generalization of\nboth independent component analysis and linear structural equation models. We\nstudy the identifiability of linear causal disentanglement, assuming access to\ndata under multiple contexts, each given by an intervention on a latent\nvariable. We show that one perfect intervention on each latent variable is\nsufficient and in the worst case necessary to recover parameters under perfect\ninterventions, generalizing previous work to allow more latent than observed\nvariables. We give a constructive proof that computes parameters via a coupled\ntensor decomposition. For soft interventions, we find the equivalence class of\nlatent graphs and parameters that are consistent with observed data, via the\nstudy of a system of polynomial equations. Our results hold assuming the\nexistence of non-zero higher-order cumulants, which implies non-Gaussianity of\nvariables.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
