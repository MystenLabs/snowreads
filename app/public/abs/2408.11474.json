We assume that $ \\nu $ is proximal, strongly irreducible and\nthat $ \\nu^{*n}\\{0\\}=0 $ for all integers $ n\\in\\mathbb{N} $. We consider the\nrandom sequence $ \\overline\\gamma_n := \\gamma_0 \\cdots \\gamma_{n-1} $ for $\n(\\gamma_k)_{k \\ge 0} $ independents of distribution law $ \\nu $. We define the\nlogarithmic singular gap as $ \\mathrm{sqz} = \\log\\left( \\frac{\\mu_1}{\\mu_2}\n\\right) $ , where $ \\mu_1 $ and $ \\mu_2 $ are the two largest singular values.\nWe show that $ (\\mathrm{sqz}(\\overline{\\gamma}_n))_{n\\in\\mathbb{N}} $ escapes\nto infinity linearly and satisfies exponential large deviations estimates below\nits escape rate. With the same assumptions, we also show that the image of a\ngeneric line by $ \\overline{\\gamma}_n $ as well as its eigenspace of maximal\neigenvalue both converge to the same random line $l_\\infty $ at an exponential\nspeed.If we moreover assume that the push-forward distribution $N(\\nu)$ is $\n\\mathrm{L}^p $ for $ N:g\\mapsto\\log\\left(\\|g\\|\\|g^{-1}\\|\\right) $ and for some\n$ p\\ge 1 $, then we show that $ \\log|w(l_\\infty)| $ is $ \\mathrm{L}^p $ for all\nunitary linear form $ w $ and the logarithm of each coefficient of $\n\\overline{\\gamma}_n $ is almost surely equivalent to the logarithm of the norm.\nTo prove these results, we do not rely on any classical results for random\nproducts of invertible matrices with $ \\mathrm{L}^1 $ moment assumption.\nInstead we describe an effective way to group the i.i.d factors into i.i.d\nrandom words that are aligned in the Cartan projection. We moreover have an\nexplicit control over the moments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
