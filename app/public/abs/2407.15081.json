It is crucial to\nunderstand the mechanisms of sliding ferroelectricity and to deterministically\nand efficiently switch the polarization with optimized electric fields. Here,\napplying our newly developed DREAM-Allegro multi-task equivariant neural\nnetwork, which simultaneously predicts interatomic potentials and Born\neffective charges, we construct a comprehensive potential for boron nitride\n($\\mathrm{BN}$) bilayer. The molecular dynamics simulations reveal a remarkably\nhigh Curie temperature of up to 1500K, facilitated by robust intralayer\nchemical bonds and delicate interlayer van der Waals(vdW) interactions. More\nimportantly, it is found that, compared to the out-of-plane electric field, the\ninclined field not only leads to deterministic switching of electric\npolarization, but also largely lower the critical strength of field, due to the\npresence of the in-plane polarization in the transition state. This strategy of\nan inclined field is demonstrated to be universal for other sliding\nferroelectric systems with monolayer structures belonging to the symmetry group\n$p \\bar{6} m 2$, such as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
