A Python-based verification environment capitalizes on open-source\nframeworks such as PyUVM providing Python-based UVM 1.2 implementation and\nPyVSC facilitating constrained randomization and functional coverage. These\nlibraries play a pivotal role in expediting test development and hold promise\nfor reducing setup costs. The goal of this paper is to evaluate the\neffectiveness of PyUVM verification testbenches across various design IPs,\naiming for a comprehensive comparison of their features and performance metrics\nwith the established SystemVerilog-UVM methodology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
