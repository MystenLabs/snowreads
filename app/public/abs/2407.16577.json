The most significant contribution comes\nfrom the $z_3$ dependence induced by ultraviolet (UV) renormalization of the\nWilson line. We demonstrate that the next-to-leading order perturbative\ncalculations of the renormalization factor can describe, to a few percent\naccuracy, the lattice QCD rest frame matrix elements with separations up to\ndistances of 0.6~fm on multiple lattice spacings. The residual discrepancies\ncan be modeled by a leading effect from the structure of the nucleon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yhmsIDc4LRzuV5U5Y3O-pP6a8-8sdkUuqR7KVKRO75g","pdfSize":"5412618"}
