We employ a semi-analytical numerical method that solves vapor-liquid\nequilibrium using the Redlich-Kwong and Peng-Robinson equation of state to\ncalculate the saturation pressure of water. The deviation from the ideal gas\nlaw is quantified and examined through saturation pressure isotherms. We find\nthat at low temperatures, lighter gases such as helium show little deviation\nfrom the ideal gas law, whereas heavier gases such as nitrogen deviate\nsignificantly. As temperature increases, the difference between the gases\ndecreases. The results suggest that in areas of low temperature, the non-ideal\nnature of gases must be taken into account.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
