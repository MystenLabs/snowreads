In this study, we examine the community structure\nof re-post networks within the context of a polarized political environment at\ntwo different times. We specifically identify individuals who consistently\nswitch between opposing communities and analyze the key features that\ndistinguish them. Our investigation focuses on two crucial aspects of these\nusers: the topological properties of their interactions and the political bias\nin the content of their posts. Our analysis is based on a dataset comprising 2\nmillion tweets related to US President Donald Trump, coupled with data from\nover 100 000 individual user accounts spanning the 2020 US presidential\nelection year. Our findings indicate that individuals who switch communities\nexhibit disparities compared to those who remain within the same communities,\nboth in terms of the topological aspects of their interaction patterns\n(pagerank, degree, betweenness centrality.) and in the sentiment bias of their\ncontent towards Donald Trump.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
