The notion is also relevant for\nalgebraically independent families of polynomials in the Cox ring. We provide a\ngeneralisation of the Saito criterion for the freeness of the toric logarithmic\nsheaf. We explain the relationship between this sheaf and the usual sheaf of\nlogarithmic vector fields and the connection with holomorphic foliations on\ntoric varieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
