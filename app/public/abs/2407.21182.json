This system features an off-axis Mach-Zehnder\ninterferometer and bulk acoustic waves to capture cell mechanics. It employs\nhigh-resolution components to create detailed interferograms and allows\ncontinuous imaging of cell deformation. Unlike conventional techniques, our\nmethod provides high-throughput, label-free measurements while preserving cell\nintegrity. Polyacrylamide beads are tested for high precision, highlighting the\npotential of the system in early cancer detection, disease monitoring, and\nmechanobiological research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
