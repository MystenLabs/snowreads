They however pose a threat to the industry\ndue to personality rights concerns. As such, methods to identify the original\nsinger in synthetic voices are needed. In this paper, we investigate how singer\nidentification methods could be used for such a task. We present three\nembedding models that are trained using a singer-level contrastive learning\nscheme, where positive pairs consist of segments with vocals from the same\nsingers. These segments can be mixtures for the first model, vocals for the\nsecond, and both for the third. We demonstrate that all three models are highly\ncapable of identifying real singers. However, their performance deteriorates\nwhen classifying cloned versions of singers in our evaluation set. This is\nespecially true for models that use mixtures as an input. These findings\nhighlight the need to understand the biases that exist within singer\nidentification systems, and how they can influence the identification of voice\ndeepfakes in music.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_-aq3dE0WZJhehEszMJd4EcpUaRp0pe-rMi9BPT_txE","pdfSize":"940511"}
