They ensure that their application and code pages are confidential,\ntamper proof and immune to diverse types of attacks. In 2021, Intel suddenly\nannounced its plans to deprecate its most trustworthy enclave, SGX, on its 11th\nand 12th generation processors. The reasons stemmed from the fact that it was\ndifficult to scale the enclaves (sandboxes) beyond 256 MB as the hardware\noverheads outweighed the benefits. Competing solutions by Intel and other\nvendors are much more scalable, but do not provide many key security guarantees\nthat SGX used to provide notably replay attack protection. In the last three\nyears, no proposal from industry or academia has been able to provide both\nscalability (with a modest slowdown) as well as replay-protection on generic\nhardware (to the best of our knowledge). We solve this problem by proposing\nSecScale that uses some new ideas centered around speculative execution (read\nfirst, verify later), creating a forest of MACs (instead of a tree of counters)\nand providing complete memory encryption (no generic unsecure regions). We show\nthat we are 10% faster than the nearest competing alternative.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
