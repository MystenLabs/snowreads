Detailed derivation shows the\nproposed equations have super-Burnett order for small Knudsen numbers, and the\nmoment equations enjoy a symmetric structure. A new modification of Onsager\nboundary conditions is proposed to ensure stability as well as the removal of\nundesired boundary layers. Numerical examples of one-dimensional channel flows\nis conducted to verified our model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
