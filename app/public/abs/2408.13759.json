Unlike existing\nmethods, this paper proposes using MARL for the locomotion learning of a single\nquadruped robot. We develop a learning structure called Multi-Agent\nReinforcement Learning for Single Quadruped Robot Locomotion (MASQ),\nconsidering each leg as an agent to explore the action space of the quadruped\nrobot, sharing a global critic, and learning collaboratively. Experimental\nresults indicate that MASQ not only speeds up learning convergence but also\nenhances robustness in real-world settings, suggesting that applying MASQ to\nsingle robots such as quadrupeds could surpass traditional single-robot\nreinforcement learning approaches. Our study provides insightful guidance on\nintegrating MARL with single-robot locomotion learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
