An ordered\nsequence $(\\omega_1,\\ldots,\\omega_\\ell)$ of elements of $\\Omega$ is an\nirredundant base for $G$ if the pointwise stabilizer of the sequence is trivial\nand no point is fixed by the stabilizer of its predecessors. We show that any\ninterval of natural numbers can be realized as the set of cardinalities of\nirredundant bases for some finite primitive group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
