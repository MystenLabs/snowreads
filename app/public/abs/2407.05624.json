Matrix\nfactor models are employed to reduce the dimensionality of such data, but they\nlack the capability to make predictions without specified dynamics in the\nlatent factor process. To address this issue, we propose a two-component\ndynamic matrix factor model that extends the standard matrix factor model by\nincorporating a matrix autoregressive structure for the low-dimensional latent\nfactor process. This two-component model injects prediction capability to the\nmatrix factor model and provides deeper insights into the dynamics of\nhigh-dimensional matrix time series. We present the estimation procedures of\nthe model and their theoretical properties, as well as empirical analysis of\nthe estimation procedures via simulations, and a case study of New York city\ntaxi data, demonstrating the performance and usefulness of the model.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
