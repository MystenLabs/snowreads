Galaxies were selected out of the Galaxy Zoo\n2 (GZ2) sample, so also have gri imaging from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. An\nidentical classification tree, and vote weighting/aggregation was applied to\nboth UKIDSS and GZ2 classifications enabling direct comparisons. With this\nResearch Note we provide a public release of the GZ:UKIDSS morphologies and\ndiscuss some initial comparisons with GZ2.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
