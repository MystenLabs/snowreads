The relevant hadronic\nform factors are calculated using the Covariant Confined Quark Model developed\npreviously by our group. We predict the branching fractions\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\Upsilon(1S)\\to B_{(c)}\\ell\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell)$ to be of the order of\n$10^{-13}$ and $10^{-10}$ for the case of $B$ and $B_c$, respectively. Our\npredictions agree well with other theoretical calculations. We also consider\nthe effects of possible New Physics in the case of $\\Upsilon(1S)\\to\nB_c\\tau\\bar{\\nu}_\\tau$. We show that the branching fraction of this decay can\nbe enhanced by an order of magnitude using the constraints from the $B\\to\nD^{(*)}\\ell\\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$ and $B_c\\to J/\\psi\\ell \\bar{\\nu}_\\ell$ experimental\ndata.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MPenk42Lg7EK1LkK3yHL290nf_lUsmB5IeIFax8CtNA","pdfSize":"669080"}
