This allows one to check how\nimportant the integration measure is for the qualitative features of random\nmatrix models, as well as to test the robustness and universality of the\nqualitative picture of the original model. While for a small trace deformation\nthe phase diagram is identical to that of the Stephanov model, for a large\ndeformation an exotic phase with spontaneous charge-conjugation breaking\nappears.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
