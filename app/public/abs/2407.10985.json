This paper presents a novel, efficient traceback strategy\nin combination with a defence system against distributed denial of service\n(DDoS) attacks named Tracemax. A single packets can be directly traced over\nmany more hops than the current existing techniques allow. It let good\nconnections pass while bad ones get thwarted. Initiated by the victim the\nrouters in the network cooperate in tracing and become automatically\nself-organised and self-managed. The novel concept support analyses of packet\nflows and transmission paths in a network infrastructure. It can effectively\nreduce the effect of common bandwidth and resource consumption attacks and\nfoster in addition early warning and prevention.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
