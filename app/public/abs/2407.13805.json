We explore this property to compare Geometric\nScaling present at the ISR with the recently proposed scaling law at the LHC.\nWe argue that at the LHC, within present experimental uncertainties, there is\nfact a family of scaling laws.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eBrWfELMmCn-1tAGNDqMkoQkWVZS3xhfMmLakiEihAM","pdfSize":"361387"}
