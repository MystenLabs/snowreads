Then, it was assumed that the vortex field was the Laguerre-Gaussian\n(L-G) mode which is free-space solution, but the generation and stable\npropagation of the L-G mode vortex are not easy in the millimeter frequency\nrange. On the other hand, it is known that millimeter-wave hybrid mode of\ncylindrical corrugated waveguide has also vortex property. In this paper, we\ninvestigate propagation characteristics of millimeter-wave vortex of a hybrid\nmode of cylindrical corrugated waveguide in the magnetized plasma by using\nthree dimensional numerical simulations with finite-difference time-domain\n(FDTD) method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
