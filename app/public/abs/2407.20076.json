However, building robust offensive language detection models\nrequires large amounts of labeled data, which can be expensive and\ntime-consuming to obtain. Semi-supervised learning offers a feasible solution\nby utilizing labeled and unlabeled data to create more accurate and robust\nmodels. In this paper, we explore a few different semi-supervised methods, as\nwell as data augmentation techniques. Concretely, we implemented eight\nsemi-supervised methods and ran experiments for them using only the available\ndata in the RO-Offense dataset and applying five augmentation techniques before\nfeeding the data to the models. Experimental results demonstrate that some of\nthem benefit more from augmentations than others.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"gTktIuvJ3mcsV-wMiamlcaO4Uvw2CA4xD6f3Mg1YYSY","pdfSize":"292415"}
