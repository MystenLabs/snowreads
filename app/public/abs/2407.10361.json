However, due to their generic functional forms and\nextreme flexibility, they can catastrophically fail to capture the properties\nof novel, out-of-sample configurations, making the quality of the training set\na determining factor, especially when investigating materials under extreme\nconditions. In the present study, we propose a novel automated dataset\ngeneration method based on the maximization of the information entropy of the\nfeature distribution, aiming at an extremely broad coverage of the\nconfiguration space in a way that is agnostic to the properties of specific\ntarget materials. The ability of the dataset to capture unique material\nproperties is demonstrated on a range of unary materials, including elements\nwith the fcc (Al), bcc (W), hcp (Be, Re and Os), and graphite (C) ground\nstates. MLIAPs trained to this dataset are shown to be accurate over a broad\nrange of application-relevant metrics, as well as extremely robust over very\nbroad swaths of configurations space, even without dataset fine-tuning or\nhyper-parameter optimization, making the approach extremely attractive to\nrapidly and autonomously develop general-purpose MLIAPs suitable for\nsimulations in extreme conditions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
