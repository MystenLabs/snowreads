This theorem and its corollaries are relevant for all\nfour-dimensional tachyon-free closed string theories which can be realized from\nhigher-dimensional theories via geometric compactifications. As such, they\ntherefore apply regardless of the presence or absence of spacetime\nsupersymmetry and regardless of the gauge symmetries or matter content\ninvolved. This theorem resolves a hidden clash between modular invariance and\nthe process of decompactification, and enables us to uncover a number of\nsurprising phenomenological properties of these theories. Chief among these is\nthe fact that certain physical quantities within such theories cannot exhibit\nlogarithmic or power-law running and instead enter an effective fixed-point\nregime above the compactification scale. This cessation of running occurs as\nthe result of the UV/IR mixing inherent in the theory. These effects apply not\nonly for gauge couplings but also for the Higgs mass and other quantities of\nphenomenological interest, thereby eliminating the logarithmic and/or power-law\nrunning that might have otherwise appeared for such quantities. These results\nillustrate the power of UV/IR mixing to tame divergences -- even without\nsupersymmetry -- and reinforce the notion that UV/IR mixing may play a vital\nrole in resolving hierarchy problems without supersymmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
