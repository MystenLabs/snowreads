To do this, we compute explicit local\nformulae for the Hausdorff function $d(P, -) : Z_n \\to \\mathbb{R}$, where $P$\nis a fixed polytope and $Z_n$ is the space of rank $n$ zonotopes. This local\ntheory is then used to provide an optimization algorithm based on subgradient\ndescent that converges to critical points of $d(P, -)$. We also express the\ncondition of being at a local minimum as a polyhedral feasibility condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
