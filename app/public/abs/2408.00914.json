Such\nworkflows become more effective with reliable confidence estimation.\nUnfortunately, confidence estimation is a documented weakness of models such as\nGPT-4, and established methods to compensate require significant additional\ncomplexity and computation. The present effort explores methods for effective\nconfidence estimation with GPT-4 with few-shot learning for event detection in\nthe BETTER ontology as a vehicle. The key innovation is expanding the prompt\nand task presented to GPT-4 to provide License to speculate when unsure and\nOpportunity to quantify and explain its uncertainty (L&O). This approach\nimproves accuracy and provides usable confidence measures (0.759 AUC) with no\nadditional machinery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
