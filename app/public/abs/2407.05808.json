In this article we use the theory of\nLorentzian polynomials, developed by Br\\\"and\\'en and Huh, to prove a\ngeneralization of the Mason-Welsh conjecture to the context of valuated\nmatroids. In fact, we provide a log-concavity result in the more general\nsetting of valuated discrete polymatroids, or equivalently, M-convex functions.\nOur approach is via the construction of a generic extension of a valuated\nmatroid or M-convex function, so that the bases of the extension are related to\nthe independent sets of the original matroid. We also provide a similar\nlog-concavity result for valuated bimatroids, which, we believe, might be of\nindependent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
