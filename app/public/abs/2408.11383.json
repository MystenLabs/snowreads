Using the third data release of the Gaia\nspace mission, Gaia DR3, Ash-1 was accidentally discovered within the\nconstellation Sagittarius in the field of the poorly studied cluster Majaess\n190. Here we present the first estimates of these two clusters' primary\nastrophysical properties. The membership probabilities P>0.50 were assigned to\nboth clusters using the pyUPMASK technique. The distances were determined using\nthe parallaxes of the clusters' members, which were consistent with the\nisochrone fitting of the color-magnitude diagrams. The ages and distances of\nMajaess 190 and Ash-1 are found to be 4 Gyr and 630 Myr; 2130 and 1360 pc,\nrespectively. The extinctions, heliocentric distances, mass function,\nluminosity function, and overall masses of the studied clusters were also\ncomputed. Based on the relaxation times, it appears that both clusters are in a\nstate of dynamic relaxation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
