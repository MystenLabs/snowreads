While precise\nspectroscopic measurements of this effect have advanced significantly, there\nremains a lack of simple, visually accessible demonstrations for educational\npurposes. Here, we present a low-cost experiment that allows for direct visual\nobservation of the Zeeman effect. Our setup involves a flame containing sodium\n(from table salt) placed in front of a sodium vapor lamp. When a magnetic field\nis applied to the flame, the shadow cast by the flame noticeably lightens,\nproviding a clear, naked-eye demonstration of the Zeeman effect. Furthermore,\nwe conduct two quantitative experiments using this setup, examining the effects\nof varying magnetic field strength and sodium concentration. This innovative\napproach not only enriches the experimental demonstration for teaching atomic\nphysics at undergraduate and high school levels but also provides an open\nplatform for students to explore the Zeeman effect through hands-on experience.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
