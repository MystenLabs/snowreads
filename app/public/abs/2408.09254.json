The only previously\nknown construction with such linear dimension and distance required a growing\nalphabet size $q$ (Krishna & Tillich, 2019). Our codes imply protocols for\nmagic state distillation with overhead exponent\n$\\gamma=\\log(n/k)/\\log(d)\\rightarrow 0$ as the block length\n$n\\rightarrow\\infty$, where $k$ and $d$ denote the code dimension and distance\nrespectively. It was previously an open question to obtain such a protocol with\na contant alphabet size $q$.\n  We construct our codes by combining two modular components, namely,\n  (i) a transformation from classical codes satisfying certain properties to\nquantum codes supporting transversal $CCZ$ gates, and\n  (ii) a concatenation scheme for reducing the alphabet size of codes\nsupporting transversal $CCZ$ gates. For this scheme we introduce a quantum\nanalogue of multiplication-friendly codes, which provide a way to express\nmultiplication over a field in terms of a subfield.\n  We obtain our asymptotically good construction by instantiating (i) with\nalgebraic-geometric codes, and applying a constant number of iterations of\n(ii). We also give an alternative construction with nearly asymptotically good\nparameters ($k,d=n/2^{O(\\log^*n)}$) by instantiating (i) with Reed-Solomon\ncodes and then performing a superconstant number of iterations of (ii).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
