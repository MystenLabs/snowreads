The method is based on point forecasts\npublished by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), as well as robust\nstatistics from the the empirical distribution of the IMF's past forecast\nerrors while imposing coherence of prediction intervals across horizons. We\nshow that the technique yields calibrated prediction intervals and performs\nsimilar to, or better than, more complex time series models in terms of\nstatistical loss functions. We provide a simple website with graphical\nillustrations of our forecasts, as well as time-stamped data files that\ndocument their real time character.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
