We evaluate the ability of anomaly\ndetection algorithms to provide indicators correlated with degraded model\nperformance. By placing acceptance thresholds over such indicators, hard\nboundaries are formed that define the model's coverage. As a use case, we\nconsider the extraction of exoplanetary spectra from transit light curves,\nspecifically within the context of ESA's upcoming Ariel mission. Isolation\nForests are shown to effectively identify contexts where prediction models are\nlikely to fail. Coverage/error trade-offs are evaluated under conditions of\ndata and concept drift. The best performance is seen when Isolation Forests\nmodel projections of the prediction model's explainability SHAP values.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
