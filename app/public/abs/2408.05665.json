The framework is constructed based on the least squares\nproblem subject to a penalty on the number of breakpoints. We restate the\n$l_0$-penalized regression problem as a quadratic programming problem with\ninteger- and real-valued arguments and show that MIO is capable of finding\nprovably optimal solutions using a well-known optimization solver. Compared to\nthe popular $l_1$-penalized regression (LASSO) and other classical methods, the\nMIO framework permits simultaneous estimation of the number and location of\nstructural breaks as well as regression coefficients, while accommodating the\noption of specifying a given or minimal number of breaks. We derive the\nasymptotic properties of the estimator and demonstrate its effectiveness\nthrough extensive numerical experiments, confirming a more accurate estimation\nof multiple breaks as compared to popular non-MIO alternatives. Two empirical\nexamples demonstrate usefulness of the framework in applications from business\nand economic statistics.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"t2q6CsAr6CQjKo9A43X6nc1WJFEN-ih-LF5GreZGVMA","pdfSize":"532796"}
