We then\nshow that the first-order theory of any irreducible affine Coxeter group does\nnot have a prime model. Finally, we prove that universal Coxeter groups of\nfinite rank are homogeneous, and that the same applies to every hyperbolic (in\nthe sense of Gromov) one-ended right-angled Coxeter group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
