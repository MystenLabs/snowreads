In detail, we generalize Guo and\nLi's two $q$-supercongruences for double basic hypergeometric series, which are\nrelated to $q$-analogues of Van Hamme's (C.2) supercongruence and Long's\nsupercongruence, respectively. In addition, we also present two conclusions for\ndouble and triple hypergeometric series associated with Van Hamme's (D.2)\nsupercongruence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
