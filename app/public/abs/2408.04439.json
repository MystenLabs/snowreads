In particular, the systolic\ncomplex is known to be the most informative part of the seismocardiogram, thus\nrequiring further analysis. State-of-art solutions to detect the systolic\ncomplex are based on Deep Learning models, which have been proven effective in\npioneering studies. However, these solutions have only been tested in a\ncontrolled scenario considering only clean signals acquired from users\nmaintained still in supine position. On top of that, all these studies consider\ndata coming from a single dataset, ignoring the benefits and challenges related\nto a cross-dataset scenario. In this work, a cross-dataset experimental\nanalysis was performed considering also data from a real-world scenario. Our\nfindings prove the effectiveness of a deep learning solution, while showing the\nimportance of a personalization step to contrast the domain shift, namely a\nchange in data distribution between training and testing data. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the benefits of a multi-channels approach, leveraging the\ninformation extracted from both accelerometers and gyroscopes data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
