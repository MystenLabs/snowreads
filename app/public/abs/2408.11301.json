The key feature of this phase-field approach is the ability to\ntransparently and explicitly specify nucleation and kinetic behavior in the\nmodel, in contrast to other regularized interface models. We use this to study\n2 distinct problems where it is essential to explicitly specify the kinetic and\nnucleation behavior governing twin evolution.\n  First, we study twinning interfaces in 2-d. When these interfaces are driven\nto move, we find that significant levels of twin nucleation occur ahead of the\nmoving interface. Essentially, the finite interface velocity and the relaxation\ntime of the stresses ahead of the interface allows for nucleation to occur\nbefore the interface is able to propagate to that point. Second, we study the\ngrowth of needle twins in antiplane elasticity. We show that both nucleation\nand anisotropic kinetics are essential to obtain predictions of needle twins.\nWhile standard regularized interface approaches do not permit the transparent\nspecification of anisotropic kinetics, this is readily possible with the\nphase-field approach that we have used here.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"n7r6ZfUNopQXlnF_J9yHX_cmPafveHloWV26zbLqqF4","pdfSize":"2120144"}
