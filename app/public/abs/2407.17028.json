Compared to manual inspections, computer vision technologies offer\na more efficient solution when deployed on-site. Multispectral imaging provides\ndiverse information about objects under different spectrums, aiding in the\ndifferentiation between waste and lakeside lawn environments. This study\nintroduces WasteMS, the first multispectral dataset established for the\nsemantic segmentation of lakeside waste. WasteMS includes a diverse range of\nwaste types in lawn environments, captured under various lighting conditions.\nWe implemented a rigorous annotation process to label waste in images.\nRepresentative semantic segmentation frameworks were used to evaluate\nsegmentation accuracy using WasteMS. Challenges encountered when using WasteMS\nfor segmenting waste on lakeside lawns were discussed. The WasteMS dataset is\navailable at https://github.com/zhuqinfeng1999/WasteMS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
