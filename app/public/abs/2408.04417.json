This models a great variety of (in general, nonlinear\nnonconvex) optimization problems. Various hierarchies of (lower and upper)\nbounds have been introduced, having the remarkable property that they converge\nasymptotically to the global minimum. These bounds exploit algebraic\nrepresentations of positive polynomials in terms of sums of squares and can be\ncomputed using semidefinite optimization. Our focus lies in the performance\nanalysis of these hierarchies of bounds, namely, in how far the bounds are from\nthe global minimum as the degrees of the sums of squares they involve tend to\ninfinity. We present the main state-of-the-art results and offer a gentle\nintroductory overview over the various techniques that have been recently\ndeveloped to establish them, stemming from the theory of orthogonal\npolynomials, approximation theory, Fourier analysis, and more.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
