The evolution of such systems impacts some\nimportant astrophysical processes, such as core-collapse supernovae and the\nnucleosynthesis of heavy nuclei. Many-body simulations require classical\nresources beyond current computing capabilities for physically relevant system\nsizes. Quantum computers are therefore a promising candidate to efficiently\nsimulate the many-body dynamics of collective neutrino oscillations. Previous\nquantum simulation efforts have primarily focused on properties of the\ntwo-flavor approximation due to their direct mapping to qubits. Here, we\npresent new quantum circuits for simulating three-flavor neutrino systems on\nqutrit- and qubit-based platforms, and demonstrate their feasibility by\nsimulating systems of two, four and eight neutrinos on IBM and Quantinuum\nquantum computers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
