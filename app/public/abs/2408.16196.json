We examine in\ndetail why the Dirac dual structure fails and it is not functional for these\ncases, highlighting all the physical consequences of this misdirection. The\napproach considered here is different from the one usually taken in current\nliterature. We pinpoint the shortcomings that this dual structure brings to\nparticle interpretation, and propagator structure, as well as the implications\nin non-locality, and the existence of negative energy levels. This\ninvestigation furnishes a background for the successful achievements in the\nfield associated with such proper dual formulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
