This method relies on using a sketch-orthogonal basis\nduring the Arnoldi process while maintaining the Arnoldi relation and\nexploiting a restarting scheme to focus on a specific part of the spectrum. We\nanalyze this method and show that it retains useful properties of the\nImplicitly Restarted Arnoldi (IRA) method, such as restarting without adding\nerrors to the Ritz pairs and implicitly applying polynomial filtering.\nExperiments are presented to validate the numerical efficiency of the proposed\nrandomized eigenvalue solver.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
