To capture\nthe homogeneous structures, we introduce a combination of $L^0$-gradient and\ncurvature regularization on level lines. This new regularization term enforces\nstrong sparsity on the image gradient while reducing the undesirable staircase\neffects as well as preserving the geometry of contours. For the smoothly\nvarying component, we utilize the $L^2$-norm of the Laplacian that favors\nisotropic smoothness. To capture the oscillation, we use the inverse Sobolev\nseminorm. To solve the associated minimization problem, we design an efficient\noperator-splitting algorithm. Our algorithm effectively addresses the\nchallenging non-convex non-smooth problem by separating it into sub-problems.\nEach sub-problem can be solved either directly using closed-form solutions or\nefficiently using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). We provide systematic\nexperiments, including ablation and comparison studies, to analyze our model's\nbehaviors and demonstrate its effectiveness as well as efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
