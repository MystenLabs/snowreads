We\ngeneralize Gowers norms to arbitrary compact non-commutative groups. On the\nstructural side, we show that nilspace theory (the algebraic part of\nhigher-order Fourier analysis) can be naturally extended to include all\nnon-commutative groups. To this end, we introduce generalized nilspaces called\n\"groupspaces\" and demonstrate that they possess properties very similar to\nnilspaces. We study $k$-th order generalizations of groups that are special\ngroupspaces called {\\it k-step} groupspaces. One step groupspaces are groups.\nWe show that $k$-step groupspaces admit the structure of an iterated principal\nbundle with structure groups $G_1,G_2,\\dots,G_k$. A similar, but somewhat more\ntechnical statement holds for general groupspaces, with possibly infinitely\nmany structure groups. Structure groups of groupspaces are in some sense\nanalogous to higher homotopy groups. In particular we use a version of the\nEckmann-Hilton argument from homotopy theory to show that $G_i$ is abelian for\n$i\\geq 2$. Groupspaces also show some similarities with $n$-groups from higher\ncategory theory (also used in physics) but the exact relationship between these\nconcepts is a subject of future research.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
