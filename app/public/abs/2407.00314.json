The results have\nimportant applications in discrete differential geometry. First, on a general\nfinite weighted graph, we prove the discrete-time Ollivier Ricci curvature flow\n$d_{n+1}\\coloneqq(1-\\alpha\\kappa_{d_{n}})d_{n}$ converges to a constant\ncurvature metric. Then the author in \\cite[Theorem 5.1]{M23} proved a Laplacian\nseparation principle on a locally finite graph with non-negative Ollivier\ncurvature. Here we prove the Laplacian separation flow converges to the\nconstant Laplacian solution and generalize the result to nonlinear $p$-Laplace\noperators. Moreover, our results can also be applied to study the long-time\nbehavior in the nonlinear Dirichlet forms theory and nonlinear\nPerron--Frobenius theory. At last, we define the Ollivier Ricci curvature of\nnonlinear Markov chain which is consistent with the classical Ollivier Ricci\ncurvature, sectional curvature \\cite{CMS24}, coarse Ricci curvature on\nhypergraphs \\cite{IKTU21} and the modified Ollivier Ricci curvature for\n$p$-Laplace. And we prove the convergence results for the nonlinear Markov\nchain with nonnegative Ollivier Ricci curvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SmwUp7j1RhjaeV7arkcYxiRmoCpWt5gHbJlqMW-XHSA","pdfSize":"677067"}
