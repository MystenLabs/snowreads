We use the concept of\neffective metric to determine the phase velocities of a propagating wave from\nthe BI and EH nonlinear electrodynamics and use them to set constraints on the\nMM nonlinear parameter. In a second part of the paper, we consider the black\nhole solutions of the nonlinear electrodynamics coupled with General Relativity\nand determine the shadows cast by the static black holes. Confronting the\nobservations of the shadows of M87$^*$ and Sagittarius A$^*$ with our\ntheoretical results allows us to set restrictions on the nonlinear parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
