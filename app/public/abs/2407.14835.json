It is proved that the full preimage of\neach neighborhood of $\\infty$ is an infinitely connected domain without having\nany unbounded boundary component. Following the literature, the point at\n$\\infty$ is called a Baker omitted value for the function in such a situation.\nMore importantly, there are infinitely many critical values and no finite\nasymptotic value and in fact, the set of all critical values is found to be\nunbounded for these functions. We also investigate the iteration of three\nexamples of entire functions with Baker omitted value and prove that these do\nnot have any Baker wandering domain. There is a conjecture stating that the\nnumber of completely invariant domains of a transcendental entire function is\nat most one. How some of these maps are right candidates to work upon in view\nof this conjecture is demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a5fKvaZK-cPcGVlZ4CKZU1HumuOoRSFZ6jXNxDgzrNA","pdfSize":"407791"}
