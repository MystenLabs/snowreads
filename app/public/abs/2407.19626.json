The SDE approach is the\nanalytic nonperturbative method for solving strongly coupled QFTs. When applied\nto QCD, this approach, also based on the first principle, is the analytic\nalternative to lattice QCD. However, the SDEs for the n-point Green's functions\ninvolves (n+1)-point Green's functions (sometimes (n+2)-point functions as\nwell). Therefore any practical method for solving this infinitely coupled\nsystem of equations requires a truncation scheme. When considering strongly\ncoupled QED as a modeling of QCD, naive truncation schemes violate various\nprinciples of the gauge theory. These principles include gauge invariance,\ngauge covariance, and multiplicative renormalizability. The combination of\ndimensional regularization with the spectral representation of propagators\nresults in a tractable formulation of a truncation scheme for the SDEs of QED\npropagators, which has the potential to preserve the aforementioned principles\nand renders solutions obtainable in the Minkowski space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
