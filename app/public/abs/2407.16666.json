We provide a\npolynomial-time algorithm which decides whether a given graph is a Burling\ngraph and if it is, constructs its intersection model by rectangular frames.\nThat model enables a polynomial-time algorithm for the maximum independent set\nproblem in Burling graphs. As a consequence, we establish Burling graphs as the\nfirst known hereditary class of graphs that admits such an algorithm while not\nbeing $\\chi$-bounded.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
