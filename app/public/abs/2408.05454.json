In existing methods, when linear\nconstraints are imposed, each iteration needs to solve a convex minimization.\nExploiting our obtained algorithm, we propose a convex-optimization-free\nalgorithm. This algorithm can be applied to classical and quantum\nrate-distortion theory. We numerically apply our method to the derivation of\nthe optimal conditional distribution in the rate-distortion theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DGNZ5EV6Hfebc7oXgt-HkyIX89VONTQRgKJEig0bkfM","pdfSize":"592398"}
