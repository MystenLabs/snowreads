The\ncurrent forefront of research in the control of classical waves has emerged\nfrom a seemingly unrelated field, namely, non-Hermitian quantum mechanics. By\ndrawing analogies between this theory and those of classical systems,\nresearchers have discovered phenomena that defy conventional intuition and have\nexploited them to control light, sound, and elastic waves. Here, we provide a\nbrief perspective on recent developments, challenges and intricacies that\ndistinguish non-Hermitian elastodynamics from optics and acoustics. We close\nthis perspective with an outlook on potential directions such as topological\nphases in non-Hermitian elastodynamics and broken Hermitian symmetry in\nmaterials with electromomentum couplings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
