Within the StyleGAN framework, the adoption of image\nskip connection is favored over the traditional residual connection. However,\nthis preference is just based on empirical observations; there has not been any\nin-depth mathematical analysis on it yet. To rectify this situation, this brief\naims to elucidate the mathematical meaning of the image skip connection and\nintroduce a groundbreaking methodology, termed the image squeeze connection,\nwhich significantly improves the quality of image synthesis. Specifically, we\nanalyze the image skip connection technique to reveal its problem and introduce\nthe proposed method which not only effectively boosts the GAN performance but\nalso reduces the required number of network parameters. Extensive experiments\non various datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently enhances\nthe performance of state-of-the-art models based on StyleGAN. We believe that\nour findings represent a vital advancement in the field of image synthesis,\nsuggesting a novel direction for future research and applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
