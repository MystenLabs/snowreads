We concentrate on the Markovian approximation of the\ntime-evolution and relate the expected value of the so defined entropy\nvariations with the well-known expression of entropy production due to Lebowitz\nand Spohn. We do so under the detailed balance condition and, as a byproduct,\nwe show that the probabilities of outcomes of two-time measurements are given\nby a continuous time Markov process determined by the Lindblad generator of the\nMarkovian quantum dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uIzp5Y_C_XWDYq6hWVknttvLqzDrhi5LIN8Il_B50Zg","pdfSize":"237319"}
