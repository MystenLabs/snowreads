We propose a personalized,\naspect-controlled model called Multi-Aspect Prompt LEarner (MAPLE), in which it\nintegrates aspect category as another input dimension to facilitate the\nmemorization of fine-grained aspect terms. Experiments on two real-world review\ndatasets in restaurant domain show that MAPLE outperforms the baseline\nreview-generation models in terms of text and feature diversity while\nmaintaining excellent coherence and factual relevance. We further treat MAPLE\nas a retriever component in the retriever-reader framework and employ a\nLarge-Language Model (LLM) as the reader, showing that MAPLE's explanation\nalong with the LLM's comprehension ability leads to enriched and personalized\nexplanation as a result. We will release the code and data in this http upon\nacceptance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"SAyEaAhRvmAZlnjcFd-f2HsI9uFUyb_FYQdtd3knBg0","pdfSize":"3227276"}
