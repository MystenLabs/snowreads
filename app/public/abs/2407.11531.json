Most task-offloading\nstrategies assumed that UAVs were location-fixed and capable of handling all\ntasks. However, in complex disaster environments, UAV locations often change\ndynamically, and the heterogeneity of on-board resources presents a significant\nchallenge in optimizing task scheduling in EUN to minimize latency. To address\nthese problems, a Finite state machines-based Path-following Collaborative\ncomputation strategy (FPC) for emergency UAV swarms is proposed. First, an\nExtended Finite State Machine Space-time Graph (EFSMSG) model is constructed to\naccurately characterize on-board resources and state transitions while\nshielding the EUN dynamic characteristic. Based on the EFSMSG, a mathematical\nmodel is formulated for the FPC strategy to minimize task processing delay\nwhile facilitating computation during transmission. Finally, the Constraint\nSelection Adaptive Binary Particle Swarm Optimization (CSABPSO) algorithm is\nproposed for the solution. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FPC\nstrategy effectively reduces task processing delay, meeting the requirements of\ndelay-sensitive tasks in emergency situations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
