In some cases,\nsoft robots can be powered by biohybrid actuators and the design process of\nthese systems is far from straightforward. We analyse here two algorithms that\nmay assist the design of these systems, namely, NEAT (NeuroEvolution of\nAugmented Topologies) and HyperNEAT (Hypercube-based NeuroEvolution of\nAugmented Topologies). These algorithms exploit the evolution of the structure\nof actuators encoded through neural networks. To evaluate these algorithms, we\ncompare them with a similar approach using the Age Fitness Pareto Optimization\n(AFPO) algorithm, with a focus on assessing the maximum displacement achieved\nby the discovered biohybrid morphologies. Additionally, we investigate the\neffects of optimization against both the volume of these morphologies and the\ndistance they can cover. To further accelerate the computational process, the\nproposed methodology is implemented in a client-server setting; so, the most\ndemanding calculations can be executed on specialized and efficient hardware.\nThe results indicate that the HyperNEAT-based approach excels in identifying\nmorphologies with minimal volumes that still achieve satisfactory displacement\ntargets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
