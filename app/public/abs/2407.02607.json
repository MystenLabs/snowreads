We first unveil that the existing\npopular Riemannian metric on the Cholesky manifold can be generally\ncharacterized as the product metric of a Euclidean metric and a Riemannian\nmetric on the space of n-dimensional positive vectors. Based on this analysis,\nwe propose two novel metrics on the Cholesky manifolds, i.e., Diagonal Power\nEuclidean Metric and Diagonal Generalized Bures-Wasserstein Metric, which are\nnumerically stabler than the existing Cholesky metric. We also discuss the gyro\nstructures and deformed metrics associated with our metrics. The gyro\nstructures connect the linear and geometric properties, while the deformed\nmetrics interpolate between our proposed metrics and the existing metric.\nFurther, by Cholesky decomposition, the proposed deformed metrics and gyro\nstructures are pulled back to SPD manifolds. Compared with existing Riemannian\nmetrics on SPD manifolds, our metrics are easy to use, computationally\nefficient, and numerically stable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
