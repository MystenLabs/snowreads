Our approach\ntests the joint existence of instruments, which are associated with the\ntreatment but not directly with the outcome (at least conditional on\nobservables), and suitable control variables, conditional on which the\ntreatment is exogenous, and learns the partition of instruments and control\nvariables from the observed data. The detection of sets of instruments and\ncontrol variables relies on the condition that proper instruments are\nconditionally independent of the outcome given the treatment and suitable\ncontrol variables. We establish the consistency of our method for detecting\ncontrol variables and instruments under certain regularity conditions,\ninvestigate the finite sample performance through a simulation study, and\nprovide an empirical application to labor market data from the Job Corps study.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
