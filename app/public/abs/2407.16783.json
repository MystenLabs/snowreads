Our analysis documents a complex crystal-chemical behavior of\nFeN$_2$ characterized by the formation of a strongly covalent N-N bond with an\nunexpected valence state of Fe ions $3+$ (paramagnetic ferric Fe$^{3+}$ ions in\nthe low-spin state), in agreement with available experimental data. Our results\nreveal weak (orbital-dependent) correlation effects, which are complicated by\nthe possible emergence of multiple spin density wave states on a microscopic\nlevel. This suggests the importance of antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations to\nexplain the properties of FeN$_2$ under pressure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
