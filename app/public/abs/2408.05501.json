A bi-unitary connection, which is a finite family of complex number\nsubject to some axioms, realizes an object in any unitary fusion category. It\nalso gives a characterization of a finite-dimensional nondegenerate commuting\nsquare in subfactor theory of Jones and realizes a certain $4$-tensor appearing\nin recent studies of $2$-dimensional topological order. We study\n$\\alpha$-induction for bi-unitary connections, and show that flatness of the\nresulting $\\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections implies commutativity of the\noriginal Frobenius algebra. This gives a converse of our previous result and\nanswers a question raised by R. Longo. We furthermore give finer correspondence\nbetween the flat parts of the $\\alpha$-induced bi-unitary connections and the\ncommutative Frobenius subalgebras studied by B\\\"ockenhauer-Evans.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
