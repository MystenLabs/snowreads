To this end, for curves of finite type we extend the\nclassical C\\'ordoba--Fefferman biorthogonality. For cones over degenerate\ncurves, we analyze wave envelope estimates proved via High-Low-decomposition.\nThe arguments are subsequently extended to the cone over the complex parabola.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
