To study the detailed chemistry induced by CRs, we conducted a\nYebes W band line survey towards an unshocked MC (which we named as 3C391:NML)\nassociated with supernova remnant (SNR) 3C391. We detected emission lines of 18\nmolecular species in total and estimated their column densities with local\nthermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE analysis. Using the abundance ratio\nN(HCO+)/N(CO) and an upper limit of N(DCO+)/N(HCO+), we estimated the CR\nionization rate of 3C391:NML is $\\zeta\\gtrsim 2.7\\times 10^{-14}\\rm \\ s^{-1}$\nwith an analytic method. However, we caution on adopting this value because\nchemical equilibrium, which is a prerequisite of using the equations, is not\nnecessarily reached in 3C391:NML. We observed lower N(HCO+)/N(HOC+), higher\nN(HCS+)/N(CS), and higher X($l$-C3H+) by an order of magnitude in 3C391:NML\nthan the typical values in quiescent dense MCs. We found that an enhanced CR\nionization rate (of order $\\sim 10^{-15}$ or $\\sim 10^{-14}\\rm \\ s^{-1}$) is\nneeded to reproduce the observation with chemical model. This is higher than\nthe values found in typical MCs by 2--3 orders of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UMcQXH5Lnc0WtvN5KyftNQnReSkyft6CsoWivRVbHJY","pdfSize":"3107949"}
