However, many current approaches ignore the\nuniversality of the search strategy and fail to reduce the computational\nredundancy during the search process, especially in one-shot NAS architectures.\nBesides, current NAS methods show invalid reparameterization in non-linear\nsearch space, leading to poor efficiency in common search spaces like DARTS. In\nthis paper, we propose TopoNAS, a model-agnostic approach for gradient-based\none-shot NAS that significantly reduces searching time and memory usage by\ntopological simplification of searchable paths. Firstly, we model the\nnon-linearity in search spaces to reveal the parameterization difficulties. To\nimprove the search efficiency, we present a topological simplification method\nand iteratively apply module-sharing strategies to simplify the topological\nstructure of searchable paths. In addition, a kernel normalization technique is\nalso proposed to preserve the search accuracy. Experimental results on the\nNASBench201 benchmark with various search spaces demonstrate the effectiveness\nof our method. It proves the proposed TopoNAS enhances the performance of\nvarious architectures in terms of search efficiency while maintaining a high\nlevel of accuracy.
