However, the lifecycle of wearable\nsystems faces several challenges. First, effective model training for new\nwearable devices requires substantial labeled data from various subjects\ncollected directly by the wearable. Second, subsequent model updates require\nfurther extensive labeled data for retraining. Finally, frequent model updating\non the wearable device can decrease the battery life in long-term data\nmonitoring. Addressing these challenges, in this paper, we propose MetaWearS, a\nmeta-learning method to reduce the amount of initial data collection required.\nMoreover, our approach incorporates a prototypical updating mechanism,\nsimplifying the update process by modifying the class prototype rather than\nretraining the entire model. We explore the performance of MetaWearS in two\ncase studies, namely, the detection of epileptic seizures and the detection of\natrial fibrillation. We show that by fine-tuning with just a few samples, we\nachieve 70% and 82% AUC for the detection of epileptic seizures and the\ndetection of atrial fibrillation, respectively. Compared to a conventional\napproach, our proposed method performs better with up to 45% AUC. Furthermore,\nupdating the model with only 16 minutes of additional labeled data increases\nthe AUC by up to 5.3%. Finally, MetaWearS reduces the energy consumption for\nmodel updates by 456x and 418x for epileptic seizure and AF detection,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
