Yet, a microscopic description\nof the mechanisms governing spatial organization of the NPs is still lacking.\nCombining small angle X-ray scattering, state-of-the-art numerical simulations\nand a simple toy model, we uncover how the volume phase transition of microgels\ndrives NP-NP interactions, inducing NP progressive rearrangement with\ntemperature. These results are directly compared to the extinction spectra of\nmicrogel-NPs complexes, allowing us to establish for the first time a\nmicroscopic link between plasmon coupling and NP local structure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
