We introduce a novel approach using the\nHolstein-Primakoff transformation to treat the spin chains as pseudo-bosonic\nsystems and thereby applying the synchronization criteria for harmonic\noscillators. Our theoretical framework and numerical simulations reveal that\nunder optimal conditions, the spin chains can achieve both classical and\nperfect quantum synchronization. We show that quantum synchronization is robust\nagainst variations in the number of spins and inter-spin coupling, though may\nbe affected by thermal noise. This work advances the understanding of\nsynchronization in multi-spin systems and introduces a generalized\nsynchronization measure for both bosons and fermions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
