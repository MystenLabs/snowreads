Our proposed IP-GRPDAL method\nallows for larger stepsizes by replacing the extrapolation step with a convex\ncombination step. Each iteration of the linesearch requires to update only the\ndual variable, and hence it is quite cheap. In addition, we prove convergence\nof the proposed algorithm and show an O(1/N) ergodic convergence rate for our\nalgorithm, where N represents the number of iterations. When one of the\ncomponent functions is strongly convex, the accelerated O(1/N2) convergence\nrate results are established by choosing adaptively some algorithmic\nparameters. Furthermore, when both component functions are strongy convex, the\nlinear convergence rate results are achieved. Numerical simulation results on\nthe sparse recovery and image deblurring problems illustrate the feasibility\nand efficiency of our inexact algorithms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
