These systems are hierarchical\ntriples, with inner binary separations of order $1$ au, and outer separations\nof $100$-$100,000$ au. Leveraging the fact that the inner binary and outer\ntertiary should have nearly identical parallaxes, we use the sample to\ncalibrate the parallax uncertainties for orbital and acceleration binary\nsolutions. We find that the parallax uncertainties of orbital solutions are\ntypically underestimated by a factor of $1.3$ at $G>14$, and by a factor of\n$1.7$ at $G = 8$-$14$. The true parallax uncertainties are nevertheless a\nfactor of $\\sim 10$ smaller than those of the single-star astrometric solutions\nfor the same sources. The parallax uncertainties of acceleration solutions are\nunderestimated by larger factors of $2$-$3$ but still represent a significant\nimprovement compared to the sources' single-star solutions. We provide\ntabulated uncertainty inflation factors for astrometric binary solutions and\nmake the catalog of hierarchical triples publicly available.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FtagTC58e2JwtJoBG3HN2jWROIQypWpY8EqeLwORC5c","pdfSize":"2976406"}
