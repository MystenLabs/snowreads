Therefore the errors obtained in the Parton\nDistribution Functions that are extracted from this data will also be dominated\nby these experimental systematic errors, as well as the systematic errors\nembedded in the theoretical calculations. However, as is well known, there are\noften significant uncertainties in these systematic errors, and so to determine\nprecisely the errors in the Parton Distribution Functions, we need to be\nthoughtful about the uncertainties in the errors themselves. In this paper, we\ndiscuss an approach where these \"errors on errors\" can be incorporated into a\n$\\chi^2$ calculation, and investigate how such a model behaves and what it\ntells us about the resulting errors. Also we look at two data sets, ATLAS W,Z\nData [arXiv:1612.03016] and the ATLAS 7 TeV Inclusive Jet Distribution Data\n[arXiv:1410.8857] and investigate the information that this model implies about\nthese two data sets.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
