The source wishes to compress its observations and store the result\nin a public database such that (i) authorized sets of users are able to\nreconstruct the source with a certain distortion level, and (ii) information\nleakage to non-authorized sets of colluding users is minimized. In other words,\nthe recovery of the source is restricted to a predefined access structure. The\nmain result of this paper is a closed-form characterization of the fundamental\ntrade-off between the source coding rate and the information leakage rate. As\nan example, threshold access structures are studied, i.e., the case where any\nset of at least $t$ users is able to reconstruct the source with some\npredefined distortion level and the information leakage at any set of users\nwith a size smaller than $t$ is minimized.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
