Unlike traditional datasets for\ntraffic signal control which aim to provide simplified feature vectors like\nvehicle counts from traffic simulators, SynTraC provides real-style images from\nthe CARLA simulator with annotated features, along with traffic signal states.\nThis image-based dataset comes with diverse real-world scenarios, including\nvarying weather and times of day. Additionally, SynTraC also provides different\nreward values for advanced traffic signal control algorithms like reinforcement\nlearning. Experiments with SynTraC demonstrate that it is still an open\nchallenge to image-based traffic signal control methods compared with\nfeature-based control methods, indicating our dataset can further guide the\ndevelopment of future algorithms.
