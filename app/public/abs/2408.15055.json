Many state-of-the-art approaches\nachieve inspiring performance in estimating HTE on benchmark datasets or\nsimulation studies. However, the indirect predicting manner and complex model\narchitecture reduce the interpretability of these approaches. To mitigate the\ngap between predictive performance and heterogeneity interpretability, we\nintroduce the Causal Rule Forest (CRF), a novel approach to learning hidden\npatterns from data and transforming the patterns into interpretable multi-level\nBoolean rules. By training the other interpretable causal inference models with\ndata representation learned by CRF, we can reduce the predictive errors of\nthese models in estimating HTE and CATE, while keeping their interpretability\nfor identifying subgroups that a treatment is more effective. Our experiments\nunderscore the potential of CRF to advance personalized interventions and\npolicies, paving the way for future research to enhance its scalability and\napplication across complex causal inference challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
