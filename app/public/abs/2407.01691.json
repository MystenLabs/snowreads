Building on the formalism of arXiv:2405.05305, it is\nshown that the leading terms in this series for large $N_c$ can be resummed in\nclosed form in renormalization-group improved perturbation theory. This\nremarkable observation suggests that large-$N_c$ methods might also be helpful\nto study other aspects of non-global logarithms at hadron colliders, and to\ncombine our analytic results with amplitude-level parton showers.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
