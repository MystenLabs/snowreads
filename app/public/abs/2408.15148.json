One can substitute `gapped' for\n`projectively topological'. Our proofs use evaluations of a field theory in\nparametrized families.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
