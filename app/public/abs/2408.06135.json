The\ntreatment is based on the Schwinger-Dyson equation governing this vertex, and a\nlarge-volume lattice simulation, involving ten thousand gauge field\nconfigurations. The key hypothesis employed in both approaches is the ``planar\ndegeneracy'', which classifies diverse configurations by means of a single\nvariable, thus enabling their meaningful ``averaging''. The results of both\napproaches show notable agreement, revealing a considerable suppression of the\naveraged form factor in the infrared. The deviations from the exact planar\ndegeneracy are discussed in detail, and a supplementary variable is used to\nachieve a more accurate description. The effective charge defined through this\nspecial form factor is computed within both approaches, and the results\nobtained are in excellent agreement.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
