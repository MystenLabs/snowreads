While prior work has\nstudied fingerspelling recognition, there has been little attention to\nevaluating how well sign language translation models understand fingerspelling\nin the context of entire sentences -- and improving this capability. We\nmanually annotate instances of fingerspelling within FLEURS-ASL and use them to\nevaluate the effect of two simple measures to improve fingerspelling\nrecognition within American Sign Language to English translation: 1) use a\nmodel family (ByT5) with character- rather than subword-level tokenization, and\n2) mix fingerspelling recognition data into the translation training mixture.\nWe find that 1) substantially improves understanding of fingerspelling (and\ntherefore translation quality overall), but the effect of 2) is mixed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"FQIVqDyaDlNBgeQv_JPRLetEA7Ffj_6iNXN0-ysijEQ","pdfSize":"1147005"}
