The\ndesign philosophy is based on the observation that different pixel regions\nwithin an image exhibit varying levels of complexity, with higher complexities\nposing a greater challenge for accurate segmentation. We thus introduce image\ncomplexity as prior guidance and propose the Image Complexity prior-guided\nFeature Refinement Network (ICFRNet). This network aggregates both complexity\nand segmentation features to produce an attention map for refining segmentation\nfeatures within an Image Complexity Guided Attention (ICGA) module. We optimize\nthe network in terms of both segmentation and image complexity prediction tasks\nwith a combined loss function. Experimental results on the Cityscapes and\nCamViD datasets have shown that our ICFRNet achieves higher accuracy with a\ncompetitive efficiency for real-time segmentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
