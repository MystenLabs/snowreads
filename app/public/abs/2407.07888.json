As\nthe terminology suggests, they are self-similar objects that further satisfy a\nMarkov branching property. They are built from the combination of the recursive\nconstruction of real trees by gluing line segments with the seminal observation\nof Lamperti, which relates positive self-similar Markov processes and L\\'evy\nprocesses via a time change. They carry natural length and harmonic measures,\nwhich can be used to perform explicit spinal decompositions. Self-similar\nMarkov trees encompass a large variety of random real trees that have been\nstudied over the last decades, such as the Brownian CRT, stable L\\'evy trees,\nfragmentation trees, and growth-fragmentation trees. We establish general\ninvariance principles for multi-type Galton--Watson trees with integer types\nand illustrate them with many combinatorial classes of random trees that have\nbeen studied in the literature, including (possibly dissipative) discrete\nfragmentation trees, peeling trees of Boltzmann (possibly $O(n)$-decorated)\nplanar maps, or even the more recent fully parked trees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
