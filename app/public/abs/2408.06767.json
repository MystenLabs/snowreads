In particular, we discuss the coefficient of the chromomagnetic\nmoment parameter $\\mu_G$ which has a large uncertainty at leading order due to\nits dependence on the renormalization scale. We find that the\nrenormalization-scale dependence of this coefficient is significantly reduced,\nthereby reducing the theoretical uncertainty of the coefficient and\nconsequently of the rates. The sign of the coefficient becomes stable, and we\nestimate that the NLO corrections will increase the decay rates by around\n$2\\%$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
