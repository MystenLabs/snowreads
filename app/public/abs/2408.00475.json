First, we investigate\nspace-like surfaces in $L^4_1(f,c)$ satisfying that the tangent component of\n$\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is an eigenvector of all shape operators, called\nclass $\\mathcal A$ surfaces. Then, we get a classification theorem of\nspace-like class $\\mathcal A$ surfaces in $L^4_1(f,0)$. Also, we examine\nminimal space-like class $\\mathcal A$ surfaces in $L^4_1(f,0)$. Finally, we\ngive the parametrizations of space-like surfaces in $L^4_1(f,0)$ when the\nnormal part of the unit vector field $\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial t}$ is parallel.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
