This paper presents a novel nonparametric\ndensity estimation procedure that utilizes bivariate penalized spline smoothing\nover triangulation for data scattered over irregular spatial domains. The\napproach is likelihood-based with a regularization term that addresses the\nroughness of the logarithm of density based on a second-order differential\noperator. The proposed method offers greater efficiency and flexibility in\nestimating density over complex domains and has been theoretically supported by\nestablishing the asymptotic convergence rate under mild natural conditions.\nThrough extensive simulation studies and a real-world application that analyzes\nmotor vehicle theft data from Portland City, Oregon, we demonstrate the\nadvantages of the proposed method over existing techniques detailed in the\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"wumpJDrjJrwHMJ9DE50MI8YG4R1ivuHvLVvppOASn44","pdfSize":"3665948"}
