For most stochastic optimization problems,\nthis gap must be statistically estimated. We show that standard estimators are\noptimistically biased for risk-averse problems, which compromises the\nstatistical guarantee on the optimality gap. We introduce estimators for\nrisk-averse problems that do not suffer from this bias. Our method relies on\nusing two independent samples, each estimating a different component of the\noptimality gap. Our approach extends a broad class of methods for estimating\nthe optimality gap from the risk-neutral case to the risk-averse case, such as\nthe multiple replications procedure and its one- and two-sample variants. Our\napproach can further make use of existing bias and variance reduction\ntechniques.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
