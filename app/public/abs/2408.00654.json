We assume that $f$ is a real\nvalued continuous function satisfying critical exponential growth in the\nTrudinger-Moser sense, and $F$ is the primitive of $f$. Let $Q$ be a positive\nreal valued continuous weight, which can be singular at zero. Our main goal is\nto prove the existence of a nontrivial solution for all parameter values except\nthe resonant case, i.e., when $\\lambda$ coincides with any of the eigenvalues\nof the operator $(-\\Delta, H^1_0(\\Omega))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v0SWmvWgRg5zMDoAzhUtME8oFTjWc2OmMCXFiQA8DBE","pdfSize":"430668"}
