We find that there is a statistically significant\ndifference in the distributions of outflow opening angles for Class 0 and Class\nI outflows, with a distinct lack of both wide-angle Class 0 outflows and highly\ncollimated Class I outflows. Synthesizing our results with several previous\nstudies, we find that outflows widen with age through the Class 0 stage but do\nnot continue to widen in the Class I stage. The maximum projected opening angle\nreached is approximately 90 degrees +/- 20 degrees, with the transition between\nwidening and remaining constant occurring near the boundary between the Class 0\nand Class I phases of evolution. While the volume fractions occupied by these\noutflows are no more than a few tens of percent of the total core volume, at\nmost, recent theoretical work suggests outflows may still be capable of playing\na central role in setting the low star formation efficiencies of 25%-50%\nobserved on core scales.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
