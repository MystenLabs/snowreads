Comput. Fluid\nDyn. 32:137--164, 2018). This micro-physics moisture model is a refinement of\nthe one communicated by Klein and Majda (Theor. Comput. Fluid Dyn. 20:525--551,\n2006), which serves as a foundation of multi-scale asymptotic expansions for\nmoist deep convection in the atmosphere. Specifically, we show, in this paper,\nthat the system of compressible Navier--Stokes equations coupled with the\nmoisture dynamics is well-posed. In particular, the micro-physics of moisture\nmodel incorporates the phase changes of water in moist air.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DqPKQXWOUQmYB4szcYF-pdG9pMGNqPpzpj58zDchI3c","pdfSize":"347163"}
