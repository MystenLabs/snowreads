It is known that every\ninitial state $\\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium\nand stay there most of the time (``thermalize'') if the Hamiltonian is\nnon-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate\nthermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic\nthermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain\nperturbation $H_\\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\\gg 1$ free fermions on a\none-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high\ndegeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate\nHamiltonians, all $\\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis,\nand we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more\ngenerally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by\nthe fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more\neasily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies\nto arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$, which seem no less\nrealistic than $H_\\theta$, and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we\nconsider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not\nnecessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation,\n$H=H_0+\\lambda V$ with $\\lambda\\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is\nnon-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i)\nevery $\\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii)\nfor any subspace $\\mathcal{H}_\\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium\nmacro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\\psi_0$ from\n$\\mathcal{H}_\\nu$ thermalize.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
