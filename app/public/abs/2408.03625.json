By considering the case of a scalar\nfield theory, we provide a detailed discussion of the properties satisfied by a\nbackground dependent Wilson action. We show how the Ward identity associated\nwith background field shifts for the Wilson action is related to that for the\n1PI Wilson action, or effective average action. Moreover, we discuss the ERG\nequations in the dimensionless framework and emphasize the role of the Ward\nidentity in this setting. We give two examples: the Gaussian fixed point for\nthe real scalar theory and the large $N$ limit of the linear sigma model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JOlJkBQdmOnBxGq8Dv2iLRViZJiJUopn40ZBo7S9kUE","pdfSize":"289503"}
