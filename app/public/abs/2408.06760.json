This raises an issue as to which model should\nbe used for modelling the effect of treatment on the outcome variable, $Y$.\nShould one fit, the stratum indicator, $S$, the continuous covariate, $X$, both\nor neither?\n  This question has been investigated in the literature using simulations\ntargetting the overall effect on inferences about treatment . However, when a\ncovariate is added to a model there are three consequences for inference: 1)\nThe mean square error effect, 2) The variance inflation factor and 3) second\norder precision. We consider that it is valuable to consider these three\nfactors separately even if, ultimately, it is their joint effect that matters.\n  We present some simple theory, concentrating in particular on the variance\ninflation factor, that may be used to guide trialists in their choice of model.\nWe also consider the case where the precise form of the relationship between\nthe outcome and the covariate is not known. We conclude by recommending that\nthe continuous coovariate should always be in the model but that, depending on\ncircumstances, there may be some justification in fitting the stratum indicator\nalso.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
