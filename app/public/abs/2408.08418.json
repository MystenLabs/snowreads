We launch a study of\nseveral domination problems on diameter-two graphs, or 2-clubs, and study their\nparameterized complexity with respect to the 2ccvd number as main parameter. We\nfurther propose to explore the class of problems that become solvable in\nsub-exponential time when the running time is independent of some input\nparameter. Hardness of problems for this class depends on the Exponential-Time\nHypothesis. We give examples of problems that are in the proposed class and\nproblems that are hard for it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
