We call this\ndimension ${\\rm PG_CF}$ dimension and show that it can serve as an alternative\ndefinition of the ${\\rm G_C}$-projective dimension introduced by Holm and J\\o\nrgensen. Modules with ${\\rm PG_CF}$ dimension zero are called ${\\rm PG_CF}$\nmodules. When the module $C$ is nice enough, we show that the class ${\\rm\nPG_CF}(R)$ of these modules is projectively resolving. This enables us to\nobtain good homological properties of this new dimension. We also show that\n${\\rm PG_CF}(R)$ is the left-hand side of a complete hereditary cotorsion pair.\nThis yields, from a homotopical perspective, a hereditary Hovey triple where\nthe cofibrant objects coincide with the ${\\rm PG_CF}$ modules and the fibrant\nobjects coincide with the modules in the well-known Bass class\n$\\mathcal{B}_C(R)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
