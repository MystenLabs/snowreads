We study\nhow these symmetries act on the basic representation and on the symmetric and\nnon-symmetric Askey-Wilson (AW) polynomials and functions. Interestingly $t_4$\nmaps AW polynomials to functions. In the second part of the paper we look for a\nversion of non-symmetric AW functions that behave well under these symmetries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
