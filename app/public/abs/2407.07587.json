This paper introduces Let Occ Flow, the\nfirst self-supervised work for joint 3D occupancy and occupancy flow prediction\nusing only camera inputs, eliminating the need for 3D annotations. Utilizing\nTPV for unified scene representation and deformable attention layers for\nfeature aggregation, our approach incorporates a backward-forward temporal\nattention module to capture dynamic object dependencies, followed by a 3D\nrefine module for fine-gained volumetric representation. Besides, our method\nextends differentiable rendering to 3D volumetric flow fields, leveraging\nzero-shot 2D segmentation and optical flow cues for dynamic decomposition and\nmotion optimization. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and KITTI datasets\ndemonstrate the competitive performance of our approach over prior\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
