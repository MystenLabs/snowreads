In this paper, we innovatively propose to introduce\nSimAM and CBAM attention mechanism in U-Net, and the experimental results show\nthat after adding SimAM and CBAM modules alone, the model improves 17.41% and\n12.23% in MIoU, and the Mpa and Accuracy are also significantly improved. And\nafter fusing the two,the model performance jumps up to 19.11% in MIoU, and the\nMpa and Accuracy are also improved by 16.38% and 14.8% respectively, showing\nexcellent segmentation accuracy and visual effect with strong generalization\nability and robustness. This study opens up a new path for remote sensing image\nsegmentation technology and has important reference value for algorithm\nselection and improvement.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DE8ZXA3blTKnwewror12iHZdMbXGTpNqOgwLqnmQx7Y","pdfSize":"249252"}
