Boundary conditions can\ndrastically modify the scaling behaviors: The scaling exponent is found to be\n$\\alpha=1/2$ for hybridized and fully open boundary conditions, and $\\alpha=2$\nfor periodic boundary condition. We argue that the exponent $\\alpha=1/2$ cannot\nbe explained by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism unless we adopt an effective\ndimension $d^{\\rm eff}=1$ instead of the real dimension $d=2$. For comparison,\nwe also investigate the slow quench dynamics across the bulk-obstructed phase\ntransitions and a single multicritical point, which obeys the Kibble-Zurek\nmechanism with dimension $d=2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
