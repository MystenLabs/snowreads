While user interfaces have been improved over\ntime, neutron scattering experiments still require specific knowledge or\ntraining by an expert due to the complexity of such advanced instrumentation\nand the limited number of experiments each person may perform each year. This\npaper introduces an innovative chatbot application that leverages Large\nLanguage Models(LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technologies to\nsignificantly enhance the user experience at the EQ-SANS, a small-angle neutron\nscattering instrument at the Spallation Neutron Source of Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory. Through a user-centric design approach, the EQ-SANS Assisting\nChatbot (ESAC) serves as an interactive reference for users, thereby\nfacilitating the use of the instrument by visiting scientists. By bridging the\ngap between the users of EQ-SANS and the control systems required to perform\ntheir experiments, the ESAC sets a new standard for interactive learning and\nsupport for the scientific community using large-scale scientific facilities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"PhaqstbNKPlLxc7lcxHxbrs7f_1VUaWiEkSXrTkWnVs","pdfSize":"4516998"}
