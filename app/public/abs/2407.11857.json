We propose to conceptualize\ndialogue consistency as a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), wherein\nvariables represent segments of the dialogue referencing the conversational\ndomain, and constraints among variables reflect dialogue properties, including\nlinguistic, conversational, and domain-based aspects. To demonstrate the\nfeasibility of the approach, we utilize a CSP solver to detect inconsistencies\nin dialogues re-lexicalized by an LLM. Our findings indicate that: (i) CSP is\neffective to detect dialogue inconsistencies; and (ii) consistent dialogue\nre-lexicalization is challenging for state-of-the-art LLMs, achieving only a\n0.15 accuracy rate when compared to a CSP solver. Furthermore, through an\nablation study, we reveal that constraints derived from domain knowledge pose\nthe greatest difficulty in being respected. We argue that CSP captures core\nproperties of dialogue consistency that have been poorly considered by\napproaches based on component pipelines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5BCxM32NuwJG8I5dO98lPOTqYyoxlHklRnOceugqkvk","pdfSize":"261681"}
