Here, we address this challenge with a compact,\nnarrowband source design. The entangled pairs are generated via SPDC in two\nperpendicularly oriented nonlinear crystals in a Fabry-P\\'e{}rot cavity. We\nshow that the case of highly non-degenerate wavelengths and type-II phase\nmatching is the most promising candidate for a practical implementation. Using\nthe parameters of an experiment we are currently working on, this design should\nallow generating entangled photons with a bandwidth of a few MHz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
