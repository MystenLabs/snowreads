Current work explores much of\nthese concepts in simulations, that are developed to understand how quantum\nnetworking will be set up and researchers can experiment virtually. Exposing\nflaws in network designs, like unsustainable topologies, or develop protocols\nthat efficiently utilize network resources, simulators can also help assess\nwhether workloads are balanced across virtual machines in the network. However,\nmuch of these simulation models come without reliable verification methods, for\ntesting performance in real deployments.\n  In this paper, we present a review of, to the best of our knowledge,\ncurrently used toolkits for modeling quantum networks. With these toolkits and\nstandardized validation techniques, we can lay down the foundations for more\naccurate and reliable quantum network simulators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bsn-rDnB88cTnFrvAnoPPGwOJ1Jqjs2xnU1t6htpXGQ","pdfSize":"541982"}
