Despite initial attempts to integrate\ndeep learning into object-based image analysis (OBIA), its full potential\nremains largely unexplored. In this article, as OBIA usage becomes more\nwidespread, we conducted a comprehensive review and expansion of its task\nsubdomains, with or without the integration of deep learning. Furthermore, we\nhave identified and summarized five prevailing strategies to address the\nchallenge of deep learning's limitations in directly processing unstructured\nobject data within OBIA, and this review also recommends some important future\nresearch directions. Our goal with these endeavors is to inspire more\nexploration in this fascinating yet overlooked area and facilitate the\nintegration of deep learning into OBIA processing workflows.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
