Specifically, we analyze two\nscenarios, where the $J^P$ quantum numbers of $N^*(2080)$ are $3/2^-$ and\n$1/2^-$. Our results show that the contribution from $s$-channel $N^*$ exchange\ndominates the total cross section, surpassing those from $t$-channel $K^{(*)}$\nexchange and $u$-channel $\\Sigma$ exchange. Additionally, we present\npredictions for the differential cross section of the $\\pi^-p\\rightarrow\nK^{*}\\Sigma$ process. Notably, in the large momentum transfer region ($\\theta =\n90^\\circ$), the differential cross section in the $t$-distribution aligns with\nthe energy-dependent scaling formula predicted by the constituent counting\nrule, specifically, $d\\sigma/dt \\sim 1/s^{8}$ for the $\\pi^-p\\rightarrow\nK^{*}\\Sigma$ reaction. Finally, we extend the 2-to-2 scattering process to the\n2-to-3 Dalitz process and provide theoretical predictions for this scenario.\nOur findings suggest that the cross section for the $\\pi^-p \\rightarrow\nK^{*}\\Sigma\\rightarrow K^+\\pi^-\\Sigma^0$ process can reach several tens of $\\mu\nb$ near the threshold, making it highly favorable for experimental measurement.\nHowever, the current scarcity of experimental data for the $\\pi^-p\\rightarrow\nK^{*}\\Sigma$ reaction at threshold energy limits our ability to precisely\ndetermine the properties of the nucleon excited state $N^*$ and related\nphysical quantities. Therefore, additional experimental measurements of the\n$\\pi^-p \\rightarrow K^{*}\\Sigma$ reaction at threshold are strongly encouraged,\nand correlation studies could be pursued at facilities such as J-PARC, AMBER,\nand upcoming HIKE and HIAF meson beam experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
