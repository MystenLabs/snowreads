Utilizing chest X-rays (CXR) as the primary modality, we\ninvestigate whether a model trained on one pulmonary disease can make\npredictions about another novel pulmonary disease, a scenario with significant\nimplications for medical settings with limited data on emerging diseases. The\nXDT framework leverages the embedding space of a vision encoder, which, through\nkernel transformation, aids in distinguishing between diseased and non-diseased\nclasses in the latent space. This capability is especially beneficial in\nresource-limited environments or in regions with low prevalence of certain\ndiseases, where conventional diagnostic practices may fail. However, the XDT\nframework is currently limited to binary classification, determining only the\npresence or absence of a disease rather than differentiating among multiple\ndiseases. This limitation underscores the supplementary role of XDT to\ntraditional diagnostic tests in clinical settings. Furthermore, results show\nthat XDT-CXR as a framework is able to make better predictions compared to\nother zero-shot learning (ZSL) baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
