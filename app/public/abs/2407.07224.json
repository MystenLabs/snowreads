The methodology is applied in\nparallel to fluids for which the generalized Newtonian viscosity depends on\neither the shear rate or the shear stress magnitude. The only limitation on the\nviscosity model is that it allows for a closed-form solution for the axial\nvelocity profile in a straight and rigid channel. The power-law and Ellis\nviscosity models are considered as featured examples and to enable comparisons\nto previous works. The analytical expression obtained via the reciprocal\ntheorem shows that the pressure drop reduction under the power-law model can\nalso be obtained from the pressure drop reduction under the Ellis model in the\nregime of large Carreau number (small Ellis number).\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
