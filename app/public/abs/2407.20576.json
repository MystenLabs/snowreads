They may (i) prescribe using particular redundant\ndictionaries for certain classes of signals to become sparsely represented, or\n(ii) dictate specific measurement mechanisms which exploit certain physical\nprinciples. On the problem of RIP measurement matrix design in compressed\nsensing with redundant dictionaries, we give a simple construction to derive\nsensing matrices whose compositions with a prescribed dictionary have a high\nprobability of the RIP in the $k \\log(n/k)$ regime. Our construction thus\nprovides recovery guarantees usually only attainable for sensing matrices from\nrandom ensembles with sparsifying orthonormal bases. Moreover, we use the\ndictionary factorization idea that our construction rests on in the application\nof magnetic resonance imaging, in which also the sensing matrix is prescribed\nby quantum mechanical principles. We propose a recovery algorithm based on\ntransforming the acquired measurements such that the compressed sensing theory\nfor RIP embeddings can be utilized to recover wavelet coefficients of the\ntarget image, and show its performance on examples from the fastMRI dataset.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
