In this paper, we introduce a new active\nset algorithm for solving such problems and analyze its possible advantages.\nThe novelty of the proposed scheme is in the way of solving the KKT system\nbased on matrix properties. More precisely, we combine the two KKT equations to\nreduce the order and substitute it with a null space computation. The null\nspace is in hand by use of the singular values decomposition. In problems with\nhigh number of independent constraints, we proposed another scheme. This also\naims to solve the KKT system based on matrix properties. We implement both\nalgorithms and test them over both randomly generated problems and standard\nproblems mentioned in CUTEst. In general, more than 2000 tests with great\nvariety are generated and computing times and accuracies are reported. The\nproposed schemes for solving convex quadratic problems are members of active\nset family. Because of using matrix properties, it reduces computing time and\nas larger as the problem is, the improvement shows to be more remarkable. The\nfirst strategy performs the original active set when the number of constraints\nis low while the second outperforms the original algorithm when there exists a\nlot of independent constraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
