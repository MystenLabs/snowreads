We analyze the architectural advancements, performance improvements,\nand suitability for edge deployment across these versions. YOLOv5 introduced\nsignificant innovations such as the CSPDarknet backbone and Mosaic\nAugmentation, balancing speed and accuracy. YOLOv8 built upon this foundation\nwith enhanced feature extraction and anchor-free detection, improving\nversatility and performance. YOLOv10 represents a leap forward with NMS-free\ntraining, spatial-channel decoupled downsampling, and large-kernel\nconvolutions, achieving state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational\noverhead. Our findings highlight the progressive enhancements in accuracy,\nefficiency, and real-time performance, particularly emphasizing their\napplicability in resource-constrained environments. This review provides\ninsights into the trade-offs between model complexity and detection accuracy,\noffering guidance for selecting the most appropriate YOLO version for specific\nedge computing applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
