We\nobserved a maximum effective PMA energy density (Keff) of = 1.604 x 106 erg/cc\nwith low saturation magnetization (Ms) at the specified TA. The enhancement of\nKeff with Ms is significantly influenced by structural variations at the\ninterfaces of CoFeMnSi and MgAl2O4, attributed to sufficient interfacial\noxidation dependent on the TA. The TA was identified as a critical factor\naffecting the surface morphology, grain size, and surface roughness of the\nmultilayer. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) measurements were employed to\nconfirm the presence of Co-O or Fe-O bond in the multilayer structures,\nelucidating the true origin of PMA. The control of interfacial oxidation at the\ninterface during annealing is crucial for regulating the strength of PMA.\nTherefore, this double CoFeMnSi/MgAl2O4-based multilayer presents a promising\navenue, serving as a favorable candidate for future p-MTJs-based spintronic\ndevices with enhanced thermal stability.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
