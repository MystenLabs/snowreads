The latter is solely determined by the real roots of a\ndimension-dependent polynomial. We also recover the static spherically\nsymmetric (black hole) solutions of Lovelock gravity using Palais' symmetric\ncriticality principle. We show how to linearize the generic field equations of\nLovelock models about a given maximally symmetric vacuum, which turns out to\nfactorize into the product of yet another dimension-dependent polynomial and\nthe linearized Einstein tensor about the relevant background. We also describe\nhow to compute conserved charges using linearized field equations along with\nthe relevant background Killing isometries. We further describe and discuss the\nspecial vacua which are defined by the simultaneous vanishing of the\naforementioned polynomials.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4ktF0awLs0MDQYs4oxJvlLIlhdXwHiOUIip2gGVi90c","pdfSize":"255931"}
