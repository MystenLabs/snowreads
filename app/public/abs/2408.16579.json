Cosmic microwave background (CMB) $\\mu$ distortion tightly\nconstrain the abundance of PBHs in the mass range of $10^4 \\sim 10^{11}\nM_{\\odot}$ recently, limiting their potential to serve as seeds for the SMBHs\nobserved. Given that $\\mu$ distortion directly constrain the primordial power\nspectrum, it is crucial to employ more precise methods in computing PBH\nabundance to strengthen the reliability of these constraints. By a\nPress-Schechter (PS) type method utilizing the compaction function, we find\nthat the abundance of PBHs could be higher than previously estimated\nconstraints from $\\mu$ distortion observations. Furthermore, our analysis shows\nthat variations in the shape of the power spectrum have a negligible impact on\nour conclusions within the mass ranges under consideration. This conclusion\nprovides us a perspective for further research on the constrain of PBH by $\\mu$\ndistortion.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
