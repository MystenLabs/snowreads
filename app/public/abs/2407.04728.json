This demonstration presents a\nhigh-bandwidth, real-time integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) platform\noperating in the upper D-band at 160 GHz. The platform comprises a\nsoftware-defined intermediate frequency transceiver and a D-band radio\nfrequency module. Its flexible software design allows for rapid integration of\nsignal processing algorithms. Highlighting its potential for advanced research\nin ISAC systems, the platforms's efficacy is showcased through a live\ndemonstration with an algorithm implementing human target tracking and activity\nclassification.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
