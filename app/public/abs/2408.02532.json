This correspondence is well-known in characteristic zero since\nthe rational double points are quotient singularities in characteristic zero\nwhereas not necessarily in positive characteristic. Considering some rational\ndouble points are not taut in characteristic two, three or five, we can see\nthere exist two rational double points which are not analytically isomorphic\nbut whose singularity categories are triangulated equivalent. As an\napplication, we construct a counter-example in positive characteristic of a\ntheorem of Hua and Keller: the dg singularity category of a hypersurface\nsingularity determines its Tyurina algebra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
