We propose two schemes for\nenumerating active users in such a GF-NOMA system, which is equivalent to\nestimating the sparsity level. Both schemes utilize a short common pilot and\nthe eigenvalues of the sample covariance matrix of the received signal. The two\nschemes differ in their treatment of noise variance: one exploits known\nvariance information, while the other is designed to function without this\nknowledge. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nschemes in terms of the normalized mean-squared error.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
