In large multipartite systems,\nnonlocality characterization quickly becomes a challenging task. A common\npractice is to make use of symmetries, low-order correlators, or exploiting\nlocal geometries, to restrict the class of inequalities. In this paper, we\ncharacterize translation-invariant (TI) Bell inequalities with finite-range\ncorrelators in one-dimensional geometries. We introduce a novel methodology\nbased on tropical algebra tensor networks and highlight its connection to graph\ntheory. Surprisingly, we find that the TI Bell polytope has a number of\nextremal points that can be uniformly upper-bounded with respect to the system\nsize. We give an efficient method to list all vertices of the polytope for a\nparticular system size, and characterize the tightness of a given TI Bell\ninequality. The connections highlighted in our work allow us to re-interpret\nconcepts developed in the fields of tropical algebra and graph theory in the\ncontext of Bell nonlocality, and vice-versa.
