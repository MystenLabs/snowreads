However,\nmodern-day photonic computing strategies are predominantly analog, making them\nsusceptible to noise and intrinsically difficult to scale. The optical Skyrmion\noffers a route to overcoming these limitations through digitization in the form\nof a discrete topological number that can be assigned to the analog optical\nfield. Apart from an intrinsic robustness against perturbations, optical\nSkyrmions represent a new dimension that has yet to be exploited for photonic\ncomputing, namely spatially varying polarization. Here, we propose a method of\nperforming perturbation-resilient integer arithmetic with this new dimension of\noptical Skyrmions through passive optical components and present experimental\nevidence demonstrating its feasibility. To the best of our knowledge, this is\nthe first time such discrete mathematical operations have been directly\nachieved using optical Skyrmions without external energy input.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
