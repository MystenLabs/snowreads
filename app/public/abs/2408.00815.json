Their technique employed finite fields. This same result was\nobtained later by using another technique. In this article, we examine the\ncomplete graph on 17 vertices, K17, which can be represented as a regular\npolygon of 17 sides with all its diagonals. We color each edge of K17 with one\nof the three colors, blue, red or yellow. The graph thus obtained is called\ncomplete trichromatic graph K17^(3) (the superscript determines the number of\ncolors). A triangle contained in graph K17^(3) with edges colored with one and\nonly one color is called monochromatic. It has been shown that for any coloring\nof the K17^(3) edges, K17^(3) contains at least one monochromatic triangle.\nThis article examines the problem of determining the minimum number of\nmonochromatic triangles with the same color contained in K17^(3).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
