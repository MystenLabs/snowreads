Under linear approximation, this is\nknown as the Fermi golden rule (FGR). However, this principle becomes\nchallenging to apply in the \"0/0\" limit, where\n${\\omega},{\\Delta}{\\rightarrow}0$ simultaneously. In \"0/0\" scenarios, such as\ntopological phase transition (TPT), a type-II pumping, geometric pumping (GP),\nis recognized subject to geometric rules, distinguished from type-I dictated by\nFGR. Type-I features an \"arrow of energy\", sending particles higher in energy,\nreflected by FGR's dependence on Fermi distribution $f_v-f_c$ (probabilities of\nvalence and conduction bands). While GP is non-directional, its probability\nrelies on $f_v+f_c-2f_v f_c$ instead, a key signature for detection. In this\nwork, we address: (1) the concept of GP; (2) its features of fractionality,\nirreversibility, and dependence on TPT; (3) experimental detection with\nultra-fast spectrum in coherent phonon driving of ZrTe$_5$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
