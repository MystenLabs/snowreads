However, since they rely\non sign flips across the surface, these algorithms cannot be used directly on\nUnsigned Distance Fields (UDFs). In this work, we introduce a deep-learning\napproach to taking a UDF and turning it locally into an SDF, so that it can be\neffectively triangulated using existing algorithms. We show that it achieves\nbetter accuracy in surface detection than existing methods. Furthermore it\ngeneralizes well to unseen shapes and datasets, while being parallelizable. We\nalso demonstrate the flexibily of the method by using it in conjunction with\nDualMeshUDF, a state of the art dual meshing method that can operate on UDFs,\nimproving its results and removing the need to tune its parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
