Different from the classical mean-field limit\nanalysis, the chaos in this model is imposed at discrete time and is propagated\nto discrete time flux. We approach separately the limits of the number of\nparticles $N\\to\\infty$ and the discrete time interval $\\tau\\to 0$ with respect\nto the RBM, by using the flocking property of the Cucker-Smale model and the\nobservation in combinatorics. The Wasserstein distance is used to quantify the\ndifference between the approximation limit and the original mean-field limit.\nAlso, we combine the RBM with generalized Polynomial Chaos (gPC) expansion and\nproposed the RBM-gPC method to approximate stochastic mean-field equations,\nwhich conserves positivity and momentum of the mean-field limit with random\ninputs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
