To promote both safety and courtesy in\nAV's behavior, an extension of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs)-inspired risk\nevaluation framework is proposed in this paper by considering both noisy\nobserved positions and velocities of surrounding vehicles. The perceived risk\nby the ego vehicle can be visualized as a risk map that reflects the\nunderstanding of the surrounding environment and thus shows the potential for\nfacilitating safe and courteous driving. By incorporating the risk evaluation\nframework into the Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme, we propose a\nCourteous MPC for ego AV to generate courteous behaviors that 1) reduce the\noverall risk imposed on other vehicles and 2) respect the hard safety\nconstraints and the original objective for efficiency. We demonstrate the\nperformance of the proposed Courteous MPC via theoretical analysis and\nsimulation experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
