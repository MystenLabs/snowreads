Given the current resource inventory levels, the retailer makes an\nassortment decision at each period, and the goal of the retailer is to maximize\nthe total profit from purchases. With the exact optimal dynamic assortment\nsolution being computationally intractable, a practical strategy is to adopt\nthe re-solving technique that periodically re-optimizes deterministic linear\nprograms (LP) arising from fluid approximation. However, the fractional\nstructure of MNL makes the fluid approximation in assortment optimization\nhighly non-linear, which brings new technical challenges. To address this\nchallenge, we propose a new epoch-based re-solving algorithm that effectively\ntransforms the denominator of the objective into the constraint. Theoretically,\nwe prove that the regret (i.e., the gap between the resolving policy and the\noptimal objective of the fluid approximation) scales logarithmically with the\nlength of time horizon and resource capacities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
