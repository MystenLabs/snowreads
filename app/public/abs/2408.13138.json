While\ntheir ability to automate difficult reasoning processes required to handle\nprotocols at that scale is impressive, there remains a gap in the modeling\nlanguages used. In particular, providing support for writing and maintaining\nlarge protocol specifications. This work attempts to fill this gap by\nintroducing a high-level protocol modeling language, called Tamgram, with a\nformal semantics that can be translated to the multiset rewriting semantics of\nTamarin. Tamgram supports writing native Tamarin code directly, but also allows\nfor easier structuring of large specifications through various high-level\nconstructs, in particular those needed to manipulate states in protocols. We\nprove the soundness and the completeness of Tamgram with respect to the trace\nsemantics of Tamarin, discuss different translation strategies, and identify an\noptimal strategy that yields performance comparable to manually coded Tamarin\nspecifications. Finally we show the practicality of Tamgram with a set of small\ncase studies and one large scale case study.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
