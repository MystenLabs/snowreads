By automatically preprocessing and\nextracting essential HVAC object information then creating detailed 3D models,\nour proposed AHMsys significantly reduced the 20 percent work schedule of the\nBIM process in Akila. This advancement highlights the essential impact of\nintegrating AI technologies in managing the lifecycle of a digital\nrepresentation of the building.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
