The deformation factor $w(r)$ in the metric is\nobtained using the two types of neural network. First, we numerically obtain\n$w(r)$ using MLP, accurately reproducing the QCD results of the lattice, and\ncalculate the heavy quark potential at finite temperature and the chemical\npotential. Subsequently, we employ KAN within the Andreev-Zakharov model for\nvalidation purpose, which can analytically reconstruct $w(r)$, matching the\nAndreev-Zakharov model exactly and confirming the validity of MLP. Finally, we\nconstruct an analytical holographic model using KAN and study the heavy-quark\npotential at finite temperature and chemical potential using the KAN-based\nholographic model. This work demonstrates the potential of KAN to derive\nanalytical expressions for high-energy physics applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
