Lower\nbounds for the quantity of such pairs where $\\pi$ is non-singular were first\nstudied in ``Glasby, Niemeyer, Praeger (Finite Fields Appl., 2022)'', which was\nlater improved in ``Glasby, Ihringer, Mattheus (Des. Codes Cryptogr., 2023)''\nand generalised in ``Glasby, Niemeyer, Praeger (Linear Algebra Appl., 2022)''.\nIn this paper, we derive explicit formulae, which allow us to give the exact\nproportion and improve the known lower bounds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
