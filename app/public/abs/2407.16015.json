Here, we show that the key insight underlying the Wallcamera is\nthe same one that underpins the concept and the prototype of differential\nimaging forensics (DIF), both of which were validated and reported several\nyears prior to the Wallcamera's debut. Rather than being the first to extract\nand amplify invisible signals -- aka latent evidence in the forensics context\n-- from wall reflections in a video, or the first to propose activity\nrecognition following that approach, the Wallcamera's actual innovation is\nachieving activity recognition at a finer granularity than DIF demonstrated. In\naddition to activity recognition, DIF as conceived has a number of other\napplications in forensics, including 1) the recovery of a photographer's\npersonal identifiable information such as body width, height, and even the\ncolor of their clothing, from a single photo, and 2) the detection of image\ntampering and deepfake videos.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
