We consider two applications to the geometry of\nthis moduli space in genus $2$, denoted as $\\bar{\\mathcal S}_2$. First, we\ncharacterize the canonical projection of $\\bar{\\mathcal S}_2$ in terms of its\nbehavior near the boundary, proving in particular that $\\bar{\\mathcal S}_2$ is\nnot projected. Secondly, we combine the information on superperiods with the\nexplicit calculation of genus $2$ Mumford isomorphism, due to Witten, to study\nthe expansion of the superstring measure for genus $2$ near the boundary. We\nalso present the proof, due to Deligne, of regularity of the superstring\nmeasure on $\\bar{\\mathcal S}_g$ for any genus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4apI-Yx4QOoTr4sFaXONtFBcM67zvMYmPuYRfrOEJhk","pdfSize":"715920"}
