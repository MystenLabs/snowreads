Explicit formulas for root\nvectors are provided for $\\imath$quantum groups of each rank 1 type. We show\nthat our PBW type bases give rise to integral bases for the modified\n$\\imath$quantum groups. The leading terms of our bases can be identified with\nthe usual PBW bases in the theory of quantum groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
