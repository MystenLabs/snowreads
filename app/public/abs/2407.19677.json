Evolving advances in AI and emerging concerns about the misuse\nof personal data have pushed policymakers to draft legislation on trustworthy\nAI and privacy protection for its citizens. This paper presents the state of\nthe privacy legislation at the U.S. Congress and outlines how voice data is\nconsidered as part of the legislation definition. This paper also reviews\nadditional privacy protection for children. This paper presents a holistic\nreview of enacted and proposed privacy laws, and consideration for voice data,\nincluding guidelines for processing children's data, in those laws across the\nfifty U.S. states. As a groundbreaking alternative to actual human data,\nethically generated synthetic data allows much flexibility to keep AI\ninnovation in progress. Given the consideration of synthetic data in AI\nlegislation by policymakers to be relatively new, as compared to that of\nprivacy laws, this paper reviews regulatory considerations for synthetic data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
