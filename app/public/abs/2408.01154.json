Recently, embedding-based EA has attracted significant attention\nand many approaches have been proposed. Early approaches primarily focus on\nlearning entity embeddings from the structural features of KGs, defined by\nrelation triples. Later methods incorporated entities' names and attributes as\nauxiliary information to enhance embeddings for EA. However, these approaches\noften used different techniques to encode structural and attribute information,\nlimiting their interaction and mutual enhancement. In this work, we propose a\ndense entity retrieval framework for EA, leveraging language models to\nuniformly encode various features of entities and facilitate nearest entity\nsearch across KGs. Alignment candidates are first generated through entity\nretrieval, which are subsequently reranked to determine the final alignments.\nWe conduct comprehensive experiments on both cross-lingual and monolingual EA\ndatasets, demonstrating that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance\ncompared to existing EA methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
