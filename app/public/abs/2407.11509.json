Specifically, in one\ndimension, two systems can share the same matrix representation. In this work,\nwe investigate both the fermion and hardcore-boson models with nearest-neighbor\n(NN) interaction in a ring lattice. We construct the exact eigenstates of the\nhardcore-boson model with resonant NN interaction and show that they possess\noff-diagonal long-range order (ODLRO) in the thermodynamic limit. In\ncomparison, the fermionic counterpart does not support such a feature due to\nthe different particle statistics, although they share an identical energy\nspectrum. In addition, we examine the effect of the periodic boundary condition\non the dynamics of the condensate states through numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
