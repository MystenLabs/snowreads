To leverage the approximation ability of neural networks, we\nproposed a general framework for optimizing and learning Nash equilibrium using\nneural networks to estimate players' cost functions. Depending on the\navailability of data, we propose two approaches (a) the two-stage approach: we\nneed the data pair of players' strategy and relevant function value to first\nlearn the players' cost functions by monotonic neural networks or graph neural\nnetworks, and then solve the Nash equilibrium with the learned neural networks;\n(b) the joint approach: we use the data of partial true observation of the\nequilibrium and contextual information (e.g., weather) to optimize and learn\nNash equilibrium simultaneously. The problem is formulated as an optimization\nproblem with equilibrium constraints and solved using a modified\nBackpropagation Algorithm. The proposed methods are validated in numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
