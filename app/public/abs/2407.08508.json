Aiming for improvement, we develop a metric that\nquantifies the value of a tackle in terms of the prevented expected points\n(PEP). Specifically, we compare the real end-of-play yard line of tackles with\nthe predicted yard line given the hypothetical situation that the tackle had\nbeen missed. For this, we use high-resolution tracking data, that capture the\nposition and velocity of players, and a random forest to account for\nuncertainty and multi-modality in yard-line prediction. Moreover, we\nacknowledge the difference in the importance of tackles by assigning an\nexpected points value to each individual tree prediction of the random forest.\nFinally, to relate the value of tackles to a player's ability to tackle, we fit\na suitable mixed-effect model to the PEP values. Our approach contributes to a\ndeeper understanding of defensive performances in American football and offers\nvaluable insights for coaches and analysts.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
