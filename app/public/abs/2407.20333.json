In this work we compute the spin cobordism\ngroups of the classifying space of $Spin(32)/\\mathbb{Z}_2$ relevant to\ndescribing type I/heterotic string theory and explore their (shared)\nnon-perturbative sector. To facilitate this we leverage our knowledge of type I\nD-brane physics behind the related ko-homology. The computation utilizes\nseveral established tools from algebraic topology, the focus here is on two\nspectral sequences. First, the Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence is used to\nobtain the cohomology of the classifying space of the $Spin(32)/\\mathbb{Z}_2$\nwith $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ coefficients. This will enable us to start the Adams\nspectral sequence for finally obtaining our result, the spin cobordism groups.\nWe conclude by providing a string theoretic interpretation to the cobordism\ngroups.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
