By\nusing the method of backstepping and the technique of splitting, a boundary\nfeedback controller is designed to ensure the input-to-state stability (ISS) of\nthe closed-loop system with Dirichlet boundary disturbances, while preserving\nfixed-time stability (FTS) of the corresponding disturbance-free system, for\nwhich the fixed time is either determined by the Riemann zeta function or\nfreely prescribed. To overcome the difficulty brought by Dirichlet boundary\ndisturbances, the ISS and FTS properties of the involved systems are assessed\nby applying the generalized Lyapunov method. Numerical simulations are\nconducted to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme of control\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q0r38JnmZnfN1afxeTGMVkM8BZUj7i67T1F9VHVsQrY","pdfSize":"324301"}
