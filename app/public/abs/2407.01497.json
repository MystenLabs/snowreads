Among the brightest Class~I methanol\nmasers, we have those in the $J_{-1}\\rightarrow(J-$ 1)$_{0}-E$ line series,\ncurrently reported for the $J=4-9$ transitions, with the only exception being\nthe $J=7$ one at 181.295~GHz, and never expanded to higher $J$ transitions. We\naim to search for population inversion in the $7_{-1}\\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and\n$10_{-1}\\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transition lines at 181.295 and\n326.961\\,GHz, respectively, and also extend the number of known low-mass\nstar-forming sources harboring Class\\,I methanol masers. We employed the\nAtacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) 12\\,m telescope to survey low-mass\nGalactic sources, focusing on methanol emission lines. We conducted rotation\ndiagrams for all sources with detected $J=7$ methanol line transitions, while\nemploying radiative transfer modeling (both in and out of local thermodynamic\nequilibrium) to characterize methanol excitation conditions in detail for one\nspecific source with detected masers. We have detected the\n$7_{-1}\\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ and $10_{-1}\\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ methanol transitions\nin six out of nineteen sources. Among them, we firmly determined the\n$10_{-1}\\rightarrow9_{0}-E$ maser nature in CARMA\\,7, L1641N, NGC\\,2024, and\nSerpens FIRS, and we claim for the presence of inverted population emission in\nthe $7_{-1}\\rightarrow6_{0}-E$ line toward CARMA\\,7 and L1641N. This represents\nthe first report of methanol maser emission in these particular transitions.\nOur study supports previous works indicating that conditions for Class\\,I\nmethanol maser emission are satisfied in low-mass star-forming regions and\nexpands the range of detectable frequencies toward higher values.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"a-RGv7fyIeQH2qBMacjRQotDx-NTigOn960i14bj5Vc","pdfSize":"12463603"}
