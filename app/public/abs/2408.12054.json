We obtain ultralong $T_{1}$, e.g., $\\sim$600 ns at 300\nK, which leads to ultralong in-plane spin diffusion length $\\sim$110 $\\mu$m\nwithin the drift-diffusion model. Our prediction sets the upper bound of\n$T_{1}$ of graphite at each given temperature and Fermi level. The anisotropy\nratios of $T_{1}$ or values of $T_{1z}/T_{1x}$ are found small and around 0.6.\nWe examine the applicability of the well-known Elliot-Yafet (EY) relation,\nwhich declares that spin relaxation rate $T_{1\\alpha}^{-1}$ ($\\alpha=x,y,z$) is\nproportional to the product of the ensemble average of spin mixing parameter\n$\\left\\langle b_{\\alpha}^{2}\\right\\rangle $ and carrier relaxation rate\n$\\tau_{p}^{-1}$. Our numerical tests suggest that the EY relation works\nqualitatively if the degeneracy threshold $t^{\\mathrm{deg}}$ for evaluating\n$b_{\\alpha}^{2}$ is elatively large (not much smaller than or comparable to\n$k_{B}T$), e.g., $10^{-3}$ eV or larger, but fails if $t^{\\mathrm{deg}}$ is too\ntiny (much smaller than $k_{B}T$), e.g., $10^{-6}$ eV or smaller.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
