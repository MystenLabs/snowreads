Speech emotion recognition (SER) models\ncan suffer from particularly many sources of uncertainty, such as the ambiguity\nof emotions, Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data or, in general, poor recording\nconditions. Reliable UQ methods are thus of particular interest as in many SER\napplications no prediction is better than a faulty prediction. While the\neffects of label ambiguity on uncertainty are well documented in the\nliterature, we focus our work on an evaluation of UQ methods for SER under\ncommon challenges in real-world application, such as corrupted signals, and the\nabsence of speech. We show that simple UQ methods can already give an\nindication of the uncertainty of a prediction and that training with additional\nOOD data can greatly improve the identification of such signals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
