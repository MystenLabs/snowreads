Based on the group\ntheoretical analysis, we show that the chirality-related second-order nonlinear\noptical response occurs for two different input frequencies when the low-energy\nmodel Hamiltonian includes a time-reversal-even pseudoscalar quantity, i.e.,\nthe electric toroidal monopole. We demonstrate its emergence by investigating a\nfundamental microscopic model with the chiral-type antisymmetric spin--orbit\ninteraction on a simple cubic lattice. By analyzing the behavior of nonlinear\noptical conductivity based on the Kubo formula, we find that the response is\nlargely enhanced when one of the frequencies is set to zero and the other is\nset to a resonant frequency. We also discuss the relaxation time dependence of\nthe response.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
