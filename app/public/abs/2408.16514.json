Already\nin the simplest superrenormalizable case, the theory has a six-derivative\nLagrangian, admitting either a real or complex spectrum of masses. In the case\nof a real spectrum, there are the graviton, massive unphysical ghosts, and\nnormal particles with masses exceeding the ones of the ghosts. It is also\npossible to have pairs of complex conjugate massive ghost-like particles. We\nshow that in both cases, these theories do not admit a K\\\"all\\'en-Lehmann\nrepresentation and do not satisfy the positivity criterium of consistency in\nterms of the fields associated to those particles. In the main part of the\nwork, using a relatively simple Euclidean scalar toy model, we show that the\ntheory with complex spectrum forms bound states confining unphysical massive\nexcitations into a normal composite particle. Finally, we discuss the\ncosmological implications of such a ghost confinement.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MCMijKIuYdUDFVTZLWoI2LUHkopZw1gvRHRnUrJDg1U","pdfSize":"235844"}
