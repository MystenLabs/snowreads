The lack of\navailability of prior knowledge in dynamic scenarios is without doubt a major\nbarrier for scalable machine intelligence. My view of the interaction between\nthe two tiers intelligence is based on the idea that when knowledge is not\nreadily available at the knowledge base tier, more knowledge can be extracted\nfrom the other tier, which has access to trained models from machine learning\nalgorithms. To analyse this hypothesis, I create two experiments based on\ndifferent datasets, which are related directly to risk-awareness of autonomous\nsystems, analysed by different machine learning algorithms (namely; multi-layer\nfeedforward backpropagation, Naive Bayes, and J48 decision tree). My analysis\nshows that the two-tiers intelligence approach for coupling ML and KB is\ncomputationally valid and the time complexity of the algorithms during the\nrobot mission is linear with the size of the data and knowledge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
