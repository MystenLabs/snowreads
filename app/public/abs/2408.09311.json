The system is designed to be\nhighly accessible, user-friendly, and capable of functioning in real-time under\nvarying environmental conditions like backgrounds, lighting, skin tones, and\nhand sizes. We discuss the technical details of the model architecture,\napplication in the wild, as well as potential future enhancements for\nreal-world consumer applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S0kmZlZszZBk-piUsXdxEDsxMdorAJ5Gnuj68vbzbME","pdfSize":"2232462"}
