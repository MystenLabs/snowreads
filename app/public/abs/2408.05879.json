This function contains richly detailed mechanistic\ninformation about transition pathways, but a full parameterization of the\ncommittor requires building representing a high-dimensional function, a\ngenerically challenging task. Recent efforts to leverage neural networks as a\nmeans to solve high-dimensional partial differential equations, often called\n\"physics-informed\" machine learning, have brought the committor into\ncomputational reach. Here, we build on the semigroup approach to learning the\ncommittor and assess its utility for predicting dynamical quantities such as\ntransition rates. We show that a careful reframing of the objective function\nand improved adaptive sampling strategies provide highly accurate\nrepresentations of the committor. Furthermore, by directly applying the Hill\nrelation, we show that these committors provide accurate transition rates for\nmolecular system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
