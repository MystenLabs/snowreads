The proposed framework employs an indirect channel for\nnormal supply, wherein spare satellites are initially injected into a parking\norbit before transferring to the target orbital plane via propulsion systems\nand orbital perturbations. Conversely, the auxiliary supply mode utilizes a\ndirect channel, injecting spare satellites immediately into their designated\norbital planes. The inventory management model is constructed using parametric\nreplenishment policies: $\\left(s,Q\\right)$ and $\\left(R_1,R_2,Q_1,Q_2\\right)$\nwith a time window. Following this model, two optimization problems are\naddressed to construct the supply chain for satellite mega-constellation\nreplenishment and to evaluate its performance. These are decision-making\ncontexts from the perspectives of constellation operators and launch service\nproviders. The case study showcases the practical applicability of the proposed\nmodel and optimization problems, yielding valuable insights for stakeholders in\nthe spaceborne industry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RGw5dfWdnheWgc5-QZN7pzZlOHa43K8_qyaDBGkLpio","pdfSize":"1620295"}
