Specifically, the functional regression parameters are\nsupported on a connected and compact two--point homogeneous space. The\nGeneralized Least--Squares (GLS) parameter estimator is computed in the\nlinearized model, having error term displaying manifold scale varying Long\nRange Dependence (LRD). The performance of the theoretical and plug--in\nnonlinear regression predictors is illustrated by simulations on sphere, in\nterms of the empirical mean of the computed spherical functional absolute\nerrors. In the case where the second--order structure of the functional error\nterm in the linearized model is unknown, its estimation is performed by minimum\ncontrast in the functional spectral domain. The linear case is illustrated in\nthe Supplementary Material, revealing the effect of the slow decay velocity in\ntime of the trace norms of the covariance operator family of the regression LRD\nerror term. The purely spatial statistical analysis of atmospheric pressure at\nhigh cloud bottom, and downward solar radiation flux in Alegria et al. (2021)\nis extended to the spatiotemporal context, illustrating the numerical results\nfrom a generated synthetic data set.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
