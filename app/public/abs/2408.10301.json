Here, we show that quantum mechanics hinders chaos\nin many-body systems: although the quantum eigenstates are thermal and strongly\nentangled, exponentially many of them are scarred, that is, have an enlarged\nweight along underlying classical unstable periodic orbits. Scarring makes the\nsystem more likely to be found on an orbit it was initialized on, retaining a\nmemory of its past and thus weakly breaking ergodicity, even at long times and\ndespite the system being fully thermal. We demonstrate the ubiquity of quantum\nscarring in many-body systems by considering a large family of spin models,\nincluding some of the most popular ones from condensed matter physics. Our\nfindings, at hand for modern quantum simulators, prove structure in spite of\nchaos in many-body quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
