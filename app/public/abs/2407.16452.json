By advocating for the use of a consistent\nSingle Folding Model (SFM) for all optical potentials in IAV calculations, we\naim to reduce the uncertainties associated with half-shell components and\nenhance agreement with experimental data. We present results from\ndeuteron-induced reactions on $^{60}$Ni and $^{208}$Pb, which serve as\nsurrogate targets for neutron-induced reactions on short-lived nuclei. The\napplication of consistent optical potentials derived from the SFM shows\nimproved alignment with experimental data compared to traditional global\nphenomenological potentials. Furthermore, we investigate the\n$^{59}$Co($^6$Li,$\\alpha X$) reaction, which reveals that the half-shell\n$T$-matrix plays a pivotal role in accurately modeling nuclear reactions. Our\nfindings suggest that a unified approach to optical potentials, accounting for\nhalf-shell effects, is critical for a precise understanding of complex nuclear\nreactions. This work highlights the significance of the internal dynamics of\nthe wave function, particularly in lighter targets, and underscores the\nimportance of the half-shell $T$-matrix as a previously underappreciated\nvariable in reaction calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8FoMe62SUqNjfO50mhD6V1j36YFuy0GLo2FulO86QU8","pdfSize":"470122"}
