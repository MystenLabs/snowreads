While\nthis integration presents new opportunities, it also brings novel challenges,\nparticularly in ensuring the dependability of such hybrid systems. This paper\naims to identify integration challenges, anticipate failures, and foster a\ndiverse co-design for HPC-QC systems by bringing together QC, cloud computing,\nHPC, and network security. The focus of this emerging inter-disciplinary effort\nis to develop engineering principles that ensure the dependability of hybrid\nsystems, aiming for a more prescriptive co-design cycle. Our framework will\nhelp to prevent design pitfalls and accelerate the maturation of the QC\ntechnology ecosystem. Key aspects include building resilient HPC-QC systems,\nanalyzing the applicability of conventional techniques to the quantum domain,\nand exploring the complexity of scaling in such hybrid systems. This\nunderscores the need for performance-reliability metrics specific to this new\ncomputational paradigm.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
