Its goal is to\nretrieve the relevant tables and columns of a target database for a user's\nquery while disregarding irrelevant ones. However, imperfect schema linking can\noften exclude required columns needed for accurate query generation. In this\nwork, we revisit schema linking when using the latest generation of large\nlanguage models (LLMs). We find empirically that newer models are adept at\nutilizing relevant schema elements during generation even in the presence of\nlarge numbers of irrelevant ones. As such, our Text-to-SQL pipeline entirely\nforgoes schema linking in cases where the schema fits within the model's\ncontext window in order to minimize issues due to filtering required schema\nelements. Furthermore, instead of filtering contextual information, we\nhighlight techniques such as augmentation, selection, and correction, and adopt\nthem to improve the accuracy of our Text-to-SQL pipeline. Our approach ranks\nfirst on the BIRD benchmark achieving an accuracy of 71.83%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JlmmLW88MOlGDRz2zgGigUWCzksNzmx7oWGKHScVjJA","pdfSize":"1095621"}
