The second-order\nderivative terms vanish if the local equilibrium hypersurface is the hyperplane\n$t=const$ in the collision center-of-mass frame. However, since the freeze-out\nhypersurface has a non-trivial space-time structure, these terms may result in\na non-vanishing contribution to the spin polarization, whose magnitude needs to\nbe assessed with numerical computations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
