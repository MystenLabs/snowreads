A subgraph $H$ of a multigraph $G$ is called {\\it multicolored} if its\nedges receive distinct colors in a given simple $k$-coloring of $G$. In 2004,\nKeevash-Saks-Sudakov-Verstra\\\"{e}te introduced the {\\it $k$-color Tur\\'{a}n\nnumber} $ex_k(n,H)$, which denotes the maximum number of edges in an $n$-vertex\nmultigraph that has a simple $k$-coloring containing no multicolored copies of\n$H$. They made a conjecture for any $r\\geq 3$ and $r$-color-critical graph $H$\nthat in the range of $k\\geq \\frac{r-1}{r-2}(e(H)-1)$, if $n$ is sufficiently\nlarge, then $ex_k(n, H)$ is achieved by the multigraph consisting of $k$ colors\nall of which are identical copies of the Tur\\'{a}n graph $T_{r-1}(n)$. In this\npaper, we show that this holds in the range of $k\\geq 2\\frac{r-1}{r}(e(H)-1)$,\nsignificantly improving earlier results. Our proof combines the stability\nargument of Chakraborti-Kim-Lee-Liu-Seo with a novel graph packing technique\nfor embedding multigraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
