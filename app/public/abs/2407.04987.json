All solutions to the Finsler $N$-Laplacian Liouville\nequation with finite mass are completely classified. In particular, if\n$H(\\xi)=|\\xi|$, then the Finsler $N$-Laplacian $\\Delta ^{H}_{N}$ reduces to the\nregular $N$-Laplacian $\\Delta_N$. Our result is a counterpart in the limiting\ncase $p=N$ of the classification results in \\cite{CFR} for the critical\nanisotropic $p$-Laplacian equations with $1<p<N$ in convex cones, and also\nextends the classification results in \\cite{CK,CL,CW,CL2,E} for Liouville\nequation in the whole space $\\mathbb{R}^{N}$ to general convex cones. In our\nproof, besides exploiting the anisotropic isoperimetric inequality inside\nconvex cones, we have also proved and applied the radial Poincar\\'{e} type\ninequality (Lemma \\ref{A1}), which are key ingredients in the proof and of\ntheir own importance and interests.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
