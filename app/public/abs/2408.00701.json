Inspired by\nSiamese neural networks and state-of-art multi-box detection approaches, the\njoint neural networks are able to perform object recognition and detection for\ncategories that remain unseen during the training process. Following the\none-shot object recognition/detection constraints, the training and testing\ndatasets do not contain overlapped classes, in other words, all the test\nclasses remain unseen during training. The joint networks architecture is able\nto effectively compare pairs of images via stacked convolutional layers of the\nquery and target inputs, recognising patterns of the same input query category\nwithout relying on previous training around this category. The proposed\napproach achieves 61.41% accuracy for one-shot object recognition on the\nMiniImageNet dataset and 47.1% mAP for one-shot object detection when trained\non the COCO dataset and tested using the Pascal VOC dataset.
