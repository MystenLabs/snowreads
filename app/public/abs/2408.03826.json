This is an electromagnetic inverse source problem with\nbroad applications, such as antenna synthesis and design, medical imaging, and\npollution source tracing. We introduce new imaging functions and a\ncomputational algorithm to determine the number of point sources, their\nlocations, and associated moment vectors, even when these vectors have notably\ndifferent magnitudes. The number of sources and locations are estimated using\nsignificant peaks of the imaging functions, and the moment vectors are computed\nvia explicitly simple formulas. The theoretical analysis and stability of the\nimaging functions are investigated, where the main challenge lies in analyzing\nthe behavior of the dot products between the columns of the imaginary part of\nthe Green's tensor and the unknown moment vectors. Additionally, we extend our\nmethod to reconstruct small-volume sources using an asymptotic expansion of\ntheir radiated electric field. We provide numerical examples in three\ndimensions to demonstrate the performance of our method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
