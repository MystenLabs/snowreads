Both theoretical constructions and experiments\nhave so far been restricted to the very small families of torus knots or\nlemniscate knots. Here we describe a mathematical construction that presumably\nallows us to generate optical vortices in the shape of any given knot or link.\nWe support this claim by producing for every knot $K$ in the knot table up to 8\ncrossings a complex field $\\Psi:\\mathbb{R}^3\\to\\mathbb{C}$ that satisfies the\nparaxial wave equation and whose zeros have a connected component in the shape\nof $K$. These fields thus describe optical beams in the paraxial regime with\nknotted optical vortices that go far beyond previously known examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
