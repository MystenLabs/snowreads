This framework leverages deep learning\nmethodologies, including conventional Multi-Layer Perceptrons and the newly\ndeveloped Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks. It is optimized using economic\ninformation encapsulated by Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations and coupled\nalgebraic equations. The application of neural networks holds the promise of\naccurately resolving high-dimensional problems with fewer computational demands\nand limitations compared to standard numerical methods. This versatile\nframework can be readily adapted for elementary differential equations, and\nsystems of differential equations, even in cases where the solutions may\nexhibit discontinuities. Importantly, it offers a more straightforward and\nuser-friendly implementation than existing libraries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0lhZrQ7tFZi92ijpEn9p6IIOvwLEQ_dQqr3W54GsmZk","pdfSize":"2228102"}
