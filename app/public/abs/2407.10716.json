It consists of a\nbooster composed of several dielectric disks positioned with $\\mu$m precision.\nA prototype composed of one movable disk was built to demonstrate the\nmechanical feasibility of such a booster in the challenging environment of the\nexperiment: high magnetic field to convert the axions into photons and\ncryogenic temperature to reduce the thermal noise. It was tested both inside a\nstrong magnetic field up to 1.6 T and at cryogenic temperatures down to 35K.\nThe measurements of the velocity and positioning accuracy of the disk are shown\nand are found to match the MADMAX requirements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
