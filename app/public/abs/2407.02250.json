The light operator\n$\\mathcal{O}_2$ is the dimension two superconformal primary in the stress\ntensor multiplet and $\\mathcal{H}$ is a general half-BPS superconformal primary\noperator with dimension (or $R$-charge) $\\Delta_{\\mathcal{H}}$. We consider the\nlarge-charge 't Hooft limit, where $\\Delta_{\\mathcal{H}} \\rightarrow \\infty$\nwith fixed 't Hooft-like coupling $\\lambda:=\\Delta_{\\mathcal{H}}\\, g_{_{\\rm\nYM}}^2$. We show that the $L$-loop contribution to the HHLL correlators in the\nleading large-charge limit is universal for any choice of the heavy operator\n$\\mathcal{H}$, given as $\\lambda^L \\sum_{\\ell=0}^{L} \\Phi^{(\\ell)}\n\\Phi^{(L-\\ell)}$ with an $SU(N)$ colour factor coefficient, where\n$\\Phi^{(\\ell)}$ is the ladder Feynman integral, which is known to all loops.\nThe dependence on the explicit form of the heavy operator lies only in the\ncolour factor coefficients. We determine such colour factors for several\nclasses of heavy operators, and show that the large charge limit leads to\nminimal powers of $N$. For the special class of \"canonical heavy operators\",\none can even resum the all-loop ladder integrals and determine the correlators\nat finite $\\lambda$. Furthermore, upon integrating over the spacetime\ndependence, the resulting integrated HHLL correlators agree with the existing\nresults derived from supersymmetric localisation. Finally, as an application of\nthe all-loop analytic results, we derive exact expressions for the structure\nconstants of two heavy operators and the Konishi operator, finding intriguing\nconnections with the integrated HHLL correlators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
