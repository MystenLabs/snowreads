Language is hypothesized to play a key role in human culture, driving\nindividual cognitive capacities and shaping communication. Yet the majority of\nmodels of collective innovation assign no cognitive capacities or language\nabilities to agents. Here, we contribute a computational study of collective\ninnovation where agents are Large Language Models (LLMs) that play Little\nAlchemy 2, a creative video game originally developed for humans that, as we\nargue, captures useful aspects of innovation landscapes not present in previous\ntest-beds. We, first, study an LLM in isolation and discover that it exhibits\nboth useful skills and crucial limitations. We, then, study groups of LLMs that\nshare information related to their behaviour and focus on the effect of social\nconnectivity on collective performance. In agreement with previous human and\ncomputational studies, we observe that groups with dynamic connectivity\nout-compete fully-connected groups. Our work reveals opportunities and\nchallenges for future studies of collective innovation that are becoming\nincreasingly relevant as Generative Artificial Intelligence algorithms and\nhumans innovate alongside each other.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
