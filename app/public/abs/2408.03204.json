Along with various library functionalities, we\ndescribe technical details on the efficient parallel computation of input\ngraphs, signals, and processor parameters in GPU. Then, we show its example use\nunder a music mixing scenario, where parameters of every differentiable\nprocessor in a large graph are optimized via gradient descent.
