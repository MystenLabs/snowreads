Meanwhile, enhancing dynamic network performance is a\ncrucial element in promoting technological advancement and meeting the growing\ndemands of users in many applications areas involving networks. In this\narticle, we explore an integration of LLMs and graphs in dynamic networks,\nfocusing on potential applications and a practical study. Specifically, we\nfirst review essential technologies and applications of LLM-enabled graphs,\nfollowed by an exploration of their advantages in dynamic networking.\nSubsequently, we introduce and analyze LLM-enabled graphs and their\napplications in dynamic networks from the perspective of LLMs as different\nroles. On this basis, we propose a novel framework of LLM-enabled graphs for\nnetworking optimization, and then present a case study on UAV networking,\nconcentrating on optimizing UAV trajectory and communication resource\nallocation to validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework. Finally, we\noutline several potential future extensions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
