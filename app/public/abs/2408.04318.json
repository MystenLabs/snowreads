Research predominantly focuses on these diseases due to their\nwidespread nature, aiming to decrease mortality, enhance treatment options, and\nimprove healthcare standards. Among these, kidney disease stands out as a\nparticularly severe condition affecting men and women worldwide. Nonetheless,\nthere is a pressing need for continued research into innovative, early\ndiagnostic methods to develop more effective treatments for such diseases.\nRecently, automatic diagnosis of Kidney Cancer has become an important\nchallenge especially when using deep learning (DL) due to the importance of\ntraining medical datasets, which in most cases are difficult and expensive to\nobtain. Furthermore, in most cases, algorithms require data from the same\ndomain and a powerful computer with efficient storage capacity. To overcome\nthis issue, a new type of learning known as transfer learning (TL) has been\nproposed that can produce impressive results based on other different\npre-trained data. This paper presents, to the best of the authors' knowledge,\nthe first comprehensive survey of DL-based TL frameworks for kidney cancer\ndiagnosis. This is a strong contribution to help researchers understand the\ncurrent challenges and perspectives of this topic. Hence, the main limitations\nand advantages of each framework are identified and detailed critical analyses\nare provided. Looking ahead, the article identifies promising directions for\nfuture research. Moving on, the discussion is concluded by reflecting on the\npivotal role of TL in the development of precision medicine and its effects on\nclinical practice and research in oncology.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jivb_BwhE4sDM3XIV42KqUvS8MPE699yE54lcRQWbfo","pdfSize":"11024042"}
