Early galaxy ``proto-clusters'' are believed\nto be important physical drivers of the overall cosmic star-formation rate\ndensity and serve as ``hotspots'' for the reionization of the intergalactic\nmedium. Our understanding of the formation of these structures at the earliest\ncosmic epochs is, however, limited to sparse observations of their galaxy\nmembers, or based on phenomenological models and cosmological simulations. Here\nwe report the detection of a massive neutral, atomic hydrogen (HI) gas\nreservoir permeating a galaxy proto-cluster at redshift $z=5.4$, observed one\nbillion years after the Big Bang. The presence of this cold gas is revealed by\nstrong damped Lyman-$\\alpha$ absorption features observed in several background\ngalaxy spectra taken with JWST/NIRSpec in close on-sky projection. While\noverall the sightlines probe a large range in HI column densities, $N_{\\rm HI}\n= 10^{21.7}-10^{23.5}$ cm$^{-2}$, they are similar across nearby sightlines,\ndemonstrating that they probe the same dense, neutral gas. This observation of\na massive, large-scale overdensity of cold neutral gas challenges current\nlarge-scale cosmological simulations and has strong implications for the\nreionization topology of the Universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yXYJ80uQ09XmwT1WbeORx9parkA9VdFkAyweIZYXq3U","pdfSize":"20614557"}
