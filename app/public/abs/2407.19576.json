We develop a multiplexed quantum sensing approach with\nscanning probes containing two nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers at the tip apex. A\nshared optical channel is used for simultaneous qubit initialization and\nreadout, while phase- and frequency-dependent microwave spin manipulations are\nleveraged for de-multiplexing the optical readout signal. Scanning dual-NV\nmagnetometry is first demonstrated by simultaneously imaging multiple field\nprojections of a ferrimagnetic racetrack device. Then, we record the two-point\ncovariance of spatially correlated field fluctuations across a current-carrying\nwire. Our multiplex framework establishes a method to investigate a variety of\nspatio-temporal correlations, including phase transitions and electronic noise,\nwith nanoscale resolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
