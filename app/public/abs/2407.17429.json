In this paper, we analyze student interactions with Jill\nacross multiple courses and colleges, focusing on the types and complexity of\nstudent questions based on Bloom's Revised Taxonomy and tool usage patterns. We\nfind that, by supporting a wide range of cognitive demands, Jill encourages\nstudents to engage in sophisticated, higher-order cognitive questions. However,\nthe frequency of usage varies significantly across deployments, and the types\nof questions asked depend on course-specific contexts. These findings pave the\nway for future work on AI-driven educational tools tailored to individual\nlearning styles and course structure, potentially enhancing both the teaching\nand learning experience in classrooms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
