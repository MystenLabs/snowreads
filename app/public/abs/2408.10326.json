We state the continuity\nof the solution $u_\\alpha$ in terms of $\\alpha$ for $\\alpha\\in (0,1)$ with\nrespect to the convergence in law in the topology of continuous functions with\nuniform metric on compact sets. We also prove that the probability measure\ninduced by $u_\\alpha$ converges weakly to the one induced by the solution in\nthe space-time white noise case as $\\alpha$ goes to $1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
