It is regarded\nas an important property to characterize the log-aesthetic curves which have\nbeen studied as reference curves or guidelines for designing aesthetic shapes\nin CAD systems. We reformulate the two different self-affinities proposed in\nthe development of log-aesthetic curves. We give rigorous proof that one\nself-affinity actually characterizes log-aesthetic curves, while another one\ncharacterizes parabolas. We then propose a new self-affinity which, in\nequiaffine geometry, characterizes the constant curvature curves (the quadratic\ncurves). It integrates the two self-affinities, by which constant curvature\ncurves in similarity and equiaffine geometries are characterized in a unified\nmanner.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
