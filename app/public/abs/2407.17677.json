That presentation built on several earlier\npublications that developed a research method for assessing the number of women\ncomputer scientists that [a] are chronologically prior to the availability of\nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on women in the IT workforce; and [b]\npermit focused investigation of varied sub-fields within computing. This\npresent report expands on these earlier articles, and their evolving research\nmethod, connecting them to the ACM SIG Heritage presentation. It also outlines\nsome of the choices and considerations made in developing and refining \"mixed\nmethods\" research (using both quantitative and qualitative approaches) as well\nas extensions of the research being currently explored.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
