We show that for the cyclic quiver of length $K$, this algebra is the\nuniversal enveloping algebra of the positive half of a certain extension of\nmatrix differential operators on $\\mathbb{C}^{*}$, while its deformation gives\na positive half of an explicit integral form of Guay's Affine Yangian\n$\\ddot{\\mathcal{Y}}_{\\hbar_1,\\hbar_2}(\\mathfrak{gl}(K))$. By the main theorem\nof Botta-Davison (2023) and Schiffmann-Vasserot (2023), this also determines\nthe positive half of the Maulik-Okounkov Yangian for the case of cyclic\nquivers. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the strong rationality\nconjecture, calculate the spherical subalgebra of the non-deformed CoHA for any\nquiver without loops, recover results about the CoHA of compactly supported\nsemistable sheaves on the minimal resolution of the Kleinian singularity\n$\\mathbb{C}^2/\\mathbb{Z}_{K}$ and identify a commutative algebra inside the\nadditive shuffle algebra associated to the cyclic quiver. We end by\nconjecturally relating the obtained integral form with the algebra defined by\nGaiotto-Rap\\v{c}\\'ak-Zhou, in the context of twisted M-theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fYarzpsezXBNhNzOpNarR1o_8rdajdx2DB3rjMarvfA","pdfSize":"844094"}
