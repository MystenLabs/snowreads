This paper addresses the challenge of\nmodeling relationships between non-Euclidean responses and multivariate\nEuclidean predictors. We propose a flexible regression model capable of\nhandling high-dimensional predictors without imposing parametric assumptions.\nTwo primary challenges are addressed: the curse of dimensionality in\nnonparametric regression and the absence of linear structure in general metric\nspaces. The former is tackled using deep neural networks, while for the latter\nwe demonstrate the feasibility of mapping the metric space where responses\nreside to a low-dimensional Euclidean space using manifold learning. We\nintroduce a reverse mapping approach, employing local Fr\\'echet regression, to\nmap the low-dimensional manifold representations back to objects in the\noriginal metric space. We develop a theoretical framework, investigating the\nconvergence rate of deep neural networks under dependent sub-Gaussian noise\nwith bias. The convergence rate of the proposed regression model is then\nobtained by expanding the scope of local Fr\\'echet regression to accommodate\nmultivariate predictors in the presence of errors in predictors. Simulations\nand case studies show that the proposed model outperforms existing methods for\nnon-Euclidean responses, focusing on the special cases of probability measures\nand networks.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
