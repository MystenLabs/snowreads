This work explores the relationship between haptic feedback\nfrom real objects and their visual representations in VR. The study examines\nhow users confirm and adjust the sizes of different virtual objects. The\nresults show that as the size of the virtual cubes increases, users are less\nlikely to perceive the size correctly and need more adjustments. This research\nprovides insights into how haptic sensations and visual inputs interact,\ncontributing to the understanding of visual-haptic illusions in VR\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
