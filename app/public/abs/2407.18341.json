The Win Ratio method (WR) proposed by Pocock et\nal. (2012) [1] employs a hierarchical structure to combine fatal and non-fatal\nevents by giving death information an absolute priority, which adversely\naffects power if the treatment effect is mainly on the non-fatal outcomes. We\nhereby propose the Shrinking Coarsened Win Ratio method (SCWR) that releases\nthe strict hierarchical structure of the standard WR by adding stages with\ncoarsened thresholds shrinking to zero. A weighted adaptive approach is\ndeveloped to determine the thresholds in SCWR. This method preserves the good\nstatistical properties of the standard WR and has a greater capacity to detect\ntreatment effects on non-fatal events. We show that SCWR has an overall more\nfavorable performance than WR in our simulation that addresses the influence of\nfollow-up time, the association between events, and the treatment effect\nlevels, as well as a case study based on the Digitalis Investigation Group\nclinical trial data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
