The web design process is\ncomplex and often time-consuming, especially for those with limited expertise.\nIn this paper, we introduce Web Rendering Parameters Generation (WebRPG), a new\ntask that aims at automating the generation for visual presentation of web\npages based on their HTML code. WebRPG would contribute to a faster web\ndevelopment workflow. Since there is no existing benchmark available, we\ndevelop a new dataset for WebRPG through an automated pipeline. Moreover, we\npresent baseline models, utilizing VAE to manage numerous elements and\nrendering parameters, along with custom HTML embedding for capturing essential\nsemantic and hierarchical information from HTML. Extensive experiments,\nincluding customized quantitative evaluations for this specific task, are\nconducted to evaluate the quality of the generated results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
