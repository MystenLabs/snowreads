We show that\nthis same interpretation arises from a simple postulate of self-consistence of\ncomposites for these scalars. The model looks only for colour and electric\ncharge, and it pays the cost of an additional chiral $+4/3$ quark per\ngeneration.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
