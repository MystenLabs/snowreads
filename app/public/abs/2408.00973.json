One\nis prediction accuracy,and the other is interpretability. Over the recent\ndecades, many prediction models of high performance, such as ensemble-based\nmodels and deep neural networks, have been developed. However, these models are\noften too complex, making it difficult to intuitively interpret their\npredictions. This complexity in interpretation limits their use in many\nreal-world fields that require accountability, such as medicine, finance, and\ncollege admissions. In this study, we develop a novel method called Meta-ANOVA\nto provide an interpretable model for any given prediction model. The basic\nidea of Meta-ANOVA is to transform a given black-box prediction model to the\nfunctional ANOVA model. A novel technical contribution of Meta-ANOVA is a\nprocedure of screening out unnecessary interaction before transforming a given\nblack-box model to the functional ANOVA model. This screening procedure allows\nthe inclusion of higher order interactions in the transformed functional ANOVA\nmodel without computational difficulties. We prove that the screening procedure\nis asymptotically consistent. Through various experiments with synthetic and\nreal-world datasets, we empirically demonstrate the superiority of Meta-ANOVA\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
