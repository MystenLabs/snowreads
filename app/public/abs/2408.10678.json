Moreover, in the event of a gravitational-wave detection,\npredicting the presence of a neutron star remnant is crucial in order to advise\npotential electromagnetic follow-up campaigns. In this work, we use Gradient\nBoosted Decision Trees and publicly available data from numerical-relativity\nsimulations to construct a classifier that predicts the outcome of binary\nneutron star mergers, based on the binary's parameters inferred from\ngravitational-wave inspiral signals: total mass, mass-weighted tidal\ndeformability, mass ratio, and effective inspiral spin. Employing parameters\nthat can be estimated from the inspiral part of the signal only allows us to\npredict the remnant independently on the detection of a postmerger\ngravitational-wave signal. We build three different classifiers to distinguish\nbetween various potential scenarios, we estimate their accuracy and the\nconfidence of their predictions. Finally, we apply the developed classifiers to\nreal events data, finding that GW170817 most likely lead to the formation of a\nhypermassive neutron star, while GW190425 to a prompt collapse to a black hole.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
