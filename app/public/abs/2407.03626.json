For this purpose, we focus on the\n$f(R,T,L_m)= R+ \\alpha TL_m$ model, where $\\alpha$ is a free parameter. We\nderive the modified TOV equations and the relativistic moment of inertia in the\nslowly rotating approximation. Using an equation of state (EoS) for\ncolor-superconducting quark stars, we examine the effects of the $\\alpha TL_m$\nterm on the different macroscopic properties of these stars. Our results reveal\nthat the decrease of the parameter $\\alpha$ leads to a noticeable increase in\nthe maximum-mass values. For negative $\\alpha$ with sufficiently small\n$\\vert\\alpha\\vert$, we obtain a qualitative behavior similar to the general\nrelativistic (GR) context, namely, it is possible to obtain a critical stellar\nconfiguration such that the mass reaches its maximum. However, for sufficiently\nlarge values of $\\vert\\alpha\\vert$ keeping negative $\\alpha$, the critical\npoint cannot be found on the mass-radius diagram. We also find that the\ninclusion of anisotropic pressure can provide masses and radii quite consistent\nwith the current observational measurements, which opens an outstanding window\nonto the physics of anisotropic quark stars. By comparing the $I-C$ relations\nof isotropic quark stars in modified gravity, we show that such a correlation\nremains almost unchanged as the parameter $\\alpha$ varies from GR counterpart.\nOn the other hand, given a fixed $\\alpha$, the $I-C$ relation is insensitive to\nvariations of the anisotropy parameter $\\beta$ to $\\mathcal{O}(4\\%)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
