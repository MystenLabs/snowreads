Our focus is on theories with an approximate and spontaneously broken\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry where quasi-stable domain walls can form at early\ntimes. This seemingly simple framework bears a wealth of phenomenological\nimplications that can be tackled by means of different cosmological and\nastrophysical probes. We elucidate the connection between domain wall dynamics\nand the production of dark matter and gravitational waves. In particular, we\nidentify three main benchmark scenarios. The gravitational wave signal observed\nby pulsar timing arrays can be generated by the domain walls if the mass of the\nsinglet is $m_s \\sim\\,$PeV. For lower masses, but with $m_s \\gtrsim 10\\,$GeV,\nscalars produced in the annihilation of the domain walls can be dark matter\nwith a distinctive feature in their power spectrum. Finally, the thermal bath\nprovides an unavoidable source of unstable scalars via the freeze-in mechanism\nwhose subsequent decays can be tested by their imprints on cosmological and\nterrestrial observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
