The data reveal\nspatially resolved outflows in the inner 2 kpc, seen in low ionization (traced\nby the [Ar ii] 6.99um emission) and in warm molecular gas (traced by the H2\nrotational transitions). We find a maximum mass-outflow rate of 4.90 (2.04)\nM/yr at ~900 pc from the nucleus for the warm outflow (198 K< T< 1000 K) and\nestimate and outflow rate of up to 1.22 (0.51) M/yr for the hotter gas phase (T\n> 1000 K). These outflows can clear the entire nuclear reservoir of warm\nmolecular gas in about 1 Myr. The derived kinetic power of the molecular\noutflows lead to coupling efficiencies of 2-5 percent of the AGN luminosity,\nway above the minimum expected to the AGN feedback be effective quenching the\nstar formation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
