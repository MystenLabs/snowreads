In this demo, we explore the potential of Virtual Reality (VR) to\nsensitize non-disabled people to barriers in the built environment. We\ncontribute a VR simulation of a major traffic hub in Karlsruhe, Germany, and we\nemploy visual embellishments and animations to showcase barriers and potential\nremoval strategies. Through our work, we seek to engage users in conversation\non what kind of environment is accessible to whom, and what equitable\nparticipation in society requires. Additionally, we aim to expand the\nunderstanding of how VR technology can promote reflection through interactive\nexploration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lflz8oV3b1wxroR5WIqQZ4EDDVywFtSs0ssrY7b4l40","pdfSize":"26781756","txDigest":"2wp1ZccPDWN5nQBufDueSSyjUMNFQicinjfSTdDYBuNw","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
