However, examples of electrically\nlarge radiators readily demonstrate that this Q limit is incorrect. Spherical\nmode radiation is reexamined and an equivalent 1D transmission line model is\nderived that exactly models the fields. This model leads to a precise cutoff\nfrequency of the spherical waveguide, which provides a clear boundary between\npropagating and evanescent fields. A new delineation of 'stored' and 'radiated'\nelectromagnetic energy is postulated, which leads to a new definition of\nspherical mode Q. Next, attention is turned to the Harrington bound on the\ndirectivity-bandwidth tradeoff of an antenna with an arbitrary size. Harrington\nderived the maximum directivity for a specified number of spherical harmonics\nsuch that the Q is not 'large'. Here, the method of Lagrange multipliers is\nused to quantify the maximum directivity for a given bandwidth. It is shown\nthat optimally exciting all spherical harmonics (including n>ka) enables both\nlarger directivity and bandwidth than Harrington's previous limit. While Chu\nand Harrington's analyses are generally good approximations for most\nsituations, the new self-consistent theory that defines fundamental antenna\nlimits leads to updated results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1wDAHy6kRjNtFJVG5svPz6KmWHr4025o1T_d8TLdywQ","pdfSize":"1922730"}
