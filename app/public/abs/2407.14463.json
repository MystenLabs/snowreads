However, their\n\"black-box\" nature hinders interpretability, which is crucial in real-world\napplications. In contrast, \"white-box\" tree-based survival models offer better\ninterpretability but struggle to converge to global optima due to greedy\nexpansion. In this paper, we bridge the gap between previous deep survival\nmodels and traditional tree-based survival models through deep rectified linear\nunit (ReLU) networks. We show that a deliberately constructed deep ReLU network\n(SurvReLU) can harness the interpretability of tree-based structures with the\nrepresentational power of deep survival models. Empirical studies on both\nsimulated and real survival benchmark datasets show the effectiveness of the\nproposed SurvReLU in terms of performance and interoperability.
