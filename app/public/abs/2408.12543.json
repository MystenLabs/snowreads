This generalizes a\nformula by the first and third authors for the Delta Conjecture at $t=0$, and\nfollows from work of Blasiak, Haiman, Morse, Pun, and Seelinger.\n  Our main result is that we also provide a purely combinatorial proof of this\nskewing identity, giving a new proof of the Rise Delta Theorem from the\nRational Shuffle Theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
