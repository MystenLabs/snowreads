Given N tasks, we propose to simultaneously identify\nthe best task groups from 2^N candidates and train the model weights\nsimultaneously in one-shot, with the high-order task-affinity fully exploited.\nThis is distinct from the pioneering methods which sequentially identify the\ngroups and train the model weights, where the group identification often relies\non heuristics. As a result, our method not only improves the training\nefficiency, but also mitigates the objective bias introduced by the sequential\nprocedures that potentially lead to a suboptimal solution. Specifically, we\nformulate MTG as a fully differentiable pruning problem on an adaptive network\narchitecture determined by an underlying Categorical distribution. To\ncategorize N tasks into K groups (represented by K encoder branches), we\ninitially set up KN task heads, where each branch connects to all N task heads\nto exploit the high-order task-affinity. Then, we gradually prune the KN heads\ndown to N by learning a relaxed differentiable Categorical distribution,\nensuring that each task is exclusively and uniquely categorized into only one\nbranch. Extensive experiments on CelebA and Taskonomy datasets with detailed\nablations show the promising performance and efficiency of our method.
