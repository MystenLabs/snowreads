The experimental results were compared with calculations using the\nIAM-SCAR+I model. Satisfactory agreements between both data sets were found for\nelectron energies above 200 eV within experimental uncertainties, whereas\nsignificant deviations of up to 100% were observed at electron energies below\n60 eV. In addition to the measurements of differential elastic scattering cross\nsections, total inelastic scattering cross sections of $\\mathrm{(CCl_3F)}$ were\ncalculated using the spherical complex optical potential (SCOP) model. These\ncalculations closely match experimental total ionization cross sections\navailable in the literature for energies below 50 eV. The sum of the\nexperimental total elastic and the theoretical total inelastic scattering cross\nsections aligns very well with the total electron scattering cross sections of\n$\\mathrm{(CCl_3F)}$ measured by other groups across the entire energy range (30\neV to 800 eV), demonstrating the consistency among these three cross sections.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
