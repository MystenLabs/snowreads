LiteEFG enables the user to\nexpress computation graphs in Python to define updates on the game tree\nstructure. The graph is then executed by the C++ backend, leading to\nsignificant speedups compared to running the algorithm in Python. Moreover, in\nLiteEFG, the user needs to only specify the computation graph of the update\nrule in a decision node of the game, and LiteEFG will automatically distribute\nthe update rule to each decision node and handle the structure of the\nimperfect-information game.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cSVKkhS5aW7OhFX7oZAXN7Xx83i5OJp5tYrcuMRegt0","pdfSize":"628001","objectId":"0x8b62f73d86b91d5a8b22c297e51d3668d9f6d2d5748b7e8ee1b51490900f4c87","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
