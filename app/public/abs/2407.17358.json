The calibration of black box AI\nmodels is carried out via the optimization of hyperparameters dictating\narchitecture, optimization, and/or inference configuration. Prior work has\nintroduced learn-then-test (LTT), a calibration procedure for hyperparameter\noptimization (HPO) that provides statistical guarantees on average performance\nmeasures. Recognizing the importance of controlling risk-aware objectives in\nengineering contexts, this work introduces a variant of LTT that is designed to\nprovide statistical guarantees on quantiles of a risk measure. We illustrate\nthe practical advantages of this approach by applying the proposed algorithm to\na radio access scheduling problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6-WKNog6vQG0JAHG0sAQEen7on7DVnbeiPrb7TenKe0","pdfSize":"340797"}
