However, many AI-driven album\ncover services require subscriptions or technical expertise, limiting\naccessibility. To address these challenges, we developed Music2P, an\nopen-source, multi-modal AI-driven tool that streamlines album cover creation,\nmaking it efficient, accessible, and cost-effective through Ngrok. Music2P\nautomates the design process using techniques such as Bootstrapping Language\nImage Pre-training (BLIP), music-to-text conversion (LP-music-caps), image\nsegmentation (LoRA), and album cover and QR code generation (ControlNet). This\npaper demonstrates the Music2P interface, details our application of these\ntechnologies, and outlines future improvements. Our ultimate goal is to provide\na tool that empowers musicians and producers, especially those with limited\nresources or expertise, to create compelling album covers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
