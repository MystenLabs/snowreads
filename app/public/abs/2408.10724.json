A critical concern at\npresent involves the identification of machine-generated news. In this work, we\ntake a significant step by introducing a benchmark dataset designed for neural\nnews detection in four languages: English, Turkish, Hungarian, and Persian. The\ndataset incorporates outputs from multiple multilingual generators (in both,\nzero-shot and fine-tuned setups) such as BloomZ, LLaMa-2, Mistral, Mixtral, and\nGPT-4. Next, we experiment with a variety of classifiers, ranging from those\nbased on linguistic features to advanced Transformer-based models and LLMs\nprompting. We present the detection results aiming to delve into the\ninterpretablity and robustness of machine-generated texts detectors across all\ntarget languages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vGbIGoG4G6r_OcNuowpO9b_SnubS3jN6jAXTKaTMHrA","pdfSize":"3019271"}
