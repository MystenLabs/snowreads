The low-resolution prism spectrum displays high equivalent\nwidth nebular emission, with remarkably high ratios of low-ionisation species\nof oxygen, nitrogen and sulphur, relative to hydrogen; auroral O$^+$ emission\nis clearly detected, possibly also C$^+$. From the high-resolution grating\nspectrum, we measure a gas velocity dispersion $\\sigma$~400 km s$^{-1}$, broad\nenough to rule out star-forming gas in equilibrium in the gravitational\npotential of the galaxy. Emission-line ratio diagnostics suggest that the\nnebular emission is due to a shock which ran out of pre-shock gas. To infer the\nphysical properties of the system, we model simultaneously the galaxy spectral\nenergy distribution (SED) and shock-driven line emission under a Bayesian\nframework. We find a relatively low-mass, star-forming system (M* =\n1.4$\\times$10^{10} M$_\\odot$, SFR = 70 M$_\\odot$ yr$^{-1}$), where shock-driven\nemission contributes 50 per cent to the total H$\\beta$ luminosity. The nebular\nmetallicity is near solar - three times higher than that predicted by the\nmass-metallicity relation at z=4.6, possibly related to fast-paced chemical\nevolution near the galaxy nucleus. We find no evidence for a recent decline in\nthe SFR of the galaxy, meaning that, already at this early epoch, fast\nradio-mode AGN feedback was poorly coupled with the bulk of the star-forming\ngas; therefore, most of the feedback energy must end up in the galaxy halo,\nsetting the stage for future quenching.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ch9Yr7XpIomo5YIErI4QtYipzpwZn2D_1EPRClwkhXM","pdfSize":"3101084"}
