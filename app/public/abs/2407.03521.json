The MPMG serves as a theoretical model and\nreasonable approximation of real-world first-price sealed-bid public auctions\nthat follow the minimum price rule. The goal is to provide researchers and\npractitioners with a framework to study market fairness and regulation in both\ndigitized and non-digitized public procurement processes, amidst growing\nconcerns about algorithmic collusion in online markets. We demonstrate, using\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning-driven artificial agents, that algorithmic\ntacit coordination is difficult to achieve in the MPMG when cooperation is not\nexplicitly engineered. Paradoxically, our results highlight the robustness of\nthe minimum price rule in an auction environment, but also show that it is not\nimpervious to full-scale algorithmic collusion. These findings contribute to\nthe ongoing debates about algorithmic pricing and its implications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
