We find an erosion of the magic number $N=50$ toward\n$^{70}$Ca manifesting itself by an onset of deformation and increased\ncomplexity in the ground states. For $^{78}$Ni, we predict a low-lying\nrotational band consistent with recent data, which up until now has been a\nchallenge for ab initio nuclear models. Ground states are deformed in\n$^{76}$Fe, $^{74}$Cr, and $^{72}$Ti, although the spherical states are too\nclose in energy to unambiguously identify the shape of the ground state within\nthe uncertainty estimates. In $^{70}$Ca, the potential energy landscape from\nquadrupole-constrained Hartree-Fock computations flattens, and the deformation\nbecomes less rigid. We also compute the low-lying spectra and $B({\\rm E2})$\nvalues for these neutron-rich $N=50$ nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tcB0Dd2tlSPJy5hoIgOSeYUxNZG0NgDB8iDYBb_sfgk","pdfSize":"1450136"}
