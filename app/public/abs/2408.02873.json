Kepler-21 b is a radius valley\nplanet ($R = 1.6\\pm 0.2 R_{\\oplus}$) with an Earth-like composition\n(8.38$\\pm$1.62 g/cc), though its mass and radius fall in the regime of possible\n\"water worlds.\" We utilize new Keck/HIRES and WIYN/NEID radial velocity (RV)\ndata in conjunction with Kepler and TESS photometry to perform a detailed study\nof activity mitigation between photometry and RVs. We additionally refine the\nsystem parameters, and we utilize Gaia astrometry to place constraints on a\nlong-term RV trend. Our activity analysis affirms the quality of Kepler\nphotometry for removing correlated noise from RVs, despite its temporal\ndistance, though we reveal some cases where TESS may be superior. Using refined\norbital parameters and updated composition curves, we rule out a ``water world\"\nscenario for Kepler-21 b, and we identify a long period super-Jupiter planetary\ncandidate, Kepler-21 (c).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2gOZS7hCDuYexXnhG9JjxLGkSDCoLOgPioFlwhPeJ4M","pdfSize":"3244390"}
