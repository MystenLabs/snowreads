This well-known\neffect is scrutinized here in the presence of final-state rescattering. The\ngoal is achieved first by utilizing general arguments provided by Landau\nequations, and second by applying a modern scattering formalism with explicit\ntwo- and three-body unitarity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
