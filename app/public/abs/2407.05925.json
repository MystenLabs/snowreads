We worked with the\ndomain experts of SAP SE to develop an HR support chatbot as an efficient and\neffective tool for addressing employee inquiries. We inserted a\nhuman-in-the-loop in various parts of the development cycles such as dataset\ncollection, prompt optimization, and evaluation of generated output. By\nenhancing the LLM-driven chatbot's response quality and exploring alternative\nretrieval methods, we have created an efficient, scalable, and flexible tool\nfor HR professionals to address employee inquiries effectively. Our experiments\nand evaluation conclude that GPT-4 outperforms other models and can overcome\ninconsistencies in data through internal reasoning capabilities. Additionally,\nthrough expert analysis, we infer that reference-free evaluation metrics such\nas G-Eval and Prometheus demonstrate reliability closely aligned with that of\nhuman evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
