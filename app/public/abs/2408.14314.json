Let the ANN be composed of a ReLU layer and\nseveral linear layers (convolution, sum-pooling, or fully connected). We assume\nthe network was trained with high accuracy. Despite numerous suggested\napproaches, interpreting an artificial neural network remains challenging for\nhumans. For a new method of interpretation, we construct a bridge between a\nsimple ANN and logic. As a result, we can analyze and manipulate the semantics\nof an ANN using the powerful tool set of logic. To achieve this, we decompose\nthe input space of the ANN into several network partition cells. Each network\npartition cell represents a linear combination that maps input values to a\nclassifying output value. For interpreting the linear map of a partition cell\nusing logic expressions, we suggest minterm values as the input of a simple\nANN. We derive logic expressions representing interaction patterns for\nseparating objects classified as 1 from those classified as 0. To facilitate an\ninterpretation of logic expressions, we present them as binary logic trees.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
