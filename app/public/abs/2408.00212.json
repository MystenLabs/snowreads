We present a method for removing the\nill-conditionality, which was previously considered a significant challenge,\nand provide a mathematical analysis in the context of disk regions. Moreover,\nwe extend the proposed method to the general Jordan region using conformal\nmapping, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed method through numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gKDZBamedtL7osUdRM1X6kivQduHfoD4wklEKWSG4Uk","pdfSize":"609873","txDigest":"6xD4PT35kWKsAC1FuWFhAA5VUE3dkKswTxudqLbkejD3","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
