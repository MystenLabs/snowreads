This mechanism is ideally suited\nfor realizing warm inflation since it can lead to large thermal friction while\npreserving the flatness of the potential. We show, however, that requiring\nstandard properties of an axion $-$ in particular a discrete shift symmetry and\na potential generated non-perturbatively by instanton effects $-$ excludes the\nstrong regime of warm slow-roll inflation, in which thermal friction dominates.\nThe derivation of this result does not require any phenomenological input.\nWhile non-minimal (axion-like) models provide a way out, sphaleron heating with\na standard axion is capable of enabling the weak regime of warm inflation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
