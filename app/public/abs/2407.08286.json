This paper presents a\ncontrol architecture developed for a robotic system designed for MIS\noperations. The modular structure of the control system allows for\ncompatibility with a range of procedures in abdominal and thoracic regions. The\nproposed control system, employing the master-slave concept, is presented\nalongside the experimental model. Functional validation is obtained by\nperforming a Siemens NX simulation and comparing the results with several\nexperimental runs using the experimental model of the robot. With its compact\nsize and stiffness, the system holds promise for integration with other robotic\nsystems. Future efforts will be dedicated to exploring and optimizing this\npotential collaboration to enhance the overall capabilities of robotic-assisted\nsurgery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
