We model the degrees of freedom of the\nelectrons in both plates using the 1+2 dimensional Dirac field and select a\nnonlocal potential to describe the interaction between the two plates. The\ninternal relative motion is introduced via a Galilean boost, assuming one plate\nslides relative to the other. We then calculate the effective action of the\nsystem and derive the vacuum occupation number in momentum space using a\nperturbative method. The numerical plots show that, as a function of momentum\nthe vacuum occupation number is isotropic for a motion speed v = 0 and\nanisotropic for nonzero v. Due to energy transfer between the plates, the\nprocess of relative motion induces on-shell excitations, similar to the\ndissipative process of the Schwinger effect. Therefore, we can study the\nmotion-induced dissipation effects and the dissipative forces via quantum\naction. The numerical results demonstrate that both the imaginary part of the\nquantum action for the motion boost and the dissipative force have a threshold\nas a function of v, and both are positively correlated with v.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
