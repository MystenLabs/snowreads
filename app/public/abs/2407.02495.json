Computers\nwill become conscious, have a theory of mind, think and reason, will become\nmore intelligent than humans, and so on. But the claims are science fiction,\nnot science. This article reviews evidence for the following three propositions\nusing extensive body of scientific research and related sources from the\ncognitive and neurosciences, evolutionary evidence, linguistics, data science,\ncomparative psychology, self-driving cars, robotics. and the learning sciences.\n(1) Do computing machines think or reason? (2) Are computing machines sentient\nor conscious? (3) Do computing machines have a theory of mind?\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
