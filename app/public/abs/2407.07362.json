After 24 years, XTE J2012+381 again\nunderwent an outburst in December 2022. In this work, we focused on the\nmeasurement of spin and mass of black hole candidate XTE J2012+381 using\nbroadband spectral analysis of X-ray data from \\emph{Swift/XRT} and\n\\emph{NuSTAR}. By using the relxillCp model, the spin and inclination of the\nsource were found to be $0.883_{-0.061}^{+0.033}$ and $46.2_{-2.0}^{+3.7}$\ndegrees, respectively for high disk density\n($i.e.\\;10^{20}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-3}$). We further test our results for lamp post\ngeometry using the relxilllpCp model. The spin and inclination of the source\nwere found to be $0.892_{-0.044}^{+0.020}$ and $43.1_{-1.2}^{+1.4}$ degrees,\nrespectively. Then \"continuum-fitting\" method was used for the soft state to\nestimate the mass of BH and found to be\n$7.95_{-3.25}^{+7.65}\\;\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ and\n$7.48_{-2.75}^{+5.80}\\;\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$ for the spin and inclination\nestimated from the relxillCp and relxilllpCp model respectively. We used a\ndistance of 5.4 kpc as measured by Gaia using the parallax method. This study\nalso addresses the issue of supersolar iron abundance in XTE J2012+381 by using\n\\texttt{reflionx} based reflection model and found high disk density for the\nsource.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
