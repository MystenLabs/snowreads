Ultracold atomic gases in optical\nlattices provide a wonderful platform to simulate orbital physics. In this\nwork, we consider spinless fermionic atoms loaded into $p$-orbital bands of a\ntwo-dimensional frustrated triangular lattice. The system can be described by\nan extended Fermi-Hubbard model, which is numerically solved by using the\norbital version of real-space dynamical mean-field theory. Low-temperature\nphase diagrams are obtained, which contain stripe-, ferro- and para-orbital\nordered quantum phases, due to the interplay of anisotropic hoppings and\ngeometrical frustration. In order to understand the underlying mechanics of\ncompeting orbital orders, we derive an effective orbital-exchange model, which\nyields consistent explanation with our main numerical results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
