Here we propose such a model in the\nframework of a global radial collapse of molecular clouds, where the collapse\nvelocity depends on the density profile and the initial mass-to-radius ratio of\nmolecular clouds, with the collapse velocity accelerating during the collapse\nprocess. This simplified analytical model allows us to estimate a lifetime of\ngiant molecular clouds of approximately $0.44-7.36 \\times 10^7\\, \\rm{yr}$, and\na star formation timescale of approximately $0.5-5.88 \\times 10^6\\, \\rm{yr}$.\nAdditionally, we can predict an SFE of approximately $1.59\\, \\%$, and an SFR of\nroughly $1.85\\, \\rm{M_{\\odot} \\, yr^{-1}}$ for the Milky Way in agreement with\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
