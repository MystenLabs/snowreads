Due to this special constraint\non Lax operator, it is showed that the generating functions $f$ and $g$ of the\ncorresponding Darboux transformations, can only be chosen from (adjoint) wave\nfunctions or $(L^k)_{<m}=\\sum_{i=1}^lq_i\\Delta^{-1}\\Lambda^mr_i$. Then\nsuccessive applications of Darboux transformations for gcdKP hierarchy are\ndiscussed. Finally based upon above, solutions of gcdKP hierarchy are obtained\nfrom $L^{\\{0\\}}=\\Lambda$ by Darboux transformations.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
