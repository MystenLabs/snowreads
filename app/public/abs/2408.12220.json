In this problem, $l$ robots placed arbitrarily on\nnodes of a network having $n$ nodes are asked to relocate themselves\nautonomously so that each node contains at most $\\lfloor \\frac{l}{n}\\rfloor$\nrobots. When $l\\le n$, then each node of the network contains at most one\nrobot. Recently, in NETYS'23, Kaur et al. introduced a variant of dispersion\ncalled \\emph{Distance-2-Dispersion}. In this problem, $l$ robots have to solve\ndispersion with an extra condition that no two adjacent nodes contain robots.\n  In this work, we generalize the problem of Dispersion and\nDistance-2-Dispersion by introducing another variant called\n\\emph{Distance-$k$-Dispersion (D-$k$-D)}. In this problem, the robots have to\ndisperse on a network in such a way that shortest distance between any two pair\nof robots is at least $k$ and there exist at least one pair of robots for which\nthe shortest distance is exactly $k$. Note that, when $k=1$ we have normal\ndispersion and when $k=2$ we have D-$2$-D. Here, we studied this variant for a\ndynamic ring (1-interval connected ring) for rooted initial configuration. We\nhave proved the necessity of fully synchronous scheduler to solve this problem\nand provided an algorithm that solves D-$k$-D in $\\Theta(n)$ rounds under a\nfully synchronous scheduler. So, the presented algorithm is time optimal too.\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that considers this\nspecific variant.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
