To address this, we propose\nVulCatch, a binary-level vulnerability detection framework. VulCatch introduces\na Synergy Decompilation Module (SDM) and Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) to\ntransform raw binary code into pseudocode using CodeT5, preserving high-level\nsemantics for deep analysis with tools like Ghidra and IDA. KAN further\nenhances feature transformation, enabling the detection of complex\nvulnerabilities. VulCatch employs word2vec, Inception Blocks, BiLSTM Attention,\nand Residual connections to achieve high detection accuracy (98.88%) and\nprecision (97.92%), while minimizing false positives (1.56%) and false\nnegatives (2.71%) across seven CVE datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
