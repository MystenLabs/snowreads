Existing approaches fall short in reconciling\ndeterministic and randomized compilation, lack appropriate intermediate\nrepresentations, and struggle to guarantee correctness. Addressing these\nchallenges, we present MarQSim, a novel compilation framework. MarQSim\nleverages a Markov chain-based approach, encapsulated in the Hamiltonian Term\nTransition Graph, adeptly reconciling deterministic and randomized compilation\nbenefits. We rigorously prove its algorithmic efficiency and correctness\ncriteria. Furthermore, we formulate a Min-Cost Flow model that can tune\ntransition matrices to enforce correctness while accommodating various\noptimization objectives. Experimental results demonstrate MarQSim's superiority\nin generating more efficient quantum circuits for simulating various quantum\nHamiltonians while maintaining precision.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
