The\ncontrol is localized with respect to space, age and size; an estimate of the\ntime required to bring the system to zero is provided. We demonstrate the null\ncontrollability of the model using a technique that avoids the explicit use of\nparabolic Carleman estimates. Instead, this method combines the observability\nestimates of the final state with the use of characteristics and estimates of\nthe associated semigroup. Furthermore, we extend this work by highlighting the\ndifference in controllability time for two models with different birth kernels.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EV6k7VRRGdhUvAltt8uUYseufRAUDWIPnJI-Jl3kq44","pdfSize":"1265479"}
