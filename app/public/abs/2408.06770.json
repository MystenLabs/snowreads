Let $T\\Box P_n$ be the Cartesian product of a\ntree $T$ and a path on $n$ vertices. Kao and Weng proved that $T\\Box P_n$ is\nhamiltonian if $T$ has a path factor, $n$ is an even integer and $n\\geq 4\\Delta\n(T)-2$. They conjectured that for every $\\Delta \\geq 3$ there exists a graph\n$G$ of maximum degree $\\Delta$ which has a path factor, such that for every\neven $n< 4\\Delta-2$ the product $G\\Box P_n$ is not hamiltonian. In this article\nwe prove this conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fFEgWr6k571kRY1hdd0JQ3Pai0gHA8I_rvZtkjzhwHE","pdfSize":"130641"}
