A follow-up observational analysis was undertaken\ngiven that these two properties are hard to reconcile as originating in the\nsame stellar object. As a result, IRC-10412 has been classified as a new\nsemiregular variable of SRb type in the asymptotic giant branch, and different\nbut consistent estimates of its mass-loss parameter are reported. We propose\nthat its unusually high radio emission arises from a ~ 1E-5 Msun/yr stellar\nwind exposed to an external source of ionizing photons, possibly coming from\nnearby OB associations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ibzkvZ-Jaws9XcHzedM5rZ2CfSkAfuzUPwdLBsOn-xA","pdfSize":"5149220"}
