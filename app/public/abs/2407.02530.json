Using the framework, we can\nachieve exact uniform sampling over all vertices and perfect state transfer\nbetween any two vertices, provided that eigenvalues of Laplacian matrix of the\ngraph are all integers. Furthermore, if the graph is vertex-transitive as well,\nthen we can achieve deterministic quantum spatial search that finds a marked\nvertex with certainty. In contrast, existing quantum search algorithms\ngenerally has a certain probability of failure. Even if the graph is not\nvertex-transitive, such as the complete bipartite graph, we can still adjust\nthe algorithmic framework to obtain deterministic spatial search, which thus\nshows the flexibility of it. Besides unifying and improving plenty of previous\nresults, our work provides new results on more graphs. The approach is easy to\nuse since it has a succinct formalism that depends only on the depth of the\nLaplacian eigenvalue set of the graph, and may shed light on the solution of\nmore problems related to graphs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xrIKRp3ijXkDpTnHePWmBFGQR8y4c1L2hT2LKeX8oOw","pdfSize":"379998"}
