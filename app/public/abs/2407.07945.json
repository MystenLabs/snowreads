We\nfirst list the relevant dimension-8 massless SMEFT amplitudes, and then obtain\nthe low-energy amplitudes using on-shell Higgsing. In all cases, the\ncontributions we calculate are the leading-order contributions to 4-point\ncontact-terms; the dimension-6 SMEFT merely corrects the three-point couplings\nentering the amplitudes. Since they are given in terms of physical quantities,\nnamely momenta and polarizations, the results allow for a direct mapping of EFT\neffects to low-energy observables. The vector amplitudes are sensitive to both\nanomalous vector couplings and Higgs self-couplings. The left-handed fermion\namplitudes feature SU(2) violating effects first generated at dimension-8. We\nalso compare our results to HEFT predictions. Interestingly, the dimension-8\nSMEFT populates almost all the novel structures generated by the dimension-8\nHEFT.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
