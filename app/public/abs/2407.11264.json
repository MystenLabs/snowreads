In this paper, we study entropy limit theorems for k-th largest\norder statistics under linear normalization. We show the necessary and\nsufficient conditions which convergence entropy of k-th extreme holds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6xbqAyQAqy1UuJEl0TXT1vXrRKmtgbqMbCGMdX1LWe4","pdfSize":"208897"}
