Despite the\npotential shown by large language models (LLMs), their planning capabilities\nremain limited to short-horizon tasks and they are unable to replace the\nsymbolic planning approach. Symbolic planners, on the other hand, may encounter\nexecution errors due to their common assumption of complete domain knowledge\nwhich is hard to manually prepare for an open-world setting. In this paper, we\nintroduce a Language-Augmented Symbolic Planner (LASP) that integrates\npre-trained LLMs to enable conventional symbolic planners to operate in an\nopen-world environment where only incomplete knowledge of action preconditions,\nobjects, and properties is initially available. In case of execution errors,\nLASP can utilize the LLM to diagnose the cause of the error based on the\nobservation and interact with the environment to incrementally build up its\nknowledge base necessary for accomplishing the given tasks. Experiments\ndemonstrate that LASP is proficient in solving planning problems in the\nopen-world setting, performing well even in situations where there are multiple\ngaps in the knowledge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
