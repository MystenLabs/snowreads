We show that the eigenvalue is\nminimal for the harmonic oscillator and derive a quantitative version of the\ncorresponding inequality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
