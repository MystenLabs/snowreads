To make the system's accommodate more IoT devices, this\npaper proposes a high-scalable authentication model (Hi-SAM). Hi-SAM introduces\nthe Proof-of-Work idea to authentication, which allows device to obtain the\nnetwork resource based on frequency. To optimize the frequency, mean field game\nis used for competition among devices, which can reduce the decision space of\nlarge-scale population games. And a dynamic time-range message authentication\ncode is designed for security. From the test at large population scales, Hi-SAM\nis superior in the optimization of authentication workload and the anomaly\ndetection efficiency.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
