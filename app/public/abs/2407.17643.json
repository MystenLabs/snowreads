In addition, the framework can be\nadopted as an add-on system to augment existing suspension control schemes.\nComprehensive numerical studies are performed to evaluate and validate the\nproposed framework.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
