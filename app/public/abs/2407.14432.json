In this work, we proposed and experimentally demonstrated\na highly efficient 2D grating coupler fabricated with 193-nm deep-ultraviolet\n(DUV) lithography on the 220-nm silicon-on-insulator (SOI) platform. An\nexperimental peak coupling efficiency of -2.54 dB can be obtained using a\nminimum feature size of 180 nm, relying on the novel double-layer 2D grating\nstructure. The proposed 2D waveguide grating is composed of a 70-nm\nshallow-etched hole array and a 160-nm-thick deposited polycrystalline silicon\ntooth array. The demonstrated design exhibits a 3-dB bandwidth of 23.4 nm with\ngood positioning tolerance for optical fibers. Due to the benefits of perfectly\nvertical coupling configuration, the measured polarization-dependent loss in\nexperiments is below 0.3 dB within the 3-dB working bandwidth. Our proposed\ndouble-layer 2D gratings can also be applied to other integrated optics\nplatforms, where the grating directionality can be enhanced by optimizing the\nfront-end-of-line process to break the vertical symmetry, thus enabling an\nefficient and polarization-independent coupling between optical fibers and\nphotonic chips.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
