The implications of the\nstatistical black-box approach - stochastic parrots - are prominently\ncriticized in the language model research community; however, the significance\nfor novel generative tasks is not.\n  This work investigates the alignment between personalized language models and\nsurvey participants on a Moral Foundation Theory questionnaire. We adapt\ntext-to-text models to different political personas and survey the\nquestionnaire repetitively to generate a synthetic population of persona and\nmodel combinations. Analyzing the intra-group variance and cross-alignment\nshows significant differences across models and personas. Our findings indicate\nthat adapted models struggle to represent the survey-captured assessment of\npolitical ideologies. Thus, using language models to mimic social interactions\nrequires measurable improvements in in-context optimization or parameter\nmanipulation to align with psychological and sociological stereotypes. Without\nquantifiable alignment, generating politically nuanced content remains\nunfeasible. To enhance these representations, we propose a testable framework\nto generate agents based on moral value statements for future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
