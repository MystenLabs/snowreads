Through parameter tuning\nand rigorous evaluation, we assess various ML algorithms. Techniques like\nminimum child weight and learning rate monitoring were used to reduce\noverfitting and optimize performance. Our findings highlight the robust\nperformance of Deep Neural Network (DNN) models across all phases. Ensemble\nmethods, including voting and bagging, also showed promise in enhancing\npredictive accuracy and robustness. However, Support Vector Machine (SVM)\nmodels with the Sigmoid kernel faced challenges, indicating a need for further\nrefinement. Overall, our study provides insights into ML-based lung cancer\nclassification, emphasizing the importance of parameter tuning to optimize\nmodel performance and improve diagnostic accuracy in oncological care.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
