The theoretical model simulates event-by-event (3+1)D collision\ndynamics using hydrodynamics and hadronic transport theory. We analyze the\nmodel's 20-dimensional posterior distributions obtained using three model\nemulators with different accuracy and demonstrate the essential role of\ntraining an accurate model emulator in the Bayesian analysis. Our analysis\nprovides robust constraints on the Quark-Gluon Plasma's transport properties\nand various aspects of (3+1)D relativistic nuclear dynamics. By running full\nmodel simulations with 100 parameter sets sampled from the posterior\ndistribution, we make predictions for $p_{\\rm T}$-differential observables and\nestimate their systematic theory uncertainty. A sensitivity analysis is\nperformed to elucidate how individual experimental observables respond to\ndifferent model parameters, providing useful physics insights into the\nphenomenological model for heavy-ion collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
