However, the need for detailed\narchitecture design poses significant challenges in designing and operating\nthese systems. This paper introduces a taxonomy focused on the architectures of\nfoundation-model-based agents, addressing critical aspects such as functional\ncapabilities and non-functional qualities. We also discuss the operations\ninvolved in both design-time and run-time phases, providing a comprehensive\nview of architectural design and operational characteristics. By unifying and\ndetailing these classifications, our taxonomy aims to improve the design of\nfoundation-model-based agents. Additionally, the paper establishes a decision\nmodel that guides critical design and runtime decisions, offering a structured\napproach to enhance the development of foundation-model-based agents. Our\ncontributions include providing a structured architecture design option and\nguiding the development process of foundation-model-based agents, thereby\naddressing current fragmentation in the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
