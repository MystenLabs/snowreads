However, the implementation of the\nprocesses is challenging due to the continuous-time aspect and the necessity of\nintegrating the rate function. Recently, Corbella, Spencer, and Roberts (2022)\nproposed a new algorithm to automate the implementation of the Zig-Zag sampler.\nHowever, the efficiency of the algorithm highly depends on a hyperparameter\n($t_{\\text{max}}$) that is fixed all along the run of the algorithm and needs\npreliminary runs to tune. In this work, we relax this assumption and propose a\nnew variant of their algorithm that let this parameter change over time and\nautomatically adapt to the target distribution. We also replace the Brent\noptimization algorithm by a grid-based method to compute the upper bound of the\nrate function. This method is more robust to the regularity of the function and\ngives a tighter upper bound while being quicker to compute. We also extend the\nalgorithm to other PDMPs and provide a Python implementation of the algorithm\nbased on JAX.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
