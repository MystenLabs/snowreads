We generalize their approach to prove that\nthe extension operator associated with any $n$-dimensional quadratic manifold\nin $\\mathbb{R}^d$ cannot be weak-type bounded at $q = 2d/n$. The key step in\ngeneralizing the proof of Beckner, Carbery, Semmes, and Soria will be replacing\nKakeya sets with what we will call $\\mathcal{N}$-Kakeya sets, where\n$\\mathcal{N}$ denotes a closed subset of the Grassmannian $\\text{Gr}(d-n,d)$.\nWe define $\\mathcal{N}$-Kakeya sets to be subsets of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ containing\na translate of every $d-n$-plane segment in $\\mathcal{N}$. We will prove that\nif $\\mathcal{N}$ is closed and $n$-dimensional, then there exists compact,\nmeasure zero $\\mathcal{N}$-Kakeya sets, generalizing the same result for\nstandard Kakeya sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
