So far,\nsimulations have struggled to adequately represent the attributes that motivate\nthe actions of the agents. In fact, existing population synthesis frameworks\ngenerate agent profiles limited to socio-demographic attributes. In this paper,\nwe introduce a novel value-enriched population synthesis framework that\nintegrates a motivational layer with the traditional individual and household\nsocio-demographic layers. Our research highlights the significance of extending\nthe profile of agents in synthetic populations by incorporating data on values,\nideologies, opinions and vital priorities, which motivate the agents'\nbehaviour. This motivational layer can help us develop a more nuanced\ndecision-making mechanism for the agents in social simulation settings. Our\nmethodology integrates microdata and macrodata within different Bayesian\nnetwork structures. This contribution allows to generate synthetic populations\nwith integrated value systems that preserve the inherent socio-demographic\ndistributions of the real population in any specific region.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
