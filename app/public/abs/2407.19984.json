Confidence estimation is crucial for a\ntrust-worthy automatic diagnostic system which informs the clinician about the\nconfidence of model predictions and helps reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. This\npaper investigates confidence estimation for automatic detection of AD and\ndepression based on clinical interviews. A novel Bayesian approach is proposed\nwhich uses a dynamic Dirichlet prior distribution to model the second-order\nprobability of the predictive distribution. Experimental results on the\npublicly available ADReSS and DAIC-WOZ datasets demonstrate that the proposed\nmethod outperforms a range of baselines for both classification accuracy and\nconfidence estimation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6KFhJYokxhodpMJrVHzCdHMBo1YYd0ILA-tgkhVTRSA","pdfSize":"497122"}
