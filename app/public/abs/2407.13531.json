Our results show that RecBole\noutperforms LensKit on two of three metrics on the ML-100K data set: it\nachieved an 18% higher nDCG, 14% higher precision, and 35% lower recall. To\nensure a fair comparison, we adjusted LensKit's nDCG calculation to match\nRecBole's method. This alignment made the performance more comparable, with\nLensKit achieving an nDCG of 0.2540 and RecBole 0.2674. Differences in\nsimilarity matrix calculations were identified as the main cause of performance\ndeviations. After modifying LensKit to retain only the top K similar items,\nboth libraries showed nearly identical nDCG values across all data sets. For\ninstance, both achieved an nDCG of 0.2586 on the ML-1M data set with the same\nrandom seed. Initially, LensKit's original implementation only surpassed\nRecBole in the ModCloth dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
