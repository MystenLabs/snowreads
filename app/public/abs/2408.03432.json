Sasaki on the lattice\nL(H) of closed linear subspaces of a Hilbert space H as a projection of L(H)\nonto a certain sublattice of L(H). Since L(H) is an orthomodular lattice, the\nSasaki projection and its dual can serve as the logical connectives conjunction\nand implication within the logic of quantum mechanics. It was shown by the\nauthors in a previous paper that these operations form a so-called adjoint\npair. The natural question arises if this result can be extended also to\nlattices with a unary operation which need not be orthomodular or to other\nalgebras with two binary and one unary operation. To show that this is possible\nis the aim of the present paper. We determine a variety of lattices with a\nunary operation where the Sasaki operations form an adjoint pair and we\ncontinue with so-called $\\lambda$-lattices and certain classes of semirings. We\nshow that the Sasaki operations have a deeper sense than originally assumed by\ntheir author and can be applied also outside the lattices of closed linear\nsubspaces of a Hilbert space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"avouQyObpTDUx1g8nj-DHZTlLK4M7fAP7r4CvSP0rBg","pdfSize":"188982"}
