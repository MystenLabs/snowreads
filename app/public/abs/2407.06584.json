Unlike most previous efforts that focus on\nsolving a specific task, HiLMa-Res is designed to be general for various\nloco-manipulation tasks that require quadrupedal robots to maintain sustained\nmobility. The novel design of this framework tackles the challenges of\nintegrating continuous locomotion control and manipulation using legs. It\ndevelops an operational space locomotion controller that can track arbitrary\nrobot end-effector (toe) trajectories while walking at different velocities.\nThis controller is designed to be general to different downstream tasks, and\ntherefore, can be utilized in high-level manipulation planning policy to\naddress specific tasks. To demonstrate the versatility of this framework, we\nutilize HiLMa-Res to tackle several challenging loco-manipulation tasks using a\nquadrupedal robot in the real world. These tasks span from leveraging\nstate-based policy to vision-based policy, from training purely from the\nsimulation data to learning from real-world data. In these tasks, HiLMa-Res\nshows better performance than other methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
