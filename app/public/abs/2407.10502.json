Our\nresults have a strong impact in terms of explicit computations of functor\nhomology, and they open the way to new applications to stable homology of\ngroups or to K-theory. As an illustration, we prove comparison theorems between\ncohomologies of classical algebraic groups over infinite perfect fields, in the\nspirit of a celebrated result of Cline, Parshall, Scott et van der Kallen for\nfinite fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
