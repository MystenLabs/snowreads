We present positive\ncombinatorial formulas and provide explicit interpretations. Notably, we show\nan explicit monomial expansion in terms of the $\\alpha$-binomial basis and an\nexpansion into certain chromatic symmetric functions in terms of the\n$\\alpha$-falling factorial basis. Among various connections with other\nsubjects, we highlight a significant link to $q$-rook theory, including a new\nsolution to the $q$-hit problem posed by Garsia and Remmel in their 1986 paper\nintroducing $q$-rook polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
