We show that\nthere are no solutions in the case that the matter model is a radiation fluid.\nIf the matter is described via kinetic theory we obtain that there exist unique\nsolutions to the Einstein-Vlasov system and the Einstein-Boltzmann system for a\ncertain range of soft potentials. For both the Vlasov and the Boltzmann case we\nalso obtain asymptotic expansions close to the initial conformal gauge\nsingularity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
