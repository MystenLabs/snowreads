In particular, critical and\nlist-critical graphs occupy a prominent place in graph coloring theory.\nStiebitz, Tuza, and Voigt introduced strongly critical graphs, i.e., graphs\nthat are $k$-critical yet $L$-colorable with respect to every non-constant\nassignment $L$ of lists of size $k-1$. Here we strengthen this notion and\nextend it to the framework of DP-coloring (or correspondence coloring) by\ndefining robustly $k$-critical graphs as those that are not\n$(k-1)$-DP-colorable, but only due to the fact that $\\chi(G) = k$. We then seek\ngeneral methods for constructing robustly critical graphs. Our main result is\nthat if $G$ is a critical graph (with respect to ordinary coloring), then the\njoin of $G$ with a sufficiently large clique is robustly critical; this is new\neven for strong criticality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
