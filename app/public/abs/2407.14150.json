We then obtain an improved pQCD prediction for this process by using\nthe Principle of Maximum Conformality (PMC). We show the first time that the\nPMC can be applied for any pQCD calculable observable at the total or\ndifferential levels via a self-consistent way in perturbation theory. By the\nrecursive use of renormalization group equation, the resultant PMC series\nsatisfies all the requirements of renormalization group, which is free of\nconventional renormalization scheme-and-scale ambiguities at any fixed-order\nlevel. We thus obtain a more precise prompt total cross section at the NLO\nlevel, e.g. $\\sigma|_{\\rm prompt}^{\\rm PMC}=\n0.565^{+0.144}_{-0.125}~\\text{pb}$. Here the uncertainty is the squared average\nof those from the $\\alpha_s$ fixed-point uncertainty $\\Delta\\alpha_s(M_Z)$, the\nuncertainty of charm quark mass $\\Delta m_c$, and an estimated contribution of\nthe uncalculated NNLO-terms as predicted by the Pad\\'{e} approximation\napproach. The differential cross sections $d\\sigma/dP_{J/\\psi}$,\n$d\\sigma/d|\\cos \\theta|$, and $d\\sigma/dz$ for $e^+e^- \\to J/\\psi+c+\\bar{c}$\nare further examined. Those results show that by further considering the\nfeed-down contributions, the PMC predictions show better agreement with the\nBelle measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
