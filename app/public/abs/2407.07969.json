We study the entanglement asymmetry of a class\nof excited \"coherent states\" in conformal quantum field theories with a U(1)\nsymmetry, employing Euclidean path-integral methods with topological symmetry\ndefects and the replica formalism. We compute, at leading order in perturbation\ntheory, the asymmetry for a variety of subsystems, including finite spherical\nsubregions in flat space, in finite volume, and at positive temperature. We\nalso study its Lorentzian time evolution, showcasing the dynamical restoration\nof the symmetry due to thermalization, as well as the presence of a quantum\nMpemba effect. Our results are universal, and apply in any number of\ndimensions. We also show that the perturbative entanglement asymmetry is\nrelated to the Fisher information metric, which has a known holographic dual\ncalled Hollands-Wald canonical energy, and that it is captured by the AdS bulk\ncharge contained in the entanglement wedge.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
