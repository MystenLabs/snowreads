The saturation function describes the\nminimum number of edges of a $G$-saturated graph. In particular, we study the\norder of magnitude of these functions. For (unordered) graphs, $0$-$1$\nmatrices, and vertex-ordered graphs it was possible to show that the saturation\nfunctions are either $O(1)$ or $\\Theta(n)$. We show that the saturation\nfunctions of edge-ordered graphs are also either $O(1)$ or $\\Omega(n)$.\nHowever, by finding edge-ordered graphs whose saturation functions are\nsuperlinear, we show that such a dichotomy result does not hold in general.\n  Additionally, we consider the semisaturation problem of edge-ordered graphs,\na variant of the saturation problem where we do not require that $H$ is\n$G$-free. We show a general upper bound $O(n \\log n)$ and characterize\nedge-ordered graphs with bounded semisaturation function.\n  We also present various classes of graphs with bounded, linear and\nsuperlinear (semi)saturation functions. Along the way, we define a natural\nvariant of the above problem, where the new edge must get the smallest label.\nThe behaviour of the two variants shows many similarities, which motivated us\nto investigate the second variant extensively as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
