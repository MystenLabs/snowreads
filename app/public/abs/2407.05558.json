First, we develop a node-wise decoupling method to de-compose an OEF\nproblem into multiple OEF subproblems. Then, we propose a hidden\nconvexity-based method to equivalently reformulate nonconvex OEF subproblems as\nsemi-definite programs. This method differs from any ap-proximation and\nconvexification methods that may incur infeasible solutions. Since all OEF\nsubproblems are origi-nally convex or equivalently convexified, we adopt an\nADMM to solve the hidden convexity-based distributed OEF problem with\nconvergence analysis. Test results validate the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethod, especially in handling a large number of agents.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
