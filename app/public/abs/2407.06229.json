Our findings indicate that a\ntraining time series comprising a few periodic orbits of low periods can\nsuccessfully reconstruct the Lorenz attractor. We also demonstrate that biased\ntraining data does not negatively impact reconstruction success. Our method's\nability to reconstruct a physical measure is much better than the so-called\ncycle expansion approach, which relies on weighted averaging. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate that fixed point attractors and chaotic transients can be\naccurately reconstructed by a model trained from a few periodic orbits, even\nwhen using different parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
