In the\ncontext of dynamical purification transitions, scrambling dynamics sustain\nextensive and positive coherent information at low measurement rates, but\nnoises can suppress it to zero or negative values. Here we introduce\nquantum-enhanced operations into a noisy monitored quantum circuit. This\ncircuit, viewed as a quantum channel, undergoes a phase transition in coherent\ninformation from a recoverable phase with positive values to an irrecoverable\nphase with negative values. This transition is modulated by the relative\nfrequency of noise and quantum-enhanced operations. The existence of a\nrecoverable phase implies that quantum-enhanced operations can facilitate\nreliable quantum information transmission in the presence of diverse noises.\nRemarkably, we propose a resource-efficient protocol to characterize this phase\ntransition, effectively avoiding post-selection by utilizing every run of the\nquantum simulation. This approach bridges the gap between theoretical insights\nand practical implementation, making the phase transition feasible to\ndemonstrate on realistic noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
