In\nparticular, we consider the task of finite-time stabilization for a linear\ntime-invariant system. We first derive the nominal energy required to achieve\nthis task in a disturbance-free system, and then the worst-case energy over all\nfeasible disturbances. The latter leads to an optimal control problem with a\nleast-squares solution, and then an infinite-dimensional optimization problem\nwhere we derive an upper bound on the solution. The comparison of these\nenergies is accomplished using additive and multiplicative metrics, and we\nderive analytical bounds on these metrics. Simulation examples on an ADMIRE\nfighter jet model demonstrate the practicability of these metrics, and their\nvariation with the task hardness, a combination of the distance of the initial\ncondition from the origin and the task completion time.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
