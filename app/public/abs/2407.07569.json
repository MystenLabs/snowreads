Our work is\nmotivated by the recent proposal of interlayer pairing induced by the\ninterlayer superexchange interaction of nearly half-filled $d_{z^2}$ orbitals\nin the bilayer and trilayer nickelate superconductors. We explore general\nproperties of interlayer pairing superconductivity and perform systematic\nGinzburg-Landau analyses of an effective multilayer model. For real materials,\nour results imply strong superconducting order parameter modulation and short\ncoherence length along the $z$-axis (perpendicular to the layers). This reveals\na unique feature of multilayer superconductivity with interlayer pairing and\nprovides a basic framework for future experimental and theoretical\ninvestigations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
