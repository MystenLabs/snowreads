We\nfocus on two key components: the Film Grain Analysis (FGA) module implemented\nin VVenC and the Film Grain Synthesis (FGS) module implemented in VVdeC. We\ndescribe the methodologies used to implement these modules and discuss the\ngeneration of Supplementary Enhancement Information (SEI) parameters to signal\nfilm grain characteristics in the encoded video sequences. Additionally, we\nconduct subjective and objective evaluations across Full HD videos to assess\nthe effectiveness of film grain handling. Our results demonstrate the\ncapability of the FGA and FGS techniques to accurately analyze and synthesize\nfilm grain, thereby improving the visual quality of encoded video content.\nOverall, our study contributes to advancing the understanding and\nimplementation of film grain handling techniques in VVC open-source\nimplementations, with implications for enhancing the viewing experience in\nmultimedia applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A5e8CR9FLxUVJqMy25qEQsjsLURodYtJUUDUqiOOYDI","pdfSize":"946881"}
