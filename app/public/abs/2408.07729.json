A\nthorough process for data preparation, comprising activities like cleaning,\nnormalization, and segmentation into training and testing sets, lays the\nframework for model training and evaluation. The study uses the CSE-CIC-IDS\n2018 and LITNET-2020 datasets to compare ML methods (Decision Trees, Random\nForest, XGBoost) and DL models (CNNs, RNNs, DNNs, MLP) against key performance\nmetrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score). The Decision Tree model\nperformed better across all measures after being fine-tuned with Enhanced\nParticle Swarm Optimization (EPSO), demonstrating the model's ability to detect\nnetwork breaches effectively. The findings highlight EPSO's importance in\nimproving ML classifiers for cybersecurity, proposing a strong framework for\nNIDS with high precision and dependability. This extensive analysis not only\ncontributes to the cybersecurity arena by providing a road to robust intrusion\ndetection solutions, but it also proposes future approaches for improving ML\nmodels to combat the changing landscape of network threats.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aYgrD_m2CW8LvxiobeFKE29pgc9CH8aPvaEwf7KAl14","pdfSize":"930468"}
