Extensive research has delved\ninto refining algorithms for determining the ideal lens position across\npassive, active, and hybrid autofocus systems. This paper explores the\nmathematical intricacies and practical considerations essential for optimizing\nlens positions during focus searches, addressing overarching challenges\nencountered in AF systems, such as balancing speed and accuracy. Moreover, the\nlens position calculations proposed herein can be applied to various focus\nalgorithms, including focus bracketing. The proposed method offers adaptability\nand scalability, rendering it suitable for integration into a wide array of\ncamera systems, ranging from smartphones and DSLRs to microscopes and\nindustrial imaging devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
