Previous works generally focused on the alignment of image-text\npairs via the contrastive pre-training paradigm. Such pre-trained models have\nbeen applied to pathology image classification in zero-shot learning or\ntransfer learning fashion. Herein, we hypothesize that the pre-trained\nvision-language models can be utilized for quantitative histopathology image\nanalysis through a simple image-to-text retrieval. To this end, we propose a\nText-based Quantitative and Explainable histopathology image analysis, which we\ncall TQx. Given a set of histopathology images, we adopt a pre-trained\nvision-language model to retrieve a word-of-interest pool. The retrieved words\nare then used to quantify the histopathology images and generate understandable\nfeature embeddings due to the direct mapping to the text description. To\nevaluate the proposed method, the text-based embeddings of four histopathology\nimage datasets are utilized to perform clustering and classification tasks. The\nresults demonstrate that TQx is able to quantify and analyze histopathology\nimages that are comparable to the prevalent visual models in computational\npathology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3iRVHykV9h6_ZljQEY_-ULRtqbloZ5OJBeYUxElp6ks","pdfSize":"4841087"}
