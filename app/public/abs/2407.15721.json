Different morphisms and\ncodings may yield the same morphic sequence. This paper investigates how to\nprove that two such representations of a morphic sequence by morphisms\nrepresent the same sequence. In particular, we focus on the smallest\nrepresentations of the subsequences of the binary Fibonacci sequence obtained\nby only taking the even or odd elements. The proofs we give are induction\nproofs of several properties simultaneously, and are typically found fully\nautomatically by a tool that we developed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
