We prove that (i) Each\n{\\it entropy-invariant solution} can be identified as a {\\it time-periodic\nMaxwell-Boltzmann distribution}. Moreover, these distributions can be\ncharacterized by thirteen conservation laws, which sheds light on the global\ndynamics. (ii) Each {\\it time-periodic Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution} is\nnonlinearly stable, including neutral asymptotic stability and Lyapunov\nstability. Furthermore, the convergence rate is entirely reliant on the\nthirteen conservation laws and is optimal when compared to the linear scenario.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
