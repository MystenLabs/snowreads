The fLoS fading distribution\nis expressed in terms of the multivariate confluent hypergeometric functions\n$\\Psi_2$, $\\Phi_3^{(n)}$, and $\\Phi_3 = \\Phi_3^{(2)}$ and encompasses\nwell-known distributions, such as the Nakagami-$m$, Hoyt, Rice, and Rician\nshadowed fading distributions as special cases. An efficient method to\nnumerically compute the fLoS fading distribution is also addressed. Notably,\nfor a positive integer $k$, the fLoS fading distribution simplifies to a finite\nmixture of $\\kappa$-$\\mu$ distributions. Additionally, we analyze the outage\nprobability and Ergodic capacity, presenting a tailored Prony's approximation\nmethod for the latter. Numerical results are presented to show the impact of\nthe fading parameters and verify the accuracy of the proposed approximation.\nMoreover, we illustrate an application of the proposed fLoS fading distribution\nfor characterizing wireless systems affected by channel aging.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nHLbN_Dadb8wBZF8wvShmOXurePbddJmveBvMcKCfUg","pdfSize":"596675"}
