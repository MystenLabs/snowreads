The efficient calibration to market\ndata of these more complex models becomes a relevant target in practice. The\nmain objective of the present work is to efficiently calibrate some recent\nSABR/LIBOR market models to real market prices of caplets and swaptions. For\nthe calibration we propose a parallelized version of the simulated annealing\nalgorithm for multi-GPUs. The numerical results clearly illustrate the\nadvantages of using the proposed multi-GPUs tools when applied to real market\ndata and popular SABR/LIBOR models.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Pricing of Securities"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
