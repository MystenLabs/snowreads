Motivated by these developments, we study stationary\nmultivariate diffusion processes with a sparsely structured drift. Our main\nresult gives a characterization of the conditional independence relations that\nhold in a stationary distribution. The result draws on a graphical\nrepresentation of the drift structure and pertains to conditional independence\nrelations that hold generally as a consequence of the drift's sparsity pattern.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
