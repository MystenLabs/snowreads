It is confirmed\nthat at high enough isospin densities, charged pions start to condense and the\npion superfluid phase appears in the system. It is shown that the chiral\ncondensate and the pion condensate can be transformed to each other and form a\n`chiral circle' in the superfluid phase. We derived the Equation of State (EoS)\nfor pionic matter, calculated the normalized trace anomaly $\\Delta$ and\n$(\\epsilon-3p)/m_\\pi^4$, and analyzed the sound speed and adiabatic index.\nAdditionally, we provided data on the mass-radius relation and tidal\ndeformability of pion stars. The results indicate that the holographic models\nalign well with lattice QCD concerning isospin density, axial-vector\ncondensation, EoS, and trace anomaly, though discrepancies in sound speed and\nadiabatic index emerge at higher isospin chemical potentials. The holographic\nmodels closely match those from chiral perturbation theory ($\\chi$PT),\nsuggesting that they can be considered as five-dimensional description of\n$\\chi$PT.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OTAP6mUvUOWD1y2-hQtMSIhcmrDXYPe26qotwkvvszU","pdfSize":"1459831"}
