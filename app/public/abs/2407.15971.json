This result is achieved by extending\nNe\\v{c}as' inequality to square-integrable functions that vanish in a small\nband covering the boundary. It is found that the associated a priori pressure\nestimate depends inversely on the volume of the band. Numerical experiments\nconfirm these findings. Based on these results, guidelines are provided for\napplying vanishing pressure boundary conditions in model coupling and domain\ndecomposition methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4elDns6jehGzfnzjZyY01q-dkUrYEaiye6AiSKKAsoc","pdfSize":"2059629"}
