The algorithm\ndoes not relay on the Quantum Fourier Transform and its quantum computational\ncomplexity is of order $O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ in terms of the target\naccuracy $\\varepsilon>0$. The $O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ bound on quantum\ncomputational complexity is also superior compared to those in the earlier\napproaches due to smaller constants. Moreover, a much tighter bound is obtained\nby means of computer-assisted estimates for the expected value of quantum\ncomputational complexity. The correctness of the algorithm and the\n$O(\\frac{1}{\\varepsilon})$ bound on quantum computational complexity are\nsupported by precise proofs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
