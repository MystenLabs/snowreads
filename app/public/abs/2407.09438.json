However, it\nremains unclear how decentralized shape control determines the movement of the\nentire organism. Here, we investigate how efficient locomotion emerges from\ncoordinated yet simple and decentralized decision-making of the body parts\nusing neuroevolution techniques. Our approach allows us to investigate optimal\nlocomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies, with emerging\nlong-wavelength body shape deformations corresponding to surprisingly efficient\nswimming gaits. The obtained decentralized policies are robust and tolerant\nconcerning morphological changes or defects and can be applied to artificial\nmicroswimmers for cargo transport or drug delivery applications without further\noptimization \"out of the box\". Our work is of relevance to understanding and\ndeveloping robust navigation strategies of biological and artificial\nmicroswimmers and, in a broader context, for understanding emergent levels of\nindividuality and the role of collective intelligence in Artificial Life.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
