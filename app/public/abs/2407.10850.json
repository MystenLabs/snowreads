Recent\nobservations have revealed that about 10 per cent of nucleated galaxies host\nhybrid nuclei, consisting of both NSCs and accreting SMBHs that power active\ngalactic nuclei (AGN). Motivated by the potential of the recently published\nmulti-wavelength data sets from LeMMINGs survey, here we present the most\nthorough investigation to date of the incidence of hybrid nuclei in a large\nsample of 100 nearby nucleated galaxies (10 E, 25 S0, 63 S, and 2 Irr),\ncovering a wide range in stellar mass ($M_{*,\\rm gal} \\sim 10^{8.7}-10^{12}~\\rm\nM_{sun}$). We identify the nuclei and derive their properties by performing\ndetailed 1D and 2D multi-component decompositions of the optical and\nnear-infrared $HST$ stellar light distributions of the galaxies using S\\'ersic\nand core-S\\'ersic models. Our AGN diagnostics are based on homogeneously\nderived nuclear 1.5 GHz $e$-MERLIN radio, $Chandra$ X-ray (0.3--10 keV) and\noptical emission-line data. We determine the nucleation fraction ($f_{\\rm nuc}\n$) as the relative incidence of nuclei across the LeMMINGs $HST$ sample and\nfind $f_{\\rm nuc} =~ $100/149 (= 67 $\\pm$ 7 per cent), confirming previous\nwork, with a peak value of 49/56~(= $88 \\pm 13$ per cent) at bulge masses\n$M_{*,\\rm bulge} \\sim 10^{9.4}$- $10^{10.8}~\\rm M_{sun}$. We identify 30\nnucleated LeMMINGs galaxies that are optically active, radio-detected and X-ray\nluminous ($L_{X} > 10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$). This indicates that our nucleated\nsample has a lower limit $\\sim$ 30 per cent occupancy of hybrid nuclei, which\nis a function of $M_{*,\\rm bulge}$ and $M_{*,\\rm gal}$. We find that hybrid\nnuclei have a number density of $(1.5 \\pm 0.4) \\times 10^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
