We conduct here a comprehensive study of these operators and their\nrelevant system-theoretic properties. The general theory is then leveraged to\ndelineate both known and new design methodologies for control, estimation, and\nmodel reduction. Several entirely new designs arise from this systematic\ncategorization, including new recursive and low-gain design frameworks for\nobservation of cascaded systems. The benefits of the results beyond the linear\ntime-invariant setting are demonstrated through preliminary extensions for\nnonlinear systems, with an outlook towards the development of a similarly\ncomprehensive nonlinear theory.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
