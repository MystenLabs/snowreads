It is\nknown that $\\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a disjoint union of\npoints and circles when both $G$ and $H$ are cycles. We generalize this known\nresult by showing that $\\mathrm{Hom}(G,H)$ is homotopy equivalent to a disjoint\nunion of points and circles whenever $G$ is connected and $H$ is a cycle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
