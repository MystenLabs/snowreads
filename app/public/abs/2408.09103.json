For the scientific\ndisciplines that rely on computationally intensive analyses of large data sets,\na granular understanding of the analysis methodology is an essential component\nof reproducibility. This paper discusses the guiding principles of a\ncomputational reproducibility framework that enables a scientist to proactively\ngenerate a complete reproducible trace as analysis unfolds, and share data,\nmethods and executable tools as part of a scientific publication, allowing\nother researchers to verify results and easily re-execute the steps of the\nscientific investigation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Jp71w0EQIZumC2wJxjiUNr51SnqC41EENamsJ37rL_A","pdfSize":"770032"}
