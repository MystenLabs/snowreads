Our main result generalises theorems in the\nliterature for graphs and for crossed products of commutative C*-algebras by\nthe integers. We give a condition on the surjective local homeomorphism that\ncharacterises the AF embeddability of the C*-algebra of the associated\nDeaconu-Renault groupoid. In order to prove our main result, we analyse\nhomology groups for AF groupoids, and we prove a theorem that gives an explicit\nformula for the isomorphism of these groups and the corresponding K-theory.\nThis isomorphism generalises Farsi, Kumjian, Pask, Sims (M\\\"unster J. Math,\n2019) and Matui (Proc. Lond. Math. Soc, 2012), since we give an explicit\nformula for the isomorphism and we show that it preserves positive elements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
