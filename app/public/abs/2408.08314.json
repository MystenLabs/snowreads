The latter possibility is called the\n\"inverted hierarchy scenario\" (IH) and would provide the opportunity of\nsimultaneous discovery of two scalars. In both searches the selection cuts are\noptimised for the case of an on-shell $Z$ boson. For the case of the $Z$ boson\nbeing off-shell (denoted by $Z^*$, for which $m_{A^0} - m_{h^0}<m_Z$) no limits\nare set on the relevant 2HDM parameters from this process. It is known that the\ndecay $A^0\\to h^0 Z^*$ can have a large branching ratio (BR) in 2HDMs\n(especially in the Type I structure). In the context of the IH scenario and\ndeveloping our previous work, we calculate the signal cross section\n$\\sigma(gg\\to A^0)\\times {\\rm BR}(A^0\\to h^0Z^{(*)})\\times {\\rm BR}(h^0\\to\nb\\overline b,\\tau\\overline \\tau)$ in the four types of 2HDMs with NFC. We also\nsuggest some selection cuts that could provide sensitivity to $A^0\\to h^0 Z^*$\nin the IH scenario.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
