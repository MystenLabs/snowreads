Recent interest\nin exceptional points has led to re-examination of non-Hermitian\ngeneralizations of many physical models, including the SSH model. In such\nnon-Hermitian systems, singular points called exceptional points (EPs) appear\nthat are of interest for applications in super-resolution sensing systems and\ntopological lasers. Here, a non-Hermitian and non-PT-symmetric variation of the\nSSH model is introduced, in which the hopping amplitudes are non-reciprocal and\nvary monotonically along the chain. It is found that, while the existence of\nthe EPs is due to the nonreciprocal couplings, the number, position, and order\nof the EPs can all be altered by the addition of the hopping amplitude\ngradient, adding a new tool for tailoring the spectrum of a non-Hermitian\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gnP4bzyhGHn8zhqz67aaZkcOpvZ6xy0LCFIU1QgunfI","pdfSize":"887210"}
