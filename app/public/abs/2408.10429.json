Motivated by this practical\nreality, we study price competition under a flexible choice model:\nConsider-then-Choose with Lexicographic Choice (CLC). In this model, a customer\nfirst forms a consideration set of sellers based on (i) her willingness-to-pay\nand (ii) an arbitrary set of criteria on items' non-price attributes; she then\nchooses the highest-ranked item according to a lexicographic ranking in which\nitems with better performance on more important attributes are ranked higher.\nWe provide a structural characterization of equilibria in the resulting game of\nprice competition, and derive an economically interpretable condition, which we\ncall gradient dominance, under which equilibria can be computed efficiently.\nFor this subclass of CLC models, we prove that distributed gradient-based\npricing dynamics converge to the set of equilibria. Extensive numerical\nexperiments show robustness of our theoretical findings when gradient dominance\ndoes not hold.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
