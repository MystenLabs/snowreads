The\nscotogenic model can be considered the proto-type model realizing this idea,\nbut many other variants exist. In this paper we explore the phenomemology of a\nparticular DM neutrino mass model, containing a triplet scalar. We calculate\nthe relic density and check for constraints from direct detection experiments.\nThe parameter space of the model, allowed by these constraints, contains\ntypically a long-lived or quasi-stable doubly charged scalar, that can be\nsearched for at the LHC. We reinterpret existing searches to derive limits on\nthe masses of the scalars of the model and estimate future sensitivities in the\nhigh-luminosity phase of the LHC. The searches we discuss can serve to\nconstrain also many other 1-loop neutrino mass models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
