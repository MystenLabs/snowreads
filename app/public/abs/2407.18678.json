Now we consider blow-ups of\nruled surfaces more generally. We propose a conjecture for classifying all the\nnegative self-intersection curves on the blow-up of a ruled surface at very\ngeneral points, analogous to the $(-1)$-curves conjecture in $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\nAssuming this conjecture is true, we exhibit an ample line bundle with an\nirrational Seshadri constant at a very general point on such a surface.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
