We show that, for\nfibered links in $S^3$, the degree of the ADO invariant is determined by the\ngenus and the top coefficient is a root of unity. More precisely, we prove that\nthe top coefficient is determined by the Hopf invariant of the plane field of\n$S^3$ associated to the fiber surface. Our proof is based on the genus bounds\nestablished in our previous work, together with a theorem of Giroux-Goodman\nstating that fiber surfaces in the three-sphere can be obtained from a disk by\nplumbing/deplumbing Hopf bands.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RM0DhpY47i8Y9HCcBbpdfb8LPR3EOgfmUB07wpiIO-w","pdfSize":"489080"}
