Since OP is not routinely monitored, it can be\nchallenging to estimate exposure and health impacts. Remote sensing data are\ncommonly used to estimate PM mass concentration, but have never been used to\nestimate OP. In this study, we evaluate the potential of satellite images to\nestimate OP as measured by acellular ascorbic acid (OP AA) and dithiothreitol\n(OP DTT) assays of 24-hour PM10 sampled periodically over five years at three\nlocations around Grenoble, France. We use a deep convolutional neural network\nto extract features of daily 3 m/pixel PlanetScope satellite images and train a\nmultilayer perceptron to estimate OP at a 1 km spatial resolution based on the\nimage features and common meteorological variables. The model captures more\nthan half of the variation in OP AA and almost half of the variation in OP DTT\n(test set R2 = 0.62 and 0.48, respectively), with relative mean absolute error\n(MAE) of about 32%. Using only satellite images, the model still captures about\nhalf of the variation in OP AA and one third of the variation in OP DTT (test\nset R2 = 0.49 and 0.36, respectively) with relative MAE of about 37%. If\nconfirmed in other areas, our approach could represent a low-cost method for\nexpanding the temporal or spatial coverage of OP estimates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
