The\nmain result is about the dynamics on the skew-product, which is governed by the\nexistence and prevalence of strange attractors in the corresponding resonance\ntongues of the Arnold family. The strange attractors carry the unique physical\nmeasure of the system, which determines the behaviour of Lebesgue-almost all\ninitial conditions. This phenomenon can be considered as the transition\ndynamics from a strange attractor with one positive Lyapunov exponent to\nhyperchaos. Besides an analytical rigorous proof, we illustrate the main\nresults with numerical simulations. We also conjecture how persistent\nhyperchaos can be obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"JNuyS3QRK5yWbFF3MkM5gMN8MZu24oY6dbDhlBYft80","pdfSize":"2533530"}
