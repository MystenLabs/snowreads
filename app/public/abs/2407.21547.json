However, classical algorithms that can\nperform this task suffer either from complexity or reduced performances. This\nwork aims at proposing a quantum annealing approach to overcome this trade-off.\nFirstly, we show that the maximum a posteriori decoder of the activity pattern\nof the network can be seen as the ground state of an Ising Hamiltonian. For N\nusers in a network with perfect channels, we propose a universal control\nfunction to schedule the annealing process. Our approach avoids to continuously\ncompute the optimal control function but still ensures high success probability\nwhile demanding a lower annealing time than a linear control function. This\nadvantage holds even in the presence of imperfections in the network.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
