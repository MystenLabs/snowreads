Atomic resolution\ncharacterization of nanoparticle surface dynamics is challenging since it\nrequires both high spatial and temporal resolution. Though ultrafast\ntransmission electron microscopy (TEM) can achieve picosecond temporal\nresolution, it is limited to nanometer spatial resolution. On the other hand,\nwith the high readout rate of new electron detectors, conventional TEM has the\npotential to visualize atomic structure with millisecond time resolutions.\nHowever, the need to limit electron dose rates to reduce beam damage yields\nmillisecond images that are dominated by noise, obscuring structural details.\nHere we show that a newly developed unsupervised denoising framework based on\nartificial intelligence enables observations of metal nanoparticle surfaces\nwith time resolutions down to 10 ms at moderate electron dose. On this\ntimescale, we find that many nanoparticle surfaces continuously transition\nbetween ordered and disordered configurations. The associated stress fields can\npenetrate below the surface leading to defect formation and destabilization\nmaking the entire nanoparticle fluxional. Combining this unsupervised denoiser\nwith electron microscopy greatly improves spatio-temporal characterization\ncapabilities, opening a new window for future exploration of atomic-level\nstructural dynamics in materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uOHkTLuaxUYCaKzcBJ3M1qelGlH1pS3EPOxO87wdgX0","pdfSize":"4512212"}
