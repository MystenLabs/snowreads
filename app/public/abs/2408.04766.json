Through\ntime-dependent density-functional theory calculations, we find that this CM is\nrobust with respect to the parameters of the applied laser pulse. We document\nthe spatial and temporal origin of the localized hole, which is initiated via\nstrong-field tunnel ionization in the halogen end of the molecule, and near the\npeak of the laser electric field. In bromobutadiyne we find a range of\nwavelengths around $1500~\\text{nm}$ that consistently leads to the initiation\nof high-contrast CM. In addition, we show that the inclusion of Ehrenfest\nnuclear dynamics does not disrupt the creation of the localized hole, nor the\nsubsequent CM motion, in bromobutadiyne or \\emph{para}-bromoaniline.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
