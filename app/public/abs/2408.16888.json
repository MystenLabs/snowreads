This results in an instability that\ntransfers kinetic energy from the plasma to the electric field. We show that\nthere are intensity profiles for the beam (found by numerical optimization)\nthat can largely suppress this instability and drive the system into a state\nthat, after the beam has been switched off, remains stable over long times. The\nmodulated beam intensity requires no feedback, i.e. no knowledge of the\nphysical system during time evolution is required, and the frequency of the\nmodulation scales approximately inversely with system size, which is\nparticularly favorable for large plasma systems. We also show that the results\nobtained are robust in the sense that perturbations, e.g. deviation from the\noptimized beam profiles, can be tolerated without losing the ability to\nsuppress the instability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
