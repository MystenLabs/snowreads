These symbolic regression models (SRMs) are\nthen employed to perform Bayesian inference with a comprehensive dataset from\nnuclear physics experiments and astrophysical observations. The posterior\ndistributions of EoS parameters obtained from Bayesian inference using SRMs\nclosely match those obtained directly from the solutions of TOV equations. Our\nSRM-based approach is approximately 100 times faster, enabling efficient\nBayesian analyses across different combinations of data to explore their\nsensitivity to various EoS parameters within a reasonably short time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OGmzrmWVd1Ckvx4eA9uMcXCEE-U_mKu3ojq7h85YZB4","pdfSize":"2033968"}
