The main jet axis has an elongated S shape, appearing as a\nfaint narrow zone in visible and UV. We term it the S-shaped hose, and the\nstructure of three symmetry lines, the point-symmetric wind rose. The two other\nlines connect a protrusion (an ear or a bulge) with a hole on the opposite side\nof the center (a nozzle or a cavity), structures that we identify in the X-ray,\nUV, visible, IR, and/or radio images. There is a well-known blowout at the\nsouthern end of the S-shaped hose, and we identify a possible opposite blowout\nat the northern end of the S-shaped hose. The point-symmetrical morphology of\nthe Cygnus Loop is according to the expectation of the jittering jets explosion\nmechanism (JJEM) of CCSNe, where several to few tens of pairs of jets with\nstochastically varying directions explode the star. The three pairs of jets\nthat shaped the wind-rose structure of the Cygnus Loop are the last energetic\npairs of this series of jets. Our study further supports the JJEM as the main\nexplosion mechanism of CCSNe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
