General theoretical analysis of topological orders at\n$\\nu=3/4$ revealed that four types of non-Abelian states with Ising anyons have\nground state degeneracy $12$ on the torus. The properties of $\\nu=3/4$ states\ncan be analyzed using two complementary approaches. In the first one, they are\ntreated as particle-hole conjugate of $\\nu=1/4$ Moore-Read types states. In the\nsecond one, they are mapped to composite fermions with reverse flux attachment\nat effective filling factor $3/2$, whose integral part realizes an integer\nquantum Hall state and the fractional part realizes $\\nu=1/2$ Moore-Read type\nstates. For the specific case of bilayer graphene, numerical calculations\ndemonstrate that strong Landau level mixing could generate a gapped state at\n$\\nu=3/4$ with 12 fold ground state degeneracy on the torus. Its chiral\ngraviton spectral functions has one low energy peak with negative chirality and\none high energy peak with positive chirality. This points to a specific member\nof the Moore-Read type states and agrees with the deduction based on daughter\nstates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yDy1TqITEC_0Ig_IHRT7apt6196NvBJWOMhbTKBw9fE","pdfSize":"1592286"}
