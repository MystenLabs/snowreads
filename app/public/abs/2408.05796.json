This phenomenon is found\nto be tunable by modifying the surface with different molecular layers. A\ncomparative analysis of dynamic hysteresis, static hysteresis, and contact line\nfriction coefficients across diverse substrates reveals that dynamic hysteresis\nis not a result of dissipative effects but is instead proportionally linked to\nthe flexibility of the grafted layer on the surface. In the quest for\nappropriate conditions to model oscillatory contact line motion, we identify\nthe generalized Hocking's linear law and modified Generalized Navier Boundary\nCondition (GNBC) as alternative options for predicting realistic dynamic\nhysteresis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
