We start by discussing how $T\\bar{T}$ and\nRoot-$T\\bar{T}$ deformations of two-dimensional field theories can be\nequivalently interpreted as the coupling of the undeformed matter sector to a\ngravity theory. We then extend this duality to higher-dimensional scenarios by\nusing an approach that relies on the non-trivial eigenvalue degeneracy\ncharacterising the energy-momentum tensor of specific physical theories. We\nalso explore incorporating dynamical degrees of freedom in the gravity sector,\nand show that the deformed space-time geometry induced by the $T\\bar{T}$-like\ndeformations defines a Ricci-Bourguignon flow of the metric tensor, which\nreduces to a Ricci flow in four dimensions. Finally, exploiting a dressing-type\nmechanism for the action functional characterizing a broad class of\n$T\\bar{T}$-like deformations we study explicit examples, such as Einstein-Ricci\nsolitons, $(d-1)$-form field theories, and spherically symmetric electrovacuum\nsolutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
