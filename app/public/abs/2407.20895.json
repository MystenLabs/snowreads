In this paper, we analyze\nnon-Hermitian topology under the nonlinearity of eigenvalues. Specifically, we\nelucidate that such nonlinear systems may exhibit exceptional points and\nnon-Hermitian skin effects which are unique non-Hermitian topological\nphenomena. The robustness of these non-Hermitian phenomena is clarified by\nintroducing the topological invariants under nonlinearity which reproduce the\nexisting ones in linear systems. Furthermore, our analysis elucidates that\nexceptional points may emerge even for systems without an internal degree of\nfreedom where the equation is single component. These nonlinearity-induced\nexceptional points are observed in mechanical metamaterials, e.g., the Kapitza\npendulum.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2YztRL_8xtoYXEPDQhuJIB6lR4Y1jM85Idgc3mlxTrg","pdfSize":"1922940"}
