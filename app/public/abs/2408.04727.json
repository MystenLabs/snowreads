We prove that there exists $\\eta\\geq 0.002$\nsuch that if $q\\geq (2-\\eta)\\Delta$, then there exists an open set\n$\\mathcal{U}\\subset \\mathbb{C}$ that contains the interval $[0,1]$ such that\nfor each $w\\in \\mathcal{U}$ and any graph $G=(V,E)$ of maximum degree at most\n$\\Delta$, the partition function of the anti-ferromagnetic $q$-state Potts\nmodel evaluated at $w$ does not vanish. This provides a (modest) improvement on\na result of Liu, Sinclair, and Srivastava, and breaks the $q=2\\Delta$-barrier\nfor this problem.\n  As a direct consequence we obtain via Barvinok's interpolation method a\ndeterministic polynomial time algorithm to approximate the number of proper\n$q$-colorings of graphs of maximum degree at most $\\Delta$, provided $q\\geq\n(2-\\eta)\\Delta$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
