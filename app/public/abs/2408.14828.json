This makes them difficult to implement on current noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers and results in the inability to\nperform quantum algorithms at useful scales with near-term quantum processors.\nDue to this, calculations are generally done without encoding. We propose a\nmiddle ground between these two approaches: constructions in the [[n,n-2,2]]\nquantum error detecting code that can detect any error from a single faulty\ngate by measuring the stabilizer generators of the code and additional ancillas\nat the end of the computation. This achieves what we call weak fault-tolerance.\nAs we show, this demonstrates a significant improvement over no error\ncorrection for low enough physical error probabilities and requires much less\noverhead than codes that achieve full fault-tolerance. We give constructions\nfor a set of gates that achieve universal quantum computation in this error\ndetecting code, while satisfying weak fault-tolerance up to analog imprecision\non the physical rotation gate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1Bmfz0xwVhfubqBwvtoz_AwTsnL97kpHb6ZQw6fboeg","pdfSize":"423582"}
