In practice, however, elements of RIS may suffer from\nphase deviations, which need to be properly estimated and calibrated. This\npaper models the problem of over-the-air (OTA) estimation of the RIS elements\nas a quasi-neural network (QNN) so that the phase estimates can be obtained\nusing the classic backpropagation (BP) algorithm. We also derive the Cram\\'{e}r\nRao Bounds (CRBs) for the phases of the RIS elements as a benchmark of the\nproposed approach. The simulation results verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed algorithm by showing that the root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the\nphase estimates are close to the CRBs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
