Here, we\nsharpen our previous analytic results and validate them via the first numerical\nexploration of the Gubser flow in a holographic conformal field theory.\n  Remarkably, the leading generic behavior at large de Sitter time is\nfree-streaming in transverse directions and the sub-leading behavior is that of\na color glass condensate. We also show that Gubser flow can be smoothly glued\nto the vacuum outside the future Minkowski wedge generically given that the\nenergy density vanishes faster than any power when extrapolated to early proper\ntime or to large distances from the central axis. We find that at intermediate\ntimes the ratio of both the transverse and longitudinal pressures to the energy\ndensity converge approximately to a fixed point which is hydrodynamic only for\nlarge initial energy densities. We argue that our results suggest that the\nGubser flow is better applied to collective behavior in jets rather than the\nfull medium in the phenomenology of heavy ion collisions and can reveal new\nclues to the mechanism of confinement.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
