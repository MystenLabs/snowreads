The most common\nair-water flow measurement instrument to characterize such flows is the\nintrusive dual-tip phase-detection needle probe, which identifies phase changes\naround the needle tips due to a change of resistivity (phase-detection\nconductivity probe) or light refraction (phase-detection fiber optical probe).\nPhase-detection conductivity probes are typically custom made for research\npurposes, with current design dating back to the 1980ies. In the present study,\nthe next generation of dual-tip conductivity probes is developed and validated\nagainst a state-of-the-art system. The novel probe design comprises two main\nfeatures, including (1) a printed circuit board of the sensor's electrodes and\n(2) a detachable sensor head. These features offer many advantages over the\nclassical needle-type design. For example, the circuit boards can be\nmanufactured with high precision and the sensor head can be easily replaced in\ncase of damage or deterioration. As such, it is anticipated that this\nrelatively cheap and robust design will enable a better repeatability of\nair-water flow experiments, combined with an enhanced accessibility for the\nair-water flow research community.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bZIKNIafHjuTJp14LTTEWtVVadjP6N6GNiMe9f2exRk","pdfSize":"4548932"}
