The pressure anisotropy due to the intermolecular\nforce between the fluid particles in the same or the different fluid components\nis approximately proportional to the multiplication of the corresponding fluid\ndensity gradients, and from the molecular dynamics simulation of the\nliquid-vapor and liquid-liquid interfaces, we demonstrate that the density\ngradient theory (DGT) by van der Waals gives the leading order approximation of\nthe free energy density in inhomogeneous systems, neglecting the Tolman length.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
