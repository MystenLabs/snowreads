We investigate the\nimpedance response of ion-controlled transistors using a model that combines\nelectronic motion along the channel and vertical ion diffusion by insertion\nfrom the electrolyte, depending on the chemical capacitance, the diffusion\ncoefficient of ions, the electronic transit time, and the series impedance\ncomponents due to the electrolyte and its interfaces. Based on transport and\ncharge conservation equations, we show that the vertical impedance produces a\nstandard result of diffusion in intercalation systems, while the transversal\nimpedance (drain current vs gate voltage) contains the electronic parameters of\nhole accumulation and transport along the channel. We establish the spectral\nshapes of drain and gate currents and the complex admittance spectra by\nreference to equivalent circuit models for the vertical and transversal\nimpedances, that describe well the measurements of a PEDOT:PSS OECT. We obtain\nnew insights to the determination of mobility by the relationship between drain\nand gate currents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
