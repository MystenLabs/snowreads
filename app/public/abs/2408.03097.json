The task of micro-gesture classification task involves\nrecognizing the category of a given video clip, which focuses on more\nfine-grained and subtle body movements compared to typical action recognition\ntasks. Given the inherent complexity of micro-gesture recognition, which\nincludes large intra-class variability and minimal inter-class differences, we\nutilize two innovative modules, i.e., the cross-modal fusion module and\nprototypical refinement module, to improve the discriminative ability of MG\nfeatures, thereby improving the classification accuracy. Our solution achieved\nsignificant success, ranking 1st in the track of Micro-gesture Classification.\nWe surpassed the performance of last year's leading team by a substantial\nmargin, improving Top-1 accuracy by 6.13%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
