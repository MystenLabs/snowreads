The near-brane limit of\nthe metric describing these branes has an AdS$_3$ factor, implying the\nexistence of a dual CFT. Each partition of the M2 and M5 charges among spikes\ngives rise to a different \"mohawk\" revealing a new layer of brane\nfractionation. We conjecture that all these mohawks are dual to ground states\nof near-brane-intersection CFT's. We show that the supergravity solutions\ndescribing these mohawks are part of the large families of AdS$_3$ $\\times S^3\n\\times S^3$ solutions described in [arXiv:1312.5477]. We identify precisely\nwhich of these families are relevant to brane intersections and show that the\nAdS$_3$ invariance emerges from the self-similarity of the spikes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
