Approaches based on Latent Feature Analysis (LFA) have\nshown to be beneficial for discovering effective temporal patterns in QoS data.\nHowever, existing methods cannot well model the spatiality and temporality\nimplied in dynamic interactions in a unified form, causing abundant accuracy\nloss for missing QoS estimation. To address the problem, this paper presents a\nnovel Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)-based dynamic QoS estimator namely\nSpatiotemporal Coupling GCN (SCG) model with the three-fold ideas as below.\nFirst, SCG builds its dynamic graph convolution rules by incorporating\ngeneralized tensor product framework, for unified modeling of spatial and\ntemporal patterns. Second, SCG combines the heterogeneous GCN layer with tensor\nfactorization, for effective representation learning on bipartite user-service\ngraphs. Third, it further simplifies the dynamic GCN structure to lower the\ntraining difficulties. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two\nlarge-scale widely-adopted QoS datasets describing throughput and response\ntime. The results demonstrate that SCG realizes higher QoS estimation accuracy\ncompared with the state-of-the-arts, illustrating it can learn powerful\nrepresentations to users and cloud services.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
