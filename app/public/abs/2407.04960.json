However, most existing CRS models mainly focus on dialogue\ncomprehension and preferences mining from the current dialogue session,\noverlooking user preferences in historical dialogue sessions. The preferences\nembedded in the user's historical dialogue sessions and the current session\nexhibit continuity and sequentiality, and we refer to CRSs with this\ncharacteristic as sequential CRSs. In this work, we leverage memory-enhanced\nLLMs to model the preference continuity, primarily focusing on addressing two\nkey issues: (1) redundancy and noise in historical dialogue sessions, and (2)\nthe cold-start users problem. To this end, we propose a Memory-enhanced\nConversational Recommender System Framework with Large Language Models (dubbed\nMemoCRS) consisting of user-specific memory and general memory. User-specific\nmemory is tailored to each user for their personalized interests and\nimplemented by an entity-based memory bank to refine preferences and retrieve\nrelevant memory, thereby reducing the redundancy and noise of historical\nsessions. The general memory, encapsulating collaborative knowledge and\nreasoning guidelines, can provide shared knowledge for users, especially\ncold-start users. With the two kinds of memory, LLMs are empowered to deliver\nmore precise and tailored recommendations for each user. Extensive experiments\non both Chinese and English datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MemoCRS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
