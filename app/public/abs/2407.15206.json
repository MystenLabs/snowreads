The aims of\nthis work are to study the {\\rm v}-number ${\\rm v}(J)$ of $J$ and to study when\n$J$ is linearly presented using combinatorics and commutative algebra. We\nclassify when ${\\rm v}(J)$ attains its minimum and maximum possible values in\nterms of the vertex covers of the graph that satisfy the exchange property. If\nthe cover ideal of a graph has a linear presentation, we express its v-number\nin terms of the covering number of the graph. We show necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the graph $\\mathcal{G}_J$ of $J$ to be connected. Then, for\nunmixed K\\\"onig graphs, we classify when $J$ is linearly presented using graph\ntheory, and show some results on Cohen--Macaulay K\\\"onig graphs. If $G$ is\nunmixed, it is shown that the columns of the linear syzygy matrix of $J$ are\nlinearly independent if and only if $\\mathcal{G}_J$ has no strong $3$-cycles.\nOne of our main theorems shows that if $G$ is unmixed and has no induced\n4-cycles, then $J$ is linearly presented. For unmixed graphs without $3$- and\n$5$-cycles, we classify combinatorially when $J$ is linearly presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
