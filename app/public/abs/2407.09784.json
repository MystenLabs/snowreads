We prove that the solution remains close to the orbit of the soliton\nfor a large-time, if the initial data is close to the ground state solitons.\nThe proof uses the hyperbolic dynamics near ground state, which exhibits\nproperties of local structural stability of solutions with respect to the flows\nof the nonlocal nonlinear Schrodinger equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
