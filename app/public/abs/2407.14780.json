This solves the parabolic version of the\nBullett-Freiberger Conjecture from 2003 on mateability between rational maps\nand Hecke groups. The proof is in two steps. The first is the construction of a\npinched polynomial-like map which is a mating between a parabolic rational map\nand a parabolic circle map associated to the Hecke group. The second is lifting\nthis pinched polynomial-like map to an algebraic correspondence via a suitable\nbranched covering.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
