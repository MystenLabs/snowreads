However, confirming superconductivity in borophene\nexperimentally has been evasive to date, mainly due to the detrimental effects\nof metallic substrates and its susceptibility to oxidation. In this study, we\npresent an \\textit{ab initio} analysis of superconductivity in the\nexperimentally synthesized hydrogenated $\\beta_{12}$ borophene, which has been\nproven to be less prone to oxidation. Our findings demonstrate that\nhydrogenation significantly enhances both the stability and superconducting\nproperties of $\\beta_{12}$ borophene. Furthermore, we reveal that tensile\nstrain and hole doping, achievable through various experimental methods,\nsignificantly enhance the critical temperature, reaching up to 29 K. These\nfindings not only promote further fundamental research on superconducting\nborophene and its heterostructures, but also position hydrogenated borophene as\na versatile platform for low-dimensional superconducting electronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3QZXiSNametZ3xjSgvf00S6mjM1XcV8XPiVfaS_GNMQ","pdfSize":"12275082"}
