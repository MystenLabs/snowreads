A single information reconciliation setup can generate\nsecret keys up to a distance of 112 km. This enables a unified reconciliation\nsystem, thereby facilitating the commercialization of CV-QKD.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
