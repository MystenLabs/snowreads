By\nanalyzing the factors that influence the current state of the SDLC and how\nthose will change with AI we propose a new model of development. This white\npaper proposes the emergence of a fully AI-native SDLC, where AI is integrated\nseamlessly into every phase of development, from planning to deployment. We\nintroduce the V-Bounce model, an adaptation of the traditional V-model that\nincorporates AI from end to end. The V-Bounce model leverages AI to\ndramatically reduce time spent in implementation phases, shifting emphasis\ntowards requirements gathering, architecture design, and continuous validation.\nThis model redefines the role of humans from primary implementers to primarily\nvalidators and verifiers with AI acting as an implementation engine.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
