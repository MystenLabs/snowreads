An\nemerging field is inertial navigation for pedestrians, which relies only on\ninertial sensors for positioning. In this paper, we present inertial pedestrian\nnavigation models and learning approaches. Among these, are methods and\nalgorithms for shoe-mounted inertial sensors and pedestrian dead reckoning\n(PDR) with unconstrained inertial sensors. We also address three categories of\ndata-driven PDR strategies: activity-assisted, hybrid approaches, and\nlearning-based frameworks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
