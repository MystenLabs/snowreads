It is demonstrated that both the 1-point thermal ($T\\neq 0$)\nconformal blocks and the 4-point plane ($T=0$) conformal blocks are defined by\nthe same 4-point conformal integral. It is shown that up to power prefactors\nthe 1-point thermal conformal block is given by the fourth Appell function.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
