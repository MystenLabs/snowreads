We formulate a generalized trickle-down equation in the abstract\ncontext of linear-tilt localization schemes. Building on this generalization,\nwe improve the best-known results for several Markov chain mixing or sampling\nproblems -- for example, we improve the threshold up to which Glauber dynamics\nis known to mix rapidly in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass model. Other\napplications of our framework include improved mixing results for the Langevin\ndynamics in the $O(N)$ model, and near-linear time sampling algorithms for the\nantiferromagnetic and fixed-magnetization Ising models on expanders. For the\nlatter application, we use a new dynamics inspired by polarization, a technique\nfrom the theory of stable polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
