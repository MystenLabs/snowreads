In this paper, we\npropose a novel Business-Centric Network (BCN) aimed at enabling scalable QoS\nprovisioning, based on a cross-layer framework that captures the relationship\nbetween application, transport parameters, and channels. We investigate both\ncontinuous flow and event-driven flow models, presenting key QoS metrics such\nas throughput, delay, and reliability. By jointly considering power and\nbandwidth allocation, transmission parameters, and AP network topology across\nlayers, we optimize weighted resource efficiency with statistical QoS\nprovisioning. To address the coupling among parameters, we propose a novel deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) framework, which is Collaborative Optimization\namong Heterogeneous Actors with Experience Sharing (COHA-ES). Power and\nsub-channel (SC) Actors representing multiple APs are jointly optimized under\nthe unified guidance of a common critic. Additionally, we introduce a novel\nmultithreaded experience-sharing mechanism to accelerate training and enhance\nrewards. Extensive comparative experiments validate the effectiveness of our\nDRL framework in terms of convergence and efficiency. Moreover, comparative\nanalyses demonstrate the comprehensive advantages of the BCN structure in\nenhancing both spectral and energy efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
