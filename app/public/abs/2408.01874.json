However, on close inspection, one can show\nexisting adaptive trust-region methods have theoretical guarantees with\nseverely suboptimal dependence on problem properties such as the Lipschitz\nconstant of the Hessian. For example, TRACE developed by Curtis et al. obtains\na $O(\\Delta_f L^{3/2} \\epsilon^{-3/2}) + \\tilde{O}(1)$ iteration bound where\n$L$ is the Lipschitz constant of the Hessian. Compared with the optimal\n$O(\\Delta_f L^{1/2} \\epsilon^{-3/2})$ bound this is suboptimal with respect to\n$L$. We present the first adaptive trust-region method which circumvents this\nissue and requires at most $O( \\Delta_f L^{1/2} \\epsilon^{-3/2}) +\n\\tilde{O}(1)$ iterations to find an $\\epsilon$-approximate stationary point,\nmatching the optimal iteration bound up to an additive logarithmic term. Our\nmethod is a simple variant of a classic trust-region method and in our\nexperiments performs competitively with both ARC and a classical trust-region\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
