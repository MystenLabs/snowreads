As\none of the challenges in the crisis was the lack of empirical results and the\ntransfer of research results into practices, action research could address\nthese challenges. It is a methodology where collaboration and host\norganizations are the focus of knowledge discovery, development, and\ndocumentation. Although the method is often well received in industrial\ncontexts, it isn't easy to learn as it requires experience and varies from\norganization to organization. This chapter describes the pillars of action\nresearch as a methodology and how to teach them. The chapter includes examples\nof teaching action research at the bachelor, master, and PhD levels. In\naddition to theory, the chapter contains examples from practice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ocjfv3uPBauPEdVMepe4nOdRjJm6YRxXxuWe8tUMdDU","pdfSize":"952338"}
