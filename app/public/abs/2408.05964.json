We\npropose YOLO-EA, an innovative model that enhances safety measure detection by\nintegrating ECA into its backbone's convolutional layers, improving discernment\nof minuscule objects like hardhats. YOLO-EA further refines target recognition\nunder occlusion by replacing GIoU with EIoU loss. YOLO-EA's effectiveness was\nempirically substantiated using a dataset derived from real-world railway\nconstruction site surveillance footage. It outperforms YOLOv5, achieving 98.9%\nprecision and 94.7% recall, up 2.5% and 0.5% respectively, while maintaining\nreal-time performance at 70.774 fps. This highly efficient and precise YOLO-EA\nholds great promise for practical application in intricate construction\nscenarios, enforcing stringent safety compliance during complex railway\nconstruction projects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
