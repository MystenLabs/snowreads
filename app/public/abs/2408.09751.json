For the intermediate values\nof mass parameters multiplicity result holds. For the small mass parameter the\nuniqueness is guaranteed. Moreover, there is a threshold value of the mass,\nwhich can not be exceeded. It is achieved by considering the related dynamical\nsystem in the rescaled mass-density variables which is governed by the global\nLyapunov function with sink. Some preliminary extensions to nonlinear equation\nof state are discussed with numerical density profiles.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-DKKWuPXywHCPdXCsnxoUwEJR4qeOlrzrig-v6g_vGY","pdfSize":"757103"}
