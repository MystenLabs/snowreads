We find that the\npion quasiparticle, defined as the low-energy pole in the two-point function of\nthe axial charge, becomes lighter as the temperature increases and give an\nargument based on hydrodynamics as to why the pole becomes purely diffusive\nabove the chiral crossover. We study the thermal modification of the isovector\nvector spectral function using the Backus-Gilbert method, finding an\nenhancement at low energies and a depletion at energies around\n$1\\mathrm{GeV}$.The analogous study of the axial-vector channel reveals a\nlarger enhancement at energies below $1\\mathrm{GeV}$, and we show that these\nfindings are consistent with rigorous spectral sum rules. The difference\nbetween vector and axial-vector correlators, an order parameter for chiral\nsymmetry, turns out to be overall suppressed by more than an order of magnitude\nat the crossover.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dKCZQhPICYrL2uOwK0PtugC806KsBhcC60fDbqWscWs","pdfSize":"1807751"}
