We discuss the key role of the matter\ndensity parameter $\\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density\n$\\omega_c$. We argue that once $\\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density\n$\\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or\nType Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for\n$\\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ requires raising $\\omega_c$ and, under\nminimal assumptions, also the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify\nthat this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue\nthat a calibration of $\\Omega_m$ as reliable and model-independent as possible\nshould be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an interesting\npossibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster gas mass\nfraction measurements.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
