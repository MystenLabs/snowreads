After\nestablishing a definition for rootkits (making distinctions between rootkits\nand simple kernel-level applications) and defining metrics to evaluate such\nsoftware, we introduce four widespread kernel-level anti-cheat solutions. We\nlay out the inner workings of these types of software, assess them according to\nour previously established definitions, and discuss ethical considerations and\nthe possible privacy infringements introduced by such programs. Our analysis\nshows two of the four anti-cheat solutions exhibiting rootkit-like behaviour,\nthreatening the privacy and the integrity of the system. This paper thus\nprovides crucial insights for researchers and developers in the field of gaming\nsecurity and software engineering, highlighting the need for informed\ndevelopment practices that carefully consider the intersection of effective\nanti-cheat mechanisms and user privacy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
