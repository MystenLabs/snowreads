We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach using an off-the-shelf inductive logic\nprogramming (ILP) system on three challenging datasets. Our results show that\n(i) a relational representation can outperform a functional one, and (ii) an\noff-the-shelf ILP system with a relational encoding can outperform\ndomain-specific approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XmCHF358ATWf04WKwslzmd7h0E5G7JWOHzzjLnxsAdM","pdfSize":"481715"}
