Without requiring Hessian\ninformation, SPM evolves a single pair of spring-coupled particles on the\npotential energy surface. By cleverly designing complementary drifting and\nclimbing dynamics based on gradient decomposition, the spring pair converges\nonto the minimum energy path (MEP) and spontaneously aligns its orientation\nwith the MEP tangent, providing a reliable ascent direction for efficient\nconvergence to saddle points. SPM fundamentally differs from traditional\nsurface walking methods, which rely on the eigenvectors of Hessian that may\ndeviate from the MEP tangent, potentially leading to convergence failure or\nundesired saddle points. The efficiency of SPM for finding saddle points is\nverified by ample examples, including high-dimensional Lennard-Jones cluster\nrearrangement and the Landau energy functional involving quasicrystal phase\ntransitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
