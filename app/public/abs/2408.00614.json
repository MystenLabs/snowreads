We find a\nsignificantly reduced dipole amplitude compared to previous GMF models, and\ntrace the change to the accidental position of the peak of the extragalactic\nUHECR flux, which falls at the boundary of the strong flux de-magnification due\nto the GMF toward the central region of the Galaxy. This serendipitous\nsensitivity of UHECR anisotropies to the GMF model will be a powerful probe of\nthe source distribution as well as Galactic and extragalactic magnetic fields.\nDemagnification by the GMF also impacts visibility of some popular source\ncandidates.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"kOjsSM25FD5Ftg85egwY1RHJpWaena3mWudy5l4qlBI","pdfSize":"11594247","txDigest":"Dm5WMCUcnPUbdyCeR3mfTVGH2ka47XHEJibtiDfEYLfg","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
