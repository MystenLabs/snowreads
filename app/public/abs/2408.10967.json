We formulate this problem as a\nnonlinear integer programming problem and propose solution methodologies for\ndifferent regimes of this problem. First, we present a sequential\nrevenue-ordered policy and show that it is optimal when historical assortments\npositively affect customer utility. Second, we show that the problem is NP-hard\nunder the presence of a negative history-dependent effect (such as a satiation\neffect). In this case, we propose using a lifting-based framework to\nreformulate the problem as a mixed-integer exponential cone program that\nstate-of-the-art solvers can solve. Additionally, we identify an optimal cyclic\npolicy for an asymptotic regime, and we also relate its length to the\ncustomer's memory length. Finally, we present a case study using a catering\nservice dataset that shows that our model demonstrates good fitness and can\neffectively balance variety and revenue.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
