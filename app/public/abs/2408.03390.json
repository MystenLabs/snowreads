To develop this analysis further, we investigate the\ninter-atomic correlations to find features consistent with the formation of\nindividual superradiant domains. Moreover, we find that retardation can also\nresult in persistent oscillatory atomic dynamics accompanied by a periodic\nsequence of emission bursts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TvgbpHvblqe_1bl0hm2dcAvJi94fJ4c5W5Zzx3sM6zs","pdfSize":"5548641"}
