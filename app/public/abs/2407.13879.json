However,\nstate-of-the-art protocols are characterized by an intrinsic trade-off imposing\nto sacrifice either resolution or image acquisition speed. We address this\nlimitation by exploiting light intensity correlations, which are shown to\nenable overcoming the typical downsides of traditional hyperspectral imaging\ntechniques, both scanning and snapshot. The proposed approach also opens\npossibilities that are not otherwise achievable, such as sharper imaging and\nnatural filtering of broadband spectral components that would otherwise hide\nthe spectrum of interest. The enabled combination of high spatial and spectral\nresolution, high speed, and insensitivity to undesired spectral features shall\nlead to a paradigm change in hyperspectral imaging devices and open-up new\napplication scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
