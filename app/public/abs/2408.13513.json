The optical\nresponse of these resonators is determined by their fundamental resonances,\nknown as quasinormal modes (QNMs). Over the past decade, the electromagnetic\ntheory of QNMs has undergone significant development and has now reached a\nlevel of maturity that allows its reliable application to numerous contemporary\nelectromagnetic problems. In this review, we explore recent applications of QNM\ntheory for designing and understanding micro and nanoresonators. We highlight\nwhy QNMs provide deep physical insights and enhance computational efficiency in\nscenarios involving mode hybridization and perturbation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
