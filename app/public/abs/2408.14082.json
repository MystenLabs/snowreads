Here, we evaluate the potential of automatic speech\nrecognition (ASR) to transcribe Dutch aphasic speech and the ability of natural\nspeech features to detect aphasia. A picture-description task was administered\nand automatically transcribed in 62 persons with aphasia and 57 controls.\nAcoustic and linguistic features were semi-automatically extracted and provided\nas input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Our ASR model obtained a\nWER of 24.5%, outperforming earlier ASR models for aphasia. The SVM shows high\naccuracy (86.6%) at the individual level, with fluency features as most\ndominant to detect aphasia. ASR and semi-automatic feature extraction can thus\nfacilitate natural speech analysis in a time efficient manner in clinical\npractice.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7hzgdpy1jzxcKIE-1JVK9Kt8AdtkNhrP0gnZ3mfmhdQ","pdfSize":"562297"}
