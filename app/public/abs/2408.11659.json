Our\nCNN-based model is designed to detect Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH)\nsequences amidst various interference scenarios, leveraging the spatial and\ntemporal characteristics of PRACH signals to enhance detection accuracy and\nrobustness. Comprehensive datasets of simulated PRACH signals under controlled\ninterference conditions were generated to train and validate the model.\nExperimental results show that our CNN-based approach outperforms traditional\nPRACH detection methods in accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score. This study\ndemonstrates the potential of AI/ML techniques in advancing interference\nmanagement in 5G networks, providing a foundation for future research and\npractical applications in optimizing network performance and reliability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LzZW6ij5u8ulcEagFGci7H6XXINHwEXb2B__uPXLHBU","pdfSize":"1133164"}
