Although both enable parallel training, none enable parallel\ngeneration due to their autoregressiveness. We propose the variational SSM\n(VSSM), a variational autoencoder (VAE) where both the encoder and decoder are\nSSMs. Since sampling the latent variables and decoding them with the SSM can be\nparallelized, both training and generation can be conducted in parallel.\nMoreover, the decoder recurrence allows generation to be resumed without\nreprocessing the whole sequence. Finally, we propose the autoregressive VSSM\nthat can be conditioned on a partial realization of the sequence, as is common\nin language generation tasks. Interestingly, the autoregressive VSSM still\nenables parallel generation. We highlight on toy problems (MNIST, CIFAR) the\nempirical gains in speed-up and show that it competes with traditional models\nin terms of generation quality (Transformer, Mamba SSM).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SIPZAgydQOBoOs4GnDPnCHSrGo7EDjyZwCCbDqsP1Qs","pdfSize":"1437436","objectId":"0xac91bedc3db74098229749080cb55c5cceeaea347b38905cac22f4515dfc95b4","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
