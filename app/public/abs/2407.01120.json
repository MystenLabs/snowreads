For the first time, we extend the analysis to account for\nthe wavelength dependence introduced by the transmissivity of the optical\nwindow in front of the detector's active area. Our method involves measuring\nthe detector's response at different wavelengths and comparing it to a\ncalibrated reference detector. This allows us to accurately quantify the\nefficiency variations due to the optical window's transmissivity. The results\nprovide a comprehensive understanding of the wavelength-dependent efficiency,\nwhich is crucial for optimizing the performance of single-photon detectors in\nvarious applications, including quantum communication and photonics research.\nThis characterization technique offers a significant advancement in the\nprecision and reliability of single-photon detection efficiency measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vnpcapZlM170zsE-KFuQFTOBfjgQ_it8ntrOQelmLAQ","pdfSize":"691469"}
