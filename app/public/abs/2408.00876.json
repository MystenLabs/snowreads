Their primary application is\nin probabilistic modeling, where circuits with non-negative weights (monotone\ncircuits) can be used to represent and learn density/mass functions, with\ntractable marginal inference. Recently, it was proposed to instead represent\ndensities as the square of the circuit function (squared circuits); this allows\nthe use of negative weights while retaining tractability, and can be\nexponentially more compact than monotone circuits. Unfortunately, we show the\nreverse also holds, meaning that monotone circuits and squared circuits are\nincomparable in general. This raises the question of whether we can reconcile,\nand indeed improve upon the two modeling approaches. We answer in the positive\nby proposing InceptionPCs, a novel type of circuit that naturally encompasses\nboth monotone circuits and squared circuits as special cases, and employs\ncomplex parameters. Empirically, we validate that InceptionPCs can outperform\nboth monotone and squared circuits on image datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
