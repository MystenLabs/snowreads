The essence of this\nprotocol is a quantum feedback control with respect to the entangled ground\nstate of a quantum many-body system. To demonstrate the concept, we explore a\n(1+1)-dimensional chiral Dirac system and execute the protocol for the electric\ncurrent and charge. One of the most significant results is the creation of\nlong-range correlations across the system after applying control operations\nonly to one local site. Consequently but surprisingly, the induced charge\nsusceptibility fully reconstructs the phase diagram, despite the model\ninitially having no charge. Moreover, we find an activation of novel chiral\ndynamics induced by feedback control operations, which can be experimentally\nconfirmed using trapped ions and neutral atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
