Despite its long history,\nthe photon statistics of CL have only recently been examined, revealing\nunexpectedly large bunching of photons. Here we find that this peculiar photon\nbunching contains information of intervening excitation processes before the\nphoton emission, which can be extracted from the photon statistics within each\nexcitation event by a single free electron. Using this approach, we\nexperimentally unveiled the statistical differences of coherent CL involving a\nsingle electromagnetic interaction process and incoherent CL involving multiple\nexcitation processes. The developed formulation is universally applicable for\nparticle generation processes in general to investigate the nature of cascade\nreactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
