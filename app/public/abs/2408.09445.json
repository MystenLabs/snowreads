Nevertheless, experimental\nrealizations supporting this potential have thus far been lacking. Here, we\npresent a new level of control over a 1-milligram torsional pendulum,\ndemonstrating laser feedback cooling of its torsional motion from room\ntemperature to 240 microkelvins, establishing the coldest mechanical motion in\nthe microgram-to-kilogram mass window -- a factor of 25 beyond prior art. The\ndeveloped system shows a unique torque sensing capability, reaching\n$1.2\\times10^{-18}$ N$\\cdot$m/$\\sqrt{\\textrm{Hz}}$ thermal-noise-limited\nsensitivity -- a factor of 10 below the state of the art for the milligram\nscale. With readily feasible improvements in the pendulum suspension, a further\n100-fold reduction in both achievable temperatures and torque sensitivities is\nforeseen, pushing towards operation in the quantum regime at such large mass\nscales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
