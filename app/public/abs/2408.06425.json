This work\nintroduces a novel multiscale state-space model to explore the dynamic\ninterplay between systems interacting across different time scales, with\nfeedback between each scale. We propose a Bayesian learning framework to\nestimate unknown states by learning the unknown process noise covariances\nwithin this multiscale model. We develop a Particle Gibbs with Ancestor\nSampling (PGAS) algorithm for inference and demonstrate through simulations the\nefficacy of our approach.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D9QlULHO6klHMmP9Vt3ZxA1d3S7AOWzl4LqEj2m5XRg","pdfSize":"9216853"}
