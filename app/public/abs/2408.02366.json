With this fact, we also show that rational\nfunction semifields of tropical curves which do not consist of only one point\nhave Krull dimension two.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jAFY0IzxQj-GD3vmx7_HdLUTTN6cWNIasYB3cF4Yc40","pdfSize":"304636","txDigest":"MomnbzrcQjqccyFP1vj1qCNTkousdeAc9bNU8GEihvY","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
