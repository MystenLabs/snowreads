Both simulated\nand measured results verify that the hyper-lens designed with flexural metal\nplates can achieve super-resolution imaging for microwave at operating\nwavelength ({\\lambda}0=3cm) with a resolution of 0.25{\\lambda}0 and a uniform\nmagnification of about 5. Moreover, the designed hyper-lens ensures that both\nthe object and image surfaces are planes, and simultaneously provides a uniform\nmagnification for objects in different positions. Additionally, the proposed\nhyper-lens offers a broadband super-resolution imaging capabilities, achieving\ngood super-resolution imaging effects for microwave frequencies ranging from\n8.5 to 11 GHz. The proposed hyper-lens may find applications in high precision\nimaging, detection, and sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
