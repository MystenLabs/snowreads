More precisely, given a complex projective\nvariety X with log-canonical singularities, we give criteria for X to be\nisomorphic to a Baily-Borel-Mok compactification of a ball quotient, asking on\nthe one hand the equality case in a suitable Miyaoka-Yau (MY) inequality, and\non the other hand some adequate assumptions on the singularities. We also give\nas a result of independent interest that log-resolutions of log-canonical\nsingularities have their fibers connected by chains of special varieties in the\nsense of Campana; this is used in the proof to control the behaviour of the\nperiod map near the exceptional divisors of such resolutions. We also show that\nit is necessary to assume that the singularities are at least logcanonical:\nsome examples of Deligne-Mostow-Deraux can be manipulated to provide examples\nof singular varieties satisfying the equality case in MY, while not being\nisomorphic to such Baily-Borel-Mok compactifications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
