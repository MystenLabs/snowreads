We show that in any\nundominated mechanism, there is a quantity floor, which depends only on the\nprimitives, and the regulator's operation decision is stochastic only if the\nmonopolist produces at the quantity floor. We provide a near-complete\ncharacterization of the set of undominated mechanisms and use it to (a) provide\na foundation for deterministic mechanisms, (b) show that the efficient\nmechanism is dominated, and (c) derive a max-min optimal regulatory mechanism.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
