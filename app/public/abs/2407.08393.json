All identities are obtained\nin the setting of $L^p$ for all $p\\in (1,\\infty)$ without the real-valued\nfunction assumption. The obtained identities provide a simple and direct\nunderstanding of these inequalities as well as the nonexistence of nontrivial\nextremizers. As a byproduct, we show extended Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg type\ninequalities with remainder terms that imply a cylindrical extension of the\nclassical Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl uncertainty principle. Furthermore, we prove\n$L^p$-Hardy type identities with logarithmic weights that imply the critical\nHardy inequality in the special case. Lastly, we also discuss extensions of\nthese results on homogeneous Lie groups. Particular attention is paid to\nstratified Lie groups, where the functional inequalities become intricately\nintertwined with the properties of sub-Laplacians and related hypoelliptic\npartial differential equations. The obtained results already imply new insights\neven in the classical Euclidean setting with respect to the range of parameters\nand the arbitrariness of the choice of any homogeneous quasi-norm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
