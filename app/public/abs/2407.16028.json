In\nparticular, considering geometric decomposition of the Hilbert space, we study\nthis measure both in the vacuum state of a family of non-local scalar theories\nand also in the squeezed states of a local scalar theory. We also evaluate\nfield space capacity of entanglement between interacting scalar field theories.\nWe present both analytical and numerical evidences for the volume law scaling\nof this quantity in different setups and discuss how these results are\nconsistent with the behavior of other entanglement measures including Renyi\nentropies. Our study reveals some generic properties of the capacity of\nentanglement and the corresponding reduced density matrix in the specific\nregimes of the parameter space. Finally, by comparing entanglement entropy and\ncapacity of entanglement, we discuss some implications of our results on the\nexistence of consistent holographic duals for the models in question.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
