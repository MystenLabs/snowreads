It\nis natural to study the line bundles on such curves according to the splitting\ntype of their pushforward along projection maps $C \\to \\mathbb{P}^1$. Inspired\nby Wood's parameterization of ideal classes in rings associated to binary\nforms, we further refine the stratification of line bundles $L$ on $C$ by\nfixing the splitting types of both $L$ and $L(\\Delta)$, where $\\Delta \\subset\nC$ is the intersection of $C$ with the directrix of the Hirzebruch surface. Our\nmain theorem determines the dimensions of these locally closed strata and, if\nthe characteristic of the ground field is zero, proves that they are smooth.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MbhA3Biri_tX3SDefxl40AAOoU9IZwUQ87B7gCcFQLA","pdfSize":"415439"}
