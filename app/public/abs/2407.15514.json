A recently proposed\napproach (STACS 2024) towards obtaining a better understanding of this question\nis to consider the approximability of twin-width via fixed-parameter algorithms\nwhose running time depends not on twin-width itself, but rather on parameters\nwhich impose stronger restrictions on the input graph. The first step that\narticle made in this direction is to establish the fixed-parameter\napproximability of twin-width (with an additive error of 1) when the runtime\nparameter is the feedback edge number.\n  Here, we make several new steps in this research direction and obtain:\n  - An asymptotically tight bound between twin-width and the feedback edge\nnumber;\n  - A significantly improved fixed-parameter approximation algorithm for\ntwin-width under the same runtime parameter (i.e., the feedback edge number)\nwhich circumvents many of the technicalities of the original result and\nsimultaneously avoids its formerly non-elementary runtime dependency;\n  - An entirely new fixed-parameter approximation algorithm for twin-width when\nthe runtime parameter is the vertex integrity of the graph.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
