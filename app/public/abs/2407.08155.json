Murthy has proposed a convergent expansion of free partition\nfunctions and superconformal indices of finite-$N$ purely adjoint gauge\ntheories based on a Fredholm determinant expansion. This expansion has been\ndubbed the giant graviton expansion and takes the form of an infinite series of\ncorrections to the $N=\\infty$ result, with the $m^\\text{th}$ correction being\nof order $e^{-mN}$. We show that this expansion can be reproduced using\neigenvalue instantons in unitary matrix integrals. This perspective allows us\nto get the giant graviton expansion proposed by S. Murthy without the\nintermediate step of the Hubbard Stratonovich transformation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"nwP-gmytetmpL1A8dnvwBcORdmphUCIyu26m1eb6XLo","pdfSize":"575832"}
