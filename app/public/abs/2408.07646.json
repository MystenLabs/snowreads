In this article, we investigate these complexes\nspecifically for (rectangular) grid graphs, focusing on $2 \\times n$ and $3\n\\times n$ cases. We extend and refine the work of Bayer et al., proving and\nstrengthening several of their conjectures, thereby enhancing the understanding\nof these graph complexes' topological and combinatorial properties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
