However, transport across a solid solution between rock\nsalt and half-Heusler structures has not previously been studied. In this\npaper, we demonstrate the exceptional tolerance of Ni vacancies in ErNi$_x$Sb,\nresulting in a complete alloy in the ErSb-ErNiSb space. Thermoelectric\ncharacterization demonstrates a continuous electronic transition associated\nwith the gradual collapse of the band gap with Ni removal. The carrier\nconcentration increase by three orders of magnitude and Seebeck coefficient\ndecreases from 260 uV/K to <5 uV/K. Speed of sound measurements indicate that\nremoval of Ni softens the lattice, consistent with the breakdown of the\ncovalent Ni-Sb sublattice. For low Ni content compositions, the combination of\nlow speed of sound coupled with Ni vacancies strongly hamper the propagation of\nphonons. The ability to control the electronic and thermal transport properties\nacross the rock salt to half-Heusler continuum opens new material design\nstrategies across thermoelectricity, superconductivity, and non-trivial\ntopology\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
