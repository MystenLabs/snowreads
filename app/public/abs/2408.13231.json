This method replaces the integral representation of a\nshift-invariant kernel with a sum using a quadrature rule. The design of the\nlatter is meant to reduce the number of features required for high-precision\napproximation. Specifically, for the squared exponential kernel, one must\ndesign a quadrature rule that approximates the Gaussian measure on\n$\\mathbb{R}^d$. Previous efforts in this line of research have faced\ndifficulties in higher dimensions. We introduce a new family of quadrature\nrules that accurately approximate the Gaussian measure in higher dimensions by\nexploiting its isotropy. These rules are constructed as a tensor product of a\nradial quadrature rule and a spherical quadrature rule. Compared to previous\nwork, our approach leverages a thorough analysis of the approximation error,\nwhich suggests natural choices for both the radial and spherical components. We\ndemonstrate that this family of Fourier features yields improved approximation\nbounds.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fw5rNgzyXCqTqbp7oOzSRg2DgMCPNUOrVX8eQADd4AA","pdfSize":"5572576"}
