So far, the protocol has been limited to\ndiscrete or fermionic systems, whereas extensions to bosonic systems have been\nunclear for a long time due to challenges arising from the underlying\ninfinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In this work, we close this gap and\ndevelop an RB protocol for passive Gaussian transformations, which we call\nbosonic passive RB. The protocol is based on the recently developed filtered RB\nframework and is designed to isolate the multitude of exponential decays\narising for bosonic systems. We give explicit formulas and a Julia\nimplementation for the necessary post-processing of the experimental data. We\nalso analyze the sampling complexity of bosonic passive RB by deriving\nanalytical expressions for the variance. They show a mild scaling with the\nnumber of modes, suggesting that bosonic passive RB is experimentally feasible\nfor a moderate number of modes. We focus on experimental settings involving\nFock states and particle number resolving measurements, but also discuss\nGaussian settings, deriving first results for heterodyne measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
