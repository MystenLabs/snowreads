An enhanced level-repulsion\ncorresponds to increased OQSLs in random/integrable matrices. However, in\nmany-body systems, the dynamics is more intricate due to the tensor product\nstructure of the models. Initially, as the integrability-breaking parameter\nincreases, the OQSL also increases, suggesting that breaking integrability\nallows for faster evolution of the complexity operator. At larger values of\nintegrability-breaking, the OQSL decreases, suggesting a slowdown in the\noperator's evolution speed. Information-theoretic properties, such as\nscrambling, coherence and entanglement, of Krylov basis operators in many-body\nsystems, are also investigated. The scrambling behaviour of these operators\nexhibits distinct patterns in integrable and chaotic cases. For systems\nexhibiting chaotic dynamics, the Krylov basis operators remain a reliable\nmeasure of these properties of the time-evolved operator at late times.\nHowever, in integrable systems, the Krylov operator's ability to capture the\nentanglement dynamics is less effective, especially during late times.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
