The\nstate-of-the-art backscatter systems no longer require dedicated carrier\ngenerators and leverage ambient signals as carriers. However, there is an\nemerging challenge: most prior systems need dual receivers to capture the\noriginal and backscattered signals at the same time for tag data demodulation.\nThis is not conducive to the widespread deployment of backscatter\ncommunication. To address this problem, we present double-decker, a novel\nbackscatter system that only requires a single commercial device for\nbackscatter communication. The key technology of double-decker is to divide the\ncarrier OFDM symbols into two parts, which are pilot symbols and data symbols.\nPilot symbols can be used as reference signals for tag data demodulation, thus\ngetting rid of the dependence on the dual receiver structure. We have built an\nFPGA prototype and conducted extensive experiments. Empirical results show that\nwhen the excitation signal is 802.11g, double-decker achieves a tag data rate\nof 35.2kbps and a productive data rate of 38kbps, respectively. The\ncommunication range of double-decker is up to 28m in LOS deployment and 24m in\nNLOS deployment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
