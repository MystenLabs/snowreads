However, the availability of skilled medical\npersonnel in austere environments is often limited. Autonomous robotic\nultrasound systems can aid in needle insertion for medication delivery and\nsupport non-experts in such tasks. Despite advances in autonomous needle\ninsertion, inaccuracies in vessel segmentation predictions pose risks.\nUnderstanding the uncertainty of predictive models in ultrasound imaging is\ncrucial for assessing their reliability. We introduce MSU-Net, a novel\nmultistage approach for training an ensemble of U-Nets to yield accurate\nultrasound image segmentation maps. We demonstrate substantial improvements,\n18.1% over a single Monte Carlo U-Net, enhancing uncertainty evaluations, model\ntransparency, and trustworthiness. By highlighting areas of model certainty,\nMSU-Net can guide safe needle insertions, empowering non-experts to accomplish\nsuch tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
