This study focuses on the decay cascade\n$D^{+}\\to K^{*}_{J} \\ell^{+}\\nu \\to K^{\\pm}\\pi^{\\mp} \\ell^{+}\\nu$ where the\n$K^*_J$ resonance encompasses the $K^*(892),K^{*}(1410),K^{*}_0(1430)$ states.\nWe employ the helicity amplitude technique to derive the angular distributions\nfor the decay chain, enabling the extraction of one-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional distributions. Utilizing form factors for the $D\\to K^*$\ntransition derived from the quark model, we calculate the differential and\nintegrated partial decay widths, explicitly considering the electron and muon\nmasses.\n  Decay branching fractions are calculated, the ratios of the branching\nfractions are found to be $\\frac{\\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\\to K^{*}(892)(\\to K\n^{-}\\pi^{+}) \\, \\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})}{\\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\\to K^{*}(892)(\\to K\n^{-}\\pi^{+}) \\, e^{+}\\nu_{e})} = 0.975$, $\\frac{\\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\\to\nK^{*}(1410)(\\to K ^{-}\\pi^{+}) \\, \\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})}{\\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\\to\nK^{*}(1410)(\\to K ^{-}\\pi^{+}) \\, e^{+}\\nu_{e})} = 0.714$ and\n$\\frac{\\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\\to K^{*}_{0}(1430)(\\to K ^{+}\\pi^{-}) \\,\n\\mu^{+}\\nu_{\\mu})}{\\mathcal{B}r(D^{+}\\to K^{*}_{0}(1430)(\\to K ^{+}\\pi^{-}) \\,\ne^{+}\\nu_{e})} = 0.774$. Results in this work will serve a calibration for the\nstudy of $c \\to s $ in $D$ meson decays in future and provide useful\ninformation towards the understanding of the properties of the $K^{*}$ meson,\nas well as $K \\pi$ system.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
