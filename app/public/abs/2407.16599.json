We prove that this spectrum has some of the properties conjectured by\nHill, Hopkins, and Ravenel. Our main construction method is an\n$\\mathbb{Z}/p$-equivariant analog of the Brown-Peterson tower of $BP$, based on\na previous description of the $\\mathbb{Z}/p$-equivariant Steenrod algebra with\nconstant coefficients by the authors. We also describe several variants of our\nconstruction and comparisons with other known equivariant spectra.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
