These complex tasks require AI\nto continuously summarize and improve. Current research often overlooks the\nimportance of converting real-time task experiences into system memory and\ndifferentiating the value of existing knowledge for future reference. This\npaper addresses these issues by evolving external memory models into\nMemory-Loop Networks for timely memorization and experience referencing. We\nalso enhance a RAG mechanism with knowledge precision segmentation to utilize\nmemory based on value differentiation, and design the MaxMind model for SOTG\naccordingly.To demonstrate our approach, we developed MaxMind4Sheet, an\nelectronic spreadsheet processing system aligned with the MaxMind philosophy.\nComparative experiments with SheetCopilot have demonstrated that the\naccumulation and recycling of task memories lead to a steady enhancement in\ntask success rate, with an improvement rate of approximately 3%-6% per round in\nthis implementation example. Note that as the memories continue to grow, this\ncumulative improvement may be substantial. The inclusion of memory recycling\ncan also boost the system's task execution efficiency by up to 25%, and it can\naddress the retraining issue faced by LLMs when handling specialized tasks\nthrough memories transfer.These suggest that MaxMind has significant potential\nto enhance the capabilities and productivity of LLM systems in SOTG.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
