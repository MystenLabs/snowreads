This results in the mutual approach and\nreconnection of the vortices, leading to a cascaded decay into smaller and\nsmaller vortex loops. We study the Crow instability of quantum vortex lines in\na superfluid enjoying the anisotropic, long-ranged dipole-dipole interaction\nthrough mean-field simulations of the dynamics of the superfluid order\nparameter. We observe that both the strength and direction of the dipole-dipole\ninteraction play a crucial role in determining the Kelvin modes that are\ndynamically favoured. This is shown to be linked to effective enhancements or\nsuppressions of the vortices' curvature and can be explained by the effective\ndipole-dipole interaction between the vortex lines themselves. This paves the\nway to a deeper understanding of vortex reconnection dynamics, vortex loop\ncascading and turbulence in dipolar superfluids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
