As an application, we use the $\\pi$-quasi extension of\n$\\theta$ to construct a bijection from the set of $\\pi$-defect zero characters\nof $G/N$ onto the set of relative $\\pi$-defect zero characters of $G$ over\n$\\theta$. Our results generalize the related theorems of M. Murai and of G.\nNavarro.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
