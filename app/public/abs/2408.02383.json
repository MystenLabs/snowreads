A construction based on\nstabilizer codes offers an effective method for designing such protocols. By\nanalytically investigating the effective action of stabilizer protocols for\ncodes in arbitrary dimensions, we establish a standard form for the output\nstates of recurrent stabilizer-based distillation. This links the properties of\ninput states, stabilizers, and encodings to the properties of the protocol.\nBased on those insights, we present a novel two-copy distillation protocol,\napplicable to all bipartite states, that maximizes the fidelity increase per\niteration for Bell-diagonal states in any prime dimension. The power of this\nframework and the protocol is demonstrated through numerical investigations,\nwhich provide evidence of its superior performance in terms of efficiency and\ndistillability of low-fidelity states compared to other well-established\nrecurrence protocols. By elucidating the interplay between states, errors, and\nprotocols, our contribution advances the systematic development of highly\neffective distillation protocols across arbitrary dimensions, enhancing our\nunderstanding of distillability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
