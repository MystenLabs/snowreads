This criticality is\nconjectured to balance the expressivity and robustness of neural codes, because\na non-differential fractal manifold spoils coding reliability. However,\ncontrary to the conjecture, here we prove that the neural coding is not\ndegraded even on the non-differentiable fractal manifold, where the coding is\nextremely sensitive to perturbations. Rather, we show that the trade-off\nbetween energetic cost and information always makes this critical power-law\nresponse the optimal neural coding. Direct construction of a maximum likelihood\ndecoder of the power-law coding validates the theoretical prediction. By\nrevealing the non-trivial nature of high-dimensional coding, the theory\ndeveloped here will contribute to a deeper understanding of criticality and\npower laws in computation in biological and artificial neural networks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
