In the process, we also demonstrate the strong consistency of the\nweighted sample Fr\\'echet means and geometric medians. Stratification allows\nthese estimators to be utilized beyond the narrow constraints of a completely\nrandomized experiment. After constructing confidence intervals using\nbootstrapping, we outline how to use the proposed estimates to test Fisher's\nsharp null hypothesis that the absolute average or median treatment effect is\nzero. Empirical evidence for the strong consistency of the estimators and the\nreasonable asymptotic coverage of the confidence intervals is provided through\nsimulations in both randomized experiments and observational study settings. We\nalso apply our methods to real data from an observational study to investigate\nthe causal relationship between Alzheimer's disease and the shape of the corpus\ncallosum, rejecting the aforementioned null hypotheses in cases where\nconventional Euclidean methods fail to do so. Our proposed methods are more\ngenerally applicable than past studies in dealing with general metric spaces.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
