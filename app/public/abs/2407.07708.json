The aim of the optimizer\n(MAX-MIN) is to maximize the minimum mutual information between the transmitter\nand each receiver, under a sum-power constraint. The proposed optimization\nmethod do neither impose the transmitter to use superposition coding (SC) or\nany other linear precoding, nor to use successive interference cancellation\n(SIC) at the receiver. Instead, the approach designs a joint constellation,\noptimized such that its projection into the subspace of each receiver $k$,\nmaximizes the minimum mutual information $I(W_k;Y_k)$ between each transmitted\nbinary input $W_k$ and the output signal at the intended receiver $Y_k$. The\nrates obtained by our method are compared to those achieved with linear\nprecoders.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
