First, we establish a\ngeneralized Lagrangian representation of weak (in general measure-valued)\nsolutions, which includes and extends classical results on the Lagrangianity of\nweak solutions. Second, we construct nonlinear Markov processes which are\nuniquely determined by a selection of weak solutions from initial data in\n$L^1\\cap L^p$, $p \\geq 2$, and related spaces such as the classical and\nuniformly localized Yudovich space. It is well-known that for $p <\\infty$ weak\nsolutions are in general not unique, which renders a suitable selection\nnontrivial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
