While human-machine\ninterfaces with haptic modalities offer enhanced system performance, existing\ndatasets focus primarily on visual data, overlooking comprehensive haptic\ninformation. Previous haptic texture databases have recorded sound and\nacceleration signals, but often ignore the nuanced differences between\nprobe-texture and finger-texture interactions. Recognizing this shortcoming, we\npresent the Cluster Haptic Texture Database, a multimodal dataset that records\nvisual, auditory, and haptic signals from an artificial urethane rubber\nfingertip interacting with different textured surfaces. This database, designed\nto mimic the properties of the human finger, includes five velocity levels and\neight directional variations, providing a comprehensive study of tactile\ninteractions. Our evaluations reveal the effectiveness of classifiers trained\non this dataset in identifying surfaces, and the subtleties of estimating\nvelocity and direction for each surface.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
