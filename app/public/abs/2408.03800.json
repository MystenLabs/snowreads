Prior research has identified five dimensions of trust\nassessment in visualizations (credibility, clarity, reliability, familiarity,\nand confidence), and observed that these dimensions tend to vary predictably\nalong with certain features of the visualization being evaluated. This raises a\nfurther question: how do the design features driving viewers trust assessment\nvary with the characteristics of the viewers themselves? By reanalyzing data\nfrom these studies through the lens of individual differences, we build a more\ndetailed map of the relationships between design features, individual\ncharacteristics, and trust behaviors. In particular, we model the distinct\ncontributions of endogenous design features (such as visualization type, or the\nuse of color) and exogenous user characteristics (such as visualization\nliteracy), as well as the interactions between them. We then use these findings\nto make recommendations for individualized and adaptive visualization design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
