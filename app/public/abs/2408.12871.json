The dataset was created using an advanced Long Short-Term Memory\n(LSTM) model trained on a binary classification task to distinguish between\nAI-related and non-AI-related papers. The model was trained and validated on a\nvast dataset, achieving high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The\nresulting DeepDelveAI dataset comprises over 9.4 million AI-related papers\npublished since Dartmouth Conference, from 1956 to 2024, providing a crucial\nresource for analyzing trends, thematic developments, and the evolution of AI\nresearch across various disciplines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cYZsTmdBhUvJPcPRClW2SjZ1OVHXp7OxAEIQ7bksros","pdfSize":"1959986"}
