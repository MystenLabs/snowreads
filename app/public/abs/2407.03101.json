The new variant is not necessarily monotone, but this shortcoming\ncan be easily handled via refinement. Combined with a Dijkstra/Prim type\nalgorithm, this leads to a realization of the Fr\\'echet distance (i.e., a\nmorphing) that is locally optimal (aka locally correct), that is both easy to\ncompute, and in practice, takes near linear time on many inputs. The new\nmorphing has the property that the leash is always as short-as-possible. We\nimplemented the new algorithm, and developed various strategies to get a fast\nexecution in practice. Among our new contributions is a new simplification\nstrategy that is distance-sensitive, and enables us to compute the exact\ncontinuous Fr\\'echet distance in near linear time in practice. We preformed\nextensive experiments on our new algorithm, and released Julia and Python\npackages with these new implementations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
