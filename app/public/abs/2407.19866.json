Whilst state-of-the-art DL methods can\nsuccessfully address the task, to fully exploit their capabilities they often\nrequire training on a paired dataset, in an area where ground truth is seldom\navailable. In this work, we propose a method that combines a deep image prior\n(DIP) module that, without ground truth and in conjunction with a Bloch\nconsistency enforcing autoencoder, can tackle the problem, resulting in a\nmethod faster and of equivalent or better accuracy than DIP-MRF.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
