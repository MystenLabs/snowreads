This detection\nis achieved using quantum dot charge sensors, with its speed enhanced by\nhigh-speed RF reflectometry. Recently, real-time processing of data from RF\nreflectometry has attracted much attention to quantum information processing.\nIn this paper, we propose a sequential method based on Bayes' theorem for\nestimating the charge state and compare its performance with the averaging\napproach and threshold judgment. When the noise variance differs between the\nempty and occupied states, the Bayesian approach demonstrates a lower error\nscore, facilitating the extraction of more data points in real-time charge\nstate estimation. Additionally, the Bayesian approach outperforms the averaging\nmethod and threshold judgment in terms of error rates for charge state\nestimation, even during charge transitions. This technique is broadly\napplicable to single-electron detection and holds substantial utility for\nquantum bit readout and the operation of nanoprobes that utilize\nsingle-electron detection.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
