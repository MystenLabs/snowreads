We especially investigate the role of the synthesis error\nparameter, which characterizes the quality of the synthesis in quantum state\nsynthesis complexity classes. We first show that in the high synthesis error\nregime, collapse of synthesis classes implies collapse of the equivalent\ndecision classes. For more reasonable synthesis error, we then show a similar\nrelationships for BQP and QCMA. Finally, we show that for quantum state\nsynthesis classes it is in general impossible to improve the quality of the\nsynthesis: unlike the completeness and soundness parameters (which can be\nimproved via repetition), the synthesis error cannot be reduced, even with\narbitrary computational power.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
