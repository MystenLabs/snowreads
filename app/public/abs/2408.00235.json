By relaxing the representability conditions for\nmarginals to a set of local constraints, along with a global semidefinite\nconstraint, a polynomial-time solvable semidefinite program (SDP) that provides\na lower bound for the energy can be derived. In this paper, we propose\naccelerating the solution of such an SDP relaxation by imposing a hierarchical\nstructure on the positive semidefinite (PSD) primal and dual variables.\nFurthermore, these matrices can be updated efficiently using the algebra of the\ncompressed representations within an augmented Lagrangian method. We achieve\nquadratic and even near-linear time per-iteration complexity. Through\nexperimentation on the quantum transverse field Ising model, we showcase the\ncapability of our approach to provide a sufficiently accurate lower bound for\nthe exact ground-state energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
