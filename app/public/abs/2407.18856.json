Having chosen one among the space\nof stationarity constraints that define such flows we show how energy and\nmomentum relaxation are related in the presence of dissipation. Furthermore, we\nfind that if such a fluid obeys Onsager reciprocity then the incoherent\nconductivity must be identically zero and consequently makes no contribution to\nthe observable AC or DC charge conductivities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
