We then discuss the dual formulation of these problems and the\nassociated Sinkhorn solver. Finally, we explore how these new OPT problems\nrelate to classical optimal transport (OT) problems and introduce a linear\nprogramming solver tailored for these generalized scenarios.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
