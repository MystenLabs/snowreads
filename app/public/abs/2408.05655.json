NLP\nresearch in this area has typically focused on automating some part of it given\nthat it is not feasible to monitor all active discussions effectively. Past\nworks have focused on revealing deletion patterns with like sentiment analysis,\nor on developing platform-specific models such as Wikipedia policy or stance\ndetectors. Unsurprisingly, however, this valuable body of work is rather\nscattered, with little to no agreement with regards to e.g., the deletion\ndiscussions corpora used for training or the number of stance labels. Moreover,\nwhile efforts have been made to connect stance with rationales (e.g., to ground\na deletion decision on the relevant policy), there is little explanability work\nbeyond that. In this paper, we introduce a suite of experiments on Wikipedia\ndeletion discussions and wide-analyis (Wikipedia Deletion Analysis), a Python\npackage aimed at providing one click analysis to content moderation\ndiscussions. We release all assets associated with wide-analysis, including\ndata, models and the Python package, and a HuggingFace space with the goal to\naccelerate research on automating content moderation in Wikipedia and beyond.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
