The recent\nmatching-based methods tend to tackle this by building 2D-3D correspondences.\nIn this paper, we reveal the information loss inherent in these methods and\npropose a matching-free paradigm, named MaFreeI2P. Our key insight is to\nactively retrieve the camera pose in SE(3) space by contrasting the geometric\nfeatures between the point cloud and the query image. To achieve this, we first\nsample a set of candidate camera poses and construct their cost volume using\nthe cross-modal features. Superior to matching, cost volume can preserve more\ninformation and its feature similarity implicitly reflects the confidence level\nof the sampled poses. Afterwards, we employ a convolutional network to\nadaptively formulate a similarity assessment function, where the input cost\nvolume is further improved by filtering and pose-based weighting. Finally, we\nupdate the camera pose based on the similarity scores, and adopt a heuristic\nstrategy to iteratively shrink the pose sampling space for convergence. Our\nMaFreeI2P achieves a very competitive registration accuracy and recall on the\nKITTI-Odometry and Apollo-DaoxiangLake datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
