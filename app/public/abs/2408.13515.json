The\ntwo-dimensional (2D) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an attractive solid state\nplatform with a great potential for hosting bright quantum emitters with\nquantum memories with leveraging the potential of 2D materials for realizing\nscalable preparation of defect qubits. Although, room temperature bright defect\nqubits have been recently reported in hBN but their microscopic origin, the\nnature of the optical transition as well as the optically detected magnetic\nresonance (ODMR) have been remained elusive. Here we connect the variance in\nthe optical spectra, optical lifetimes and spectral stability of quantum\nemitters to donor-acceptor pairs (DAP) in hBN by means of ab initio\ncalculations. We find that DAPs can exhibit ODMR signal for the acceptor\ncounterpart of the defect pair with S=1/2 ground state at non-zero magnetic\nfields depending on the donor partner. The donor-acceptor pair model and its\ntransition mechanisms provide a recipe towards defect qubit identification and\nperformance optimization in hBN for quantum applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V829ANnI_wGxA35B5y53E3z1h_BiKiUfmaNTGRxuOgs","pdfSize":"1714374"}
