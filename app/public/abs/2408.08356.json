Through a second-order phase\ntransition, fermion - antifermion pairs condense and the system asymptotes\ntowards zero temperature and pressure. By the present era, the\nnon-relativistic, massive condensate decays slightly faster than in the\nstandard scenario -- a unique prediction that may be tested by combined\nmeasurements of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure. We\nalso show that in the case of massive fermions, the phase transition is\nfrustrated, and freeze-out instead leaves a residual, long-lived source of dark\nenergy.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CJOvT_mREn8V4eo69rlr9NFD7637X3xEFPcd0e7mvBI","pdfSize":"395524"}
