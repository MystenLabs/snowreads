In this contribution, the offline\ndata processing in the first JUNO Data Challenge (DC-1) is presented. The\nprimary goal of DC-1 is to process one week data using conditions database and\nmulti-threaded reconstruction. The workflow involves the production of\nsimulated data and reconstruction of the data. To achieve the goals, a\nJUNO-Hackathon has been organized. The software performance is measured and the\nresults are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZhDaZNrICRSaVrCxFEzlrVfyTyJscIU67jtL6A9y-Ew","pdfSize":"343124"}
