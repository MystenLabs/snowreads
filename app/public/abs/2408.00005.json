A comprehensive\nframework has been designed to survey, catalog, and curate available speech\ndatasets, which allows replicable evaluation of automatic speech recognition\n(ASR) systems. A case study focused on the Polish language was conducted; the\nframework was applied to curate more than 24 datasets and evaluate 25\ncombinations of ASR systems and models. This research constitutes the most\nextensive comparison to date of both commercial and free ASR systems for the\nPolish language. It draws insights from 600 system-model-test set evaluations,\nmarking a significant advancement in both scale and comprehensiveness. The\nresults of surveys and performance comparisons are available as interactive\ndashboards (https://huggingface.co/spaces/amu-cai/pl-asr-leaderboard) along\nwith curated datasets (https://huggingface.co/datasets/amu-cai/pl-asr-bigos-v2,\nhttps://huggingface.co/datasets/pelcra/pl-asr-pelcra-for-bigos) and the open\nchallenge call (https://poleval.pl/tasks/task3). Tools used for evaluation are\nopen-sourced (https://github.com/goodmike31/pl-asr-bigos-tools), facilitating\nreplication and adaptation for other languages, as well as continuous expansion\nwith new datasets and systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4a-ZOT-jUOYYccnOgJpE08CxBL6AMFWVbQukM9qPU2A","pdfSize":"944794","txDigest":"72LR2aac4tuZGGjqtZUpWaxPHRu7UE58k8caEcFhGRRR","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
