Error correction in measurement-based quantum computing schemes\nwill require the construction of cluster states in at least 3 dimensions. Here\nwe generate 1-, 2-, 3-, and 4-dimensional optical frequency-mode cluster states\nby sending broadband 2-mode vacuum-squeezed light through an electro-optical\nmodulator (EOM) driven with multiple frequencies. We create the squeezed light\nusing 4-wave mixing in Rb atomic vapor and mix the sideband frequencies\n(qumodes) using an EOM, as proposed by Zhu et al. (1), producing a pattern of\nentanglement correlations that constitute continuous-variable graph states\ncontaining up to several hundred qumodes. We verify the entanglement structure\nby using homodyne measurements to construct the covariance matrices and\nevaluate the nullifiers. This technique enables scaling of optical cluster\nstates to multiple dimensions without increasing loss.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uYpqAGvqiOeEefQPGd3hKTnDDsotaTVf4ZFTNGk-6Sc","pdfSize":"5991336"}
