In\nrecent years, partially observable function data have frequently appeared in\npractical applications and are the objectofan increasing interest by the\nliterature. In this thesis, we learn the concept of data integration depth of\npartially observable functions proposed by Elias et al. 2023, which can be used\nto measure the degree of data centralization. At the same time, we also studied\nthe trimmed-mean estimator method and consistency proof proposed by Fraiman and\nMuniz 2001 for completely observable functions. This method refers to the\nprocess of removing some of the smallest and largest values before calculating\nthe mean to enhance the robustness of the estimate. In this thesis, we\nintroduce the concept of trimmed-mean estimator for partially observable\nfunctions. We discuss several theoretical and practical issues, including the\nproof that the proposed trimmed-mean estimator converges almost surely and\nprovide a simulation study. The results show that our estimator performs better\nin terms of efficiency and robustness compared to the ordinary mean under\npartially observable functional data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
