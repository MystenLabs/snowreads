We propose to\nexplore this boundary in an optical Bell's experiment by recording the\ndistribution, of the number of strings of outcomes of a given parity\ninterrupted by outcomes of the other parity, as a function of their length. The\nfeatures of these distributions for small rotations of the angle settings near\ncritical points may indicate whether the underlying process is in-deterministic\nor not. Therefore, they may show that the boundary is discontinuous, or else,\nthat determinism decays smoothly. The conditions the experimental setup must\nfulfill are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
