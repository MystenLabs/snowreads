In this review, we summarize the current understanding of the\ninteriors and atmospheres of the giant planets in the solar system: Jupiter,\nSaturn, Uranus and Neptune. We describe the principles of interior structure\nand evolution models and discuss the link between the planetary atmospheres and\ndeep interiors. We summarize the current understanding of the bulk compositions\nand internal structures of the outer planets and the remaining future\nchallenges.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
