Given a set of targets and a set of\nbase stations on the plane, an opening cost function for every base station,\nthe opened base stations can emit mobile sensors with a radius of $r$ from base\nstation to cover the targets. The goal of MinMD$+$OCTC is to cover all the\ntargets and minimize the sum of the opening cost and the moving distance of\nmobile sensors. We give the optimal solution in polynomial time for the\nMinMD$+$OCTC problem with targets on a straight line, and present a 8.928\napproximation algorithm for a special case of the MinMD$+$OCTC problem with the\ntargets on the plane.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
