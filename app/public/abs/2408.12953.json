While machine learning models excel in\ncorrecting global degradation if the damage operator is known a priori, we show\nthat they fail to predict where the damage is even after supervised training;\nthus, reliable damage detection remains a challenge. We introduce DamBench, a\ndataset for damage detection in diverse analogue media, with over 11,000\nannotations covering 15 damage types across various subjects and media. We\nevaluate CNN, Transformer, and text-guided diffusion segmentation models,\nrevealing their limitations in generalising across media types.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
