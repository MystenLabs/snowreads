Despite the promising capabilities of various\nLLMs in conducting qualitative analysis, their use in the humanities and social\nsciences has not been thoroughly examined. This article contributes to the\nemerging literature on LLMs in qualitative analysis by documenting an\nexperimental study involving GPT-4. The study focuses on performing thematic\nanalysis (TA) using a YouTube dataset derived from an EU-funded project, which\nwas previously analyzed by other researchers. This dataset is about the\nrepresentation of Roma migrants in Sweden during 2016, a period marked by the\naftermath of the 2015 refugee crisis and preceding the Swedish national\nelections in 2017. Our study seeks to understand the potential of combining\nhuman intelligence with AI's scalability and efficiency, examining the\nadvantages and limitations of employing LLMs in qualitative research within the\nhumanities and social sciences. Additionally, we discuss future directions for\napplying LLMs in these fields.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bRobvLyuHOC0zRt84Q0I6QPMhyN8oMSBNtN1CBarleM","pdfSize":"410527"}
