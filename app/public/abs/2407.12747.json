Each lollipop was\nbuilt of five identical, tangent balls placed along a line and one larger ball\nat one side of the particle and modeled the RM734 molecule, for which\nferroelectric and splay nematics were recently discovered in the experiment.\nAlthough our model did not recreate these phases, we observed inherently polar\ntype A and C interdigitated smectics. Moreover, an intriguing, isotropic phase\nconsisting of double-twisted clusters joined by planar defects was formed for a\nmoderate packing fraction and ball diameters ratio.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TgE7ZtsonCy34mH1Xfg9CorNe8P6Q4trWgYxMOfhcYM","pdfSize":"7109606"}
