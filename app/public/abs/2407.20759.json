It is\ngenerally believed that when an even number of layers of the quantum spin Hall\ninsulators are stacked, the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase becomes unstable\ndue to $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ nature. While several researchers report counterexamples\nof the instability, there is no systematic understanding. In this work, we show\nthat the $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological phase is robust against the stacking if it\nhas an additional chiral symmetry, in terms of the level repulsion in the\ncorresponding non-Hermitian system. We demonstrate this by mapping a\none-dimensional class DIII superconductor with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology to the\ncorresponding non-Hermitian system in AII$^\\dagger$ with $\\mathbb{Z}_2$\npoint-gap topology.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"U4v2VEcW-x64DDLzpWO18k0BAaNOU3DdR9m2LQKaCNo","pdfSize":"1241866"}
