They are deployed\nin an ever-increasing number of applications, ranging from autonomous racing\nand search-and-rescue missions to industrial inspections and space exploration.\nTo achieve peak performance, certain tasks require pushing the robot to its\nmaximum agility. How can we design control algorithms that enhance the agility\nof autonomous robots and maintain robustness against unforeseen disturbances?\nThis paper addresses this question by leveraging fundamental principles in\noptimal control, reinforcement learning, and differentiable simulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
