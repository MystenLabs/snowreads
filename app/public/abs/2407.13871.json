The two pivotal tools which yield these\ncorrelation inequalities are that many discrete-time Markov chains, even under\na very general conditioning, satisfy the FKG inequality, and that such\ninequalities are preserved through weak convergences. In particular, we prove\nthat L\\'{e}vy processes, Bessel processes and several conditioned Brownian\nprocesses have positive correlations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
