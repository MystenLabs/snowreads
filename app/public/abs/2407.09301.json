The main point is that the\nestimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non\nkinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension\ndependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\\sqrt n)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Otr04TePuO87AGpyL4_E2dkkiRGFT5Ao26tDC08x9yQ","pdfSize":"246123","objectId":"0x8ab4f8f57af7177c6630106d594c6941ce06ff9bda213ea0f3a726f714d45cc9","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
