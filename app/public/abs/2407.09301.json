The main point is that the\nestimate improves significantly upon the corresponding bound for the non\nkinetic version of the algorithm, due to Dalalyan. In particular the dimension\ndependence drops from $O(n)$ to $O(\\sqrt n)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
