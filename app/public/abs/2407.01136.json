The two differ by higher-derivative terms which are negligible\nclassically but revive quantumly. An equivalence with the four-derivative\naction suggests that the Nambu-Goto string in four dimensions can be described\nby the (4,3) minimal model analogouslyly to the critical Ising model on a\ndynamical lattice. While critical indices are the same as in the usual\nLiouville theory, the domain of applicability becomes broader.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
