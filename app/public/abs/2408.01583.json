We show that a superconducting sphere levitated in\na quadrupolar magnetic field, when excited by a gravitational wave, will\nproduce magnetic field fluctuations that can be read out using a flux tunable\nmicrowave resonator. With a readout operating at the standard quantum limit,\nsuch a system could achieve broadband strain noise sensitivity of $h \\lesssim\n10^{-19}/\\sqrt{\\rm Hz}$ for frequencies of $10~\\mathrm{kHz}~-~1~\\mathrm{MHz}$,\nopening new corridors for astrophysical probes of new physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
