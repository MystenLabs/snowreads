Our calculation\nallows for an accurate description of jet observables crucial for the\noptimization of experimental analyses of vector boson scattering processes. We\nfind QCD corrections and parton-shower effects moderate in size for inclusive\nquantities and distributions of the tagging jets. A larger impact of these\ncorrections is observed for subleading jets.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
