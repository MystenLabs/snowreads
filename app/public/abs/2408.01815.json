However, creating parametric designs\nin programming-based CAD presents significant challenges. Users define models\nin a code editor using a programming language, with the application generating\na visual representation in a viewport. This process involves complex\nprogramming and arithmetic expressions to describe geometric properties,\nlinking various object properties to create parametric designs. Unfortunately,\nthese applications lack assistance, making the process unnecessarily demanding.\nWe propose a solution that allows users to retrieve parametric expressions from\nthe visual representation for reuse in the code, streamlining the design\nprocess. We demonstrated this concept through a proof-of-concept implemented in\nthe programming-based CAD application, OpenSCAD, and conducted an experiment\nwith 11 users. Our findings suggest that this solution could significantly\nreduce design errors, improve interactivity and engagement in the design\nprocess, and lower the entry barrier for newcomers by reducing the mathematical\nskills typically required in programming-based CAD applications\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L4GDjTg3iZRXyr6_3DPy2dIujwNpCbMGqb8XPWCLF8Q","pdfSize":"5287289"}
