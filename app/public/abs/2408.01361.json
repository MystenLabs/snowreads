It implements among\nother options the High-Accuracy Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamics (HARM)\nscheme, but is written from scratch in C++ with the Kokkos programming model in\norder to run efficiently on both CPUs and GPUs. In addition to being fast,\nKHARMA is written to be readable, modular, and extensible, separating\nfunctionality into \"packages,\" representing, e.g., algorithmic components or\nphysics extensions. Components of the core ideal GRMHD scheme can be swapped at\nruntime, and additional packages are included to simulate electron temperature\nevolution, viscous hydrodynamics, and for designing chained multi-scale\n\"bridged\" simulations. This chapter presents the computational environment and\nrequirements for KHARMA, features and design which meet these requirements, and\nfinally, validation and performance data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
