In this Letter, by employing density\nfunctional theory calculations and dynamic simulations of atomic spin model, we\nstudy the key role of interfacial Dzyaloshinshii-Moriya interaction (DMI) in\nCrI$_3$-In$_2$Se$_3$ vdW heterostructures. Our work demonstrates feasible DMI\ntorques pumped by ferroelectric switching, which can drive current-free and\nlow-energy consumption domain wall motion. Moreover, such interfacial DMI can\nalso significantly enlarge the Walker field in magnetic field-driven domain\nwall technique.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
