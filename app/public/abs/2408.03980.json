The upper limits of the branching fraction for\n$D_s^+\\to\\gamma\\rho(770)^+$ is set to be $\\mathcal{B}(D^+_s\\to\n\\gamma\\rho(770)^+) < 6.1\\times$10$^{-4}$. The branching fraction of\n$D_s^+\\to\\gamma\\rho(770)^+$ is measured to be $(2.2\\pm0.9_{\\rm\nstat.}\\pm0.2_{\\rm syst.})\\times10^{-4}$, corresponding to an upper limit of\n$6.1\\times$10$^{-4}$ at the $90\\%$ confidence level.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
