However, the issue has not yet been fully acknowledged within\nthe existing time allocation models, potentially resulting in inaccuracies in\nvaluing travel time savings. Therefore this study is aimed at addressing this\ngap by investigating the potential impact of introducing time sharing within\nsuch a framework, as well as factors determining it as represented by travel\nactivities. In doing so, time constraint in the time allocation model of Small\nwas modified to enable sharing the same time interval between different\nactivities. The resulting expression indicated that such an augmentation could\nlead to lower estimates of value of time as a resource. On the other hand,\nempirical research based on the data from the National Passenger Survey 2004\nused for calibrating cross-nested logit model indicated a number of factors\naffecting the choice of travel activities. It was discovered that significant\ninclude possession of equipment allowing particular activities, e.g. newspaper,\npaperwork or ICT devices, companionship, gender, length of the journey,\nfrequency of using the service, possibility of working on the train, journey\nplanning in advance, first class travel, termination of the trip in central\nLondon, peak-time travel and availability of seating.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
