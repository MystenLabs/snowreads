From the\nrelativistic transport equation of kinetic theory, the full expressions of\nhydrodynamic viscous fluxes have been derived which turn out to include all\norders of out-of-equilibrium derivative corrections. It has been shown, that\nfor maintaining causality, it is imperative that the temporal derivatives must\ninclude all orders, which can be resummed in non-local, relaxation\noperator-like forms and finally `integrated in' introducing newer degrees of\nfreedom. The theory can of course be truncated at any higher spatial orders,\nbut the power over the the infinite temporal sum increases correspondingly such\nthat the causality is respected. As a result, the theory truncated at any\nhigher order of spatial gradient, requires newer degrees of freedom for each\nincreasing order.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ekWSJ49_8SCGr24vuFO5-SYCDIIEZvmg1C3yyYQUIkk","pdfSize":"114727"}
