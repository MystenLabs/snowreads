These applications fall into three categories: (i) analogues\nof these statements to distance $2$ versions of the pattern, (ii) reduction of\nthese statements to relative versions, and (iii) reductions of these statements\nto a quasirandom case with respect to some quantities that affect the number of\nrealisations of the pattern.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rcSCOqj5urlzsQRYrV9LKdOzT00TSXKcm91jkHMyAdw","pdfSize":"286584"}
