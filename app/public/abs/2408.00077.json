To date, it is performed via classical optimization strategies. We\nintroduce a class of quantum algorithms to perform compilation via quantum\ncomputers, paving the way for a quantum advantage in compilation. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of this approach via Quantum and Simulated\nAnnealing-based compilation: we successfully compile a Trotterized Hamiltonian\nsimulation with up to 64 qubits and 64 time-steps and a Quantum Fourier\nTransform with up to 40 qubits and 771 time steps. We show that, for a\ntranslationally invariant circuit, the compilation results in a fidelity gain\nthat grows extensively in the size of the input circuit, outperforming any\nlocal or quasi-local compilation approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
