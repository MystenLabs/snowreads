However,\nlarge-scale reconstruction using NeRF requires a substantial amount of aerial\nimagery for training, making it impractical in resource-constrained\nenvironments. This paper introduces an innovative incremental optimal view\nselection framework, IOVS4NeRF, designed to model a 3D scene within a\nrestricted input budget. Specifically, our approach involves adding the\nexisting training set with newly acquired samples, guided by a computed novel\nhybrid uncertainty of candidate views, which integrates rendering uncertainty\nand positional uncertainty. By selecting views that offer the highest\ninformation gain, the quality of novel view synthesis can be enhanced with\nminimal additional resources. Comprehensive experiments substantiate the\nefficiency of our model in realistic scenes, outperforming baselines and\nsimilar prior works, particularly under conditions of sparse training data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
