While some studies focus on the monitoring of a single species, such as\na particular endangered species, others monitor larger functional groups, such\nas predators. In our study, we used camera trap images collected in\nnorth-western New South Wales, Australia, to investigate how model results were\naffected by combining multiple species in single classes, and whether the\naddition of negative samples can improve model performance. We found that\nspecies that benefited the most from merging into a single class were mainly\nspecies that look alike morphologically, i.e. macropods. Whereas species that\nlooked distinctively different gave mixed results when merged, e.g. merging\npigs and goats together as non-native large mammals. We also found that adding\nnegative samples improved model performance marginally in most instances, and\nrecommend conducting a more comprehensive study to explore whether the marginal\ngains were random or consistent. We suggest that practitioners could classify\nmorphologically similar species together as a functional group or higher\ntaxonomic group to draw ecological inferences. Nevertheless, whether to merge\nclasses or not will depend on the ecological question to be explored.\n","versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 6 May 2024 04:50:55 GMT"}],"update_date":"2024-07-02","authors_parsed":[["Tam","Jess",""],["Kay","Justin",""]]}
