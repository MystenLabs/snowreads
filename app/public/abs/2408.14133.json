Our study includes predictions for both the integrated\ncross-section and the transverse momentum ($p_T$) distribution of $h_c$ ($h_b$)\nproduction at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), using the decay process $h_c\n(h_b) \\rightarrow \\eta_c (\\eta_b) + \\gamma$, $\\eta_c (\\eta_b) \\rightarrow p\n\\overline{p}$. We demonstrate substaintial discrepancies in integrated\ncross-section and the $p_T$ distribution of ${}^1P_1$ quarkonia production at\nthe LHC using Colour-Singlet Model (CSM), NRQCD and modified NRQCD. Measuring\nthese resonances at the LHC could discriminate between these models, thereby\noffering further insights into the dynamics of quarkonium production.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
