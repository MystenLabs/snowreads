Our sample of 58 lens galaxies covers\na redshift range of $0.090\\leq z_{\\rm l}\\leq0.884$. By combining new Hubble\nSpace Telescope imaging with previously observed velocity dispersion and\nline-of-sight measurements, we decompose the luminous matter profile from the\ndark matter profile and perform a Bayesian hierarchical analysis to constrain\nthe population-level properties of both profiles. We find that the inner slope\nof the dark matter density profile (\"cusp\"; $\\rho_{\\rm DM}\\propto\nr^{-\\gamma_{\\rm in}}$) is slightly steeper ($\\mu_{\\gamma_{\\rm\nin}}=1.18^{+0.03}_{-0.03}$ at $z=0.35$ with $\\leq0.16$ intrinsic scatter) than\na standard Navarro$-$Frenk$-$White (NFW; $\\gamma_{\\rm in}=1$), with an\nappreciable evolution with redshift ($d\\log(\\gamma_{\\rm in})/dz=-0.33\\pm0.13$)\nand is consistent with NFW-like distributions at higher redshifts ($z\\geq0.56$\nfor $\\leq1\\sigma$ consistency). Additionally, we find the stellar mass-to-light\nratio at the population level consistent with that of a Salpeter initial mass\nfunction, a small stellar mass-to-light gradient ($\\kappa_{*}(r)\\propto\nr^{-\\eta}$, with $\\overline{\\eta}\\leq9.4\\times10^{-3}$), and isotropic stellar\norbits. Our averaged total mass density profile is consistent with a power-law\nprofile within $0.25-4$ Einstein radii ($\\overline{\\gamma}=2.14\\pm0.06$), with\nan internal mass-sheet transformation parameter\n$\\overline{\\lambda}=1.02\\pm0.01$ consistent with no mass sheet. Our findings\nconfirm the validity of the standard mass models used for time-delay\ncosmography. However, our results are in strong tension with predictions from\nhydrodynamical simulations such as IllustrisTNG, highlighting the need to\nbetter understand the formation of massive galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0mt0xRSgXviFG1ag9xDT3QWAQTYXR7nIqS-YNWCg7LU","pdfSize":"17930589"}
