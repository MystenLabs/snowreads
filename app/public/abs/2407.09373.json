Early\nWarning Scores (EWS) are widely deployed to measure overall health status, and\nrisk of adverse outcomes, in hospital patients. However, current EWS are\nlimited both by their lack of personalisation and use of static observations.\nWe propose a pipeline that groups intensive care unit patients by the\ntrajectories of observations data throughout their stay as a basis for the\ndevelopment of personalised risk predictions. Feature importance is considered\nto provide model explainability. Using the MIMIC-IV dataset, six clusters were\nidentified, capturing differences in disease codes, observations, lengths of\nadmissions and outcomes. Applying the pipeline to data from just the first four\nhours of each ICU stay assigns the majority of patients to the same cluster as\nwhen the entire stay duration is considered. In-hospital mortality prediction\nmodels trained on individual clusters had higher F1 score performance in five\nof the six clusters when compared against the unclustered patient cohort. The\npipeline could form the basis of a clinical decision support tool, working to\nimprove the clinical characterisation of risk groups and the early detection of\npatient deterioration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
