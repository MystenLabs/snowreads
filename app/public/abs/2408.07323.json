While linear and nonlinear $\\pi$ modes were observed in conservative\nsystems, they have never been studied in nonlinear regime in the non-Hermitian\nsystems with structured gain and losses. Here we show that SSH waveguide array\nwith periodically oscillating waveguide positions in propagation direction and\nwith parity-time symmetric refractive index landscape, can support $\\pi$ modes\nthat are damped or amplified at different ends of the array. By including\nnonlinearity and nonlinear absorption into our continuous system, we achieve\nstable lasing in $\\pi$ mode at one end of the array. The representative feature\nof this system is that lasing in it is thresholdless and it occurs even at low\ngain-loss amplitudes. The degree of localization of lasing $\\pi$ modes can be\nflexibly controlled by the amplitude of transverse waveguide oscillations. This\nwork therefore introduces a new type of topological Floquet laser and a route\nto manipulation of $\\pi$ modes by structured gain and losses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
