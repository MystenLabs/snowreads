We show that, up to some error\nterm, the infinite-dimensional inf(sup)-convolution of the finite-dimensional\nvalue function yields a super (sub)-viscosity solution to the PDEs on\nWasserstein space. Hence, we obtain a convergence rate using a comparison\nprinciple of such PDEs on Wasserstein space. Our argument is purely analytic\nand relies on the regularity of value functions established in \\cite{DaJaSe23}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
