This\nextends previous work of Einsiedler, Margulis and Venkatesh. The main new\nfeature is that we allow for periodic orbits of semisimple groups with\nnontrivial centralizer in the ambient group. Our proof uses crucially an\neffective closing lemma from work with Lindenstrauss, Margulis, Mohammadi, and\nShah.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
