The first solution\nintroduces a black hole with a variable equation of state, \\( P=k(r)\\rho \\),\nthat can represent both singular and regular black holes based on parameters \\(\nM_0 \\) and \\( w_0 \\). The second solution features a black hole with Hagedorn\nfluid, relevant for the late stages of black hole formation, and reveals\nsimilarities to the first solution, describing both singular and regular black\nholes in a specific case. Furthermore, we investigate the shadow cast by these\nblack hole solutions to constrain their parameters. Recognizing that real\nastrophysical black holes are dynamic, we developed a third, dynamical solution\nthat addresses gravitational collapse and suggests the potential formation of\nnaked singularities, indicating that a black hole can transition from regular\nto singular and back to regular during its evolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xcf2_54yL_x2ZxQIKRjB97no1ueBucPObZEOU8PHRbY","pdfSize":"482950"}
