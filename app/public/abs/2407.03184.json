We show that the set of pressure functions for Anosov\ndiffeomorphisms with respect to the geometric potential is equal to the set of\npressure functions for the linear Anosov automorphism with respect to\nH\\\"{o}lder potentials. We use this result to provide a negative answer to the\n$C^{1+\\alpha}$ version of the question posed by Rodriguez Hertz on whether two\nhomotopic area preserving $C^\\infty$ Anosov difeomorphisms whose geometric\npotentials have identical pressure functions must be $C^\\infty$ conjugate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
