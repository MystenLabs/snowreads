The\nnew ones are defined for each proper subset $I \\subsetneq S$ and called\nstrongly $I$-regular hyperbolic automorphisms of $\\Delta$. Generalizing\nprevious results, we show that such elements exist in any group $G$ acting\ncocompactly and by automorphisms on $\\Delta$. Although the dynamics of strongly\n$I$-regular hyperbolic elements $\\gamma$ on the spherical building\n$\\partial_\\infty \\Delta$ of $\\Delta$ is much more complicated than for the\nstrongly regular ones, the $\\lim\\limits_{n\\to \\infty} \\gamma^{n}(\\xi)$ still\nexists in $\\partial_\\infty \\Delta$ for ideal points $\\xi \\in \\partial_\\infty\n\\Delta$ that satisfy certain assumptions. An important role in this business is\nplayed by the cone topology on $\\Delta \\cup \\partial_\\infty \\Delta$ and the\nprojection of specific residues of $\\partial_\\infty \\Delta$ on the ideal\nboundary of $Min(\\gamma)$.\n  All the above research is performed in order to achieve the second, and main,\ngoal of the article. Namely, we prove that for closed groups $G$ with a\ntype-preserving and strongly transitive action by automorphisms on $\\Delta$,\nthe Chabauty limits of certain closed subgroups of $G$ contain as a normal\nsubgroup the entire unipotent radical of concrete parabolic subgroups of $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jZ5GkesLb5IXkY3Ers7200HpuT9qlQV4sNu360ziV-w","pdfSize":"341397"}
