Earlier efforts using a\nquantum annealer were impeded by the limitations of the present quantum\nresource and its capability to implement high order interaction terms, which\nfor an $M$-order matrix will grow by O(M^2). In this paper, we propose a novel\nqubit-efficient method by implementing the Hadamard matrix searching algorithm\non a universal quantum computer. We achieve this by employing the Quantum\nApproximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). Since high order interaction terms\nthat are implemented on a gate-based quantum computer do not need ancillary\nqubits, the proposed method reduces the required number of qubits into O(M). We\npresent the formulation of the method, construction of corresponding quantum\ncircuits, and experiment results in both a quantum simulator and a real\ngate-based quantum computer. The experiments successfully found the\nBaumert-Hall type Hadamard matrices up to 132. These results motivate further\nefforts to discover previously unknown Hadamard matrices and a prospect to\nultimately demonstrate practical quantum advantages\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"2sQvAzVNlir99ijAPfrRFj4yAEyDJ7Jn38KYSzobUp8","pdfSize":"1442091"}
