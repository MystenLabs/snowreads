However, at present, many large airports have\nthe phenomenon of low taxi load rate, unbalanced income and long waiting time\nfor passengers. Therefore, how can drivers make decisions to maximize their\nbenefits, and how can management departments allocate resources and formulate\nmanagement systems to improve ride efficiency and balance drivers' benefits\nhave become urgent problems to be solved. This paper solves the above problems\nby establishing the taxi driver dual-sensitive decision model, the longitudinal\ntaxi queuing model and the short-distance passenger re-return forced M/M/1\nqueuing model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
