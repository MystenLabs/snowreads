We showcase these techniques for a system consisting of two\nfixed-frequency transmon qubits connected by a flux-tunable transmon coupler.\nThere, we find three types of parameter regions with zero or near-zero ZZ\ncoupling, all of which are accessible with current technology. We furthermore\nfind regions of strong ZZ coupling nearby, which may be used to implement\nadiabatic controlled-phase gates. Our methods are applicable to many types of\nqubits and open up for the design of large-scale quantum computers with\nimproved gate fidelities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
