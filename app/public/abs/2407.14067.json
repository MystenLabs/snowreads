Using the\nclassical Koopman operator that evolves functions on phase space, 4 classical\nKoopman channels are identified that are analogs of the 4 possible quantum\nchannels in a bipartite setting. Thus when the complete evolution has a\nquantum-classical correspondence the correspondence at the level of the\nsubunitary channels can be studied. The channels, both classical and quantum\ncan be interpreted as noisy single particle systems. Having parallel classical\nand quantum operators gives us new access to study fine details of these major\nlimiting theories. Using a coupled kicked rotor as a generic example, we\ncontrast and compare spectra of the quantum and classical channel. The largest\nnontrivial mode of the quantum channel is seen to be mostly determined by the\nstable parts of the classical phase space, even those that are surprisingly\nsmall in relation to the scale of an effective $\\hbar$. In the case when the\ndynamics has a significant fraction of chaos the spectrum has a prominent\nannular density that is approximately described by the single-ring theorem of\nrandom matrix theory, and the ring shrinks in size when the classical limit is\napproached. However, the eigenvalues and modes that survive the classical limit\nseem to be either scarred by unstable manifolds or, if they exist, stable\nperiodic orbits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
