One application is to\ndetermine the volume parameter in conformal field moduli spaces for K3\nsurfaces. Other applications involve simple Dynkin diagram manipulations\ninducing \"going up and down\" between symmetric spaces by adding parameters and\ngoing to limits respectively. For supersymmetries such as N=6, this involves\ncombinatorics of less familiar \"restricted\" Dynkin diagrams.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
