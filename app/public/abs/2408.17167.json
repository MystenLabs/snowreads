To address this issue, this study employs a multifunctional organic\nmolecule, curcumin, to modify the interface between SnO2 and the perovskite\nlayer. The functional groups on curcumin effectively passivate the defects on\nboth sides of the interface, reducing -OH and oxygen vacancy defects on the\nSnO2 surface and passivating uncoordinated Pb2+ in the perovskite layer. This\nresults in a more compatible energy level alignment and lower defect density at\nthe interface, enhancing carrier transport across it. Consequently, the devices\nbased on curcumin achieve an impressive champion power conversion efficiency\n(PCE) of 24.46%, compared to 22.03% for control devices. This work demonstrates\na simple, green, hydrophobic, and efficient molecular modification method for\nthe buried interface, laying the foundation for the development of\nhigh-performance and stable perovskite solar cells.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
