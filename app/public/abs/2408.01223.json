The\ntype of charge carrier (electron or hole) is an important factor for\ndetermining the pumping accuracy, but it has been so far compared just using\ndifferent devices that could have different potential landscapes. Here, we\nreport measurements of a silicon ambipolar single-charge pump. It allows a\ncomparison between the single-electron and single-hole pumps that share the\nentrance tunnel barrier, which is a critical part of the pumping operation. By\nchanging the frequency and temperature, we reveal that the entrance barrier has\na better energy selectivity in the single-hole pumping, leading to a pumping\nerror rate better than that in the single-electron pumping up to 400 MHz. This\nresult implies that the heavy effective mass of holes is related to the\nsuperior characteristics in the single-hole pumping, which would be an\nimportant finding for stably realizing accurate single-charge pumping\noperation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
