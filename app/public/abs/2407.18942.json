Under the conditions that there exists a\ncoefficient which dominates the other coefficients by its lower $% (\\alpha\n,\\beta ,\\gamma )$-order and lower $(\\alpha ,\\beta ,\\gamma )$-type, we obtain\nsome growth and oscillation properties of solutions of such equations which\nimprove and extend some recently results of the author and Biswas \\cite{b8}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
