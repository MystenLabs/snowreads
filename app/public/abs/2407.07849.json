We compute the scaling limit of a particular non-local correlation\nfunction, essentially equivalent to the partition function for the domino\ntilings of a pentagon-shaped domain, obtained by cutting away a triangular\nregion from a corner of the initial Aztec diamond. We observe a third-order\nphase transition when the geometric parameters of the obtained pentagonal\ndomain are tuned to have the fifth side exactly tangent to the arctic ellipse\nof the corresponding initial model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
