This selection\nprocess is performed in a supervised manner (using both dynamical and\nstructural data) and an unsupervised manner (using only structural data). We\nthen apply the selected features to predict future dynamics using a machine\nlearning technique. Finally, we discuss the potential applications of this\napproach in identifying the dominant mechanisms governing the glassy slow\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
