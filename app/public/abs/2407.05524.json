By using the non-relativistic spherical\nHartree-Fock calculation with a realistic tensor force, we show that the tensor\nforce may be deeply relevant to the $Z$- and $N$-dependence of the PSS. While\nthe PSS has often been discussed in the context of the relativistic symmetry,\nthe tensor-force effects on the PSS sometimes look analogous to the $Z$-and\n$N$-dependence of the PSS in the relativistic mean-field (RMF) calculations\nwithout explicit tensor force. The observed variation of the\n$p0d_{3/2}$-$p1s_{1/2}$ levels from $^{40}$Ca to $^{34}$Si is consistent with\nthe tensor-force-driven $Z$-dependence of the PSS, but not necessarily with the\nRMF result. Even though it is too early to be conclusive, this result\nelucidates the significance of the tensor force when discussing the PSS.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
