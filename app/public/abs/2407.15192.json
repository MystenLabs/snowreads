However, such work assumes the existence of such constraints\na-priori. In this paper, we relax this strong assumption and present an\napproach based on Error Detection Rules (EDR) that allow for learning\nexplainable rules about the failure modes of machine learning models. We show\nthat these rules are not only effective in detecting when a machine learning\nclassifier has made an error but also can be leveraged as constraints for HMC,\nthereby allowing the recovery of explainable constraints even if they are not\nprovided. We show that our approach is effective in detecting machine learning\nerrors and recovering constraints, is noise tolerant, and can function as a\nsource of knowledge for neurosymbolic models on multiple datasets, including a\nnewly introduced military vehicle recognition dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
