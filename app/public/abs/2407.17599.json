We investigate this detection by analyzing its frequency\ndependence and sensitivity to component separation methods, suggesting that\nGalactic foregrounds are unlikely to be the cause. Contrary to previous\nstudies, we find that the decrement is independent of galaxy type, indicating a\npossible correlation between the CMB and the overall matter density field. To\ntest this hypothesis, we employ three analytical approaches: cross-correlation\nanalysis, template fitting, and Bayes Factor calculation. Our cross-correlation\nanalysis shows a significant correlation (p < 0.7%) between the CMB and the\n2MASS Redshift Survey projected matter density at distances below 50 Mpc/h.\nTemplate fitting and Bayes Factor analyses support this finding, albeit with\nlower significance levels (1% - 5%). Importantly, we do not detect this signal\nbeyond 50 Mpc/h, which constrains potential physical interpretations. We\ndiscuss that the physical origin of this correlation could potentially be\nlinked to the dark matter distribution in the halos of galaxies. Further\ninvestigation is required to confirm and understand this intriguing connection\nbetween the CMB and local matter distribution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
