Using a recently discovered\nmultiplicity inequality, we prove global existence and convergence of smooth\nsolutions for spheres and axisymmetric tori, provided the initial energy lies\nbelow explicit thresholds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"H8Z84aX5EFdKlWEeQZ4zpVhRSMLyzgGInsivengZSYA","pdfSize":"502557"}
