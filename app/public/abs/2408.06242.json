The enhanced stability is an exact result when the number of species\napproaches infinity and is confirmed numerically by simulations of the\nmulti-species non-reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model. Furthermore, the diversity in\ndynamical patterns increases with increasing number of components and novel\nsteady states such as pulsating or spatiotemporally chaotic condensates are\nobserved. Our results may help to unravel the mechanisms by which living\nsystems self-organise via metabolism.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
