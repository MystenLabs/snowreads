Hall","authorsParsed":[["Hall","George T.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 7 Aug 2024 17:22:28 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-23","timestamp":1723051348000,"abstract":"  Motivation: Biologists who want to analyse their single-cell transcriptomics\ndataset must install and use specialist software via the command line. This is\noften impractical for non-bioinformaticians. Whilst CELLxGENE provides an\nintuitive graphical interface to facilitate analysis outside the command line,\nits server-side installation and execution remain complex. A version that is\neasier to install and run would allow non-bioinformaticians to take advantage\nof this valuable tool without needing to use the command line.\n  Results: Portable-CELLxGENE is a standalone distribution of CELLxGENE that\ncan be installed via a graphical interface. It contains an easy-to-use\nextension of the CELLxGENE-gateway Python package to allow the analysis of\nmultiple datasets.\n  Availability and implementation: Standalone executables compiled for Windows\nand MacOS are available at github.com/george-hall-ucl/portable-cellxgene.\nSource code is also available at the same address.
