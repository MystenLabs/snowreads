In particular, we present\nthe Generalized Coarray Multiple Signal Classification (GCA-MUSIC) DOA\nestimation algorithm to scenarios with partially-calibrated sparse subarrays.\nThe proposed GCA-MUSIC algorithm exploits the difference coarray for each\nsubarray, followed by a specific pseudo-spectrum merging rule that is based on\nthe intersection of the signal subspaces associated to each subarray. This rule\nassumes that there is no a priori knowledge about the cross-covariance between\nsubarrays. In that way, only the second-order statistics of each subarray are\nused to estimate the directions with increased degrees of freedom, i.e., the\nestimation procedure preserves the coarray Multiple Signal Classification and\nsparse arrays properties to estimate more sources than the number of physical\nsensors in each subarray. Numerical simulations show that the proposed\nGCA-MUSIC has better performance than other similar strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
