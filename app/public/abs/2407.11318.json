Here we present the results of follow-up observations of two FRBs and\nfour rotating radio transients (RRATs). Among these, only one RRAT has been\nobserved with repeating pulses, with an estimated period of around 1.297047 s.\nFor comparison, we reanalysed the Parkes archival follow-up observations in\nCSIRO's data archive for all apparently one-off sources discovered by the\nParkes telescopes, including 13 RRATs and 29 FRBs. In total, 3 RRATs are\nsuggested to be repeaters, but no repeating signals were detected from the\nother sources. Reporting details of the non-detection observations for the\napparently one-off sources would help investigate their origins, and\ncatastrophic scenarios are worth proposing for both extragalactic and Galactic\nsources.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
