We calculate this observable beyond the\nzero-frequency limit, retaining an exact dependence on the kinematics of the\nmassive objects. This allows us to study independently the ultrarelativistic or\nmassless limit, where we find agreement with the literature, and the\nsmall-deflection or post-Minkowskian (PM) limit, where we provide explicit\nresults up to $\\mathcal{O}(G^5)$. These confirm that the high-velocity limit of\na given PM order is smoothly connected to the corresponding massless result\nwhenever the latter is analytic in the Newton constant $G$. We also provide\nexplicit expressions for the waveforms to order $\\omega^{-1}$, $\\log\\omega$,\n$\\omega(\\log\\omega)^2$ in the soft limit, $\\omega\\to0$, expanded up to\nsub-subleading PM order, as well as a conjecture for the logarithmic soft terms\nof the type $\\omega^{n-1}(\\log\\omega)^{n}$ with $n\\ge 3$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
