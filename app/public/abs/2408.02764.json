One intuitively expects that reducing\nthe number of operations may decrease the chance of errors. This paradigm is\nparticularly prevalent in quantum computing, where gates are hard to implement\nand noise rapidly decreases a quantum computer's potential to outperform\nclassical computers. Here, we find that minimizing the number of operations in\na quantum algorithm can be counterproductive, leading to a noise sensitivity\nthat induces errors when running the algorithm in non-ideal conditions. To show\nthis, we develop a framework to characterize the resilience of an algorithm to\nperturbative noises (including coherent errors, dephasing, and depolarizing\nnoise). Some compilations of an algorithm can be resilient against certain\nnoise sources while being unstable against other noises. We condense these\nresults into a tradeoff relation between an algorithm's number of operations\nand its noise resilience. We also show how this framework can be leveraged to\nidentify compilations of an algorithm that are better suited to withstand\ncertain noises.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
