The architectural boundaries imposed by the tool make it\nsuitable for collective intelligence research experiments ranging from agents\nthat exchange hello world messages to virtual drone agents exchanging positions\nand eventually agents exchanging information via radio with real Crazyflie\ndrones in VU Amsterdam laboratory. The field modulation theory is implemented\nto construct synthetic local perception maps for agents, which are constructed\nbased on neighbouring agents positions and neighbouring points of interest\ndictated by the environment. By constraining the experimental setup to a 2D\nenvironment with discrete actions, constant velocity and parameters tailored to\nVU Amsterdam laboratory, UAV Crazyflie drones running hill climbing controller\nfollowed collision-free trajectories and bridged sim-to-real gap.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V815HxoSdrIlOLkOdjvu-kA-EBQdq5eSbF5Dg0jOxUI","pdfSize":"5242533"}
