First and foremost, flagging\nobservations as outlying requires a well-defined notion of nominal\noutlyingness. This paper presents a definition of nominal outlyingness and\nintroduces a general framework for quantifying outlyingness of nominal data.\nThe proposed framework makes use of ideas from the association rule mining\nliterature and can be used for calculating scores that indicate how outlying a\nnominal observation is. Methods for determining the involved hyperparameter\nvalues are presented and the concepts of variable contributions and\noutlyingness depth are introduced, in an attempt to enhance interpretability of\nthe results. An implementation of the framework is tested on five real-world\ndata sets and the key findings are outlined. The ideas presented can serve as a\ntool for assessing the degree to which an observation differs from the rest of\nthe data, under the assumption of sequences of nominal levels having been\ngenerated from a Multinomial distribution with varying event probabilities.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fI_Nizkwi1-9fby3PbSp4NZwpT3PiQlRWUGRGNbU6_c","pdfSize":"20061467"}
