We use a sample of 10,220 galaxies from the\nMapping Nearby Galaxies at APO (MaNGA) survey, part of the Sloan Digital Sky\nSurvey (SDSS-IV). For each galaxy, we examine its mid-infrared variability in\nthe $W2$ $[4.6\\mu m]$ band over thirteen years using data from the Wide\nInfrared Survey Explorer (WISE) All-Sky and Near Earth Objects WISE (NEOWISE)\nmissions. We demonstrate that we can detect variability signatures as small as\nabout $7\\%$ in the root-mean-square variation of $W2$ flux for the majority of\ncases. Using other AGN signatures of the variable galaxies, such as optical\nnarrow lines, optical broad lines, and WISE $W1-W2$ colors, we show that $\\sim\n75\\%$ of the variables show these additional AGN signatures, indicating that\nthe bulk of these cases are likely to be AGN. We also identify seven galaxies\nthat have light-curves characteristic of tidal disruption events. We present\nhere a publicly available catalog of the light-curve variability in $W2$ of\nthese galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ENqtU4WxkgS7qpRGgQSdskWNUbQeMyjTNbtP1IMnsSk","pdfSize":"14555416"}
