Under mild conditions and without requiring smoothness of the vector\nfield, we analyze the network dynamics and show that the solutions converge\nglobally to the set of equilibria for generic monotone (but not necessarily\nstrictly monotone) regulatory functions. Sufficient conditions for global state\nsynchronization are provided. Finally, by adopting a piecewise linear\napproximation of the vector field, we determine the existence, location and\nstability of the equilibria as function of the coupling gain. The theoretical\nresults are illustrated with numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
