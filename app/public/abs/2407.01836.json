We offer some structural results\non their vertex covers, and show an interesting connection between the cover\nideal of the jets of a clutter and the symbolic powers of the cover ideal of\nthe original clutter. We use this connection to prove that jets of very\nwell-covered graphs are very well-covered. Next, we turn our attention to\nprincipal jets of monomial ideals, describing their primary decomposition and\nminimal generating sets. Finally, we give formulas to compute various algebraic\ninvariants of principal jets of monomial ideals, including their Hilbert\nseries, Betti numbers, multiplicity and regularity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
