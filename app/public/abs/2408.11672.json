Nevertheless, the methodology is increasingly\nquestioned in many scientific disciplines. We demonstrate in this paper how\nmany of the worrisome aspects of statistical hypothesis testing can be\nameliorated with concepts and methods from evidential analysis. The model\nfamily we treat is the familiar normal linear model with fixed effects,\nembracing multiple regression and analysis of variance, a warhorse of everyday\nscience in labs and field stations. Questions about study design, the\napplicability of the null hypothesis, the effect size, error probabilities,\nevidence strength, and model misspecification become more naturally housed in\nan evidential setting. We provide a completely worked example featuring a 2-way\nanalysis of variance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"0VXR7C1camvltUjnQaVrKqkELmnDHvGDdACloa_3QhM","pdfSize":"1105908"}
