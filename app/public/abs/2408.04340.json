In\nthis paper, we study the twisted $q$-Yangians as coideal subalgebras of the\nquantum affine algebra introduced by Molev, Ragoucy and Sorba. We investigate\nthe invariant theory of the quantum symmetric spaces in affine types $AI, AII$\nand use the Sklyanin determinants to study the invariant theory and show that\nthey also obey classical type identities similar to the quantum coordinate\nalgebras of finite types.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
