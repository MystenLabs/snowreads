The low polarization degree points to a strong dominance of the\nturbulent magnetic field -- in agreement with the observation that the total\nsynchrotron intensity is much larger than expected from the regular component\nin current models for the Galactic magnetic field (GMF). In contrast, studies\nof cosmic ray propagation employing these GMF models suggest that cosmic rays\npropagate anisotropically, what in turn requires weak turbulent fields. As a\nsolution to this contradicting requirements, we suggest that the GMF consists\nof three components with different levels of turbulence: a disk dominated by\nthe turbulent field, a halo dominated by the regular field, plus an extended\nturbulent halo field.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
