We investigate the energy and\nfrequency dependency of the source variability to probe the origin of the\ndisc/coronal fluctuations. Following the state transition (from soft to\nintermediate state), the emergence of a band-limited noise (BLN) component is\nobserved along with the power law noise (PLN) when the disk is recovering from\na sudden decrease in the inner disk radius. A possible correlation between the\nlow-frequency variability amplitude (RMS) and the covering fraction of the\nnon-thermal component is detected. During the final AstroSat observation, a\nflip-flop phenomenon is reported, where rapid variation in RMS occurs in\nconcurrence with sudden flux transition. An indication of the evolution of\ninner disk temperature along with a significant change in thermal flux was\nobserved during the flip-flop phase, arguing for a disk instability-driven\norigin for this phenomenon. Our results suggest that the long-term variability\nevolution is primarily affected by the coronal changes, whereas the disk\nbehavior governs the short-term variability evolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
