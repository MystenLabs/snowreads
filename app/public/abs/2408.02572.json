Many of these problems are known to admit a complete\nhierarchy of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations. NPO theory has found\napplication in quantum information theory, quantum chemistry and statistical\nphysics. In this work, we consider a variant of NPO problems where a subset of\nthe operator variables satisfies a system of ordinary differential equations.\nWe find that, under mild conditions of operator boundedness, for every such\nproblem one can construct a standard NPO problem with the same solution. This\nallows us to define a complete hierarchy of SDPs to tackle the original\ndifferential problem. We apply this method to extrapolate quantum time series\nin a semi-device-independent way and sketch how one can use it to model\nHamiltonian time evolution in many-body quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
