First we show that if the norm\nsquared of the second fundamental form is constant, the Morse index of a\nfree-boundary minimal hypersurface $\\Sigma\\subset \\mathbb{S}^{n+1}_{+}$ equals:\n$1$ if $\\Sigma$ is a totally geodesic equator, $n+1$ if $\\Sigma$ is half of the\nClifford torus, or it is at least $2(n+1)$ when $\\Sigma$ is not totally\ngeodesic. Next we prove an estimate for the first eigenvalue $\\lambda_1$ of the\nsecond variation's Jacobi operator, and show that $\\lambda_1 \\leq -2n$ if\n$\\Sigma$ is not totally geodesic, with equality iff $\\Sigma$ is half of the\nminimal Clifford torus. Furthermore, $\\lambda_1 = -n$ iff $\\Sigma$ is totally\ngeodesic. Finally, if $\\Sigma$ is not totally umbilical the Morse index is at\nleast $n+1$, with equality precisely when $\\Sigma$ is the upper\n$\\mathrm{H}$-torus. For totally umbilical hypersurfaces the Morse index is $1$.\nWe also prove an upper bound for the first eigenvalue of free-boundary\n$\\mathrm{CMC}$ hypersurfaces, where equality corresponds to totally umbilical\nhypersurfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
