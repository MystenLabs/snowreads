That is, given that purely unrectifiable\n1-sets always have null intersections with Lipschitz images, we ask whether\nthese sets intersect with Lipschitz images at a dimension that is close to one.\nIn an answer to this question, we show that one-dimensional attractors of\niterated function systems that satisfy the open set condition have subsets of\ndimension arbitrarily close to one that can be covered by Lipschitz graphs.\nMoreover, the Lipschitz constant of such graphs depends explicitly on the\ndifference between the dimension of the original set and the subset that\nintersects with the graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
