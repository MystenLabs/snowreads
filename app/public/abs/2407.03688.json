However, the intricate relationship\nbetween surface error and imaging quality poses significant challenges,\nnecessitating dense sampling of featured rays during the computation process to\nensure an accurate tolerance for different fields of view (FOVs). Here, we\npropose an adaptive sampling strategy called \"Critical Ray Aiming\" for surface\ntolerance analysis. By identifying the most sensitive ray to wave aberration at\neach surface point, our methodology facilitates flexible sampling of the FOVs\nand entrance pupil (EP), achieving computational efficiency without\ncompromising accuracy in determining tolerable surface error. We demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our method through tolerance analysis of two different\nfreeform imaging systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
