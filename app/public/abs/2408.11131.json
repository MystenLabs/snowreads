Among\nseveral ongoing efforts, we examine sensitivity to the PDFs and mutual\ncompatibility of new measurements in production of Drell-Yan pairs, top-quark\npairs, and single-inclusive jets by the ATLAS, CMS, and LHCb collaborations in\nthe LHC Runs 1 and 2.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
