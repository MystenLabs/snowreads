However, we\nhave observed the phenomenon of inter-class similarity and intra-class\ninconsistency in the datasets from the UCR archive and further analyzed how\nthis phenomenon adversely affects the \"FC+SoftMax\" paradigm. To address the\nissue, we introduce ECR, which, for the first time to our knowledge, applies\ndeep learning-based retrieval algorithm to the TSC problem and integrates\nclassification and retrieval models. Experimental results on 112 UCR datasets\ndemonstrate that ECR is state-of-the-art(sota) compared to existing deep\nlearning-based methods. Furthermore, we have developed a more precise\nclassifier, ECRTime, which is an ensemble of ECR. ECRTime surpasses the\ncurrently most accurate deep learning classifier, InceptionTime, in terms of\naccuracy, achieving this with reduced training time and comparable scalability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
