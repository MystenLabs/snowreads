We derive an\neffective two-level-system Hamiltonian based on the Magnus expansion in the\nso-called \"quasi-Bragg regime\", where most Bragg-pulse atom interferometers\noperate. Furthermore, we extend the theory to a five-level description to\naccount for Doppler detuning. Using these derived effective Hamiltonians, we\ninvestigate the impacts of AC-Stark shift and polarization errors on the double\nBragg beam-splitter, along with their mitigations through detuning control.\nNotably, we design a linear detuning sweep that demonstrates robust efficiency\nexceeding 99.5% against polarization errors up to 8.5%. Moreover, we develop an\nartificial intelligence-aided optimal detuning control protocol, showcasing\nenhanced robustness against both polarization errors and Doppler effects. This\nprotocol achieves an average efficiency of 99.92% for samples with a finite\nmomentum width of 0.05$\\hbar k_L$ within an extended polarization error range\nof up to 10%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
