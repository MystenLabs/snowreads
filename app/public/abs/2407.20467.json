Under the\npresence of an external time-dependent magnetic field, dipole-dipole\ninteractions in the binary ultracold $^{166}$Er -$^{164}$Dy system were tuned\nfrom repulsive to attractive to access either, the droplet regime, or the\nextended one where individual species can be found in mixed or demixed phases.\nA thorough exploration of weak contact and dipole-dipole effective interactions\nparameters leads us to determine the phase diagrams of the 1D Bose clouds\naffected by three different external fields; free homogeneous, harmonic, and\noptical lattice confining potentials. These results were used to propose\nlong-life states composed of alternate assemblies of individual species\nconfined in optical lattices that mimics magnetic domains, whose size can be\nadjusted. Our analysis based on numerical experiments within a mean field\nscheme considered large enough systems as those commonly used in experimental\nplatforms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
