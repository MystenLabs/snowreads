We provide several equivalent descriptions of\nthe former in terms of the indecomposable projective modules of $R$ and its\nprimitive idempotents, and prove that it classifies the bispectral Darboux\ntransformations of the $R$-valued exponential function. The rational\nGrasssmannian $ {\\mathrm{Gr}}^{\\mathrm{rat}}(R)$ is defined by using certain\nfree submodules of $R(z)$ and it is proved that it can be alternatively defined\nvia Wilson type conditions imposed in a representation theoretic settings. A\ncanonical embedding ${\\mathrm{Gr}}^{\\mathrm{ad}}(R) \\hookrightarrow\n{\\mathrm{Gr}}^{\\mathrm{rat}}(R)$ is constructed based on a perfect pairing\nbetween the $R$-bimodule of quasiexponentials with values in $R$ and the\n$R$-bimodule $R[z]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
