Here, we demonstrate\nexperimentally and characterize numerically a device that combines the benefits\nof dielectrophoresis (DEP) - long-range and strong trapping forces - with those\nof plasmonic tweezers - high sensitivities - to achieve a remarkable efficiency\nin the trapping and sensing of metallic nanoparticles and biomolecules. In\nparticular, we show the DEP trapping and surface enhanced Raman scattering\ncharacterization of bovine serum albumin and Rhodamine B, thus extending the\napplications of tweezing devices to molecules having masses of only a few\nhundreds of Da. This range covers virtually any molecule relevant for life,\nfrom tiny oligopeptides to large proteins. This pushes our manipulation\ncapabilities deep into the realms of efficient single-molecule biosensing and\nquantum science, providing a powerful platform to probe matter at the\nnanoscale.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
