One aspect\nis that for people with ASD conversations in everyday life are challenging due\nto difficulties in understanding social cues, interpreting emotions, and\nmaintaining social verbal exchanges. To address these challenges and enhance\nsocial skills, we propose the development of a learning game centered around\nsocial interaction and conversation, featuring Artificial Intelligence agents.\nOur initial step involves seven expert interviews to gain insight into the\nrequirements for empathetic and conversational agents in the field of improving\nsocial skills for people with ASD in a gamified environment. We have identified\ntwo distinct use cases: (1) Conversation partners to discuss real-life issues\nand (2) Training partners to experience various scenarios to improve social\nskills. In the latter case, users will receive quests for interacting with the\nagent. Additionally, the agent can assign quests to the user, prompting\nspecific conversations in real life and providing rewards for successful\ncompletion of quests.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
