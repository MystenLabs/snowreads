Yet, neurons with their modest frequency range not only efficiently\nreceive and process multiple orders higher frequency signals, but also\ndemonstrate remarkable stability and adaptability to frequency variations in\nbrain functional connectivity. Ability to process signals beyond the\nlimitations of the receiver temporal or frequency (bandwidth) resolution is\nhighly desirable yet requires complex design architectures. Using the\nFitzHugh-Nagumo model we reveal the harmonic fractal transformation of\nfrequency and bandwidth, which enables the Nyquist rate integer (for low\nfrequencies) and sub-integer (for high frequencies) multiplication. We also\ndemonstrate for the first time that noise shaping can be achieved in a simple\nRLC-circuit without a requirement of a delay line. The discovered effect\npresents a novel regeneration type - 4R: re-amplifying, re-shaping, re-timing,\nand re-modulating and due to the fractal nature of transformation offers a\nremarkable regenerative efficiency. The effect is a generalization of phase\nlocking to non-periodic encoded signals. The discovered physical mechanism\nexplains how using neuronal functionality one can receive and process signals\nover an ultra-wide band (below or higher the spiking neuronal range by multiple\norders) and below the noise floor.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
