Our findings reveal that in certain\nstates, such as the generalized W state, where probability coefficients depend\non the number of qubits, an increase in the number of particles causes the\n$\\pi$-tangle to approach zero, while the CKW inequality converges to equality.\nIn such cases, assessing the system's entanglement can be effectively achieved\nby summing the negativities of bipartitions or summing the squares of\none-tangles. Conversely, in entangled states with probability coefficients\nindependent of the number of qubits, such as the GHZ state, the $\\pi$-tangle\nserves as an appropriate measure for studying the system's entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
