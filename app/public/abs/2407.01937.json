Consequently, managing and understanding large-scale video\ndatasets has gained increasing importance. However, empathetic data are\ntypically trained without any quality selection, leading to inefficient data\nusage and wasted computational resources. Additionally, using raw data can\nresult in low performance in empathetic dialogues. In this work, we present\nEfficient-Empathy, a sensibility and rationality score-based data selection\nalgorithm that automatically selects sensibility and rationality data while\ndiscarding low-quality data. With only the sensibility data (59% of the full\ndataset), our trained sensibility model efficiently achieves state-of-the-art\n(SoTA) performance. Furthermore, with multiple data selection hyperparameters,\nthe sensibility model demonstrates SoTA performance, showcasing the robustness\nof our method. By integrating sensibility and rationality data with a MoE\nstructure, we achieve even higher performance, demonstrating the effectiveness\nof our Efficient-Empathy algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
