We introduce a novel Incremental\nGauss--Newton (IGN) method within explicit superlinear convergence rate, which\noutperforms existing methods that only achieve linear convergence rate. In\nparticular, we formulate our problem by the nonlinear least squares with\nfinite-sum structure, and our method incrementally iterates with the\ninformation of one component in each round. We also provide a mini-batch\nextension to our IGN method that obtains an even faster superlinear convergence\nrate. Furthermore, we conduct numerical experiments to show the advantages of\nthe proposed methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
