The ability to upload audio\ndata increases the importance of developing methods to detect abusive content\nin speech recordings. However, simply transferring the mechanisms from written\nabuse detection would ignore relevant information such as emotion and tone. In\naddition, many current algorithms require training in the specific language for\nwhich they are being used. This paper proposes to use acoustic and prosodic\nfeatures to classify abusive content. We used the ADIMA data set, which\ncontains recordings from ten Indic languages, and trained different models in\nmultilingual and cross-lingual settings. Our results show that it is possible\nto classify abusive and non-abusive content using only acoustic and prosodic\nfeatures. The most important and influential features are discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pmlIaZQfPHhRkPzUSMRNu4f4mEoH2I47LVcppF1K5Fo","pdfSize":"2388432","objectId":"0xe35b3e372b28125fda8914aa3b19e255ac861e4c8a737df60ac9045e56b2aae4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
