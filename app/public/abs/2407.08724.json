Many amusing and important knots and links can be\ndescribed in this way, from twist and double braid knots to the celebrated\nKanenobu knots for even parameters -- and for all of them the entire HOMFLY\npolynomials possess planar decomposition. This provides an approach to\nevaluation of HOMFLY polynomials, which is complementary to the arborescent\ncalculus, and this opens a new direction to homological techniques, parallel to\nKhovanov-Rozansky generalisations of the Kauffman calculus. Moreover, this\nplanar calculus is also applicable to other symmetric representations beyond\nthe fundamental one, and to links which are not fully bipartite what is\nillustrated by examples of Kanenobu-like links.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
