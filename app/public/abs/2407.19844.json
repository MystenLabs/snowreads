Chen,\nX. Guo, K. Zhao, Tensor product weight modules over the Virasoro algebra, J.\nLond. Math. Soc. 88(2013), 829-844.]. All such tensor product modules are\nindecomposable modules with infinite-dimensional weight spaces. Moreover, we\nobtain the necessary and sufficient conditions for such tensor product modules\nto be irreducible. Therefore, we obtain a class of new irreducible weight\nmodules over the affine-Virasoro algebra. Finally, the necessary and sufficient\nconditions for any two such tensor product modules to be isomorphic are also\ndetermined.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
