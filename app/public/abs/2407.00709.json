The AH's difference and\nratio present viable alternatives to the traditional Cox's hazard ratio for\nquantifying the treatment effect on time-to-event outcomes in comparative\nclinical studies. While the methodology for evaluating the difference and ratio\nof AH in randomized clinical trials has been previously proposed, the\napplication of the AH-based approach in general comparative effectiveness\nresearch (CER), where interventions are not randomly allocated, remains\nunderdiscussed. This paper aims to introduce several approaches for applying\nthe AH in general CER, thereby extending its utility beyond randomized trial\nsettings to observational studies where treatment assignment is non-random.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
