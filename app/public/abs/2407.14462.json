This work investigates the\nphonon-induced decoherence for a quantum dot placed in the one-dimensional\nsystem of a homogeneous cylindrical nanowire. Such a structure supports\nmultiple longitudinal phonon branches, and we consider both a linear and a\nquadratic coupling of the emitter to these modes. Under a polaron approach, we\ninitially derive an analytical expression for the 1D pure dephasing rate, which\nleads to a reduced pure dephasing rate compared with bulk. By implementing\nthese results into a full cavity quantum electrodynamic model, we demonstrate\nthat multimode coupling is necessary to correctly predict the\nindistinguishability in a 1D system, which may otherwise be significantly\nunderestimated.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"flv8LgCzmk1sDyEGnRS0rOTBKqHUnI_Rop6nVHfy-Dg","pdfSize":"5356356"}
