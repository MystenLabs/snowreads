The algorithm\ncomputes the detailed beam dynamics on the microscale, but only in small\npatches of the beam domain, and then applies symmetry-preserving interpolation\nto these patches to accurately predict the macroscale behaviour. To validate\nthe algorithm, two examples of functionally graded beams are investigated,\nnamely cross-sectionally graded and axially graded. Gradient patterns are\ndefined via volume fractions of aluminium and silicon carbine either over the\nbeam's cross section or along its axial direction. In these examples the\nmultiscale patch scheme only computes over a fraction of the beam's\nfull-domain. Beam deflection and natural frequencies from the patch\ncomputations agree very well with existing experimental data and the\nfull-domain computations. The algorithm is stable and robust, with errors\nconsistently small and reliably reducible by increasing the number of patches.\nThe reduction in the spatial domain of computation substantially improves the\ncomputational efficiency, with the computational time reducing by a factor of\nup to 17 when the patches cover 27% of the beam.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
