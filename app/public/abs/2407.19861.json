But how is the rolling affected if these\nshapes are irregular or random? Treating the terminal rolling speed as an order\nparameter, we show that phase transitions arise as a function of the dimension\nof the state space and inertia. We calculate the scaling exponents and the\nmacroscopic lag time associated with the presence of first and second order\ntransitions, and describe the regimes of co-existence of stable states and the\naccompanying hysteresis. Experiments with rolling cylinders corroborate our\ntheoretical results on the scaling of the lag time. Experiments with spheres\nreveal closed orbits and their period-doubling in the overdamped and inertial\nlimits respectively, providing visible manifestations of the hairy ball theorem\nand the doubly-connected nature of SO(3), the space of 3-dimensional rotations.\nGoing beyond simple curiosity, our study might be relevant in a number of\nnatural and artificial systems that involve the rolling of irregular objects,\nin systems ranging from nanoscale cellular transport to robotics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
