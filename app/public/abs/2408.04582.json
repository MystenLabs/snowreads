Moreover, we study the relation between Eisenstein\nseries and cuspidal supports and present a conjectural characterization of\nirreducible smooth representations with supercuspidal $L$-parameters regarding\ngeometric constant terms. The main technical ingredient is an induction\nprinciple for geometric Eisenstein series which allows us to reduce to the\nsituations already treated in the literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
