An affirmative answer to this question was previously claimed by\nCzech-Dong. We point out an error in their proof when the bulk is multiply\nconnected. We nonetheless find strong support, of two kinds, for an affirmative\nanswer in that case. We extend the Czech-Dong proof for simply-connected\nspacetimes to spacetimes with $\\pi_1=\\mathbb{Z}$ (i.e. 2-boundary, genus-0\nwormholes). Specializing to vacuum solutions, we also numerically test\nthousands of distinct inequalities (including all known RT inequalities for up\nto 6 regions) on millions of randomly chosen configurations of regions and bulk\nspacetimes, including three different multiply-connected topologies; we find no\ncounterexamples. In an appendix, we prove some (dimension-independent) facts\nabout degenerate HRT surfaces and symmetry breaking.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"op1xm9Oo_kH6kS8IZoaWY5QAAaTZKurXWUsV3gj2U0k","pdfSize":"3597518"}
