It is well-known that to study many questions we may assume R is prime and\nconsider just R-disjoint ideals. We give a characterization for an R-disjoint\nideal to be prime. We study conditions under which there exists an R-disjoint\nideal which is a maximal ideal and when this is the case how to determine all\nsuch maximal ideals. maximal ideal to be generated by polynomials of minimal\ndegree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
