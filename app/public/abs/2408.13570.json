We introduce an\naccessible ab initio quantum embedding concept for many-body quantum optical\nsystems that allows to treat the collective coupling of molecular many-body\nsystems effectively in the spirit of macroscopic QED while keeping the rigor of\nab initio quantum chemistry for the molecular structure. Our approach fully\nincludes the quantum fluctuations of the polaritonic field and yet remains much\nsimpler and more intuitive than complex embedding approaches such as dynamical\nmean-field theory. We illustrate the underlying assumptions by comparison to\nthe Tavis--Cummings model. The intuitive application of the quantized embedding\napproach and its transparent limitations offer a practical framework for the\nfield of ab initio polaritonic chemistry to describe collective effects in\nrealistic molecular ensembles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
