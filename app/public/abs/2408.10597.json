Our\ntechnique, which is based on the invariance of the thermodynamic potential with\nrespect to spatial transformations of shear and rotation, offers an alternative\nto the general covariant approach recently developed by two of us. We apply\nthis technique in both pure mean field theories of ionic fluids and in a theory\nthat includes thermal fluctuations of the electrostatic potential, using\nvariational field theory. We also apply the thermomechanical approach to fluid\nmodels described by vector order parameters, such as liquid dielectrics, and\nobtained for this case a general expression for the stress tensor.\nAdditionally, we discuss specific issues related to the calculation of\ndisjoining pressure in ionic fluids confined in nanoscale slit-like pores with\nconductive or dielectric walls.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
