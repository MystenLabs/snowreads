However, the criteria for the SLOCC classification of black holes\nhave not been given. In addition, the LU classification of black holes has not\nbeen studied in the past. In this paper we will consider both SLOCC and LU\nclassification of the STU black holes with four integer electric charges $q_{i}\n$ and four integer magnetic charges $p^{i}$, $i=0,1,2,3$. Two STU black holes\nwith eight charges are considered SLOCC (LU) equivalent if and only if their\ncorresponding states of three qubits are SLOCC (LU) equivalent. Under this\ndefinition, we give criteria for the classification of the eight-charge STU\nblack holes under SLOCC and under LU, respectively. We will study the\nclassification of the black holes via the classification of SLOCC and LU\nentanglement of three qubits. We then identify a set of black holes\ncorresponding to the state W of three qubits, which is of interest since it has\nthe maximal average von Neumann entropy of entanglement. Via von Neumann\nentanglement entropy, we partition the STU black holes corresponding to pure\nstates of GHZ SLOCC class into five families under LU.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
