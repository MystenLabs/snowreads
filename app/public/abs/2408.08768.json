At low temperatures, irreversible loss occurs due to ensemble\ndynamics facilitated by electronic-nuclear spin interactions. We develop a\ncombined open quantum systems and electronic structure theory capable of\npredicting trends in relaxation rates in molecular spin ensembles. We use the\nGorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation and explicitly include\nelectronic structure information in the decoherence channels. We apply this\ntheory to several molecular systems pertinent to contemporary quantum\ntechnologies. Our theory provides a framework to describe irreversible\nrelaxation effects in molecular spin systems with applications in quantum\ninformation science, quantum sensing, molecular spintronics, and other spin\nsystems dominated by spin-spin relaxation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
