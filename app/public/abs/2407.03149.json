As an application, we prove that every countable abelian group can be\nembedded into a finitely presented simple group, verifying the Boone-Higman\nconjecture for countable abelian groups. Indeed, we describe a specific\n2-generated, $\\mathrm{F}_\\infty$ simple group $V\\mathcal{A}$ of homeomorphisms\nof the Cantor set that contains every countable abelian group. As a second\napplication, we prove that if $G$ is a bounded automata group then the\nassociated R\\\"over-Nekrashevych groups $V_{d,r}G$ have type\n$\\mathrm{F}_\\infty$, verifying a conjecture of Nekrashevych for a large class\nof contracting self-similar groups. Among others, this result applies to\nR\\\"{o}ver-Nekrashevych groups associated to Gupta-Sidki groups and the basilica\ngroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
