The traveling wave solution of the system is crucial for\nunderstanding the long-time behavior of solutions to the Cauchy problem.\nSpecifically, the sign of the wave speed is key to predicting which species\nwill prevail in the competition. In this paper, by studying a degenerate\nLotka-Volterra competition system, we propose two sufficient conditions for\ndetermining the sign of the wave speed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
