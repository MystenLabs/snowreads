However, access to the underlying dataset\nbehind a line chart is rarely readily available. In this paper, we explore a\nnovel dataset discovery problem, dataset discovery via line charts, focusing on\nthe use of line charts as queries to discover datasets within a large data\nrepository that are capable of generating similar line charts. To solve this\nproblem, we propose a novel approach called Fine-grained Cross-modal Relevance\nLearning Model (FCM), which aims to estimate the relevance between a line chart\nand a candidate dataset. To achieve this goal, FCM first employs a visual\nelement extractor to extract informative visual elements, i.e., lines and\ny-ticks, from a line chart. Then, two novel segment-level encoders are adopted\nto learn representations for a line chart and a dataset, preserving\nfine-grained information, followed by a cross-modal matcher to match the\nlearned representations in a fine-grained way. Furthermore, we extend FCM to\nsupport line chart queries generated based on data aggregation. Last, we\npropose a benchmark tailored for this problem since no such dataset exists.\nExtensive evaluation on the new benchmark verifies the effectiveness of our\nproposed method. Specifically, our proposed approach surpasses the best\nbaseline by 30.1% and 41.0% in terms of prec@50 and ndcg@50, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
