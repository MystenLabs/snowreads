In the present paper, we construct fused currents\nas duals to specialization maps of the corresponding shuffle algebras ([7,8,9])\nin types ADE. Both root vectors and fused currents depend on a convex order of\nthe positive roots, and the choice we make in the present paper is that of the\nAuslander-Reiten order ([24]) corresponding to an orientation of the type ADE\nDynkin diagram.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
