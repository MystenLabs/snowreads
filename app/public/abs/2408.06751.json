Recently emerging subwavelength nonlinear quantum light sources,\ne.g., GaP and LiNbO3 thin films, benefiting from the relaxed phase-matching\nconstraints and volume confinement, has shown intriguing properties, such as\nhigh-dimensional hyperentanglement and robust entanglement anti-degradation.\nVan der Waals (vdW) NbOCl2 crystal, renowned for its superior optical\nnonlinearities, has emerged as one of ideal candidates for ultrathin quantum\nlight sources [Nature 613, 53 (2023)]. However, polarization-entanglement is\ninaccessible in NbOCl2 crystal due to its unfavorable nonlinear susceptibility\ntensor. Here, by leveraging the twist-stacking degree of freedom inherently in\nvdW systems, we showcase the preparation of tunable polarization entanglement\nand quantum Bell states. Our work not only provides a new and tunable\npolarization-entangled vdW photon-pair source, but also introduces a new knob\nin engineering the entanglement state of quantum light at the nanoscale.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"vc5z-Hg7UJ7eUlZ-5jEUKPNoUxGKOjZZS9xwvBcAlAw","pdfSize":"1032843"}
