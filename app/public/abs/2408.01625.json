By analyzing the data collected by {\\it\nFermi}-LAT, VERITAS, and HAWC, with the addition of spectral data previously\nreported by LHAASO, a multiwavelength (MW) study of the morphological and\nspectral features of MGRO J1908+06 provides insight into the origin of the\n$\\gamma$-ray emission. The mechanism behind the bright TeV emission is studied\nby constraining the magnetic field strength, the source age and the distance\nthrough detailed broadband modeling. Both spectral shape and energy-dependent\nmorphology support the scenario that inverse-Compton (IC) emission of an\nevolved pulsar wind nebula (PWN) associated with PSR J1907+0602 is responsible\nfor the MGRO J1908+06 $\\gamma$-ray emission with a best-fit true age of\n$T=22\\pm 9$ kyr and a magnetic field of $B=5.4 \\pm 0.8\\ \\mu\\mathrm{G}$,\nassuming the distance to the pulsar $d_{\\mathrm{PSR}}=3.2$ kpc.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aGPfW_L-DBDTI6NdXX_Rsr9AK633_MaGDUoQOAjj8lQ","pdfSize":"1505966","txDigest":"B78KWyU7goZXbAeK1bJm2wLMyaWrTeyfKukADjDrrnXk","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
