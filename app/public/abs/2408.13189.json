Our\nexperiments demonstrate that the accelerated version outperforms the standard\nk-means++ version in terms of the number of visited points and distance\ncalculations, achieving greater speedup as the number of clusters increases.\nThe version utilizing the Triangle Inequality is particularly effective for\nlow-dimensional data, while the additional norm-based filter enhances\nperformance in high-dimensional instances with greater norm variance among\npoints. Additional experiments show the behavior of our algorithms when\nexecuted concurrently across multiple jobs and examine how memory performance\nimpacts practical speedup.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
