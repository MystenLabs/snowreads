Understanding the\ndetectors' response to an astrophysical signal across the searched signal\nmanifold is paramount to inferring the parameters of the progenitor and\ndeciding which candidates warrant telescope time. In this paper, we use\nartificial neural networks to accelerate and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\ncomputation for sufficiently local patches of the signal manifold. Our\nmachine-learning based model generates a single waveform (or equivalently,\ncomputes a single SNR timeseries) in 6 milliseconds on a CPU and 0.4\nmilliseconds on a GPU. When we use the GPU to generate batches of waveforms\nsimultaneously, we find that we can produce $10^4$ waveforms in $\\lesssim 1$ ms\non a GPU. This is achieved while remaining faithful, on average, to 1 part in\n$10^4$ (1 part in $10^5$) for binary black hole (binary neutron star)\nwaveforms. The model we present is designed to directly utilize intermediate\ndetection pipeline outputs, and is a step towards ultra-low-latency parameter\nestimation within search pipelines.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z5_8SqtwBLfloO0r_9pge0bbzhTW99txloywDlG7q6k","pdfSize":"904201"}
