Moreover, for every such 3-manifold, a dense subset of its\nflat metrics can be realized as cusp sections of a cusp-transitive 4-manifold.\nFinally, we prove that there are a lot of 4-manifolds with pairwise isometric\ncusps, for any given cusp type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
