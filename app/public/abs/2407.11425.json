As a result, researchers have developed incremental HAUIM\n(iHAUIM) algorithms to identify HAUIs in a dynamically updated database.\nContrary to conventional methods that begin from scratch, the iHAUIM algorithm\nfacilitates incremental changes and outputs, thereby reducing the cost of\ndiscovery. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art\niHAUIM algorithms, analyzing their unique characteristics and advantages.\nFirst, we explain the concept of iHAUIM, providing formulas and real-world\nexamples for a more in-depth understanding. Subsequently, we categorize and\ndiscuss the key technologies used by varying types of iHAUIM algorithms,\nencompassing Apriori-based, Tree-based, and Utility-list-based techniques.\nMoreover, we conduct a critical analysis of each mining method's advantages and\ndisadvantages. In conclusion, we explore potential future directions, research\nopportunities, and various extensions of the iHAUIM algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
