The technique consists of an\nobservable-specific classical optimization of the measurement data based on\ntensor networks leading to low-variance estimations. Compared to other\nobservable estimation protocols based on classical shadows and measurement\nframes, our approach offers several advantages: (i) it can be optimized to\nprovide lower statistical error, resulting in a reduced measurement budget to\nachieve a specified estimation precision; (ii) it scales to a large number of\nqubits due to the tensor network structure; (iii) it can be applied to any\nmeasurement protocol with measurement operators that have an efficient\nrepresentation in terms of tensor networks. We benchmark the method through\nvarious numerical examples, including spin and chemical systems in both\ninfinite and finite statistics scenarios, and show how optimal estimation can\nbe found even when we use tensor networks with low bond dimensions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
