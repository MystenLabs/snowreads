Liu as a new way to describe the\nfuzzy uncertainty. The credibility measure is the fundamental notion of the\ncredibility theory. Recently, L.Yang and K. Iwamura extended the credibility\nmeasure by defining the parametric measure $m_{\\lambda}$ ($\\lambda$ is a real\nparameter in the interval $[0,1]$ and for $\\lambda= 1/2$ we obtain as a\nparticular case the notion of credibility measure). By using the\n$m_{\\lambda}$-measure, we studied in this paper a risk neutral multi-item\ninventory problem. Our construction generalizes the credibilistic inventory\nmodel developed by Y. Li and Y. Liu in 2019. In our model, the components of\ndemand vector are fuzzy variables and the maximization problem is formulated by\nusing the notion of $m_{\\lambda}$-expected value. We shall prove a general\nformula for the solution of optimization problem, from which we obtained\neffective formulas for computing the optimal solutions in the particular cases\nwhere the demands are trapezoidal and triangular fuzzy numbers. For\n$\\lambda=1/2$ we obtain as a particular case the computation formulas of the\noptimal solutions of the credibilistic inventory problem of Li and Liu. These\ncomputation formulas are applied for some $m_{\\lambda}$-models obtained from\nnumerical data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
