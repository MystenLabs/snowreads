Among the leading\ncontenders are solid-state spin-qubits, particularly those utilizing the spin\nof phosphorous donors (31 P ). While significant progress has been made in\nenhancing quantum coherence and qubit control, challenges persist, notably in\nachieving precise and scalable P placement in Si substrate. This paper\ninvestigates by means of molecular dynamics the use of molecular PF2 ions for\nimplantation, aiming to reduce placement uncertainty while maintaining\ndetection efficiency. We examine energy transfer, molecule integrity,\nimplantation profiles, electronic signal components, and stable damage. Among\nother things we find that the assumption that the molecule only breaks apart\nimmediately due to the presence of an a-SiO2 layer on the surface of the\ncrystal and that the intensity of the electronic signal from ion-solid\ninteractions does not correlate necessarily with the penetration depth of P.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZCnRaUonM-UKhTwAu7shwRZ4AYvo5QtAabcwE567GYc","pdfSize":"1590053"}
