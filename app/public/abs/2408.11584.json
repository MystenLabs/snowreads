Thus, it is important to understand\ntheir evolution. In this paper we characterize the evolution of malicious\nemails through the lens of Psychological Factors, PFs, which are humans\npsychological attributes that can be exploited by malicious emails. That is,\nattackers who send them. For this purpose, we propose a methodology and apply\nit to conduct a case study on 1,260 malicious emails over a span of 21 years,\n2004 to 2024. Our findings include attackers have been constantly seeking to\nexploit many PFs, especially the ones that reflect human traits. Attackers have\nbeen increasingly exploiting 9 PFs and mostly in an implicit or stealthy\nfashion. Some PFs are often exploited together. These insights shed light on\nhow to design future defenses against malicious emails.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CLw_puQl_pT3g6NYtNQgn3MzSQPM-n2oPGbZVOeMI8c","pdfSize":"2558200"}
