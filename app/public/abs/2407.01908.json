Enhancing the quality of DEM is crucial for various\napplications. Although multiple types of defects may appear simultaneously in\nthe same DEM, they are commonly addressed separately. Most existing approaches\nonly aim to fill the DEM voids, or apply super-resolution to the intact DEM.\nThis paper introduces a unified generative model that simultaneously addresses\nvoids and low-resolution problems, rather than taking two separate measures.\nThe proposed approach presents the DEM Stochastic Differential Equation\n(DEM-SDE) for unified DEM quality enhancement. The DEM degradation of\ndownsampling and random voids adding is modeled as the SDE forwarding, and the\nrestoration is achieved by simulating the corresponding revert process.\nConditioned on the terrain feature, and adopting efficient submodules with\nlightweight channel attention, DEM-SDE simultaneously enhances the DEM quality\nwith an efficient process for training. The experiments show that DEM-SDE\nmethod achieves highly competitive performance in simultaneous super-resolution\nand void filling compared to the state-of-the-art work. DEM-SDE also manifests\nrobustness for larger DEM patches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
