Most of the existing methods focus on maximizing the energy\nefficiency or the charging station profit, however, the reputation of EVs is\nalso a key factor for the long-term charging station operations. To address\nthese gaps, we propose a novel framework for jointly optimizing pricing and\ncontinuous-multiple charging rates. Our approach aims to maximize both charging\nstation profit and reputation, considering multi-objective optimization and\ncontinuous rate control within physical constraints. Introducing a pricing\nfluctuating penalty for reputation modeling and a linear programming-based safe\nlayer for constraints, we confront the complexity of continuous charging rates'\naction space. To enhance convergence, we explore a soft action critic framework\nwith novel entropy temperature tunning technique. The experiments conducted\nwith real data demonstrate that the proposed method can provide extra\n25.45\\%-52.20\\% average JPR than the representative baselines.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
