While their superior performance offers considerable benefits, their\ninherent complexity often decreases human trust, which slows their application\nin high-risk decision-making domains, such as finance. The field of eXplainable\nAI (XAI) seeks to bridge this gap, aiming to make AI models more\nunderstandable. This survey, focusing on published work from the past five\nyears, categorizes XAI approaches that predict financial time series. In this\npaper, explainability and interpretability are distinguished, emphasizing the\nneed to treat these concepts separately as they are not applied the same way in\npractice. Through clear definitions, a rigorous taxonomy of XAI approaches, a\ncomplementary characterization, and examples of XAI's application in the\nfinance industry, this paper provides a comprehensive view of XAI's current\nrole in finance. It can also serve as a guide for selecting the most\nappropriate XAI approach for future applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
