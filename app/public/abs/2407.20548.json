We follow\nthe long-term evolution of a PNS under spherically symmetric and quasi-static\napproximations, in which the matter profile is determined by solving the\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation with neutrino feedback under the treatment\nof multi-group flux limited diffusion. For the stability analysis of neutrino\nflavor conversions, we recompute neutrino distributions using Monte Carlo\ntransport in order to obtain the full angular distribution needed to compute\nthe dispersion relations. We find no signs of flavor conversions in our models;\nthe physical reason is thoroughly investigated. We also argue that the negative\nconclusion in flavor conversions could be changed qualitatively if\nmulti-dimensional effects are included, as similar to cases in the earlier\nphase of CCSN.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
