Our\napproach is based on the maximum deviation (calculated over a given time\ninterval) between a benchmark function and the mean functions at different time\npoints. We speak of a gradual change of size $\\Delta $, if this quantity\nexceeds a given threshold $\\Delta>0$. For example, the benchmark function could\nrepresent an average of yearly temperature curves from the pre-industrial time,\nand we are interested in the question if the yearly temperature curves\nafterwards deviate from the pre-industrial average by more than $\\Delta =1.5$\ndegrees Celsius, where the deviations are measured with respect to the\nsup-norm. Using Gaussian approximations for high-dimensional data we develop a\ntest for hypotheses of this type and estimators for the time where a deviation\nof size larger than $\\Delta$ appears for the first time. We prove the validity\nof our approach and illustrate the new methods by a simulation study and a data\nexample, where we analyze yearly temperature curves at different stations in\nAustralia.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
