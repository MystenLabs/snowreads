We propose a facial animation platform that enables real-time conversion\nfrom real human faces to cartoon-style faces, supporting multiple models. Built\non the Gradio framework, our platform ensures excellent interactivity and\nuser-friendliness. Users can input a real face video or image and select their\ndesired cartoon style. The system will then automatically analyze facial\nfeatures, execute necessary preprocessing, and invoke appropriate models to\ngenerate expressive anime-style faces. We employ a variety of models within our\nsystem to process the HDTF dataset, thereby creating an animated facial video\ndataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ar4KDgcj-hOJ5rGy7QfEApEowDxncCNv9hl2hdMmIHs","pdfSize":"15608751","objectId":"0x05660e84a90d6fc5b1adfafee7f9812d2637204966fcec62dcaa52842105522f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
