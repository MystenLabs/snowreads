Of the synthetic network generation tools\navailable, Stochastic Block Models (SBMs) produce networks with ground truth\nclusters that well approximate input parameters from real-world networks and\nclusterings. However, we show that SBMs can produce disconnected ground truth\nclusters, even when given parameters from clusterings where all clusters are\nconnected. Here we describe the REalistic Cluster Connectivity Simulator\n(RECCS), a technique that modifies an SBM synthetic network to improve the fit\nto a given clustered real-world network with respect to edge connectivity\nwithin clusters, while maintaining the good fit with respect to other network\nand cluster statistics. Using real-world networks up to 13.9 million nodes in\nsize, we show that RECCS, applied to stochastic block models, results in\nsynthetic networks that have a better fit to cluster edge connectivity than\nunmodified SBMs, while providing roughly the same quality fit for other network\nand clustering parameters as unmodified SBMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3t2cLV904fmD8Qb5GfMZS7iUSsrJuyPk7xP6ZFNFZeA","pdfSize":"844832"}
