We provide a semi-analytical model and several analytical\napproximations that allow for fast evaluation of both the temporal evolution\nand the maximum value of the phase shift. The highest phase shifts occur when\nthe binary merges close to the pericentre of the outer orbit, and can in this\ncase be orders-of-magnitude larger compared to the circular limit. At high\nouter orbit eccentricities, the orbital curvature leaves distinct imprints onto\nthe phase shift if the binary passes the outer pericentre during its inspiral.\nBy comparing with phase shifts measured in numerical chaotic 3-body\nscatterings, we show that our model accurately describes the observed phase of\ndynamically assembled binary systems in realistic astrophysical scenarios,\nproviding a way to directly determine their formation channel via single GW\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
