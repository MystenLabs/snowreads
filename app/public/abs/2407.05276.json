Federated learning utilizes local data stored on different training\nclients for model training, rather than centralizing data on a server, thereby\ngreatly enhancing the privacy and security of training data. However, the\ndistribution of training data across different clients may be imbalanced, with\ndifferent categories of data potentially residing on different clients. This\npresents a challenge to traditional federated learning, which assumes data\ndistribution is independent and identically distributed (IID). This paper\nproposes a Blockchain-based Federated Learning Model for Non-IID Data (BFLN),\nwhich combines federated learning with blockchain technology. By introducing a\nnew aggregation method and incentive algorithm, BFLN enhances the model\nperformance of federated learning on non-IID data. Experiments on public\ndatasets demonstrate that, compared to other state-of-the-art models, BFLN\nimproves training accuracy and provides a sustainable incentive mechanism for\npersonalized federated learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
