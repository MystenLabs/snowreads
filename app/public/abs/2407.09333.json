As\ncomputing architectures evolve towards heterogeneous systems, efficiently\nharnessing diverse computing resources for hash encryption algorithms becomes\ncrucial. This paper presents HETOCompiler, a novel cryptography compilation\nframework designed for heterogeneous systems. Leveraging Multi-Level\nIntermediate Representation (MLIR), HETOCompiler abstracts syntax and semantics\nfor cryptographic primitives and heterogeneous computing models, facilitating\nefficient compilation of high-level hash encryption algorithms into executable\nprograms compatible with diverse devices. Experimental results demonstrate\nsignificant performance improvements over existing OpenSSL library, with\naverage enhancements of 49.3x, 1.5x, and 23.4x for SHA-1, MD5, and SM3\nalgorithms respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
