Both Narwhal and Roqual are protocols based on a Directed\nAcyclic Graph (DAG). Compared to Narwhal, Rorqual achieves significant\nreductions in latency and increases throughput by streamlining the steps\nrequired to include a vertex in the DAG. The use of TEEs also reduces the\ncommunication complexity of the protocol while maintaining low computational\ncosts. Through rigorous analysis, we demonstrate the protocol's robustness\nunder both normal and adversarial conditions, highlighting its improvements in\nthroughput, latency, and security.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
