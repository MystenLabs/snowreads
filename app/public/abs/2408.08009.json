We present a multi-target search in dwarf spheroidal galaxies\nfor branon DM annihilation signatures with a total exposure of 354 hours with\nthe ground-based gamma-ray telescope system MAGIC. This search led to the most\nconstraining limits on branon DM in the sub-TeV and multi-TeV DM mass range.\nOur most stringent limit on the thermally-averaged annihilation cross-section\n(at $95\\%$ confidence level) corresponds to $ \\langle \\sigma v \\rangle \\simeq\n1.9 \\times 10^{-24}{\\text{cm}^{3}\\text{s}^{-1}} $ at a branon mass of $ \\sim\n1.5~\\text{TeV}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
