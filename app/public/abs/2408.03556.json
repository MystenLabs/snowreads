FMQA is a black-box optimization algorithm that combines\nmachine learning with annealing machines to find samples to a black-box\nfunction that minimize a given loss. The CSP involves determining the optimal\narrangement of atoms in a material based on its chemical composition, a\ncritical challenge in materials science. We explore FMQA's ability to\nefficiently sample optimal crystal configurations by setting the loss function\nto the energy of the crystal configuration as given by a predefined interatomic\npotential. Further we investigate how well the energies of the various\nmetastable configurations, or local minima of the potential, are learned by the\nalgorithm. Our investigation reveals FMQA's potential in quick ground state\nsampling and in recovering relational order between local minima.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
