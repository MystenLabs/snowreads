We\nendeavour to describe a novel method of inferring the population of RSOs as a\nfunction of orbital height and inclination for a range of magnitudes. The\nmethod described uses observations of an orbit of known height and inclination\nto detect RSOs on neighbouring orbits. These neighbouring orbit targets move\nslowly relative to our tracked orbit, and are thus detectable down to faint\nmagnitudes. We conduct simulations to show that, by observing multiple passes\nof a known orbit, we can infer the population of RSOs within a defined region\nof orbital parameter space. Observing a range of orbits from different orbital\nsites will allow for the inference of a population of LEO RSOs as a function of\ntheir orbital parameters and object magnitude.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
