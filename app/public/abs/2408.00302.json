Specifically, we have\nconstructed a large family of new and general type meromorphic $1$-forms on\n$\\mathbb{P}^1,$ elliptic and hyperelliptic curves. We also established a\nconnection to the Hurwitz realization problem of branch cover for the Riemann\nSphere, which provides an algorithm to determine whether a $1$-form on\n$\\mathbb{P}^1$ (of some restricted class) is new or old.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I3Wta212vDeax-fniLDuIZzDB638ovRixM5yShuR2h8","pdfSize":"265769"}
