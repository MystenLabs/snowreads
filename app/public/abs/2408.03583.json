Our\nalgorithm vastly improves over the previous state-of-the-art\n$0.5008$-approximation deterministic algorithm, and in fact, shows that there\nis no separation between the approximation guarantees that can be obtained by\ndeterministic and randomized algorithms for the problem considered. The query\ncomplexity of our algorithm can be improved to $\\tilde{O}_\\varepsilon(n +\nr\\sqrt{n})$ using randomization, which is nearly-linear for $r = O(\\sqrt{n})$,\nand is always at least as good as the previous state-of-the-art algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
