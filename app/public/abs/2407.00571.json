We present a\nnovel learning algorithm for this setting based on a strategy of partitioning\nthe losses across sub-cliques of this graph. We complement this with a lower\nbound that is tight in many practical settings, and which we conjecture to be\nwithin a constant factor of optimal. For the important class of transitive\nfeedback graphs, we prove that this algorithm is efficiently implementable and\nobtains the optimal regret bound (up to a universal constant).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
