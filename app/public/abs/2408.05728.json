However, the frequency degree of freedom remains largely unexploited\ndue to the complexity of nonlinear process. In this work, we introduce the\nconcept of synthetic frequency dimension into magnonics, treating the\neigenfrequency of inherent modes as an additional degree of freedom. This\napproach enables the effective description of the temporal evolution of a\nmagnon state using an effective tight-binding model, analogous to a charged\nparticle hopping in a modulated lattice. A magnonic ring resonator is\ninvestigated as an example, and several intriguing phenomena are predicted,\nincluding Bloch oscillations and a leverage effect during unidirectional\nfrequency shifts, all of which are verified through micromagnetic simulations.\nNotably, our strategy operates in the linear spin-wave regime, excluding the\ninvolvement of multi-magnon scattering and high-power generation. This work\nexpands the toolkit for designing magnonic devices based on frequency\nmodulation and paves the way for a new paradigm called magnonics in synthetic\ndimensions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HQI2xwvWZ7q5d1swJULfGQ8fH8gfY9axqo5uqTWJA24","pdfSize":"5706482"}
