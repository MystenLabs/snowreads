We first show that for $m < C$, where\nconstant $C$ depends on $p$, the fundamental unit $\\varepsilon$ of $K$\nsatisfies the congruence $\\varepsilon^{p-1} \\equiv 1 \\mod{p^2}$, which implies\nthat $K$ is a non $p$-rational field. Varying $r$ then gives an infinite family\nof non $p$-rational fields. When $m = 1$ and $p$ is a non-Wieferich prime, we\nuse a criterion of Fukuda and Komatsu to show that if $p$ does not divide the\nclass number of $K$, then the Iwasawa invariants for cyclotomic\n$\\mathbb{Z}_p$-extension of $K$ vanish. We conjecture that there are infinitely\nmany $r$ such that $p$ does not divide the class number of $K$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
