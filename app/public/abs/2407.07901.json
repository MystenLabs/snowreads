In\nthe current work, we define generalized $( \\theta,\\phi) $-contraction mappings\nand study fixed point (FP) results for the maps introduced in the setting of\nrectangular quasi b-metric spaces. Our results generalize many existing\nresults. We also provide examples in support of our main findings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kcDWxNdXb6W9QOQ5XYblepJrGK3h2WqCQQb9eAIIZxc","pdfSize":"179331"}
