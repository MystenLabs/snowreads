These studies typically assume uniform interconnections between\nlayers to simplify the analytical treatment of structural properties in\nmultiplex networks. However, this assumption is not applicable for real\nnetworks, where the heterogeneity of link weights is an intrinsic\ncharacteristic. Therefore, in this paper, link weights are calculated\nconsidering the node's reputation and the impact of the inter-layer link\nweights are assessed on the overall network's structural characteristics. These\ncharacteristics include synchronization time, stability of synchronization, and\nthe second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrix (algebraic\nconnectivity). Our findings reveal that the perturbation in link weights\n(intra-layer) causes a transition in the algebraic connectivity whereas\nvariation in inter-layer link weights has a significant impact on the\nsynchronization stability and synchronization time in the multiplex networks.\nThis analysis is different from the predictions made under the assumption of\nequal inter-layer link weights.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
