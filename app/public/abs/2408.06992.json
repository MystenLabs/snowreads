The\nskew-adjacency matrix of $T$ is the $n\\times n$ zero-diagonal matrix $S_T =\n[s_{ij}]$ in which $s_{ij}=-s_{ji}=1$ if $ v_i $ dominates $ v_j $. We define\nthe determinant $\\det(T)$ of $ T $ as the determinant of $ S_T $. It is\nwell-known that $\\det(T)=0$ if $n$ is odd and $\\det(T)$ is the square of an odd\ninteger if $n$ is even. Let $\\mathcal{D}_k$ be the set of tournaments whose all\nsubtournaments have determinant at most $ k^{2} $, where $k$ is a positive odd\ninteger. The necessary and sufficient condition for $T\\in \\mathcal{D}_1$ or\n$T\\in \\mathcal{D}_3$ has been characterized in $2023$. In this paper, we\ncharacterize the set $\\mathcal{D}_5$, obtain some properties of\n$\\mathcal{D}_k$. Moreover, for any positive odd integer $k$, we give a\nconstruction of a tournament $T$ satisfying that $\\det(T)=k^2$, and $T\\in\n\\mathcal{D}_k\\backslash\\mathcal{D}_{k-2}$ if $k\\geq 3$, which implies\n$\\mathcal{D}_k\\backslash\\mathcal{D}_{k-2}$ is not an empty set for $k\\geq 3$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
