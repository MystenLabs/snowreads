However, the change\npoints and values of the piecewise constant hazard are usually unknown and need\nto be estimated. In this paper, we develop a fully data-driven procedure for\npiecewise constant hazard estimation. We work in a general counting process\nframework which nests a wide range of popular models in time-to-event analysis\nincluding Cox's proportional hazards model with potentially high-dimensional\ncovariates, competing risks models as well as more general multi-state models.\nTo construct our estimator, we set up a regression model for the increments of\nthe Breslow estimator and then use fused lasso techniques to approximate the\npiecewise constant signal in this regression model. In the theoretical part of\nthe paper, we derive the convergence rate of our estimator as well as some\nresults on how well the change points of the piecewise constant hazard are\napproximated by our method. We complement the theory by both simulations and a\nreal data example, illustrating that our results apply in rather general event\nhistories such as multi-state models.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
