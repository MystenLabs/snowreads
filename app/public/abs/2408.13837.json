Then the stability of the Fredholm tetrad is\nproved. After that, the notion of semi-compact perturbation of a closed linear\nsubspace is introduced. Then for a of pair of closed linear subspace of a\nBanach space such that one is a semi-compact perturbation of the other, it is\nproved that the relative dimension between them is well-defined. If the\nperturbation is compact, the relative dimension is stable. Finally the\nperturbed argumented Morse index is studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EytT1lwgsSzbrp7ldJkIAY1PUd_Qv-w8-_m28jC-Lq4","pdfSize":"323580"}
