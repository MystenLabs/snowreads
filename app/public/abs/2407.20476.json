The theory is formulated classically by introducing a\nwell-defined symplectic form that differs from the ordinary one, thereby\ninducing a general deformation of the Poisson brackets describing a precise\nclass of GUP theories. In this general setting, we first investigate the\nbehavior of the Bianchi I and Bianchi II models using Misner variables. Then,\nwe study the Bianchi IX model in the Mixmaster approximation, which is\nwell-known for accurately reproducing the dynamics of the point-particle\nUniverse approaching the cosmological singularity. We derive the corresponding\nBelinsky-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) map and then, by selecting a specific GUP\nmodel associated with string theory, we explicitly investigate its resulting\nfeatures shaped by the non-commutative GUP scheme. Our findings reveal that the\nchaotic and ergodic behavior typically observed in the standard BKL map, which\ncharacterizes the point-Universe's approach to the singularity, is replaced by\nquasi-periodic orbits in the parameter space of the theory. This corresponds to\nan oscillatory behavior of the Universe's scale factors, dependent on the\ninitial conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3lhZAqx4gcFSYeIPi3VCrAlimDOl1PCc972Odnj2tVY","pdfSize":"945849"}
