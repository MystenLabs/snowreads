On the other side, in frequentist analyses,\nM-estimators are often employed. In this paper, the two approaches are\nreconciled by considering M-estimators as maximum likelihood estimators of\nheavy-tailed models. We realize that, even from this perspective, there is a\nfundamental difference in that frequentists do not require these heavy-tailed\nmodels to be proper. It is shown what the difference between improper and\nproper heavy-tailed models can be in terms of estimation results through two\nreal-data analyses based on linear regression. The findings of this paper make\nus ponder on the use of improper heavy-tailed data models in Bayesian analyses,\nan approach which is seen to fit within the generalized Bayesian framework of\nBissiri et al. (2016) when combined with proper prior distributions yielding\nproper (generalized) posterior distributions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G0M2SE8uju9UB22thc4ejHwg9ZgDxN45lc-Jm8z0ejY","pdfSize":"427805"}
