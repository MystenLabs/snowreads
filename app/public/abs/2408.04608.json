Methods developed to assess their\nmagnetic configuration have primarily focused on reconstructing\nthree-dimensional representations from one-dimensional time series measurements\ntaken in situ using techniques based on the \"highly twisted magnetic flux rope\"\napproximations. However, the magnetic fields of CMEs is know to have more\ncomplicated geometries. Their structure can be quantified using measures of\nfield line topology, which have been primarily used for solar physics research.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel technique of directly quantifying the\nvarious form of magnetic helicity within a CME in the interplanetary space\nusing synthetic in situ measurements. We use a relatively simple\nthree-dimensional simulation of a CME initiated with a highly-twisted flux\nrope. We find that a significant portion of the magnetic helicity near 1~au is\ncontained in writhe and mutual helicity rather than just in twist. We discuss\nthe implications of this finding for fitting and reconstruction techniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Space Physics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qq--a4rDEfuUCaJf-MPKrghnHUQMUhWnYyLBA4xNv6g","pdfSize":"8223699"}
