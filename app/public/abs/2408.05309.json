We investigate strings governed by\nconstitutive relations where stretch is a bounded, piecewise linear function of\ntension, extending beyond the traditional Cauchy elasticity framework. Our\nanalysis includes explicit solutions for both catenaries and longitudinal,\npiecewise constant stretched motions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4d4NnN4DhUh4LQBc68RRZeWlUalpUHNEFxOIrlSRJRI","pdfSize":"407898"}
