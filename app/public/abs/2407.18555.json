This study proposes a novel approach for automated segmentation of\nmetastatic lesions in PSMA PET/CT 3D volumetric images using 2D denoising\ndiffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs). Instead of 2D trans-axial slices or 3D\nvolumes, the proposed approach segments the lesions on generated multi-angle\nmaximum intensity projections (MA-MIPs) of the PSMA PET images, then obtains\nthe final 3D segmentation masks from 3D ordered subset expectation maximization\n(OSEM) reconstruction of 2D MA-MIPs segmentations. Our proposed method achieved\nsuperior performance compared to state-of-the-art 3D segmentation approaches in\nterms of accuracy and robustness in detecting and segmenting small metastatic\nPCa lesions. The proposed method has significant potential as a tool for\nquantitative analysis of metastatic burden in PCa patients.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gm2Vrc7IAtAqXTnPIv72CUf1XYt92jnMUtHYj0XKny8","pdfSize":"1346458","objectId":"0xa8be2f0f9f09151f7fa61ee6560985ded57e07c2ec32d7cf101a3d8db98edc96","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
