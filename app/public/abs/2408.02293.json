While previous designs have focused on adaptive grasping,\ndexterity and biomimetic artificial skin, only a few systems have proposed a\nlightweight, accessible solution integrating tactile sensing with a compliant\nlinkage-based mechanism. This paper introduces OPENGRASP LITE, an open-source,\nhighly integrated, tactile, and lightweight artificial hand. Leveraging\ncompliant linkage systems and MEMS barometer-based tactile sensing, it offers\nversatile grasping capabilities with six degrees of actuation. By providing\ntactile sensors and enabling soft grasping, it serves as an accessible platform\nfor further research in tactile artificial hands.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
