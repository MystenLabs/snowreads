In a\nprevious paper with O'Neill, some of the authors proved that this value is\nalways $\\lceil n / 2 \\rceil$ or $\\lceil n / 2 \\rceil + 1$ and that it is the\nformer whenever $n$ is a multiple of $8$. In this paper, we determine this\nvalue to be $\\lceil n / 2 \\rceil$ whenever $n$ is odd or equivalent to $18$\nmodulo $24$. We also further the study of odd covers of graphs which are not\ncomplete, wherein edges are covered an odd number of times and nonedges an even\nnumber of times by the complete bipartite graphs in the collection. Among\nvarious results on disjoint unions, we find the minimum cardinality of an odd\ncover of a union of odd cliques and of a union of cycles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ymSuFo5uXqCA1sTaQztHi-br14ixbJ2jVyp25mMIcqY","pdfSize":"295482"}
