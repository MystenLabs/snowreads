In this paper, we explore the impact of\nconflicting transactions on blockchain attack vectors. Through modeling and\nsimulation, we delve into the dynamics of four pivotal attacks - block\nwithholding, double spending, balance, and distributed denial of service\n(DDoS), all orchestrated using conflicting transactions. Our analysis not only\nfocuses on the mechanisms through which these attacks exploit transaction\nconflicts but also underscores their potential impact on the integrity and\nreliability of blockchain networks. Additionally, we propose a set of\ncountermeasures for mitigating these attacks. Through implementation and\nevaluation, we show their effectiveness in lowering attack rates and enhancing\noverall network performance seamlessly, without introducing additional\noverhead. Our findings emphasize the critical importance of actively managing\nconflicting transactions to reinforce blockchain security and performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
