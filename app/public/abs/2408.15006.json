However, its short-range features\nare often obscured by final-state non-flow correlations. Here, we introduce a\ndata-driven approach to separate initial state structures from non-flow\neffects. The longitudinal structure is found having two distinct components:\none that reflects the global twisted geometry of the QGP, and another that\ncaptures localized fluctuations in rapidity. The characteristics of this second\ncomponent, contributing to short- and medium-range flow decorrelations, can be\nquantified by comparing collisions of nuclei with different shapes. This study\nrepresents the first successful attempt to disentangle long- and short-range\nflow decorrelations from non-flow backgrounds, providing new insights into the\ninitial conditions of heavy-ion collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"igq5S0lPPDX1oxnBhc5tXzxheAzLiF8cmdlWG1MyAgA","pdfSize":"1627393"}
