However, conventional methods\noften struggle with the formidable task of navigating the vast potential energy\nsurface, especially in high-dimensional spaces with numerous local minima.\nRecent advancements in machine learning-driven surrogate models offer a\npromising avenue for alleviating this computational burden. In this study, we\npropose a novel approach that combines the strengths of universal machine\nlearning potentials with a Bayesian approach of the GOFEE/BEACON framework. By\nleveraging the comprehensive chemical knowledge encoded in pretrained universal\nmachine learning potentials as a prior estimate of energy and forces, we enable\nthe Gaussian process to focus solely on capturing the intricate nuances of the\npotential energy surface. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach through\ncomparative analyses across diverse systems, including periodic bulk materials,\nsurface structures, and a cluster.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b9rb9XGHddJn-PtKDXbwqoi8hxLlx8tpnXKNiT_ilq4","pdfSize":"554373"}
