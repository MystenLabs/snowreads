Due to\nthe non-convexity of the set of feasible OPF operating points, it is\nnon-trivial to transition the power system from its current operating point to\nthe optimal one without violating constraints. On top of that, practical\nconsiderations dictate that the transition should be achieved using a small\nnumber of small-magnitude control actions. To solve this problem, this paper\nproposes an algorithm for computing a transition path by framing it as a\nshortest path problem. This problem is formulated in terms of a discretized\npiece-wise linear path, where the number of pieces is fixed a priori in order\nto limit the number of control actions. This formulation yields a nonlinear\noptimization problem (NLP) with a block tridiagonal structure, which we\nleverage by utilizing a specialized interior point method. An initial feasible\npath for our method is generated by solving a sequence of relaxations which are\nthen tightened in a homotopy-like procedure. Numerical experiments illustrate\nthe effectiveness of the algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
