We show that they are not uniformly bounded, and establish\ntheir exact growth (up a multiplicative constant): they grow with the square\nroot of the length of $g\\in\\Gamma$. We also obtain $L^p$--analogue of this\nresult. Our main tool is a logarithmic Sobolev inequality on bounded\nAhlfors--David regular metric measure spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
