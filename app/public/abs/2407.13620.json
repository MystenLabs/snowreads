Working in a renormalisable extension of the Standard Model by\nthree right-handed neutrinos, we address the question of how much information\nabout the fundamental model parameters can be obtained by measuring the\nbranching ratios in the decays of the heavy neutral leptons into individual SM\ngenerations. We find that, provided that these branching ratios could be\nmeasured with arbitrary precision, they would be sufficient to pin down all 18\nparameters of the model when supplemented with light neutrino oscillation data.\nWhen considering a finite statistical uncertainty comparable to that which can\nbe achieved by future lepton colliders in the mass range of tens of GeV, some\nparameter degeneracies remain, but measurements would still provide powerful\nconsistency checks of the model. In the sub-GeV range similar sensitivities can\nbe expected for SHiP and DUNE. This shows the potential of these experiments to\nnot only discover heavy neutral leptons, but play an important role in\nunderstanding their role in particle physics and cosmology.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
