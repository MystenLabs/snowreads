Two phonological\nfeature sets, based respectively on generative and articulatory phonology, are\nused to encode a phonetic target sequence. Different interpolation techniques\nare compared to generate smooth trajectories in these feature spaces, with a\npotential optimisation of the target value and timing to capture\nco-articulation effects. We report the Pearson correlation between a linear\nprojection of the generated trajectories and articulatory data derived from a\nmulti-speaker dataset of electromagnetic articulography (EMA) recordings. A\ncorrelation of 0.67 is obtained with an extended feature set based on\ngenerative phonology and a linear interpolation technique. We discuss the\nimplications of our results for our understanding of the dynamics of biological\nmotion.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0HRVXQ3oEFM5ZdmLY7c9GJ7wmobOwBldDrqYyeAi_Wg","pdfSize":"455179"}
