We used the leopard seal,\n\\emph{Hydrurga leptonyx}, a key species within Antarctic ecosystems, to review\nthe different available methods found. As apex predators, Leopard seals are\ncharacterized by their significant ecological role and elusive nature so\nstudying them is crucial to understand the health of their ecosystem.\nTraditional methods of monitoring seal species are often constrained by the\nlabor-intensive and time-consuming processes required for collecting data,\ncompounded by the limited insights these methods provide. The advent of machine\nlearning, particularly through the application of vision transformers, heralds\na new era of efficiency and precision in species monitoring. By leveraging\nstate-of-the-art approaches in detection, segmentation, and recognition within\ndigital imaging, this paper presents a synthesis of the current landscape,\nhighlighting both the cutting-edge methodologies and the predominant challenges\nfaced in accurately identifying seals through photographic data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
