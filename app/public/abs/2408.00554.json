Using\nperturbative quantum chromodynamics, we calculate matrix elements of the local\nand non-local axial current for a gluon target, clarifying their connection\nwith the axial anomaly. In so doing, we also reconsider classic results\nobtained in the context of the nucleon spin sum rule as well as recent results\nfor off-forward kinematics. An important role is played by the infrared\nregulator, for which we put a special emphasis on the nonzero quark mass. We\nhighlight cancellations that take place between contributions from the axial\nanomaly and the quark mass, and we elaborate on the relation of those\ncancellations with the conservation of angular momentum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F7SXApIbpuP4L12mAaGDU_-vPD70PHZE4GcLYNbX7d4","pdfSize":"724964"}
