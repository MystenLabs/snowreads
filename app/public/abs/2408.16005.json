Many previous works have\nproposed sophisticated algorithms and data structures to sample visibility\nsilhouettes more efficiently.\n  Our work presents another solution: instead of differentiating a tentative\nsurface locally, we differentiate a volumetric perturbation of a surface. We\nrefer this as a many-worlds representation because it models a non-interacting\nsuperposition of conflicting explanations (worlds) of the input dataset. Each\nworld is optically isolated from others, leading to a new transport law that\ndistinguishes our method from prior work based on exponential random media.\n  The resulting Monte Carlo algorithm is simpler and more efficient than prior\nmethods. We demonstrate that our method promotes rapid convergence, both in\nterms of the total iteration count and the cost per iteration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
