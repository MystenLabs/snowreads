We apply this to two basic\nclasses of corresponding objects via the Fourier-Mukai-Poincar\\'e transform:\npositive twists of the ideal sheaf of one point, and evaluation complexes of\nample semihomogeneous vector bundles. This leads to $\\mathbb Q^{\\ge 0}$- graded\nsection modules associated to line bundles on abelian varieties (containing the\nusual section rings), built by means of semihomogeneous vector bundles. We\nprove a duality relation between such section modules associated to dual\npolarizations. Other applications include formulas relating the thresholds of\nrelevant cohomological rank functions appearing in this context. As a\nconsequence we produce non-trivial obstructions to surjectivity of\nmultiplication maps of global sections of certain line bundles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
