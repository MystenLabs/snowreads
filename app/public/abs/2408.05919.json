This note provides a brief\nderivation of an effective Lagrangian formulation for the guiding center\napproximation that captures this dynamics without resolving the gyro motion. It\nalso explains how the effective Lagrangian may, for special magnetic fields,\nadmit a ``quasisymmetry'' which can give rise to a conserved quantity helpful\nfor plasma confinement in fields lacking a geometric isometry. The aim of this\nnote is to offer a pedagogical introduction and some perspectives on this well\nestablished subject.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
