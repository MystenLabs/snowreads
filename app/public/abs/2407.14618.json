By assigning different weights to the losses of different\nsample points, rather than the same weights as in the empirical risk, it allows\nthe model's performance to lie between the average performance and the\nworst-case performance. In this paper, we propose SOREL, the first stochastic\ngradient-based algorithm with convergence guarantees for the spectral risk\nminimization. Previous algorithms often consider adding a strongly concave\nfunction to smooth the spectral risk, thus lacking convergence guarantees for\nthe original spectral risk. We theoretically prove that our algorithm achieves\na near-optimal rate of $\\widetilde{O}(1/\\sqrt{\\epsilon})$ in terms of\n$\\epsilon$. Experiments on real datasets show that our algorithm outperforms\nexisting algorithms in most cases, both in terms of runtime and sample\ncomplexity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
