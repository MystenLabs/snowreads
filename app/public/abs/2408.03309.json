The method extracts the continuum physics from\nsolving Schr\\\"odinger equations with bound-state-like boundary conditions and\nemulates this extraction in the space of the input parameters. This parameter\nemulation can readily be adapted to emulate other continuum calculations as\nwell, e.g., those based on complex energy or Lorentz integral transform\nmethods. Here, I give an overview of the key aspects of the formalism and some\ninformative findings from numerical experimentation with two- and three-body\nsystems, which indicates the non-Hermitian quantum mechanics nature of the\nmethod. A potential connection with (near-)optimal rational approximation\nstudied in Math literature is also discussed. Further details are provided in a\nseparate paper.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
