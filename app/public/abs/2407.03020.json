The rise of social media platforms has notably\nexpanded its use as a written language. However, Arabic dialects do not have\nstandard orthographies. This, combined with the inherent noise in\nuser-generated content on social media, presents a major challenge to NLP\napplications dealing with Dialectal Arabic. In this paper, we explore and\nreport on the task of CODAfication, which aims to normalize Dialectal Arabic\ninto the Conventional Orthography for Dialectal Arabic (CODA). We work with a\nunique parallel corpus of multiple Arabic dialects focusing on five major city\ndialects. We benchmark newly developed pretrained sequence-to-sequence models\non the task of CODAfication. We further show that using dialect identification\ninformation improves the performance across all dialects. We make our code,\ndata, and pretrained models publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
