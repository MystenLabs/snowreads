However, quantifying uncertainty on\nhigh-dimensional predictions is still a severely under-invested problem,\nespecially when input-output relationships are non-linear. To handle this\nproblem, the present work introduces an innovative approach that combines\nautoencoder deep neural networks with the probabilistic regression capabilities\nof Gaussian processes. The autoencoder provides a low-dimensional\nrepresentation of the solution space, while the Gaussian process is a Bayesian\nmethod that provides a probabilistic mapping between the low-dimensional inputs\nand outputs. We validate the proposed framework for its application to\nsurrogate modeling of non-linear finite element simulations. Our findings\nhighlight that the proposed framework is computationally efficient as well as\naccurate in predicting non-linear deformations of solid bodies subjected to\nexternal forces, all the while providing insightful uncertainty assessments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
