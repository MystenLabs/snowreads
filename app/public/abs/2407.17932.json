In the presented\nwork, we discuss a two Higgs doublet model with the non-degenerate vacuum named\ninert uplifted double well type two-Higgs doublet model (UDW-2HDM) for the dark\nenergy. It is shown that when the both Higgs doublets lie in their respective\ntrue minima then one Higgs doublet can cause the current accelerated expansion\nof the Universe.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
