In\nthis work, we present a new holographic dark energy scenario designated\nFractional Holographic Dark Energy (FHDE). This model extends the conventional\nframework of HDEs by incorporating specific features from fractional calculus\nrecently applied, e.g., in cosmological settings. In this manner, we retrieve a\nnovel form of HDE energy density. We then show how FHDE can provide a\nconsistent picture of the evolution of the late-time universe even with the\nsimple choice of the Hubble horizon as the IR (infrared) cutoff. We provide\ndetailed descriptions of the cosmological evolution, showing how the fractional\ncalculus ingredients can alleviate quite a few issues associated with the\nconventional HDE scenario. Concretely, we compute and plot diagrams using the\nHubble horizon cutoff for HDE. The density parameters for DE and dark matter\n(DM), the deceleration parameter, and the DE EoS parameter indicate how the\nuniverse may evolve within our FHDE model, fitting within an appropriate\nscenario of late-time cosmology.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
