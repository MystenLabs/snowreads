It is crucial for advancing\nnext-generation intelligent robots and has garnered significant interest\nrecently. Unlike data-driven machine learning methods, embodied learning\nfocuses on robot learning through physical interaction with the environment and\nperceptual feedback, making it especially suitable for robotic manipulation. In\nthis paper, we provide a comprehensive survey of the latest advancements in\nthis field and categorize the existing work into three main branches: 1)\nEmbodied perceptual learning, which aims to predict object pose and affordance\nthrough various data representations; 2) Embodied policy learning, which\nfocuses on generating optimal robotic decisions using methods such as\nreinforcement learning and imitation learning; 3) Embodied task-oriented\nlearning, designed to optimize the robot's performance based on the\ncharacteristics of different tasks in object grasping and manipulation. In\naddition, we offer an overview and discussion of public datasets, evaluation\nmetrics, representative applications, current challenges, and potential future\nresearch directions.
