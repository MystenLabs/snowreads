Yet, they are limited to\nreasoning within a specific set of concepts, \\ie the vocabulary, prompted by\nthe user at test time. In essence, these models cannot reason in an open-ended\nfashion, i.e., answering ``List the objects in the scene.''. We introduce the\nfirst method to address 3D instance segmentation in a setting that is void of\nany vocabulary prior, namely a vocabulary-free setting. We leverage a large\nvision-language assistant and an open-vocabulary 2D instance segmenter to\ndiscover and ground semantic categories on the posed images. To form 3D\ninstance mask, we first partition the input point cloud into dense superpoints,\nwhich are then merged into 3D instance masks. We propose a novel superpoint\nmerging strategy via spectral clustering, accounting for both mask coherence\nand semantic coherence that are estimated from the 2D object instance masks. We\nevaluate our method using ScanNet200 and Replica, outperforming existing\nmethods in both vocabulary-free and open-vocabulary settings. Code will be made\navailable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
