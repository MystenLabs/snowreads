Working with\nexperts representing a significant number of groups working in the ultraviolet,\nwe summarize some of the leading science drivers, present an argument for a 100\nnm blue wavelength cutoff, and gather current state of the art of UV\ntechnologies. We present the state of the art of contamination control, a\ncrucial piece of the UV instrument plan. We explore next steps with individual\ntechnologies, as well as present paths forward with systems level testing and\ndevelopment.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
