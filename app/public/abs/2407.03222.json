These include the\nregularity and compactness theorems for immersed $\\delta$-stable minimal\nhypersurfaces in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ when $n \\geq 3$ and $\\delta >\n\\frac{n-2}{n}$, as well as the $\\delta$-stable Bernstein theorem for $n=3$ and\n$n=4$ for properly immersion. The range of $\\delta$ is optimal, as the\n$n$-dimensional catenoid in $\\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$ is $\\frac{n-2}{n}$-stable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
