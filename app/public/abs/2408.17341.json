There are also hidden structures that generalize\nBatalin-Vilkovisky algebras, which explain color-kinematics duality and the\ndouble copy but are only partially understood. We show that there is a\nrepresentation of the $C_{\\infty}$ algebra, in terms of vertex operators, on\nthe Hilbert space of a first-quantized worldline theory. To this end we\nintroduce $A_{\\infty}$ morphisms, which define the vertex operators and which\ninject the $C_{\\infty}$ algebra into the strictly associative algebra of\noperators on the Hilbert space. We also take first steps to represent the\nhidden structures on the same space.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
