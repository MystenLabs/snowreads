Accurate prediction of sepsis outcomes is crucial for timely and\neffective treatment. Although previous studies have used ML to forecast\noutcomes, they faced limitations in feature selection and model\ncomprehensibility, resulting in less effective predictions. Thus, this research\naims to develop an interpretable and accurate ML model to help clinical\nprofessionals predict in-hospital mortality.\n  Methods: We analyzed ICU patient records from the MIMIC-III database based on\nspecific criteria and extracted relevant data. Our feature selection process\nincluded a literature review, clinical input refinement, and using Random\nForest to select the top 35 features. We performed data preprocessing,\nincluding cleaning, imputation, standardization, and applied SMOTE for\noversampling to address imbalance, resulting in 4,683 patients, with admission\ncounts of 17,429. We compared the performance of Random Forest, Gradient\nBoosting, Logistic Regression, SVM, and KNN models.\n  Results: The Random Forest model was the most effective in predicting\nsepsis-related in-hospital mortality. It outperformed other models, achieving\nan accuracy of 0.90 and an AUROC of 0.97, significantly better than the\nexisting literature. Our meticulous feature selection contributed to the\nmodel's precision and identified critical determinants of sepsis mortality.\nThese results underscore the pivotal role of data-driven ML in healthcare,\nespecially for predicting in-hospital mortality due to sepsis.\n  Conclusion: This study represents a significant advancement in predicting\nin-hospital sepsis mortality, highlighting the potential of ML in healthcare.\nThe implications are profound, offering a data-driven approach that enhances\ndecision-making in patient care and reduces in-hospital mortality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
