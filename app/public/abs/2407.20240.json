This sector faces increasing operational pressures\namidst rising immigration targets, which highlights a need for enhanced\nefficiency and innovation, potentially through reliable AI solutions. The\nad-hoc use of general-purpose generative AI, such as ChatGPT, might become a\ncommon practice among newcomers and service providers to address this need.\nHowever, these tools are not tailored for the settlement domain and can have\ndetrimental implications for immigrants and refugees. We explore the risks that\nthese tools might pose on newcomers to first, warn against the unguarded use of\ngenerative AI, and second, to incentivize further research and development in\ncreating AI literacy programs as well as customized LLMs that are aligned with\nthe preferences of the impacted communities. Crucially, such technologies\nshould be designed to integrate seamlessly into the existing workflow of the\nsettlement sector, ensuring human oversight, trustworthiness, and\naccountability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nL2uPAHewGLZkYdQXeOwQNczoQoQBRlVBBXNGwBBHL4","pdfSize":"1396051"}
