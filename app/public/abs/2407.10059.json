We perform analyses of FFs by\nincluding a wide range of pseudo--data from future lepton colliders, such as\nmeasurements on hadron multiplicities in the inclusive production of two jets\nand $W$ boson pairs, at various center of mass energies, and from hadronic\ndecays of the Higgs boson, including both to heavy quarks and to gluons. The\nhigh luminosity and high energies of future lepton colliders allow for quark\nflavor separations and ensure a precise determination of FFs based solely on\ndata from electron-positron collisions. We find that either CEPC, FCC-$ee$ or\nILC can significantly reduce the uncertainties of FFs in a wide kinematic\nrange, compared to the NPC23 set obtained with a global analyses to current\nworld data. We also discuss the impact of higher-order QCD corrections, and the\npotential constraints from measurements of three-jet production. Furthermore,\nwe describe an update of the FMNLO program allowing for calculating hadron\nproduction cross sections at next-to-next-to-leading order in QCD, which is\nused in this study.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
