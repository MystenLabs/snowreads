We provide an explicit way\nto compute both the optimal domain norm and the optimal target norm in a\nSobolev embedding. Finally, we apply our results to higher-order Sobolev\nembeddings on John domains and on domains from the Maz'ya classes. Furthermore,\nour results are partially applicable to embeddings involving product\nprobability spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
