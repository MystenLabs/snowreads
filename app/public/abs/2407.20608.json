This work presents a prototype\ntool that can expedite the questionnaire translation process. The tool\nincorporates forward-backward translation using DeepL alongside GPT-4-generated\ntranslation quality evaluations and improvement suggestions. We conducted two\nonline studies in which participants translated questionnaires from English to\neither German (Study 1; n=10) or Portuguese (Study 2; n=20) using our\nprototype. To evaluate the quality of the translations created using the tool,\nevaluation scores between conventionally translated and tool-supported versions\nwere compared. Our results indicate that integrating LLM-generated translation\nquality evaluations and suggestions for improvement can help users\nindependently attain results similar to those provided by conventional,\nnon-NLP-supported translation methods. This is the first step towards more\nequitable questionnaire-based research, powered by AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
