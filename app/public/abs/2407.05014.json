These\nsystems are characterized by their ability to be repaired when failures and/or\ndegradation occur. Typically described by transport equations, these systems\nexhibit a coupled nature, interlinked through integro-differential equations\nand integral boundary conditions that dictate the transitions among all the\nstates. In this paper, we address two less-explored facets: 1) the\nwell-posedness and the asymptotic behavior of such systems with maximum repair\ntime being finite; and 2) the bilinear controllability of the system via repair\nactions. In particular, we focus on the case where only one degraded and one\nfailed states exist. We first discuss part 1) for given time-independent repair\nrates and then design the space-time dependent repair strategies that can\nmanipulate system dynamics to achieve the desired level over a finite horizon.\nOur objective is to enhance the system availability -- the probability of being\noperational when needed over a fixed period of time. We present rigorous\nanalysis and develop control strategies that leverage the bilinear structure of\nthe system model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
