Motivated by this, we collect a dataset of billiards sports, which\nincludes the layouts (i.e., locations) of billiards balls after performing\nbreak shots, called break shot layouts, the traces of the balls as a result of\nstrikes (in the form of trajectories), and detailed statistics and performance\nindicators. We then study and develop techniques for three tasks on the\ncollected dataset, including (1) prediction and (2) generation on the layouts\ndata, and (3) similar billiards layout retrieval on the layouts data, which can\nserve different users such as coaches, players and fans. We conduct extensive\nexperiments on the collected dataset and the results show that our methods\nperform effectively and efficiently.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
