At\nleast some of such maps arise as compositions\n$h:X^{\\Psi}\\xrightarrow{f^{\\Psi}}Y^{\\Psi}\\to H\\backslash Y^{\\Psi}$, where\n$X\\xrightarrow{f}Y$ is a dominant $k$-map and $H$ is an automorphism group $H$\nof $Y|k$, acting diagonally on $Y^{\\Psi}$.\n  In characteristic 0, we show that this construction, when properly modified,\ngives all dominant equivariant maps from $X^{\\Psi}$, if $\\dim X=1$. For\narbitrary $X$, the results are only partial.\n  In a subsequent paper, the `quasicoherent' equivariant sheaves on the targets\nof such $h$'s will be studied. Some preliminary results have already appeared\nin arXiv:math/2205.15144.\n  A somewhat similar problem is to check, whether the irreducible invariant\nsubvarieties of $X^{\\Psi}$ arise as pullbacks under $f^{\\Psi}$ (for appropriate\n$f$'s) of subvarieties of $Y$ diagonally embedded into $Y^{\\Psi}$. This would\nbe a complement to the famous theorem of D.E.Cohen on the noetherian property\nof the symmetric ideals. We show that this is the case if $\\dim X=1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qHZnxBvZsuYiTApdZyxPd5gE1W_RbBm81l_UwJ-5pvw","pdfSize":"283289"}
