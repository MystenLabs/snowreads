Commonly used quarter\nwave plates are not applicable here, while multi-mirror schemes are very\ncomplicated. We showed that the simple PET film $\\approx$20 $\\mu$m thick can be\nused to control the polarization state of the high peak power beam and achieve\nellipticity of $\\approx$0.8 with negligible nonlinear phase distortion. The\nfilm can withstand $10^3$ shots at intensity of $I = 3 \\cdot 10^{12}$ W/cm$^2$\nwithout visible damage. Thus, for a PW laser system and beam diameter of 20 cm\nthe PET film can be used for quite a long time. We proved this experimentally\nusing 1 TW femtosecond Ti:Sa laser measuring the angular distribution of the\nsecond harmonic from the plasma channel created in an undercritical gas plume.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
