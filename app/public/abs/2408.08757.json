We also highlight first\nadvancements in the extension of our analysis to the $Z$-boson case. We come\nout with the message that the improvement of fixed-order calculations on Higgs-\nand $Z$-boson plus jet distributions is a required step to reach the precision\nlevel of the description of observables relevant for Higgs and electroweak\nphysics at current LHC energies and nominal FCC ones.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
