This algorithm is based on a quantum finite automaton for a unary\nlanguage $\\mathtt{MOD_p}$, where $ \\mathtt{MOD_p} = \\{ a^{i \\cdot p} \\mid i\n\\geq 0 \\} $, for any prime number $p$. We consider 16-qubit and 27-qubit IBMQ\ncomputers with the special graphs of qubits representing nearest neighbor\narchitecture that is not Linear Nearest Neighbor (LNN) one. We optimize quantum\ncircuits for the quantum hashing algorithm with respect to minimizing the\nnumber of control operators as the most expensive ones. We apply the same\napproach for an optimized circuit implementation of Quantum Fourier Transform\n(QFT) operation on the aforementioned machines because QFT and hashing circuits\nhave common parts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
