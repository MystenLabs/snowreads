They significantly impact the\ncreation of feedback and how it is interpreted by developers. These biases can\nlead to illogical reasoning and decision-making, violating one of the main\nhypotheses supporting code review: developers' accurate and objective code\nevaluation. This paper explores harmful cases caused by cognitive biases during\ncode review and potential solutions to avoid such cases or mitigate their\neffects. In particular, we design several prototypes covering confirmation bias\nand decision fatigue. We rely on a developer-centered design approach by\nconducting usability tests and validating the prototype with a user experience\nquestionnaire (UEQ) and participants' feedback. We show that some techniques\ncould be implemented in existing code review tools as they are well accepted by\nreviewers and help prevent behavior detrimental to code review. This work\nprovides a solid first approach to treating cognitive bias in code review.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
