We employ a generalized variational principle to prove\nexistence of such eigenvalues, estimate how many eigenvalues there are, and\ngive upper and lower bounds for them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WES4MPagi99wuqG8xptK4URh0EzdJ5_fKYhFZo9G7V0","pdfSize":"922962"}
