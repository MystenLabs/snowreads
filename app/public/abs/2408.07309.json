In the present note, we find new expressions for Shintani's\ninvariants by generalising an observation due to Yamamoto who showed that\nShintani's invariants, originally expressed in terms of the double sine\nfunction, can be written in terms of the q-Pochhammer (or q-Exponential)\nfunction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CS5C2C7JJgPIJzrDVFZaARvk8IxYPbtmSaX8kG8-bcI","pdfSize":"173669"}
