It is demonstrated that an extra suppressed $R$-symmetry\nbreaking term $S^n$ with $n\\geq 4$ needs to be included in order to realize\nsuccessful inflation. The resulting potential is found to be similar (but not\nidentical) to the one in the Starobinsky inflation model. A relatively larger\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r\\sim 10^{-2}$ and a spectral index $n_s\\approx 0.965$\nare obtained, which are approximately independent of $n$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
