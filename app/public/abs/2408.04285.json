The reduced first module is the quotient module of the first\nmodule by the finite\n  sub-module defining the torsion linking. It is shown that the reduced first\nmodule for every\n  genus $g$ is characterized in terms of properties of a finitely generated\nmodule. As a\n  by-product, a concrete example of the fundamental group of a surface-knot of\ngenus $g$\n  which is not the fundamental group of any surface-knot of genus $g-1$ is\ngiven for every\n  $g>0$. The torsion part and the torsion-free part of the second module are\ndetermined by\n  the reduced first module and the genus-class on the reduced first module. The\nthird module\n  vanishes. The concept of an exact leaf of a surface-knot is introduced, whose\nlinking is an orthogonal sum of the torsion linking and a hyperbolic linking.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M3zCMTZLn69eIV3fOllc18iJtjiXaNplorOO5B0UNOI","pdfSize":"204540"}
