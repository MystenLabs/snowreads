In this work,\njet productions in p+p collisions are computed with a Monte Carlo event\ngenerator SHERPA, while the Linear Boltzmann Transport model is utilized to\nsimulate the multiple scattering of energetic partons in the hot and dense QCD\nmatter. The event-normalized distributions of the lower-order FWM, $H_1^T$ in\np+p and Pb+Pb collisions are calculated. It is found that for events with jet\nnumber $n_\\text{jet} = 2$ the $H_1^T$ distribution in Pb+Pb is suppressed at\nsmall $H_1^T$ while enhanced at large $H_1^T$ region as compared to p+p. For\nevents with $n_\\text{jet}>2$, the jet number reduction effect due to jet\nquenching in the QGP decreases the $H_1^T$ distribution at large $H_1^T$ in\nPb+Pb relative to p+p. The medium modification of the Fox-Wolfram moment\n$H_1^T$ for events with $n_\\text{jet}\\ge 2$ are also presented, which resemble\nthose of events with $n_\\text{jet} = 2$. Its reason is revealed through the\nrelative contribution fractions of events with different final-state jet\nnumbers to $H_1^T$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fb2cEGFVrCdf52gWGa7bn4-aoXsHW7q6Y5lgdyJQ1vQ","pdfSize":"2902692","objectId":"0x810309721031f0ceba5dd296d2c2c36791c8da41c3610f36a92ee5c42cbabc67","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
