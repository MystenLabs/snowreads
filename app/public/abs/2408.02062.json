This paper studies the asymptotic behavior of the period map for\nI-surfaces acquiring simple elliptic singularities. First we describe the\nrelationship between the deformation theory of such surfaces and their\n$d$-semistable models. Next we analyze the mixed Hodge structures on the\n$d$-semistable models, the corresponding limiting mixed Hodge structures, and\nthe monodromy. There are $6$ possible boundary strata for which the relevant\nlimiting mixed Hodge structures satisfy: $\\dim W_1 = 4$, and hence $W_2/W_1$ is\nof pure type $(1,1)$. We show that, in each case, the nilpotent orbit of\nlimiting mixed Hodge structures determines the boundary stratum and prove a\nglobal Torelli theorem for one such stratum.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OmQ6cXscoN2f0ueItBC6nHqAEbLYfDrTy1D4iSKAQF0","pdfSize":"484813","txDigest":"AN78JG6woK47PyoZGhZzBhszU4eBoZRTVLHRzfJKnyGS","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
