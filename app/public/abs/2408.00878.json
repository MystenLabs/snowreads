However, we demonstrate that for\nmulti-aspect queries and multi-aspect items, LF is highly sensitive to the\ndistribution of aspects covered by reviews in terms of aspect frequency and the\ndegree of aspect separation across reviews. To address these LF failures, we\npropose several novel aspect fusion (AF) strategies which include Large\nLanguage Model (LLM) query extraction and generative reranking. Our experiments\nshow that for imbalanced review corpora, AF can improve over LF by a MAP@10\nincrease from 0.36 to 0.52, while achieving equivalent performance for balanced\nreview corpora.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KEPAny5lqbtmapZ5V4rsFgLIdtG1zH75RoFg6jQL6HE","pdfSize":"1254510"}
