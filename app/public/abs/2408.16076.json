A collision severity map is generated from ratings, quantifying the\nseverity of collisions. A two-level optimal control problem is designed. At the\nfirst level, the objective is to identify paths with the lowest collision\nseverity. Subsequently, at the second level, among the paths with lowest\ncollision severity, the one requiring the minimum steering effort is\ndetermined. Finally, numerical simulations were conducted using the optimal\ncontrol software OCPID-DAE1. The study focuses on scenarios where collisions\nare unavoidable. Results demonstrate the effectiveness and significance of this\napproach in finding a path with minimum collision severity for autonomous\nvehicles. Furthermore, this paper illustrates how the ratings for collision\nseverity influence the behaviour of the automated vehicle.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
