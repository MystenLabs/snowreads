Unfortunately, prior program\nlogics fail to support a number of complexities that feature in the semantics\nand invariant needed to verify the security of many practical probabilistic\noblivious algorithms. We propose an approach based on reasoning over perfectly\noblivious approximations, using a program logic that combines both classical\nHoare logic reasoning and probabilistic independence reasoning to support all\nthe needed features. We formalise and prove our new logic sound in Isabelle/HOL\nand apply our approach to formally verify the security of several challenging\ncase studies beyond the reach of prior methods for proving obliviousness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
