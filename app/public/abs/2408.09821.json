The SympNets are universal approximators in the space of Hamiltonian\ndiffeomorphisms, interpretable and have a non-vanishing gradient property. We\nalso give a representation theory for linear systems, meaning the proposed\nP-SympNets can exactly parameterize any symplectic map corresponding to\nquadratic Hamiltonians. Extensive numerical tests demonstrate increased\nexpressiveness and accuracy -- often several orders of magnitude better -- for\nlower training cost over existing architectures. Lastly, we show how to perform\nsymbolic Hamiltonian regression with SympNets for polynomial systems using\nbackward error analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
