Parallels include: changes in\ngait, loss of dopamine, sustained changes in the basal ganglia, loss of\ntyrosine hydroxylase in the substantia nigra, and systemic mitochondrial\ndysfunction. We identified specific Parkinson's genes differentially expressed\npost-spaceflight. These evidences indicate that spaceflight stressor-induced\nchanges in the brain may become permanent during deep space exploration, posing\na risk of PD in astronauts\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_MZbFO85RwYNTGRoaPea14QOM3N8R7LxlMH2H14VieU","pdfSize":"2368307"}
