We show that, under modest\nmodel assumptions, if the transition probability $P_{\\nu_\\mu\\to\\nu_e}$ around\n$E_\\nu \\simeq 0.86$ GeV measured at DUNE is smaller than the one at T2HK the T\nsymmetry has to be violated. Experimental requirements needed to achieve good\nsensitivity to this test for T violation are to obtain enough statistics at\nDUNE for $E_\\nu \\lesssim 1$ GeV (around the 2nd oscillation maximum), good\nenergy resolution (better than 10%), and near-detector measurements with a\nprecision of order 1% or better.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"m1rKHibU-K0srzg_p5NGdlDeZLpoW66jY4bs3ZIBoNs","pdfSize":"836678"}
