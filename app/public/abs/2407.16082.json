These limitations\nrestrict their ability to measure higher force ranges at high sampling\nfrequencies. Besides, due to the coupling of the Gelsight sensor unit and\nmulti-axis force/torque unit structurally, the force/torque measurement ranges\nof the Gelsight-based force/torque sensors are not adjustable. To address these\nweaknesses, this paper proposes the GEL-OPTOFORT sensor that combines a\nGelSight sensor and an optoelectronic sensor-based force/torque sensor.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
