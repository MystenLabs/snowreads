Using this local Dirichlet\nform, we prove a result on the localization of antisymmetric functions of $p+1$\nvariables on diagonal neighborhoods to differential $p$-forms. This result\ngeneralizes both the well-known classical localization on smooth Riemannian\nmanifolds and the well-known semigroup approximation for quadratic forms. We\nobserve that a related localization map taking functions into forms is\nwell-defined and induces a chain map from a differential complex of\nKolmogorov-Alexander-Spanier type onto a differential complex of deRham type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
