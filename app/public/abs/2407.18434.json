A natural norm stabilization, obtained by penalizing the\nresidual measured in the norm for the space where it naturally lives, is added\nto the local problem in the individual fracture so that no compatibility\ncondition of inf-sup type is required between the Lagrange multiplier and the\nprimal unknown, which can then be discretized independently of each other.\nOptimal stability and error estimates are proven, which are confirmed by\nnumerical tests.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
