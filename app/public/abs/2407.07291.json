In practice, this\nchallenge is common in many areas, such as retail sales, transportation\nsystems, and medical science. Here, we consider this problem for a class of\nnon-stationary time series. The structural causal model (SCM) of this type of\ntime series, called the semi-stationary time series, exhibits that a finite\nnumber of different causal mechanisms occur sequentially and periodically\nacross time. This model holds considerable practical utility because it can\nrepresent periodicity, including common occurrences such as seasonality and\ndiurnal variation. We propose a constraint-based, non-parametric algorithm for\ndiscovering causal relations in this setting. The resulting algorithm,\nPCMCI$_{\\Omega}$, can capture the alternating and recurring changes in the\ncausal mechanisms and then identify the underlying causal graph with\nconditional independence (CI) tests. We show that this algorithm is sound in\nidentifying causal relations on discrete time series. We validate the algorithm\nwith extensive experiments on continuous and discrete simulated data. We also\napply our algorithm to a real-world climate dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
