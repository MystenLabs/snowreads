There are two type of such\nbifurcations: saddle-node (SN) and saddle connections (SC). The structure of a\nbifurcation is determinated by codimension one flow in the moment of\nbifurcation. We use the chord diagrams to specify the flows up to topological\ntrajectory equivivalence. A chord diagram with a marked arc is complete\ntopological invariant of a SN-bifurcations and a chord diagram with T-insert --\nof SC-bifurcations. We list all such diagrams for flows on norientable surfaces\nof genus at most 2 and nonorientable surfaces of genus at most 3. For each of\ndiagram we found inverse one that correspond the inverse flow.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
