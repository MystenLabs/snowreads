This model is distinguished by dense\nmultistability, where multiple states coexist for the same system parameters.\nThe underlying cause of this multistability is that some oscillators can lock\nat different phases or switch between locking and drifting depending on their\ninitial conditions. We identify new states, such as two-cluster states. To\nsimplify the analysis we introduce an approximate reduction of the model via\nrow-averaging of the coupling matrix. We derive a self-consistency equation for\nthe reduced model and present a stability diagram illustrating the effects of\npositive and negative adaptation. Our theoretical findings are validated\nthrough numerical simulations of a large finite system. Comparisons to previous\nwork highlight the significant influence of adaptation on synchronization\nbehavior.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
