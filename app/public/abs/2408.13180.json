X-ray is an effective\nway to test if one is diagnosed with a lung-related disease or not. This study\nconcentrates on categorizing three distinct types of lung X-rays: those\ndepicting healthy lungs, those showing lung opacities, and those indicative of\nviral pneumonia. Accurately diagnosing the disease at an early phase is\ncritical. In this paper, five different pre-trained models will be tested on\nthe Lung X-ray Image Dataset. SqueezeNet, VGG11, ResNet18, DenseNet, and\nMobileNetV2 achieved accuracies of 0.64, 0.85, 0.87, 0.88, and 0.885,\nrespectively. MobileNetV2, as the best-performing pre-trained model, will then\nbe further analyzed as the base model. Eventually, our own model,\nMobileNet-Lung based on MobileNetV2, with fine-tuning and an additional layer\nof attention within feature layers, was invented to tackle the lung disease\nclassification task and achieved an accuracy of 0.933. This result is\nsignificantly improved compared with all five pre-trained models.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
