While soft robots offer increased compliance over rigid\nbody robots, their payloads are limited, and they consume significant energy\nwhen operating against gravity in terrestrial environments. To address the\ncarrying capacity limitation, we introduce a novel class of soft-rigid hybrid\nrobot manipulators (SRH) that incorporates both soft continuum modules and\nrigid joints in a serial configuration. The SRH manipulators can seamlessly\ntransition between being compliant and delicate to rigid and strong, achieving\nthis through dynamic shape modulation and employing self-contact among rigid\ncomponents to effectively form solid structures. We discuss the design and\nfabrication of SRH robots, and present a class of novel control algorithms for\nSRH systems. We propose a configuration space PD+ shape controller and a\nCartesian impedance controller, both of which are provably stable, endowing the\nsoft robot with the necessary low-level capabilities. We validate the\ncontrollers on SRH hardware and demonstrate the robot performing several tasks.\nOur results highlight the potential for the soft-rigid hybrid paradigm to\nproduce robots that are both physically safe and effective at task performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
