We examine the existing\nmechanisms for smart contract termination across several major blockchain\nplatforms, including Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Cardano, Solana, Hyperledger\nFabric, Corda, IOTA, Apotos, and Sui. We assess the compatibility of these\nmechanisms with the requirements of the EU Data Act, focusing on aspects such\nas consumer protection, error correction, and regulatory compliance. Our\nanalysis reveals a diverse landscape of approaches, from immutable smart\ncontracts with built-in termination conditions to upgradable smart contracts\nthat allow for post-deployment modifications. We discuss the challenges\nassociated with implementing the so-called smart contract \"kill switches,\" such\nas the balance between enabling regulatory compliance and preserving the\ndecentralized ethos, the technical feasibility of such mechanisms, and the\nimplications for security and trust in the ecosystem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
