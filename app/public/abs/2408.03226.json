In the present paper, we take a\nset-theoretic approach based on the theory of elementary submodels and the\nSingular Compactness Theorem to remove the cardinality constraint from their\nresult and prove that indeed every discrete subgroup of the additive group of a\nnormed space is free Abelian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
