The player who makes\nthe last move wins. It is well-known that the P-positions (losing positions)\nare precisely those where the two piles have sizes $\\{\\lfloor \\phi n \\rfloor,\n\\lfloor \\phi^2n \\rfloor \\}$ for some integer $n\\geq 0$, and $\\phi =\n(1+\\sqrt{5})/2 = 1.6180\\cdots$.\n  In this paper we consider an altered form of Wythoff's Nim where an arbitrary\nfinite set of positions are designated to be P or N positions. The values of\nthe remaining positions are computed in the normal fashion for the game. We\nprove that the set of P-positions of the altered game closely resembles that of\na translated normal Wythoff game. In fact the fraction of overlap of the sets\nof P-positions of these two games approaches $1$ as the pile sizes being\nconsidered go to infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UPKblgCB9yHiiHMivZZpjX-LhyYiSQqyyTj_1Vtyc60","pdfSize":"848394"}
