In addition,\nthe methods of the classical and superfluid approaches to the calculation of\nthe moments of inertia are discussed, as well as their application to different\nmodels of nuclei. Within this framework, the influence of different oscillation\nmodes and nucleon exchange on the moments of inertia and spin distributions of\nfission fragments is evaluated. The authors emphasizes the need for a\ncomparative analysis of theoretical predictions with experimental data for a\ndeeper understanding of the internal structure of nuclei and fission\nmechanisms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Kr0g-0YhC15gfe06QfaR7giUgu0kBpCdgV-D7n48Vkc","pdfSize":"1069497"}
