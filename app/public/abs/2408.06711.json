(STOC'23) converts any nonlocal game\ninto an interactive protocol with a single computationally-bounded prover.\nAlthough the compiler is known to be sound in the case of classical provers, as\nwell as complete in the quantum case, quantum soundness has so far only been\nestablished for special classes of games. In this work, we establish a quantum\nsoundness result for all compiled two-player nonlocal games. In particular, we\nprove that the quantum commuting operator value of the underlying nonlocal game\nis an upper bound on the quantum value of the compiled game. Our result employs\ntechniques from operator algebras in a computational and cryptographic setting\nto establish information-theoretic objects in the asymptotic limit of the\nsecurity parameter. It further relies on a sequential characterization of\nquantum commuting operator correlations which may be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
