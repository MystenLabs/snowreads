This formulation is fully hyperelastic and uses the Kroner-Lee\nmultiplicative decomposition. It adopts the concept of elastic correctors, and\nthus, does not have any constraints on the amount of elastic strain or the form\nof elasto-plastic behaviours. In addition, the volumetric part of the plastic\ndeformation is described with the corrector of the volumetric part of the\nelastic logarithmic strain. It offers a new and sound kinematic approach to\ndeal with non-isochoric plasticity. We also use the GTN function as an example\nto demonstrate the use of the kinematic relation as well as the implementation\nof the implicit algorithm.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
