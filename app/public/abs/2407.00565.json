To speed up computation, distributed\ncomputing is a promising technique that allows parallel execution of tasks\nacross multiple compute nodes. However, current research predominantly revolves\naround the master-worker paradigm, limiting resource sharing within one-hop\nneighborhoods. This limitation can render distributed computing ineffective in\nscenarios with limited nearby resources or constrained/dynamic connectivity. In\nthis paper, we address this limitation by introducing a new distributed\ncomputing framework that extends resource sharing beyond one-hop neighborhoods\nthrough exploring layered network structures and multi-hop routing. Our\nframework involves transforming the network graph into a sink tree and\nformulating a joint optimization problem based on the layered tree structure\nfor task allocation and scheduling. To solve this problem, we propose two exact\nmethods that find optimal solutions and three heuristic strategies to improve\nefficiency and scalability. The performances of these methods are analyzed and\nevaluated through theoretical analyses and comprehensive simulation studies.\nThe results demonstrate their promising performances over the traditional\ndistributed computing and computation offloading strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
