These\nnew classes of maps are used to characterize almost normality, extremal\ndisconnectedness, $F$-frames, $Oz$-frames, among others types of locales, in a\nmanner akin to the characterization of normal locales via $\\beta$-maps. As a\nbyproduct we obtain a characterization of localic maps that preserve the\ncompletely below relation (that is, the right adjoints of assertive frame\nhomomorphisms).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"4aRjIg6dnyI8oPSHI84NNs4rTCoZSoan3_Np1ZUa8BM","pdfSize":"382386"}
