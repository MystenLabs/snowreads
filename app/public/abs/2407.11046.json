Furthermore, it has significant advantages in\ncross-task generalization and privacy-preserving. Hence, LoRA has gained much\nattention recently, and the number of related literature demonstrates\nexponential growth. It is necessary to conduct a comprehensive overview of the\ncurrent progress on LoRA. This survey categorizes and reviews the progress from\nthe perspectives of (1) downstream adaptation improving variants that improve\nLoRA's performance on downstream tasks; (2) cross-task generalization methods\nthat mix multiple LoRA plugins to achieve cross-task generalization; (3)\nefficiency-improving methods that boost the computation-efficiency of LoRA; (4)\ndata privacy-preserving methods that use LoRA in federated learning; (5)\napplication. Besides, this survey also discusses the future directions in this\nfield.
