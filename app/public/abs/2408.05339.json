However, several systems display the opposite phenomenon\nand move to a more ordered state upon heating, e.g. at low temperature\npiezoelectric quartz is paraelectric and it only becomes piezoelectric when\nheated to sufficiently high temperature. The presence, or better, the\nre-entrance of unordered phases at low temperature is more prevalent than one\nmight think. Although specific models have been developed to understand the\nphenomenon in specific systems, a universal explanation is lacking. Here we\npropose a universal simple microscopic theory which predicts the existence of\ntwo critical temperatures in inhomogeneous systems, where the lower one marks\nthe re-entrance into the less ordered phase. We show that the re-entrant phase\ntransition is caused by disorder-induced spatial localization of the zero-mode\non a finite, i.e. sub-extensive, region of the system. Specifically, this\ntrapping of the zero-mode disconnects the fluctuations of the order parameter\nin distant regions of the system, thus triggering the loss of long-range order\nand the re-entrance into the disordered phase. This makes the phenomenon quite\nuniversal and robust to the underlying details of the model, and explains its\nubiquitous observation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fm4DdYmW3RTYKn1x3yBx0prLRgwhR1F_VVqFXKU2k5c","pdfSize":"6591681"}
