The method integrates mathematical modeling using integer\nprogramming and time-varying communication graphs, which are essential for\nefficient task scheduling. Specifically, the approach utilizes distributed\nLagrangian relaxation techniques to manage the complexity of the problem.\nNumerical simulations are conducted to explore the feasibility of the proposed\napproach for handling complex satellite operations under evolving communication\ndynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
