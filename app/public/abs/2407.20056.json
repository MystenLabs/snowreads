In this respect, the\nrecently demonstrated wire-mediated ion-ion coupling stands due to the\nsimplification of its trap layout and its prospects for deterministic\nentanglement. However, the strength of such coherent ion-wire-ion coupling is\ntypically weak, hindering its practical utilization. Here, we propose a\nwire-mediated scheme for coherent ion-electron coupling. The scheme not only\nenables the sympathetic cooling of electrons via advanced ion-cooling\ntechniques, but also allows to promote the effective ion-ion coupling strength\nby orders of magnitudes via electron mediation. Our work thus paves a way\ntoward quantum information processing in ion-electron hybrid quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
