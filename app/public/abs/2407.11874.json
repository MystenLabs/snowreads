We show a sharp description of metastability on exponential\ntimescales, in a form that is believed to hold for Glauber/Langevin dynamics\nfor many mean-field spin glass models, but only known rigorously for the Random\nEnergy Models. Namely, we establish a decomposition of the state space into\nsub-exponentially many wells, and show that the projection of the Glauber\ndynamics onto which well it resides in, asymptotically behaves like a Markov\nchain on wells with certain explicit transition rates. In particular, mixing\ninside wells occurs on much shorter timescales than transit times between\nwells, and the law of the next well the Glauber dynamics will fall into depends\nonly on which well it currently resides in, not its full configuration. We can\ndeduce consequences like an exact expression for the two-time autocorrelation\nfunctions that appear in the activated aging literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
