However, the lack of interaction potential between hydrated Cs+\nand graphene limits the scope of adsorption studies. Here, it is developed that\na deep neural network potential function model to predict the interaction force\nbetween hydrated Cs+ and graphene. The deep potential has DFT-level accuracy,\nenabling accurate property prediction. This deep potential is employed to\ninvestigate the properties of the graphene surface solution, including the\ndensity distribution, mean square displacement, and vibrational power spectrum\nof water. Furthermore, calculations of the molecular orbital electron\ndistributions indicate the presence of electron migration in the molecular\norbitals of graphene and hydrated Cs+, resulting in a strong electrostatic\ninteraction force. The method provides a powerful tool to study the adsorption\nbehavior of hydrated cations on graphene surfaces and offers a new solution for\nhandling radionuclides.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DLBO87GjcMcasZ2ePu0LAp_v6VhAQJax4LKG0znNpFQ","pdfSize":"1245655"}
