Quantum\nsensor experiments designed to search for very light ALPs are particularly\nsensitive to these effects because they probe large values of the decay\nconstant for which running effects become important. In addition, while linear\naxion interactions are set by its pseudoscalar nature, quadratic interactions\nare indistinguishable from quadratic interactions of scalars. We show how the\nWilson coefficients of linear and quadratic axion interactions are related,\nincluding running effects above and below the QCD scale and provide a\ncomprehensive analysis of the sensitivity of current and future experiments. We\nidentify the reach of different experiments for the case of ALP dark matter and\ncomment on how it could be distinguished from the case where it is not the dark\nmatter. We present novel search strategies to observe quadratic ALP\ninteractions via fifth force searches, haloscopes, helioscopes and quantum\nsensors. We emphasize the nonlinear behaviour of the ALP field close to the\nsurface of the earth and point out which experimental results can be trusted in\na regime where the ALP background field has unphysical values.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
