In this work, we introduce an approach to\npuppeteer a robot by controlling a virtual robot in an augmented reality\nsetting. Our system allows for retaining the advantages of being intuitive from\na physical leader-follower side while avoiding the unnecessary use of expensive\nphysical setup. In addition, the user is endowed with additional information\nusing augmented reality. We validate our system with a pilot study n=10 on a\nblock stacking and rice scooping tasks where the majority rates the system\nfavorably.
