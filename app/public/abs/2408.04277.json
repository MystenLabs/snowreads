We then proceed to study the stability analysis of such\nequiv-CKNs under the action of diffeomorphism and draw a connection with\nequiv-CNNs, where the goal is to analyse the geometry of inductive biases of\nequiv-CNNs through the lens of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs).\nTraditional deep learning architectures, including CNNs, trained with\nsophisticated optimization algorithms is vulnerable to perturbations, including\n`adversarial examples'. Understanding the RKHS norm of such models through CKNs\nis useful in designing the appropriate architecture and can be useful in\ndesigning robust equivariant representation learning models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wW43eUWp4hXMONgS84SbrcerVQe7jXY3l5Y7LJFLi18","pdfSize":"793369"}
