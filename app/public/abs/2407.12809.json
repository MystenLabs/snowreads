Existing models for LMS adoption are often qualitative,\nlearner-centered, and difficult to leverage towards institutional support. We\npropose depth-of-use (DOU): an intuitive measurement model for faculty's\nutilization of a university-wide LMS and their needs for institutional support.\nWe hypothesis-test the relationship between DOU and course attributes like\nmodality, participation, logistics, and outcomes. In a large-scale analysis of\nmetadata from 30000+ courses offered at Virginia Tech over two years, we find\nthat a pervasive need for scale, interoperability and ubiquitous access drives\nLMS adoption by university instructors. We then demonstrate how DOU can help\nfaculty members identify the opportunity-cost of transition from legacy apps to\nLMS tools. We also describe how DOU can help instructional designers and IT\norganizational leadership evaluate the impact of their support allocation,\nfaculty development and LMS evangelism initiatives.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XINoieQfahmy_hJTTidmUGNfVN7jsaU4zNenJ8T4izI","pdfSize":"2844447"}
