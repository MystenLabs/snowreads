Our approach utilizes a\nsparse grid representation of solid materials in the material point method\nportion of the solver and a hybrid Eulerian/FLIP solver for the incompressible\nportion. We utilize these components to simulate the motion of heated air and\nparticulate matter as they interact with flammable solids, causing\ncombustion-related damage. We include a novel particle sampling strategy to\nincrease Eulerian flow accuracy near regions of high temperature. We also\nsupport control of the flame front propagation speed and the rate of solid\ncombustion in an artistically directable manner. Solid combustion is modeled\nwith temperature-dependent elastoplastic constitutive modeling. We demonstrate\nthe efficacy of our method on various real-world three-dimensional problems,\nincluding a burning match, incense sticks, and a wood log in a fireplace.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
