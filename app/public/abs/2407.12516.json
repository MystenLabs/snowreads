However, successfully\ntraining SNNs in a more biologically plausible and\nneuromorphic-hardware-friendly way is still challenging. Most recent methods\nleverage spatial and temporal backpropagation (BP), not adhering to\nneuromorphic properties. Despite the efforts of some online training methods,\ntackling spatial credit assignments by alternatives with comparable performance\nas spatial BP remains a significant problem. In this work, we propose a novel\nmethod, online pseudo-zeroth-order (OPZO) training. Our method only requires a\nsingle forward propagation with noise injection and direct top-down signals for\nspatial credit assignment, avoiding spatial BP's problem of symmetric weights\nand separate phases for layer-by-layer forward-backward propagation. OPZO\nsolves the large variance problem of zeroth-order methods by the\npseudo-zeroth-order formulation and momentum feedback connections, while having\nmore guarantees than random feedback. Combining online training, OPZO can pave\npaths to on-chip SNN training. Experiments on neuromorphic and static datasets\nwith fully connected and convolutional networks demonstrate the effectiveness\nof OPZO with similar performance compared with spatial BP, as well as estimated\nlow training costs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
