We show that when the quantum state is an\neigenstate of an operator $A$, observables $G$ which are completely\noff-diagonal with respect to $A$ have purely quantum fluctuations, as\nquantified by the quantum Fisher information, namely $F_Q(G)=4\\langle G^2\n\\rangle$. This property holds regardless of the purity of the quantum state,\nand it implies that off-diagonal fluctuations represent a metrological resource\nfor phase estimation. In particular, for many-body systems such as quantum spin\nensembles or bosonic gases, the presence of off-diagonal long-range order (for\na spin observable, or for bosonic operators) directly translates into a\nmetrological resource, provided that the system remains in a well-defined\nsymmetry sector. The latter is defined e.g. by one component of the collective\nspin or by its parity in spin systems; and by a particle-number sector for\nbosons. Our results establish the optimal use for metrology of arbitrarily\nnon-Gaussian quantum correlations in a large variety of many-body systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iv77WinxPV-tNgAS0r94Y7ybpLmwllKBDe6tqhg634s","pdfSize":"792139"}
