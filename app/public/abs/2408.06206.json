Such\na decomposition requires significant computational resources for large\nmatrices. We present a new exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string\ncoefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More\nspecifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the\ndecomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a\nmultiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the\nFast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition\ncoefficients in $\\mathcal{O}(N^2\\log N)$ time and using $\\mathcal{O}(1)$\nadditional memory, for an $N\\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our\nequation outperforms currently available solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nuVb2yfj5aBUBIQjsB-s7svNOjpTCUsLfCRPsLFqt40","pdfSize":"438599"}
