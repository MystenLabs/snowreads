We aim to maximize the residual surplus, the total value generated\nfrom an allocation minus the costs for screening agents' values. We discover a\nrobust trend indicating that no-screening mechanisms such as serial\ndictatorship with exogenous priority order tend to perform better as the\nvariety of goods increases. We analyze the underlying reasons by characterizing\nefficient mechanisms in a stylized environment. We also apply an automated\nmechanism design approach to numerically derive efficient mechanisms and\nvalidate the trend in general environments. Building on this implication, we\npropose the register-invite-book system (RIB) as an efficient system for\nscheduling vaccination against pandemic diseases.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
