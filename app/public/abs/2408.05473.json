We establish that both\n$\\mathcal{R}_cL$ and its bounded part, $\\mathcal{R}_c^*L$, are clean rings for\nany frame $L$. We show that, for any completely regular frame $L$, the\n$z_c$-ideals of $\\mathcal{R}_cL$ are contractions of the $z$-ideals of\n$\\mathcal{R}L$. This leads to the conclusion that maximal ideals (or prime\n$z_c$-ideals) of $\\mathcal{R}_cL$ correspond precisely to the contractions of\nthose of $\\mathcal{R}L$. We introduce the ${\\bf O}_c$- and ${\\bf M}_c$-ideals\nof $\\mathcal{R}_cL$. By using ${\\bf M}_c$-ideals, we characterize the maximal\nideals of $\\mathcal{R}_cL$, drawing an analogy with the Gelfand-Kolmogoroff\ntheorem for the maximal ideals of $C_c(X)$. We demonstrate that fixed maximal\nideals of $\\mathcal{R}_cL$ have a one-to-one correspondence with the points of\n$L$ in the case where $L$ is a zero-dimensional frame. We describe the maximal\nideals of $\\mathcal{R}_c^*L$, leading to a one-to-one correspondence between\nthese ideals and the points of $\\beta L$, the Stone-\\v{C}ech compactification\nof $L$, when $L$ is a strongly zero-dimensional frame. Finally, we establish\nthat $\\beta_0L$, the Banaschewski compactification of a zero-dimensional $L$,\nis isomorphic to the frames of the structure spaces of $\\mathcal{R}_cL$,\n$\\mathcal{R}_c(\\beta_0L)$, and $\\mathcal{R}(\\beta_0L)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
