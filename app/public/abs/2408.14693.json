We apply the nucleon energy-energy\ncorrelator framework, where the spinning gluon distribution introduces a\nnontrivial $\\cos(2\\phi)$ asymmetries. We will demonstrate that the fundamental\nhelicity structure of QCD amplitudes predicts a unique power counting rule:\n$\\cos(2\\phi)$ asymmetry starts at ${O}(\\alpha_s^2)$ order for dijet,\n${O}(\\alpha_s)$ for three jet and ${O}(1)$ for four (and more) jet productions.\nOur results will help us to understand the long standing puzzle of nearside\nridge behavior observed in high multiplicity events of $pp$ collisions at the\nLHC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
