This underscores the need to\nbetter engage these users. Augmented Reality (AR) could potentially bridge the\ngap between the physical and digital worlds. In this paper, we present\n\\textit{Augmented Library}, an HMD-based AR system designed to revitalize the\nphysical library experience. By creating interactive features that enhance book\ndiscovery, encourage community engagement, and cater to diverse user needs,\n\\textit{Augmented Library} combines digital convenience with physical\nlibraries' rich experiences. This paper discusses the development of the system\nand preliminary user feedback on its impact on student engagement in physical\nlibraries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
