Since the visual scenes in physical worlds are structured\nwith complex relations between objects, BACON breaks down annotations into\nbasic minimum elements and presents them in a graph structure. Element-wise\nstyle enables easy understanding, and structural composition liberates\ndifficult locating. Careful prompt design births the BACON captions with the\nhelp of public-available VLMs and segmentation methods. In this way, we gather\na dataset with 100K annotated images, which endow VLMs with remarkable\ncapabilities, such as accurately generating BACON, transforming prompts into\nBACON format, envisioning scenarios in the style of BACONr, and dynamically\nmodifying elements within BACON through interactive dialogue and more. Wide\nrepresentative experiments, including detection, VQA, and image generation\ntasks, tell BACON as a lifeline to achieve previous out-of-reach tasks or excel\nin their current cutting-edge solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
