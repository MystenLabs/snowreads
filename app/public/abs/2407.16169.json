The goal of the neural network is to resolve the\ncomputational challenges of conventional numerical methods and multiple scales\nof the model. To guarantee the network can operate uniformly in different\nregimes, it is desirable to carry the Asymptotic-Preservation (AP) property in\nthe learning process. In a micro-macro decomposition framework, we design such\nan AP formulation of loss function. The convergence analysis of both the loss\nfunction and its neural network is shown, based on the Universal Approximation\nTheorem and hypocoercivity theory of the model equation. We show a series of\nnumerical tests for forward and inverse problems of both the semiconductor\nBoltzmann and the Boltzmann-Poisson system to validate the effectiveness of our\nproposed method, which addresses the significance of the AP property when\ndealing with inverse problems of multiscale Boltzmann equations especially when\nonly sparse or partially observed data are available.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
