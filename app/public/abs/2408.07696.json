These patterns can be\nscheduled, such as daily residential irrigation, or unexpected, such as demand\nspikes from withdrawals for fire management. The critical necessity of clean,\nsafe, and reliable water requires water treatment control strategies that are\ninsensitive to disturbances to guarantee that demand will be met. One essential\nproblem in achieving this is the minimization of energy costs in the process of\nmeeting water demand, especially as the need for decarbonization persists. This\nwork develops a control-oriented hydraulic model of a water treatment facility\nwith integrated pumped storage and introduces a model predictive control\nstrategy for scheduling treatment plant system operations to minimize\ngreenhouse gas emissions and safely meet water demand.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"md0mcXhCFZzX5UsgCOYeufc9rfrjKQbyo-a_lGGV_yA","pdfSize":"421170"}
