Existing deep\nlearning methods tend to rely solely on either sequence data or structural data\nand predict the EC number as a whole, neglecting the intrinsic hierarchical\nstructure of EC numbers. To address these limitations, we introduce MAPred, a\nnovel multi-modality and multi-scale model designed to autoregressively predict\nthe EC number of proteins. MAPred integrates both the primary amino acid\nsequence and the 3D tokens of proteins, employing a dual-pathway approach to\ncapture comprehensive protein characteristics and essential local functional\nsites. Additionally, MAPred utilizes an autoregressive prediction network to\nsequentially predict the digits of the EC number, leveraging the hierarchical\norganization of EC classifications. Evaluations on benchmark datasets,\nincluding New-392, Price, and New-815, demonstrate that our method outperforms\nexisting models, marking a significant advance in the reliability and\ngranularity of protein function prediction within bioinformatics.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FJ6ltW7gKrxSFS40YR7-26Z797np_SjCn8DC-8Usrzw","pdfSize":"4805627"}
