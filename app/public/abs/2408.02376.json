High fidelity quantum\nsimulations are crucial for scaling up current quantum computers. The proposed\napproach uses DNNs to model the functional relationship between amplitudes of\npulse waveforms used in scheduling and the corresponding fidelities. The DNNs\nare trained using a dataset of amplitude and corresponding fidelities obtained\nthrough quantum simulations in Qiskit. A two-stage approach is used with the\ntrained DNNs to obtain amplitudes that yield the highest fidelity. The proposed\nmethod is evaluated by estimating the amplitude for pulse scheduling of single\n(Hadamard and Pauli-X) and two qubit gates (CNOT). The results clearly indicate\nthat the method can achieve high fidelity implementations of single-qubit gates\nwith fidelities of 0.999976 and 0.999923 for Hadamard and Pauli-X gates,\nrespectively. For the CNOT gate, the best fidelity obtained is 0.695313. This\ncan be attributed to the effects of entanglement and the need for the phase\nparameter to be accounted for within the predictive model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
