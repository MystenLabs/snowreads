We consider the rational\nfunction $f=P/Q$. For an indeterminacy point $\\text{x}$ of $f$ and a value $c$,\nwe compute the motivic Milnor fiber $S_{f,\\text{x}, c}$ in terms of some\nmotives associated to the faces of the Newton polygons appearing in the Newton\nalgorithms of $P-cQ$ and $Q$ at $\\text{x}$, without any condition of\nnon-degeneracy or convenience. In the complex setting, assuming for any\n$(a,b)\\in \\mathbb{C}^2$ that $\\text{x}$ is smooth or an isolated critical point\nof $aP+bQ$, and the curves $P=0$ and $Q=0$ do not have common irreducible\ncomponent, we prove that the topological bifurcation set\n$\\mathscr{B}_{f,\\text{x}}^{\\text{top}}$ is equal to the motivic bifurcation set\n$\\mathscr{B}_{f,\\text{x}}^{\\text{mot}}$ and they are computed from the Newton\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
