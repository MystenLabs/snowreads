In this article,\nwe give a complete classification of endosplit $p$-permutation resolutions and\nreduce the question of Galois descent of an endosplit $p$-permutation\nresolution to the Galois descent of the module it resolves. This is shown using\ntechniques from the study of endotrivial complexes, the invertible objects of\nthe bounded homotopy category of $p$-permutation modules. As an application, we\nshow that a refinement of Brou\\'{e}'s conjecture proposed by Kessar and\nLinckelmann holds for all blocks of $p$-solvable groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"um9yImZtUNI6TOuEFlEVEJ-y15RZGmcL67qQ7eBTrQw","pdfSize":"334271"}
