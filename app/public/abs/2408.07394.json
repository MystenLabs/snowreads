However, many recent\ngenerative (probabilistic) models utilize neural networks to learn a\nprobability distribution over undirected cyclic graphs. This assumption of a\ngeneric graph structure brings various computational challenges, and, more\nimportantly, the presence of non-linearities in neural networks does not permit\ntractable probabilistic inference. We address these problems by proposing\nsum-product-set networks, an extension of probabilistic circuits from\nunstructured tensor data to tree-structured graph data. To this end, we use\nrandom finite sets to reflect a variable number of nodes and edges in the graph\nand to allow for exact and efficient inference. We demonstrate that our\ntractable model performs comparably to various intractable models based on\nneural networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
