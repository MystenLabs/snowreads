Over twenty years ago, Chow et al., in their study of\na generalization of Rota's basis conjecture that they called the wide partition\nconjecture, conjectured a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence\nof a Latin tableau of shape $\\lambda$ and type $\\mu$. We report some\ncomputational evidence for this conjecture, and prove that the conjecture\ncorrectly characterizes, for any given $\\lambda$, at least the first four parts\nof $\\mu$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
