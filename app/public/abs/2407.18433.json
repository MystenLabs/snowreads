To improve user convenience, manufacturers also\nintroduced smartphone applications that enable users to customize cleaning\nsettings or access information about their robot vacuum cleaners. While this\nintegration enhances the interaction between users and their robot vacuum\ncleaners, it results in potential privacy concerns because users' personal\ninformation may be exposed. To address these concerns, end-to-end encryption is\nimplemented between the application, cloud service, and robot vacuum cleaners\nto secure the exchanged information. Nevertheless, network header metadata\nremains unencrypted and it is still vulnerable to network eavesdropping. In\nthis paper, we investigate the potential risk of private information exposure\nthrough such metadata. A popular robot vacuum cleaner was deployed in a real\nsmart environment where passive network eavesdropping was conducted during\nseveral selected cleaning events. Our extensive analysis, based on Association\nRule Learning, demonstrates that it is feasible to identify certain events\nusing only the captured Internet traffic metadata, thereby potentially exposing\nprivate user information and raising privacy concerns.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
