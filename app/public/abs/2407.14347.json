More concretely, we consider actions of graded\nLie groups on graded vector spaces and study pseudodifferential operators that\ngeneralize fundamental vector fields and multiplication by polynomials. Our two\nmain examples of elliptic operators in this calculus are Rockland operators\nwith a potential and the generalizations of the harmonic oscillator to the\nHeisenberg group due to Rottensteiner-Ruzhansky.\n  Deforming the action of the graded group, we define a tangent groupoid which\nconnects pseudodifferential operators to their principal (co)symbols. We show\nthat our operators form a calculus that is asymptotically complete. Elliptic\nelements in the calculus have parametrices, are hypoelliptic, and can be\ncharacterized in terms of a Rockland condition. Moreover, we study the mapping\nproperties as well as the spectra of our operators on Sobolev spaces and\ncompare our calculus to the Shubin calculus on $\\mathbb R^n$ and its\nanisotropic generalizations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
