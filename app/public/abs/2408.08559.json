This forms a quantum optical lattice due to the cavity backaction, with\nemergent long range interactions controlled by the light pumped into the system\nand thus long range pairing. I investigate the possibility of formation and\nemergence of edge modes using exact diagonalization and singular value\ndecomposition of the Hamiltonian in the Majorana representation, while\ncomputing the mass gap of the MZM. I find that under certain conditions MZM\nappear distinctively. This MZM have potential applications for quantum\ninformation as they are topologically protected analogous to the behaviour of\nthe Kitaev chain.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
