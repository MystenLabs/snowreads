We prove that\nthere exists an entire zero-free function $g$ and a Helson zeta-function\n$\\zeta_\\chi(s)=\\sum_{n=1}^\\infty \\chi(n) n^{-s}$, where $\\chi(n)$ is a\ncompletely multiplicative unimodular function such that $f(s)=g(s)\n\\zeta_\\chi(s)$ for $\\Re(s)>1$. By the Mittag-Leffler theorem this implies that\na Helson zeta-function may have meromorphic continuation from $\\Re(s)>1$ to the\ncomplex plane with a prescribed set of zeros and poles in the half plane\n$\\Re(s)<1$. This improves on results of Seip and Bochkov-Romanov who proved the\nsame result in the strip $21/40<\\Re(s)<1$ and conditional on the Riemann\nhypothesis in the strip $1/2< \\Re(s)<1$. Our results also gives information on\nmaximum domains of meromorphicity and analyticity of Helson zeta-functions and\nshow that any open connected set $U$ that includes the half plane $\\Re(s) >1$,\nmay be a maximum domain of meromorphicity or of analyticity for a Helson\nzeta-function. This extends results of Bhowmik and Schlage-Puchta to Dirichlet\nseries with Euler products.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
