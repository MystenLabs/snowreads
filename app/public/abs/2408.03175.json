Inspired by\nthe morphogenetic control of thin lamina such as tree leaves that robustly grow\ninto flat shapes -- we propose a range of approaches to control lithium metal\nstripping and plating. To guide discovery of materials that will implement\nthese feedback mechanisms, we develop a reduced order model that captures\ncouplings between mechanics, interface growth, temperature, and electrochemical\nvariables. We find that long-range feedback is required to achieve true\ninterface stability, while approaches based on local feedback always eventually\ngrow into rough interfaces. All together, our study provides the beginning of a\npractical framework for analyzing and designing stable electrochemical\ninterfaces in terms of the mechanical properties and the physical chemistry\nthat underlie their dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
