We introduce a proper cost functional, aimed at minimizing\nthe amount of water provided by irrigation, at the same time maximizing the\nroot water uptake, which is modeled by a sink term in the continuity equation.\nThe control is acting on the boundary of the dynamics and due to the nature of\nthe mathematical problem we use a State-Dependent Riccati approach which\nprovides suboptimal control in feedback form, applied to the system of ODEs\nresulting from the Richards' equation semidiscretization in space. The problem\nis tested with existing hydraulic parameters, also considering proper root\nwater uptake functions. The numerical simulations also consider the presence of\nnoise in the model to further validate the use of a feedback control approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
