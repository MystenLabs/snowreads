The DBR structure\nseed source uses 8mm long doped optical fibers with a line width of 3.25k. The\nwavelength tuning range of this seed source exceeds 1.5 nm with the temperature\nrange from 1{\\deg}C to 95{\\deg}C. The tuning wavelength and temperature show\nextremely high linearity, and there is no mode hopping during the tuning\nprocess. By adopting a multi-level fiber amplification structure, selecting\nappropriate doped fibers and optimizing their length, an output power exceeding\n120W of 1018nm laser has been achieved. Measurement results indicate that the\nslope efficiency of the main amplification 77.3%, with an amplified spontaneous\nemission (ASE) suppression ratio greater than 60 dB. he output linewidth is\n10.3 kHz, and the beam quality factor M2 is less than 1.3.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
