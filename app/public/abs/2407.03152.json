As it is well-known that stereo\nmatching boils down to a per-pixel disparity estimation problem, the popular\nstate-of-the-art stereo-matching approaches widely rely on regressing the scene\ndisparity values, yet via discretization of scene disparity values. Such\ndiscretization often fails to capture the nuanced, continuous nature of scene\ndepth. Stereo Risk departs from the conventional discretization approach by\nformulating the scene disparity as an optimal solution to a continuous risk\nminimization problem, hence the name \"stereo risk\". We demonstrate that $L^1$\nminimization of the proposed continuous risk function enhances stereo-matching\nperformance for deep networks, particularly for disparities with multi-modal\nprobability distributions. Furthermore, to enable the end-to-end network\ntraining of the non-differentiable $L^1$ risk optimization, we exploited the\nimplicit function theorem, ensuring a fully differentiable network. A\ncomprehensive analysis demonstrates our method's theoretical soundness and\nsuperior performance over the state-of-the-art methods across various benchmark\ndatasets, including KITTI 2012, KITTI 2015, ETH3D, SceneFlow, and Middlebury\n2014.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
