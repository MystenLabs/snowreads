We establish the wellposedness in many spaces including Radon measures\nspaces, and in particular the existence and uniqueness of fundamental\nsolutions. We also establish a Krein-Rutman theorem with constructive rate of\nconvergence in an abstract setting that we use for proving that the solutions\nto the KFP equation converge toward the conveniently normalized first\neigenfunction. Both results use the ultracontractivity of the associated\nsemigroup in a fundamental way.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
