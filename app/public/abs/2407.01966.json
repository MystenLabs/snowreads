Let $S\\subseteq [n]$. We give the first combinatorial\nproof for a formula to compute the principal minor of $D$ indexed by $S$,\nnamely $\\det D[S]$. This generalizes work of Graham and Pollak, as well as more\nrecent works.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
