The application to quantum graphs\nis discussed. It is shown how the contraction allows to generate the scattering\nmatrices of new quantum graphs from assembling of simpler graphs. The\ncontraction of quantum channels is also defined. The implementation of the\nquantum gates corresponding to the contracted unitary operator is investigated,\nalthough no explicit construction is presented. The situation is different for\nthe contraction of quantum channels for which explicit implementations are\ngiven.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1MB5yPa-I8VeCA7MIqAvBoAwsDd279ZzcfV5eit4T3M","pdfSize":"421106"}
