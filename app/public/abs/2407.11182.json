While ground\nstates of small molecular systems are typically explored using hybrid\nvariational algorithms like the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), the\nstudy of excited states has received much less attention, partly due to the\nabsence of efficient algorithms. In this work, we introduce the subspace search\nquantum imaginary time evolution (SSQITE) method, which calculates excited\nstates using quantum devices by integrating key elements of the subspace search\nvariational quantum eigensolver (SSVQE) and the variational quantum imaginary\ntime evolution (VarQITE) method. The effectiveness of SSQITE is demonstrated\nthrough calculations of low-lying excited states of benchmark model systems,\nincluding $\\text{H}_2$ and $\\text{LiH}$ molecules. A toy Hamiltonian is also\nemployed to demonstrate that the robustness of VarQITE in avoiding local minima\nextends to its use in excited state algorithms. With this robustness in\navoiding local minima, SSQITE shows promise for advancing quantum computations\nof excited states across a wide range of applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3ALMKqHHd1ji7BB6ZjLlV9CAY5AqaG1scg48SfUYM-Q","pdfSize":"582256"}
