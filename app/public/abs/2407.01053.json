This infrastructure\nis powered by three different sources: on-site photovoltaic panels (PV),\nrenewable energy through a power purchase agreement (PPA) and the power grid.\nWe consider uncertainties affecting on-site photovoltaic production and\nhydrogen demand. Renewable energy sources are emphasized in the hydrogen\nproduction process to ensure eligibility for a subsidy, which is awarded if the\nproportion of nonrenewable electricity usage stays under a predetermined\nthreshold. We solve the multistage stochastic optimization problem using a\ndecomposition method based on Lagrange duality. The numerical results indicate\nthat the solution to this problem, formulated as a policy, achieves a small\nduality gap, thus proving the effectiveness of this approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
