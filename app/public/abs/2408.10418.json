Using the hybrid formalism in $\\rm AdS_3 \\times S^3$ with pure\nNS-NS three-form flux, we compute a $\\rm PSU(1,1|2)$-covariant three-point\namplitude for half-BPS vertex operators inserted in the $\\rm AdS_3$ boundary\nand show that it agrees with the RNS computation. The zero-mode prescription\nfor the fermions in $\\rm AdS$ is defined in terms of the ``standard'' spacetime\nSUSY generator. It is found that integrating out the fermionic worldsheet\nfields in the path integral gives rise to the target-space vielbein, which\nexplicitly encodes that the conformal group on the boundary is identified with\nthe symmetry group of the $\\rm AdS$ bulk.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
