As proof of\nthe utility, we compiled a data set consisting of over 150,000 L-invariants. We\nanalyze qualitative and quantitative features found in the data. This includes\nconjecturing a statistical law for the distribution of the valuations of\nL-invariants in a fixed level as the weights of eigenforms approach infinity.\nOne novel point of our investigation is that the algorithm is sensitive to\ncompiling data for fixed Galois representations modulo p. Therefore, we explain\nnew perspectives on L-invariants that are related to Galois representations. We\npropose understanding the structures in our data through the lens of\ndeformation rings and moduli stacks of Galois representations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
