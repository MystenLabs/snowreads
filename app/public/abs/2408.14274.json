For BH case, we show that the LT precession\nfrequency~($\\Omega_{LT}$) along the pole is proportional to the\nangular-momentum~($J$) parameter or spin parameter~($a$) and is inversely\nproportional to the cubic value of radial distance parameter, and also governed\nby Eq.(1). Along the equatorial plane it is governed by Eq.(2). While for\nsuperspinar, we show that the LT precession frequency is inversely proportional\nto the cubic value of the spin parameter and it decreases with distance by MOG\nparameter as derived in Eq.(3) at the pole and in the limit $a>>r$ (where\n$\\alpha$ is MOG parameter). For $\\theta\\neq\\frac{\\pi}{2}$ and in the\nsuperspinar limit, the spin frequency varies as $\\Omega_{LT}\\propto\n\\frac{1}{a^3\\cos^4\\theta}$ and by Eq.(38)\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ScwYoG26dH0IBUOJzCMzDM2K8BK4lP0WwuZjwPmV-n0","pdfSize":"295700"}
