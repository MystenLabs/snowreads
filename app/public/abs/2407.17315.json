By\nemploying numerical simulations, we analyze the behavior of VDM under different\ninitial conditions -- homogeneous, isotropic, and partially polarized. The\nsimulations solve the Schr\\\"odinger-Poisson equations, examining the spin\ndensity distribution and its evolution during gravitational collapse and halo\nformation. Our results reveal that VDM forms halos and central Proca stars from\nhomogeneous and isotropic conditions, with the polarization density fluctuation\namplitude mirroring VDM matter density. In scenarios with no initial\npolarization, spin density remains stable in the halo core but fluctuates in\nouter regions. Partially polarized initial conditions lead to a conservation of\ntotal polarization, with increased core polarization resulting in opposite\npolarization in the periphery. We examine the novel consequences of the\npartially polarized state for direct detection of dark photons, i.e., VDM\nkinetically mixed with ordinary photons.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
