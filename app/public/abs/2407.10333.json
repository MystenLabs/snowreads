In this paper we present an interpretable neural network trained on\nthe UPWINS spectral library which contains spectra with rich metadata across\nvariation in species, health, growth stage, annual variation, and environmental\nconditions for 13 selected indicator species and natural common background\nspecies. We show that the neurons in the network learn spectral indicators for\nchemical and physiological traits through visualization of the network weights,\nand we show how these traits are combined by the network for species\nidentification with an accuracy around 90% on a test set. While neural networks\nare often perceived as `black box' classifiers, our work shows that they can be\nin fact more explainable and informative than other machine learning methods.\nWe show that the neurons learn fundamental traits about the vegetation, for\nexample the composition of different types of chlorophyll present which\nindicates species as well as response to illumination conditions. There is\nclear excess training capacity in our network, and we expect that as the UPWINS\nspectral library continues to grow the approach in this paper will provide\nfurther foundational insights in understanding plant traits. This provides a\nmethodology for designing and interpreting neural networks on spectral data in\ngeneral, and provides a framework for using neural networks with hyperspectral\nimagery for understanding vegetation that is extendable to other domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
