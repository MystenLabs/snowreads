The Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture stands out\nfor its ability to scale model size without significantly increasing training\ncosts. Despite their advantages, current MoE models often display parameter\ninefficiency. For instance, a pre-trained MoE-based LLM with 52 billion\nparameters might perform comparably to a standard model with 6.7 billion\nparameters. Being a crucial part of MoE, current routers in different layers\nindependently assign tokens without leveraging historical routing information,\npotentially leading to suboptimal token-expert combinations and the parameter\ninefficiency problem. To alleviate this issue, we introduce the Layerwise\nRecurrent Router for Mixture-of-Experts (RMoE). RMoE leverages a Gated\nRecurrent Unit (GRU) to establish dependencies between routing decisions across\nconsecutive layers. Such layerwise recurrence can be efficiently parallelly\ncomputed for input tokens and introduces negotiable costs. Our extensive\nempirical evaluations demonstrate that RMoE-based language models consistently\noutperform a spectrum of baseline models. Furthermore, RMoE integrates a novel\ncomputation stage orthogonal to existing methods, allowing seamless\ncompatibility with other MoE architectures. Our analyses attribute RMoE's gains\nto its effective cross-layer information sharing, which also improves expert\nselection and diversity.
