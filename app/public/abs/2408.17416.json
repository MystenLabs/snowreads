We have studied the superconducting and structural properties\nof Re$_{0.10}$Mo$_{0.90}$B$_2$ to 170 GPa. A structural phase transition from\nR3m to P6/mmm commences at 48 GPa, with the first signatures of\nsuperconductivity appearing above 44 GPa. The critical temperature is observed\nto increase with pressure. A complete resistive transition is observed only\nabove 150 GPa, where the highest onset $T_c$ of 30 K is also achieved. Upon\nreleasing pressure, the high pressure superconducting phase is found to be\nmetastable. During unloading, a complete resistive superconducting transition\nis observed all the way down to 20 GPa (with onset $T_c \\sim 20$ K). Our\nresults suggest that the P6/mmm structure is responsible for the observed\nsuperconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
