We adopt the technique of\ncompetitive analysis to characterize the performance of an online algorithm for\nthe defending vehicle. We first derive fundamental limits on the performance of\nany online algorithm relative to that of an optimal offline algorithm.\nSpecifically, we give three fundamental conditions for finite, 2, and 3/2\ncompetitive ratios in terms of the environment parameters. We then design and\nanalyze three classes of online algorithms that have provably finite\ncompetitiveness under varying environmental parameter regimes. Finally, we give\na numerical visualization of these regimes to better show the comparative\nstrengths and weaknesses of each algorithm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JFdpd_Opbshl0ue4Spwg90-JqxIII8RiBpIqKsFZEb8","pdfSize":"506276"}
