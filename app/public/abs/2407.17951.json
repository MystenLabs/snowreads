We call these\nsubcircuits Tseitin artifacts, as they are introduced due to the Tseitin\ntransformation step -- a well-established procedure to transform any circuit\ninto the CNF format required by several d-DNNF knowledge compilers. We discuss\nhow to detect and remove both Tseitin variables and Tseitin artifacts, leading\nto more succinct circuits. We empirically observe an average size reduction of\n77.5% when removing both Tseitin variables and artifacts. The additional\npruning of Tseitin artifacts reduces the size by 22.2% on average. This\nsignificantly improves downstream tasks that benefit from a more succinct\ncircuit, e.g., probabilistic inference tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
