If the set is\nlocally reducible, we say it has genuine nonlocality of type\n\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral 1}. Otherwise, we say it has genuine\nnonlocality of type \\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral 2}. Due to the\ncomplexity of the problem, the construction of genuinely nonlocal sets in\ngeneral multipartite systems has not been completely solved so far. In this\npaper, we first provide a nonlocal set of product states in bipartite systems.\nWe obtain a genuinely nonlocal set of type~\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral\n1} without entanglement in general $n$-partite systems\n$\\otimes^{n}_{i=1}\\mathbb{C}^{d_{i}}$ $[3\\leq (d_{1}-1)\\leq d_{2}\\leq\n\\cdots\\leq d_{n},n\\geq3]$. Then we present two constructions with genuine\nnonlocality of type~\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral 2} in\n$\\mathbb{C}^{d_{1}}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d_{2}}\\otimes\\mathbb{C}^{d_{3}}$ $(3\\leq\nd_{1}\\leq d_{2}\\leq d_{3})$ and $\\otimes^{n}_{i=1}\\mathbb{C}^{d_{i}}$ $(3\\leq\nd_{1}\\leq d_{2}\\leq \\cdots\\leq d_{n},n\\geq4)$. Our results further positively\nanswer the open problem that there does exist a genuinely nonlocal set of\ntype~\\uppercase\\expandafter{\\romannumeral2} in multipartite systems [M. S. Li,\nY. L.
