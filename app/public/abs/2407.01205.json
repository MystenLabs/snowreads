We\nshow that the space of cusp forms for the Weil representation is generated by\nsuch functions. This gives a positive answer to Eichler's basis problem in this\ncase. As applications we derive Waldspurger's result on the basis problem for\nscalar valued modular forms and give a new proof of the surjectivity of the\nBorcherds lift based on the analysis of local Picard groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
