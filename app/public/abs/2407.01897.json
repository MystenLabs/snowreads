This approach effectively summarizes descriptions related to\nspecific images, tables, and appendices within lengthy texts. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that leveraging high-quality OCR data and initially extracted\ninformation from the original text enables efficient summarization of the\ncontent related to described objects. Based on these findings, we enhanced\npopular text generation model models by incorporating additional auxiliary\nbranches to improve summarization performance. Our method achieved top scores\nof 4.33 and 4.66 in the long caption and short caption tracks, respectively, of\nthe 2024 SciCAP competition, ranking highest in both categories.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
