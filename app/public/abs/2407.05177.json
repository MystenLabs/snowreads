Our results include the following. (a) We prove the\nmotivic decomposition conjecture of Corti-Hanamura for the Hitchin system; in\nparticular, the decomposition theorem associated with the Hitchin system is\ninduced by algebraic cycles. This yields an unconditional construction of the\nmotivic perverse filtration for the Hitchin system, which lifts the\ncohomological/sheaf-theoretic perverse filtration. (b) We prove that the\ninverse of the relative Hard Lefschetz symmetry is induced by a relative\nalgebraic correspondence, confirming the relative Lefschetz standard conjecture\nfor the Hitchin system. (c) We show a strong perversity bound for the\nnormalized Chern classes of a universal bundle with respect to the motivic\nperverse filtration; this specializes to the sheaf-theoretic result obtained\nearlier by Maulik-Shen. (d) We prove a $\\chi$-independence result for the\nrelative Chow motives associated with Hitchin systems.\n  Our methods combine Fourier transforms for compactified Jacobian fibrations\nassociated with integral locally planar curves, nearby and vanishing cycle\ntechniques, and a Springer-theoretic interpretation of parabolic Hitchin moduli\nspaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
