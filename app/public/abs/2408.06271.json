Strict finitism is a constructive standpoint of mathematics that\nis more restrictive than intuitionism. Wright sketched the semantics of said\nlogic in Wright (Realism, Meaning and Truth, chap 4, 2nd edition in 1993.\nBlackwell Publishers, Oxford, Cambridge, pp.107-75, 1982), in his strict\nfinitistic metatheory. Yamada (J Philos Log.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1007/s10992-022-09698-w, 2023) proposed, as its classical\nreconstruction, a propositional logic of strict finitism under an auxiliary\ncondition that makes the logic correspond with intuitionistic propositional\nlogic. In this paper, we extend the propositional logic to a first-order logic\nthat does not assume the condition. We will provide a sound and complete pair\nof a Kripke-style semantics and a natural deduction system, and show that if\nthe condition is imposed, then the logic exhibits natural extensions of Yamada\n(2023)'s results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HRJIKSiSpSNZQtz_AFj0Qr_757yjhJHrldINtpWIbMk","pdfSize":"573201"}
