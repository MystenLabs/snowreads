The\ncore algorithm is built around stable multilevel decompositions of conforming\npiecewise linear $C^0$ finite element spaces, enabling accurate error control\nin various norms and derived quantities of interest. In this work, we extend\nthis construction to arbitrary order Lagrange finite elements $\\mathbb{Q}_p$,\n$p \\geq 0$, and propose a reformulation of the algorithm as a lifting scheme\nwith polynomial predictors of arbitrary order. Additionally, a new formulation\nusing a compactly supported wavelet basis is discussed, and an explicit\nconstruction of the proposed wavelet transform for uniform dyadic grids is\ndescribed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
