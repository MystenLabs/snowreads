In this paper, mainly focusing on the\nmeandering stage, we propose an obstacle-aware detailed routing approach to\noptimize the utilization of available space and achieve length matching while\nmaintaining the original routing of traces. Furthermore, our approach\nincorporating the proposed Multi-Scale Dynamic Time Warping (MSDTW) method can\nalso handle differential pairs against common decoupled problems. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that our approach has effective length-matching routing\nability and compares favorably to previous approaches under more complicated\nconstraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
