The adapter serves as\nthe critical bridge between the visual and language components. However,\ntraining adapters with image-level supervision often results in significant\nmisalignment, undermining the LLMs' capabilities and limiting the potential of\nMultimodal LLMs. To address this, we introduce Supervised Embedding Alignment\n(SEA), a token-level alignment method that leverages vision-language\npre-trained models, such as CLIP, to align visual tokens with the LLM's\nembedding space through contrastive learning. This approach ensures a more\ncoherent integration of visual and language representations, enhancing the\nperformance and interpretability of multimodal LLMs while preserving their\ninherent capabilities. Extensive experiments show that SEA effectively improves\nMLLMs, particularly for smaller models, without adding extra data or inference\ncomputation. SEA also lays the groundwork for developing more general and\nadaptable solutions to enhance multimodal systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
