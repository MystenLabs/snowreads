When running on\nsupercomputers, it becomes crucial to optimize the containers to exploit the\nperformance optimizations provided by the system vendors. In this paper, we\ndiscuss an approach we have developed for deploying containerized applications\non the LUMI supercomputer, specifically for running applications based on\nMessage Passing Interface (MPI) parallelization. We show how users can build\nand run containers and get the expected performance. The proposed MPI\ncontainers can be provided on LUMI so that users can use them as base images.\nAlthough we only refer to the LUMI supercomputer, similar concepts can be\napplied to the case of other supercomputers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
