This\npaper proposes a framework in which two separated BERT-based models were\nfine-tuned to identify and classify events in Portuguese documents. We\ndecompose this task into two sub-tasks. Firstly, we use a token classification\nmodel to detect event triggers. To extract event arguments, we train a Question\nAnswering model that queries the triggers about their corresponding event\nargument roles. Given the lack of event annotated corpora in Portuguese, we\ntranslated the original version of the ACE-2005 dataset (a reference in the\nfield) into Portuguese, producing a new corpus for Portuguese event extraction.\nTo accomplish this, we developed an automatic translation pipeline. Our\nframework obtains F1 marks of 64.4 for trigger classification and 46.7 for\nargument classification setting, thus a new state-of-the-art reference for\nthese tasks in Portuguese.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VR5crsfd7w4jpIksF101t-rXvyxtK10cJ7bYb6xUETM","pdfSize":"189632"}
