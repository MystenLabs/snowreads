An undirected graph is semi-transitive if it can\nbe oriented in a semi-transitive manner. The class of semi-transitive graphs\nincludes several important graph classes. The Mycielski graph of an undirected\ngraph is a larger graph constructed in a specific manner, which maintains the\nproperty of being triangle-free but increases the chromatic number.\n  In this note, we prove Hameed's conjecture, which states that the Mycielski\ngraph of a graph $G$ is semi-transitive if and only if $G$ is a bipartite\ngraph. Notably, our solution to the conjecture provides an alternative and\nshorter proof of the Hameed's result on a complete characterization of\nsemi-transitive extended Mycielski graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Dmr6CFPShSqVfvMCjsIhF6l2D1RXO5SKX0jU2IegSt4","pdfSize":"90690"}
