We aimed to develop a forearm\nbased on the body proportion, weight ratio, muscle arrangement, and joint\nperformance of the human body in order to bring out its benefits. For this, we\nneed to miniaturize the muscle modules. To approach this task, we arranged two\nmuscle motors inside one muscle module, and used the space effectively by\nutilizing common parts. In addition, we enabled the muscle module to also be\nused as the bone structure. Moreover, we used miniature motors and developed a\nway to dissipate the motor heat to the bone structure. Through these\napproaches, we succeeded in developing a forearm with a radioulnar joint based\non the body proportion, weight ratio, muscle arrangement, and joint performance\nof the human body, while keeping maintainability and reliability. Also, we\nperformed some motions such as soldering, opening a book, turning a screw, and\nbadminton swinging using the benefits of the radioulnar structure, which have\nnot been discussed before, and verified that Kengoro can realize skillful\nmotions using the radioulnar joint like a human.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
