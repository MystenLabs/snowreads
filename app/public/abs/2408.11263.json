{"id":"2408.11263","title":"Privacy-Preserving Data Management using Blockchains","authors":"Michael Mireku Kwakye","authorsParsed":[["Kwakye","Michael Mireku",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 21 Aug 2024 01:10:39 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-22","timestamp":1724202639000,"abstract":"  Privacy-preservation policies are guidelines formulated to protect data\nproviders private data. Previous privacy-preservation methodologies have\naddressed privacy in which data are permanently stored in repositories and\ndisconnected from changing data provider privacy preferences. This occurrence\nbecomes evident as data moves to another data repository. Hence, the need for\ndata providers to control and flexibly update their existing privacy\npreferences due to changing data usage continues to remain a problem. This\npaper proposes a blockchain-based methodology for preserving data providers\nprivate and sensitive data. The research proposes to tightly couple data\nproviders private attribute data element to privacy preferences and data\naccessor data element into a privacy tuple. The implementation presents a\nframework of tightly-coupled relational database and blockchains. This delivers\nsecure, tamper-resistant, and query-efficient platform for data management and\nquery processing. The evaluation analysis from the implementation validates\nefficient query processing of privacy-aware queries on the privacy\ninfrastructure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
