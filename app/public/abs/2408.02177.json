However, the interplay between H$z$RGs and the\nlarge-scale environment remains unclear. To understand the connection between\nH$z$RGs and the surrounding obscured star formation, we investigated the\noverdensity and spatial distribution of submillimeter-bright galaxies (SMGs) in\nthe field of 4C\\,23.56, a well-known H$z$RG at $z=2.48$. We used SCUBA-2 data\n($\\sigma\\,{\\sim}\\,0.6$\\,mJy) to estimate the $850\\,{\\rm \\mu m}$ source number\ncounts and examine the radial and azimuthal overdensities of the $850\\,{\\rm \\mu\nm}$ sources in the vicinity of the H$z$RG. The angular distribution of SMGs is\ninhomogeneous around the H$z$RG 4C\\,23.56, with fewer sources oriented along\nthe radio jet. We also find a significant overdensity of bright SMGs (${\\rm\nS}_{850\\rm\\,\\mu m}\\geq5\\,$mJy). Faint and bright SMGs exhibit different spatial\ndistributions. The former are concentrated in the core region, while the latter\nprefer the outskirts of the H$z$RG field. High-resolution observations show\nthat the seven brightest SMGs in our sample are intrinsically bright,\nsuggesting that the overdensity of bright SMGs is less likely due to the source\nmultiplicity.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FrGYAcrF5PfDpPjmcXepD5av1--1mHogzDzFJxpBko4","pdfSize":"1522624"}
