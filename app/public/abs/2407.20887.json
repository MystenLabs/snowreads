This is achieved by establishing a sharp $L^{5/3}$ estimate for a\nmaximal operator closely associated with the Bochner-Riesz multiplier operator.\nThe estimate depends on a novel refined $L^2$ estimate, which may be of\nindependent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
