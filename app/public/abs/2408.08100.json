Merging allows to combine event samples of\ndifferent parton multiplicities with logarithmically enhanced radiation from\nparton shower algorithms, without double-counting. Here we consider events up\nto five outgoing partons and present results for jet analyses compared to\nexperimental data provided by the ZEUS and H1 collaborations of the HERA\ncollider. The analyses span a wide range in photon virtuality, and the results\nshow that the multi-jet merging improves jet modelling especially for low\nvirtuality events.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"IcSNdGpxJdi_gqaxqM5xeZaJ9F8NOruQ6W58p39obpY","pdfSize":"488188"}
