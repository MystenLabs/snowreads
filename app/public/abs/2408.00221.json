These approaches achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration\naccuracy and are generally fast. However, deep learning (DL) approaches are, in\ncontrast to conventional non-deep-learning-based approaches, anatomy-specific.\nRecently, a universal deep registration approach, uniGradICON, has been\nproposed. However, uniGradICON focuses on monomodal image registration. In this\nwork, we therefore develop multiGradICON as a first step towards universal\n*multimodal* medical image registration. Specifically, we show that 1) we can\ntrain a DL registration model that is suitable for monomodal *and* multimodal\nregistration; 2) loss function randomization can increase multimodal\nregistration accuracy; and 3) training a model with multimodal data helps\nmultimodal generalization. Our code and the multiGradICON model are available\nat https://github.com/uncbiag/uniGradICON.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
