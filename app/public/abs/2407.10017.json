However, these methods suffer from a\nquadratic scaling with the physical simulation time, and therefore they become\nchallenging in the presence of multiple environments. This is particularly true\nwhen fermionic environments, well-known to be highly correlated, are\nconsidered. In this work we first illustrate how a thermo-chemical modulation\nof the spectral density allows replacing the original fermionic environments\nwith equivalent, but simpler, ones. Moreover, we show how this procedure\nreduces the number of chains needed to model multiple environments. We then\nprovide a derivation of the fermionic Markovian closure construction,\nconsisting of a small collection of damped fermionic modes undergoing a\nLindblad-type dynamics and mimicking a continuum of bath modes. We describe, in\nparticular, how the use of the Markovian closure allows for a polynomial\nreduction of the time complexity of chain-mapping based algorithms when\nlong-time dynamics are needed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7WRck2QZnMWIASQK7r_NcInls_TTBGh00-iqiV47M_g","pdfSize":"503549"}
