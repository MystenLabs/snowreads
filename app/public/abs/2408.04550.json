As a consequence, a time-dependent axion will lead to\nthe generation of fermions by amplifying their vacuum fluctuations. We provide\nthe formulae that allow one to determine the spectra of produced fermions in a\ngeneric Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker Universe with flat spatial slices.\nThen we derive simple approximate formulae for the spectra of the produced\nfermions, as a function of the model parameters, in the specific cases of a\nradiation- and a matter-dominated Universe, in the regime in which the\nbackreaction of the produced fermions on the axionic background can be\nneglected.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-8C3vwe-URdl53ylsqtUN8ib6bfgJSZbXko-SWAez6w","pdfSize":"1065119"}
