This study proposes an approach that\ncombines music with scientific concepts, focusing on the sonification of\nsatellite images as the core. A generative musical composition system is\ndeveloped that uses visual data to create accessible and emotional auditory\nexperiences, thus enriching the fields of scientific dissemination and artistic\nexpression. It concludes with an example of the algorithm's use in a musical\ncomposition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Ot4zCCxVdY9phD_pQYaib3V20gx9pNZM596d-Mn628s","pdfSize":"4948074"}
