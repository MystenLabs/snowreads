FLEURS-R maintains an N-way parallel speech corpus in 102 languages as\nFLEURS, with improved audio quality and fidelity by applying the speech\nrestoration model Miipher. The aim of FLEURS-R is to advance speech technology\nin more languages and catalyze research including text-to-speech (TTS) and\nother speech generation tasks in low-resource languages. Comprehensive\nevaluations with the restored speech and TTS baseline models trained from the\nnew corpus show that the new corpus obtained significantly improved speech\nquality while maintaining the semantic contents of the speech. The corpus is\npublicly released via Hugging Face.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L2SumJ4CIClaJyXkvyWweo5MrjOBrwTV8YNd5qASedE","pdfSize":"214952"}
