Our goal is to recover both the\nmetric $g$ and the potential $V$ from the (partial) Neumann-to-Dirichlet (ND)\nmap on $\\Gamma\\times \\{0\\}$ with $\\Gamma\\Subset \\Omega$. Our approach can be\ndivided into three steps:\n  Step 1. Boundary determination. We establish a novel boundary determination\nto identify $(g,V)$ on $\\Gamma$ with help of suitable approximate solutions for\nthe Schr\\\"odinger equation with inhomogeneous Neumann boundary condition.\n  Step 2. Relation to a nonlocal elliptic inverse problem. We relate inverse\nproblems for the Schr\\\"odinger equation with the nonlocal elliptic equation\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eq: a2}\n  (-\\Delta_g+V)^{1/2}v=f\\text{ in }\\Omega,\n  \\end{equation}\n  via the Caffarelli--Silvestre type extension, where the measurements are\nencoded in the source-to-solution map. The nonlocality of this inverse problem\nallows us to recover the associated heat kernel.\n  Step 3. Reduction to an inverse problem for a wave equation. Combining the\nknowledge of the heat kernel with the Kannai type transmutation formula, we\ntransfer the inverse problem for the nonlocal equation to an inverse problem\nfor the wave equation\n  \\begin{equation}\n  \\label{eq: a3}\n  (\\partial_t^2-\\Delta_g+V)w=F\\text{ in }\\Omega\\times (0,\\infty),\n  \\end{equation}\n  where the measurement operator is also the source-to-solution map. We can\nfinally determine $(g,V)$ on $\\Omega\\setminus\\Gamma$ by solving the inverse\nproblem for the wave equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
