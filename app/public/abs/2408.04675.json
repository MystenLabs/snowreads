Ideally, considering the\nchecklist before submission can favorably impact the writing of a research\npaper. However, the checklist is often filled out at the last moment. In this\nwork, we introduce ACLReady, a retrieval-augmented language model application\nthat can be used to empower authors to reflect on their work and assist authors\nwith the ACL checklist. To test the effectiveness of the system, we conducted a\nqualitative study with 13 users which shows that 92% of users found the\napplication useful and easy to use as well as 77% of the users found that the\napplication provided the information they expected.
