One category among the\nmethods are collective-variable-based methods, which rely on predefined\ncollective variables (CVs). The difficulty of selecting a few important CVs\nhinders the methods to be applied to large systems easily. Here we present a\nCV-based enhanced sampling method RiD-kit, which could handle a large number of\nCVs and perform efficient sampling. The method could be applied to various\nkinds of systems, including biomolecules, chemical reactions and materials. In\nthis protocol, we guide the users through all phases of the RiD-kit workflow,\nfrom preparing the input files, setting the simulation parameters and analyzing\nthe results. The RiD-kit workflow provides an efficient and user-friendly\ncommand line tool which could submit jobs to various kinds of platforms\nincluding the high-performance computers (HPC), cloud server and local\nmachines.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tpwpA6-ppQ6Ub-T9A_vkfyacInseZZBdJFGU_5w4rIg","pdfSize":"1862150"}
