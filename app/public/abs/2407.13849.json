However, to increase its predictive power beyond\nits linear log-risk, it was extended to utilize deep neural networks\nsacrificing its explainability. In this work, we explore the potential of\nself-explaining neural networks (SENN) for survival analysis. we propose a new\nlocally explainable Cox proportional hazards model, named CoxSE, by estimating\na locally-linear log-hazard function using the SENN. We also propose a\nmodification to the Neural additive (NAM) models hybrid with SENN, named\nCoxSENAM, which enables the control of the stability and consistency of the\ngenerated explanations. Several experiments using synthetic and real datasets\nhave been performed comparing with a NAM-based model, DeepSurv model explained\nwith SHAP, and a linear CPH model. The results show that, unlike the NAM-based\nmodel, the SENN-based model can provide more stable and consistent explanations\nwhile maintaining the same expressiveness power of the black-box model. The\nresults also show that, due to their structural design, NAM-based models\ndemonstrated better robustness to non-informative features. Among these models,\nthe hybrid model exhibited the best robustness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
