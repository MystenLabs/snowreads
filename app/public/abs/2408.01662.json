However, most existing dimension\nreduction techniques do not account for the spatial correlation between\nobservations and do not take the downstream modeling task into consideration\nwhen finding the lower-dimensional representation. We formalize the closeness\nof approximation to the original data and the utility of lower-dimensional\nscores for downstream modeling as two complementary, sometimes conflicting,\nmetrics for dimension reduction. We illustrate how existing methodologies fall\ninto this framework and propose a flexible dimension reduction algorithm that\nachieves the optimal trade-off. We derive a computationally simple form for our\nalgorithm and illustrate its performance through simulation studies, as well as\ntwo applications in air pollution modeling and spatial transcriptomics.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2S_Xms1BnjaXECUbWwBJ4rz1E0G7i6qBDc0ghAz3CPc","pdfSize":"2220300"}
