Employing an\n\\emph{informed adversary} threat model, we develop a neural network capable of\nreconstructing high-dimensional data from low-dimensional embeddings.\n  We evaluate six popular dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, sparse\nrandom projection (SRP), multidimensional scaling (MDS), Isomap, $t$-SNE, and\nUMAP. Using both MNIST and NIH Chest X-ray datasets, we perform a qualitative\nanalysis to identify key factors affecting reconstruction quality. Furthermore,\nwe assess the effectiveness of an additive noise mechanism in mitigating these\nreconstruction attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
