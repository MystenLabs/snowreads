The\nnew method keeps such properties of the classical GMRES algorithm as follows.\nBoth bases of the search space and its image are maintained orthonormal that\nincreases the robustness of the method. Moreover there is no need to store both\nbases since they are effectively represented within a common basis. Along with\nit our method is theoretically equivalent to the GCR method extended for a case\nof multiple right-hand sides but is more numerically robust and requires less\nmemory.\n  The main result of the paper is a mechanism of adding an arbitrary direction\nvector to the search space that can be easily adopted for flexible GMRES or\nGMRES with deflated restarting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
