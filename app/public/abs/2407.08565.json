While the IM test was originally developed to test for\nmodel misspecification, our study addresses that the test can also be used to\ntest for the normality of innovations in various time series models. We provide\nsufficient conditions under which the limiting null distribution of the test\nstatistics exists. As applications, a first-order threshold moving average\nmodel, GARCH model and double autoregressive model are considered. We conduct\nsimulations to evaluate the performance of the proposed test and compare with\nother tests, and provide a real data analysis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
