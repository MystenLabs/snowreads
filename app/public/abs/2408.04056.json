Our\napproach has the advantage of simplicity in its computation, eliminating the\nneed for resampling or simulations to obtain critical values. Additionally, it\ncomes with a known null/alternative distribution, facilitating easy\ncalculations for power levels and sample size planning. The paper indeed also\ndiscusses the topic of power analysis in segmented regression, namely the\nestimation of sample size or power level when the study data being collected\nfocuses on a covariate expected to affect the mean response via a piecewise\nrelationship with an unknown breakpoint. We run simulation results showing that\nour method outperforms other Tests for a Change Point (TFCP) with both normally\ndistributed and binary data and carry out a real SAT Critical reading data\nanalysis. The proposed test contributes to the framework of psychometric\nresearch, and it is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) and\nin a more user-friendly Shiny App, both illustrated at the end of the paper.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"ENyrbD_w8sWN1wiRvYf4mG4SRnV7dXO__prpiFg7Uag","pdfSize":"493045"}
