Understanding the design-performance relationship becomes\nincreasingly complicated for nonlinear deformations. Though successful at\nmodeling elastic deformations, simulation-based techniques struggle to model\nlarge elastoplastic deformations exhibiting plasticity and densification. We\npropose a neural network trained on experimental data to learn the\ndesign-performance relationship between 3D-printable shells and their\ncompressive force-displacement behavior. Trained on thousands of physical\nexperiments, our network aids in both forward and inverse design to generate\nshells exhibiting desired elastoplastic and hyperelastic deformations. We\nvalidate a subset of generated designs through fabrication and testing.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate the network's inverse design efficacy in generating\ncustom shells for several applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GevruYo0ypLPmnMcU5w-iDNJmroL2BBAJ2TXs_hA9fg","pdfSize":"7874268"}
