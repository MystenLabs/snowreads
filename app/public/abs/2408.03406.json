These results unify\nand generalize most known upper bounds for random Tur\\'an numbers of degenerate\nhypergraphs of uniformity at least 3, and also provide new tight bounds for the\nrandom Tur\\'an numbers of expansions of theta graphs and complete bipartite\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
