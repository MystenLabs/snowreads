This\ncompilation is split in two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder Measurements\nsample comprising of 20 recent measurements, primarily from the past four\nyears, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic distance\nindicators. B.One-Step Measurements sample including 33 measurements of $H_0$\nthat are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale and the distance\nladder approach. These 33 measurements are derived from diverse probes such as\nCosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, strong lensing, megamasers etc.\nStatistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between the two samples.\nThe distance ladder-based sample yields a best fit $H_0 = 72.8 \\pm 0.5$ km\ns$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\\chi^2/dof=0.51$ indicating some correlations. The\none-step measurements result in $H_0 = 69.0 \\pm 0.48$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$\nwith $\\chi^2/dof=1.37$ indicating some internal tension. If two outlier\nmeasurements are removed (TDCOSMO.I-2019 known to have systematics and\nMCP-2020) the best fit of the one step sample reduces to $H_0 = 68.3 \\pm 0.5$\nkm s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$ with $\\chi^2/dof=0.95$, fully self-consistent and\nconsistent with sound horizon based measurements. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nyields a p-value of 0.0001 suggesting that the two samples are fundamentally\ndistinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\\% that they are drawn from the\nsame underlying distribution. These findings suggest that the core of the\nHubble tension lies not between early and late-time measurements, but between\ndistance ladder measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This\ndiscrepancy points to either a systematic effect influencing all distance\nladder measurements or a fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one\nrung of the distance ladder.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
