Although existing lightweight detection\nnetworks are highly efficient, they are susceptible to false or missed\ndetection of non-salient defects due to the lack of semantic information. In\ncontrast, the diffusion model can generate higher-order semantic\nrepresentations in the denoising process. Therefore, the aim of this paper is\nto incorporate the higher-order modelling capability of the diffusion model\ninto the detection model, so as to better assist in the classification and\nlocalization of difficult targets. First, the denoising diffusion probabilistic\nmodel (DDPM) is pre-trained to extract the features of denoising process to\nconstruct as a feature repository. In particular, to avoid the potential\nbottleneck of memory caused by the dataloader loading high-dimensional\nfeatures, a residual convolutional variational auto-encoder (ResVAE) is\ndesigned to further compress the feature repository. The image is fed into both\nimage backbone and feature repository for feature extraction and querying\nrespectively. The queried latent features are reconstructed and filtered to\nobtain high-dimensional DDPM features. A dynamic cross-fusion method is\nproposed to fully refine the contextual features of DDPM to optimize the\ndetection model. Finally, we employ knowledge distillation to migrate the\nhigher-order modelling capabilities back into the lightweight baseline model\nwithout additional efficiency cost. Experiment results demonstrate that our\nmethod achieves competitive results on several industrial datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
