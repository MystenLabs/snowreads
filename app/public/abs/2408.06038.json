Starting with\naccurate density and conditional potential for a one-dimensional model of a\nstretched heteronuclear molecule, we provide a proof-of-principle example of an\napproximation that accurately reproduces the step of the exact Kohn-Sham\npotential without resorting to the Kohn-Sham orbitals, virtual or occupied. We\nalso test our strategy using the approximate conditional potentials\ncorresponding to the strictly-correlated-electron and the exact-exchange\nfunctionals. The results are encouraging in that the initial approximations are\nmodified in the qualitatively correct way: decreasing correlation in the former\nand increasing it in the latter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
