For\n$n$ odd, Buchanan, Clifton, Culver, Nie, O'Neill, Rombach and Yin showed that\nthe odd cover number of $K_n$ is equal to $(n+1)/2$ or $(n+3)/2$, and they\nconjectured that it is always $(n+1)/2$. We prove this conjecture.\n  For $n$ even, Babai and Frankl showed that the odd cover number of $K_n$ is\nalways at least $n/2$, and the above authors and Radhakrishnan, Sen and\nVishwanathan gave some values of $n$ for which equality holds. We give some new\nexamples.\n  Our constructions arise from some very symmetric constructions for the\ncorresponding problem for complete hypergraphs. Thus the odd cover number of\nthe complete 3-graph $K_n^{(3)}$ is the smallest number of complete 3-partite\n3-graphs such that each 3-set is in an odd number of them. We show that the odd\ncover number of $K_n^{(3)}$ is exactly $n/2$ for even $n$, and we show that for\nodd $n$ it is $(n-1)/2$ for infinitely many values of $n$. We also show that\nfor $r=3$ and $r=4$ the odd cover number of $K_n^{(r)}$ is strictly less than\nthe partition number, answering a question of Buchanan, Clifton, Culver, Nie,\nO'Neill, Rombach and Yin for those values of $r$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xwB_YBG9AfW0RZviJGB9_Pm-c_EsjHZe2UPFf0Rmoh0","pdfSize":"112204"}
