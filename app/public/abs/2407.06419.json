We find beyond mean-field expressions for Tan's\ncontact and establish new connections between the chemical potential and\npotential energy per particle, characteristic of systems with finite-range\ninteractions. The obtained results are relevant for dipoles, quadrupoles,\nRydberg atoms, excitons, van der Waals atoms, and other systems in the dilute\nlimit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
