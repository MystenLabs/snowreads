SMS cores in the\nhydrogen burning phase encounter the general relativistic instability during\nthe stellar evolution if the mass is larger than $\\sim 3 \\times 10^4M_\\odot$.\nSpherical SMS cores in the helium burning phase encounter the general\nrelativistic instability prior to the onset of the electron-positron pair\ninstability if the mass is larger than $\\sim 1\\times 10^4M_\\odot$. For rapidly\nrotating SMS cores, these values for the threshold mass are enhanced by up to a\nfactor of $\\sim 5$, and thus, for SMSs with mass smaller than $\\sim\n10^4M_\\odot$ the collapse is triggered by the pair-instability, irrespective of\nthe rotation. After the onset of the general relativistic instability, SMS\ncores in the hydrogen burning phase with reasonable metallicity are likely to\ncollapse to a black hole irrespective of the degree of rotation, whereas the\nSMS cores in the helium burning phase could explode via nuclear burning with no\nblack hole formation, as previous works demonstrate.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ma1RaIPF_wy-IJiiNk4iV-_-P9u0QsczBiVERl5kWdQ","pdfSize":"707053"}
