We consider\nan idealized model of a memory-driven active particle inspired from experiments\nwith walking/superwalking droplets that takes the form of the celebrated Lorenz\nsystem. By adding a small bias force to this Lorenz model, we uncover a\nmechanism for simultaneous emergence of GNM and GPM in the parameter space.\nWithin the chaotic sea of the parameter space, a symmetric pair of coexisting\nasymmetric limit cycles separate and migrate under applied bias force,\nresulting in anomalous transport behaviors that are sensitive to the particle's\nmemory. This provides a general dynamical mechanism for the emergence of\nanomalous transport behaviors for self-driven particles described by\nlow-dimensional autonomous chaotic systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
