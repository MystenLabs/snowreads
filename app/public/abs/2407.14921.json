Two typical examples are the\nVlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck (VPFP) system in plasma physics and the Boltzmann\nequation in semiconductor physics. In this paper, we propose a generic\nasymptotic-preserving multiple-input DeepONet (AP-MIONet) method for solving\nthese two kinetic equations with variable parameters in the high-field regime.\nOur method aims to tackle two major challenges in this regime: the additional\nvariable parameters introduced by electric fields, and the absence of an\nexplicit local equilibrium, which is a key component of asymptotic-preserving\n(AP) schemes. We leverage the multiple-input DeepONet (MIONet) architecture to\naccommodate additional parameters, and formulate the AP loss function by\nincorporating both the mass conservation law and the original kinetic system.\nThis strategy can avoid reliance on the explicit local equilibrium, preserve\nthe mass and adapt to non-equilibrium states. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nand efficiency of the proposed method through extensive numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
