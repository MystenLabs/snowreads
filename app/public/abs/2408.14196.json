By employing an effective field theory (EFT)\napproach, we extend the Routhian formalism to incorporate spin effects in\nscalar interactions. In this formalism, we derive for the first time the\neffective two-body potential for spinning BHs up to the third post-Newtonian\n(3PN) order in generic ESGB gravity theories. This potential is expressed in\nterms of the sensitivities of the BHs, which are then obtained through a\nmatching procedure using analytic BH solutions derived here within a\nslow-rotation approximation, accurate to seventh order in the Gauss-Bonnet\ncoupling and fifth order in the BH spin. We also examine the thermodynamic\nproperties of these rotating solutions, which, as shown in previous work, yield\nimportant insights into the inspiral phase evolution in ESGB gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
