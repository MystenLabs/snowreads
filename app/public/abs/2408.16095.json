One player\nplaces tiles vertically, while the other places them horizontally; the first\nplayer who cannot move loses. It has been conjectured that the highest\ntemperature possible in Domineering is 2. We have developed a program that\nenables a parallel exhaustive search of Domineering positions with temperatures\nclose to or equal to 2 to allow for analysis of such positions\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
