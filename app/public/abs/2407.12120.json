Designing such legged robots requires considering heterogeneous,\nmulti-domain constraints and variables, from mechanical hardware and geometry\nchoices to controller profiles. However, very few formal or systematic (as\nopposed to ad hoc) design formulations and frameworks exist to identify\nfeasible and robust running platforms, especially at the small (sub 500 g)\nscale. This critical gap in running legged robot design is addressed here by\nabstracting the motion of legged robots through a torque-driven spring-loaded\ninverted pendulum (TD-SLIP) model, and deriving constraints that result in\nstable cyclic forward locomotion in the presence of system noise. Synthetic\nnoise is added to the initial state in candidate design evaluation to simulate\naccumulated errors in an open-loop control. The design space was defined in\nterms of morphological parameters, such as the leg properties and system mass,\nactuator selection, and an open loop voltage profile. These attributes were\noptimized with a well-known particle swarm optimization solver that can handle\nmixed-discrete variables. Two separate case studies minimized the difference in\ntouchdown angle from stride to stride and the actuation energy, respectively.\nBoth cases resulted in legged robot designs with relatively repeatable and\nstable dynamics, while presenting distinct geometry and controller profile\nchoices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
