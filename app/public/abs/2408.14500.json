The discontinuous field parameters are not only\ndifficult numerically, but also are not a realistic physical picture, as it\nforces the dielectric constant and ionic strength of bulk in the near-solute\nregion. An alternative to alleviate some of these issues is to represent the\nmolecular surface as a diffuse interface, however, this also presents\nchallenges. In this work we analysed the impact of the shape of the interfacial\nvariation of the field parameters in solvation and binding energy. However we\nused a hyperbolic tangent function ($\\tanh(k_p x)$) to couple the internal and\nexternal regions, our analysis is valid for other definitions. Our methodology\nwas based on a coupled finite element (FEM) and boundary element (BEM) scheme\nthat allowed us to have a special treatment of the permittivity and ionic\nstrength in a bounded FEM region near the interface, while maintaining BEM\nelsewhere. Our results suggest that the shape of the function (represented by\n$k_p$) has a large impact on solvation and binding energy. We saw that high\nvalues of $k_p$ induce a high gradient on the interface, to the limit of\nrecovering the sharp jump when $k_p\\to\\infty$, presenting a numerical challenge\nwhere careful meshing is key. Using the FreeSolv database to compare with\nmolecular dynamics, our calculations indicate that an optimal value of $k_p$\nfor solvation energies was around 3. However, more challenging binding free\nenergy tests make this conclusion more difficult, as binding showed to be very\nsensitive to small variations of $k_p$. In that case, optimal values of $k_p$\nranged from 2 to 20.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
