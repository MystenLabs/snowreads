However, quantifying the impact and efficiency of\nthese processes remains a challenge. In this study, we use the EAGLE\ncosmological hydrodynamics simulations to examine different models of SN and\nAGN feedback. Our goal is to investigate how variations in these processes\nimpact the properties of simulated galaxy populations. Specifically, we focus\non the analysis of effective yields, evaluating their capability to trace the\neffects of feedback processes on scaling relations. Our work contributes to a\ndeeper understanding of the complex relationship between different feedback\nscenarios and the evolution of galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
