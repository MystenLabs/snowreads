We give a detailed\nintroduction to Joyce structures, with particular focus on the geometry of the\nassociated twistor space. We also prove several new results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_10-bF-Cu6uRbTuaqk6e7rJmdj60A-9YhndC8OEqKdc","pdfSize":"438099"}
