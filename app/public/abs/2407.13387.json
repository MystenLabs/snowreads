This paper demonstrates the\npotential of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/graphene heterostructures to act as\nmemristors with multiple resistance states that can be optically tuned using\nvisible light. The number of resistance levels in graphene can be controlled by\nmodulating doping levels, achieved by varying the electric field strength or\nadjusting the duration of optical illumination. Our measurements show that this\nphotodoping of graphene results from the optical excitation of charge carriers\nfrom the nitrogen-vacancy levels of hBN to its conduction band, with these\ncarriers then being transferred to graphene by the gate-induced electric field.\nWe develop a quantitative model to describe our observations. Additionally,\nutilizing our device architecture, we propose a memristive crossbar array for\nvector-matrix multiplications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
