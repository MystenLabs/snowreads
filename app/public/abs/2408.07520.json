We prove that the\ntruncation error decreases exponentially with system size when the effective\ntemperature of the mTPQ state is smaller than the target temperature, and\notherwise, the error remains constant. We also show the discipline to set the\nmTPQ parameter by considering the trade-off between the error and the numerical\ncost.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yNnk5YmEd6LXu4zfa22wKJdQC90n8n3Az8EkgW-7GqQ","pdfSize":"71915"}
