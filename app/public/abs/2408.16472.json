It requires a careful and expert\ndetection of the point to be cut. Because of its complexity, repetitive nature\nand time constraint, the task requires skilled labor that needs to be trained.\nThis extended abstract presents the computer vision pipeline employed in\nproject Vinum, using detectron2 as a segmentation network and keypoint visual\nodometry to merge different observation into a single pointcloud used to make\ninformed pruning decisions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
