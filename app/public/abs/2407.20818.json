Exploring the use of\ncost-effective, extensive synthetic datasets offers a viable solution to tackle\nthis challenge and enhance the performance of roadside monocular 3D detection.\nIn this study, we introduce the TUMTraf Synthetic Dataset, offering a diverse\nand substantial collection of high-quality 3D data to augment scarce real-world\ndatasets. Besides, we present WARM-3D, a concise yet effective framework to aid\nthe Sim2Real domain transfer for roadside monocular 3D detection. Our method\nleverages cheap synthetic datasets and 2D labels from an off-the-shelf 2D\ndetector for weak supervision. We show that WARM-3D significantly enhances\nperformance, achieving a +12.40% increase in mAP 3D over the baseline with only\npseudo-2D supervision. With 2D GT as weak labels, WARM-3D even reaches\nperformance close to the Oracle baseline. Moreover, WARM-3D improves the\nability of 3D detectors to unseen sample recognition across various real-world\nenvironments, highlighting its potential for practical applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
