Tracking emotional dynamics in chat\nconversations can enhance communication, improve services, and support\nwell-being in various contexts. This paper explores a hybrid approach to\ntracking emotional dynamics in chat conversations by combining DistilBERT-based\ntext emotion detection and emoji sentiment analysis. A Twitter dataset was\nanalyzed using various machine learning algorithms, including SVM, Random\nForest, and AdaBoost. We contrasted their performance with DistilBERT. Results\nreveal DistilBERT's superior performance in emotion recognition. Our approach\naccounts for emotive expressions conveyed through emojis to better understand\nparticipants' emotions during chats. We demonstrate how this approach can\neffectively capture and analyze emotional shifts in real-time conversations.\nOur findings show that integrating text and emoji analysis is an effective way\nof tracking chat emotion, with possible applications in customer service, work\nchats, and social media interactions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
