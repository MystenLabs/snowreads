The proposed method combines the quasilinearization method with the\nHaar wavelet collocation method. In this approach, fractional Haar integrations\nis used to determine the linear system, which, upon solving, produces the\nrequired solution. Our findings suggest that as the values of $(\\alpha, \\beta)$\napproach $(2,1),$ the solutions of the fractional and classical Lane-Emden\nbecome identical.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
