We test our proposal by realizing Miura\noperators of $q$-deformed $W$- and $Y$-algebras in terms of R-matrices of the\nquantum toroidal algebra of $\\mathfrak{gl}(1)$. Physically, the representations\nof this toroidal algebra arise from the algebra of local operators on M2-branes\nand M5-branes, in M-theory subject to an $\\Omega$-background. We associate an\nR-matrix to each M2-M5 brane crossing, by studying its description as a\ngauge-invariant intersection of a topological line defect and a holomorphic\nsurface defect in 5-dimensional non-commutative Chern-Simons theory. The Miura\ntransformation is engineered using multiple M2-M5 intersections, relying\ncrucially on the properties of the underlying R-matrices. We thereby identify\neach R-matrix with a Miura operator. In a dual Type IIB frame, the components\nof the Miura transformation are shown to coincide with the half-index of a 3d\nsupersymmetric gauge theory on a Hanany-Witten system of D3-NS5 branes. As a\nfurther application, we demonstrate that $qq$-characters can be algebraically\nconstructed from the Miura transformation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ExZmDjSCZyiIJ6r1szma3Xkan0Xfiuk5htUVMONOFdo","pdfSize":"1532019","objectId":"0x2d37dfa0ab901a7f232a17c9cd1f712b3b4f8d677a66391af207c27457c9037f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
