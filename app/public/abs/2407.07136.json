In this paper, we elucidate that systems\nwith glide symmetry exhibit non-Hermitian skin effects (NHSE) characterized by\n$\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topology. Specifically, numerically analyzing a two-dimensional\ntoy model, we demonstrate that the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$ topology induces the NHSE\nwhen the topological invariant takes $\\nu=1,2$. Furthermore, our numerical\nanalysis demonstrates that the NHSE is destroyed by perturbations preserving\nthe relevant symmetry when the $\\mathbb{Z}_4$-invariant takes $\\nu=4$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
