Adopting the dilute wormhole gas approximation, we\ncomputed the genus creation rate in the semiclassical region. We show that a\ngenus is more easily created in the spacetime corresponding to a larger\nabsolute value of the cosmological constant. We find that fluctuations of fat\nwormholes are more likely to occur than those of thin wormholes. We also\nstudied the influence of genus fluctuations on false vacuum decay. The vacuum\ndecay rate will increase if the effect of genus fluctuations is included. We\nshow that all results do not change qualitatively when the values of certain\nparameters are changed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
