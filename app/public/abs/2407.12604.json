Previous studies have primarily focused on models where\nonly edge information is provided. However, in many social networks, not only\nthe relationships between users, represented by edges, but also their personal\ninformation, represented by features, are present. In this paper, we address\nthe challenge of identifying node correspondence in correlated graphs, where\nadditional node features exist, as in many real-world settings. We propose a\ntwo-step procedure, where we initially match a subset of nodes only using edge\ninformation, and then match the remaining nodes using node features. We derive\ninformation-theoretic limits for exact graph matching on this model. Our\napproach provides a comprehensive solution to the real-world graph matching\nproblem by providing systematic ways to utilize both edge and node information\nfor exact matching of the graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
