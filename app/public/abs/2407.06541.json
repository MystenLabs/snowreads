Our\nalgorithm leverages stochastic inter-agent trust values and gradient tracking\nto achieve geometric convergence rates in expectation even in adversarial\nenvironments. We introduce growing constraint sets to limit the impact of the\nmalicious agents without compromising the geometric convergence rate of the\nalgorithm. We prove that RP3 converges to the nominal optimal solution almost\nsurely and in the $r$-th mean for any $r\\geq 1$, provided the step sizes are\nsufficiently small and the constraint sets are appropriately chosen. We\nvalidate our approach with numerical studies on average consensus and\nmulti-robot target tracking problems, demonstrating that RP3 effectively\nmitigates the impact of malicious agents and achieves the desired geometric\nconvergence.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
