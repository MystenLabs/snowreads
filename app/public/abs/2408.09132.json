This work introduces an innovative channel\ncoding scheme, termed RIS-based diffractional channel coding (DCC), which\ncapitalizes on diffraction between two RIS layers for signal-level encoding.\nContrary to traditional methods, DCC expands signal dimensions through\ndiffraction, presenting a novel countermeasure to channel effects. This paper\nfocuses on the operational principles of DCC, including encoder and decoder\ndesigns, and explores its possibilities to construct block and trellis codes,\ndemonstrating its potential as both an alternative and a supplementary\nconventional coding scheme. Key advantages of DCC include eliminating extra\npower requirements for encoding, achieving computation at the speed of light,\nand enabling adjustable code distance, making it a progressive solution for\nefficient wireless communication, particularly in systems with large-scale data\nor massive MIMO.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9-R-yVDySMhdbw4H5eNAm6QB-nia9lJNK_ZH2-Z_rMY","pdfSize":"7837824"}
