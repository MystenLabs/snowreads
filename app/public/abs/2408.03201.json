Ol'shanskii has asked whether there are Artinian groups of\narbitrarily large cardinality. We reduce this problem to an analogous question,\nregarding universal algebras, asked by J\\'onsson in the 1960s. We provide\nArtinian groups of cardinality $\\aleph_n$ for each natural number $n$. We also\ngive a consistent strong negative answer to the question of Ol'shanskii (from a\nlarge cardinal assumption) as well as a consistent positive answer. Thus,\nanswers to the questions of Ol'shanskii and J\\'onsson are independent of set\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
