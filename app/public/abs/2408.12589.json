Each sample belongs to a class that specifies\na distribution for its processing time and a function that describes how the\nvalue of the processed update decays with age at the monitor. The class of a\nsample is identified when the processed update is delivered. The server\nimplements a form of M/G/1/1 blocking queue; samples arriving at a busy server\nare discarded and samples arriving at an idle server are subject to an\nadmission policy that depends on the age and class of the prior delivered\nupdate. For the delivered updates, we characterize the average age of\ninformation (AoI) and average value of information (VoI). We derive the optimal\nstationary policy that minimizes the convex combination of the AoI and\n(negative) VoI. It is shown that the policy has a threshold structure, in which\na new sample is allowed to arrive to the server only if the previous update's\nage and value difference surpasses a certain threshold that depends on the\nspecifics of the value function and system statistics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
