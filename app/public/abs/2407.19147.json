However, the user privacy in QPQ is generally guarded in the\nnon-realtime and cheat sensitive way. That is, the dishonest database holder's\ncheating to elicit user privacy can only be discovered after the protocol is\nfinished (when the user finds some errors in the retrieved database item). Such\ndelayed detection may cause very unpleasant results for the user in real-life\napplications. Current efforts to protect user privacy in realtime in existing\nQPQ protocols mainly use two techniques, i.e., adding an honesty checking on\nthe database or allowing the user to reorder the qubits. We reexamine these two\nkinds of QPQ protocols and find neither of them can work well. We give concrete\ncheating strategies for both participants and show that honesty checking of\ninner participant should be dealt more carefully in for example the choosing of\nchecking qubits. We hope such discussion can supply new concerns when detection\nof dishonest participant is considered in quantum multi-party secure\ncomputations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"tk9bxDxC96QYDAaAhNHMpy6knJ7px6Sd1Cx2EpQB6Vs","pdfSize":"464438"}
