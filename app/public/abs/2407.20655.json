For standard finite element\npairs, a robust inf-sup condition is required to show the robustness of the\ndiscretization error with respect to the discontinuous viscosity, which has\nonly been proven for the two-subdomain case in the paper [Numer. Math. (2006)\n103: 129--149]. To avoid the robust inf-sup condition of a discrete finite\nelement pair for multiple subdomains, we propose an ultra-weak augmented mixed\nfinite element formulation. By adopting a Galerkin-least-squares method, the\naugmented mixed formulation can achieve stability without relying on the\ninf-sup condition in both continuous and discrete settings. The key step to\nhaving a robust priori error estimate is to use two norms, one energy norm and\none full norm, in robust continuity. The robust coercivity is proved for the\nenergy norm. A robust a priori error estimate in the energy norm is then\nderived with the best approximation property in the full norm for the case of\nmultiple subdomains. Additionally, the paper introduces a singular Kellogg-type\nexample with exact solutions for the first time. Extensive numerical tests are\nconducted to validate the robust error estimate.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
