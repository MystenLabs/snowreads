Traditional motion planners need to\ncalculate the entire multi-goal path from scratch in response to changes in the\nenvironment, which result in a large consumption of computing resources. This\nprocess is not only time-consuming but also may not meet real-time requirements\nin application scenarios that require rapid response to environmental changes.\nIn this paper, we provide a novel Multi-Goal Motion Memory technique that\nallows robots to use previous planning experiences to accelerate future\nmulti-goal planning in changing environments. Specifically, our technique\npredicts collision-free and dynamically-feasible trajectories and distances\nbetween goal pairs to guide the sampling process to build a roadmap, to inform\na Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver to compute a tour, and to efficiently\nproduce motion plans. Experiments conducted with a vehicle and a snake-like\nrobot in obstacle-rich environments show that the proposed Motion Memory\ntechnique can substantially accelerate planning speed by up to 90\\%.\nFurthermore, the solution quality is comparable to state-of-the-art algorithms\nand even better in some environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
