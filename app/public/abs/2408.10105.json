Expanding on this work, Qing and Rafi recently developed\nthe quasi-redirecting boundary, denoted $\\partial G$, to include all directions\nof metric spaces at infinity. Both boundaries are topological spaces that\nconsist of equivalence classes of quasi-geodesic rays and are\nquasi-isometrically invariant. In this paper, we study these boundaries when\nthe space is equipped with a geometric group action. In particular, we show\nthat $G$ acts minimally on $\\partial_\\kappa G$ and that contracting elements of\nG induces a weak north-south dynamic on $\\partial_\\kappa G$. We also prove,\nwhen $\\partial G$ exists and $|\\partial_\\kappa G|\\geq3$, $G$ acts minimally on\n$\\partial G$ and $\\partial G$ is a second countable topological space. The last\nsection concerns the restriction to proper CAT(0) spaces and finite dimensional\n\\CAT cube complexes. We show that when $G$ acts geometrically on a finite\ndimensional CAT(0) cube complex (whose QR boundary is assumed to exist), then a\nnontrivial QR boundary implies the existence of a Morse element in $G$. Lastly,\nwe show that if $X$ is a proper cocompact CAT(0) space, then $\\partial G$ is a\nvisibility space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
