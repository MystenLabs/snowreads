Further, we also consider repeated-root constacyclic\ncodes and characterize them in terms of symmetric and asymmetric $q$-cyclotomic\ncosets. Using zero sets of classical self-orthogonal and dual-containing codes,\nwe derive quantum error correcting codes (QECCs) for both constacyclic\nBose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes and repeated-root constacyclic codes. We\nprovide some examples of QECCs derived from repeated-root constacyclic codes\nand show that constacyclic BCH codes are more efficient than repeated-root\nconstacyclic codes. Finally, quantum encoders and decoders are also proposed in\nthe transform domain for Calderbank-Shor-Steane CSS-based quantum codes. Since\nconstacyclic codes are a generalization of cyclic codes with better minimum\ndistance than cyclic codes with the same code parameters, the proposed results\nare practically useful.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ct5zpjwASxmLHZWiJyxwVLgeSrsMl8vU3bWIn-J_oGo","pdfSize":"984929"}
