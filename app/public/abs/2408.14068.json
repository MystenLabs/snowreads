Implicit forms, such as\ntriply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) has captured a significant attention,\nrecently, as tiles in lattices, partially because implicit forms have the\npotential for synthesizing with ease more complex topologies of tiles, compared\nto parametric forms. In this work, we show how variable offsets of implicit\nforms could be used in lattice design as well as lattice analysis, while graded\nwall and edge thicknesses could be fully controlled in the lattice and even\nvary within a single tile. As a result, (geometrically) heterogeneous lattices\ncould be created and adapted to follow analysis results while maintaining\ncontinuity between adjacent tiles. We demonstrate this ability on several 3D\nmodels, including TPMS.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
