Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs),\nwhich have the potential to change the characteristics of incident\nelectromagnetic waves with low power cost, can improve the performance or the\nMIMO mmWave wireless communications. Uniform circular array (UCA) is an\neffective antenna structure with low complexity transceiver. In this paper, UCA\nbased RIS-assisted MIMO mmWave wireless communications with transmit UCA, the\nRIS UCAs, and receive UCA are investigated. Since the rotation angles between\nthe transceiver make the channel matrix noncirculant, an algorithm is developed\nto derive the ranges of the rotation angles based on an acceptable error and\nreduce the impact of rotation angles on channel matrix. Then, we propose a\nlow-complexity precoding scheme at the transmitter, phase designs at the RIS\nUCAs, and a phase compensation scheme at the receiver, which can convert the\nchannel matrix into an equivalent circulant channel matrix with a small error.\nThen, a fast symbol-wise maximum likelihood (ML) detection scheme is proposed\nto recover the signals with low computational complexity. Simulation results\nare presented to illustrate the theory.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
