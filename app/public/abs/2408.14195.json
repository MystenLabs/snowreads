An underlying instance is\ndefined by a partitioning of the arms into clusters of predefined sizes, such\nthat for any $j > i$, all arms in cluster $i$ have a larger mean reward than\nthose in cluster $j$. The goal in RAI is to reliably identify a certain\nprespecified number of arms from each cluster, while using as few arm pulls as\npossible. The RAI problem covers as special cases several well-studied MAB\nproblems such as identifying the best arm or any $M$ out of the top $K$, as\nwell as both full and coarse ranking. We start by providing an\ninstance-dependent lower bound on the sample complexity of any feasible\nalgorithm for this setting. We then propose two algorithms, based on the idea\nof confidence intervals, and provide high probability upper bounds on their\nsample complexity, which orderwise match the lower bound. Finally, we do an\nempirical comparison of both algorithms along with an LUCB-type alternative on\nboth synthetic and real-world datasets, and demonstrate the superior\nperformance of our proposed schemes in most cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
