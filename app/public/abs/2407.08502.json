This class encompasses both systems brought out\nof equilibrium by the variation of a thermodynamic control parameter, as after\na temperature quench, or intrinsically out of equilibrium models with violation\nof detailed balance. The one-dimensional Ising model and the voter model (on an\narbitrary graph) are prototypical examples of these two situations which are\nused here as guiding examples. Defining the fluctuation-dissipation ratio\n$X_{ij}(t,t')=\\beta R_{ij}/(\\partial G_{ij}/\\partial t')$, where\n$G_{ij}(t,t')=\\langle S_i(t)S_j(t')\\rangle$ is the spin-spin correlation\nfunction and $\\beta$ is a parameter regulating the strength of the perturbation\n(corresponding to the inverse temperature when detailed balance holds), we show\nthat, in the quite general case of a kinetics obeying dynamical scaling, on\nequal sites this quantity has a universal form$X_{ii}(t,t') = (t+t')/(2t)$,\nwhereas $\\lim _{t\\to \\infty}X_{ij}(t,t')=1/2$ for any $ij$ couple. The specific\ncase of voter models with long-range interactions is thoroughly discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
