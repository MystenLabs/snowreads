In this paper, we introduce a new property $(\\natural)$ that extends\nthe nearly Gorenstein property in semi-standard graded rings. We show\n$(\\natural)$ relates to a property in affine semigroup rings and generalizes\nresults on Veronese subrings. Furthermore, $(\\natural)$ and the nearly\nGorenstein property are equivalent in Ehrhart rings of $(0,1)$-polytopes with\nthe integer decomposition property and in rings with minimal multiplicity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
