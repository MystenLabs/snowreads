With a single pair of observation directions $\\pm\\hat{x}$, we prove\nthat the lines $\\{z\\in\\mathbb R^2|\\, \\hat{x}\\cdot z = \\hat{x}\\cdot y, \\,y\\in\nA_{\\hat{x}}\\}$ can be determined by multi-frequency far field patterns at the\ndirections $\\pm\\hat{x}$, where $A_{\\hat{x}}$ denotes a set containing the\ncorners of the boundary and points whose normal vector to the boundary is\nparallel to $\\hat{x}$. Furthermore, if the source support is composed of\npolygons and annuluses, then we prove that the support can be determined by\nmulti-frequency far field patterns at sparse directions. Precisely, the lowest\nnumber of the observation directions is given in terms of the number of the\ncorners and the annuluses. Inspired by the uniqueness arguments, we introduce\ntwo novel indicators to determine the source support. Numerical examples in two\ndimensions are presented to show the validity and robustness of the two\nindicators for reconstructing the boundaries of the source support with a high\nresolution. The second indicator also shows its powerful ability to determine\nthe unknown source function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
