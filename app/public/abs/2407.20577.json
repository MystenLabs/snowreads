We find a magnetic field induced torque which leads to atomic binding\nat shorter distances than at zero field. Furthermore, the conductance drops\nbelow $G_0$ at high magnetic fields by about 15\\% in Au. We calculate the\nconduction through nanosized Au contacts containing residual $O_2$ molecules\nattached to the contact region and find a spin polarized current when $O_2$ is\nlocated at the atomic contact. We discuss the role of spin-orbit coupling in\nthe magnetic properties of $O_2$ attached to Au.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kDdcVpGJOCQy6HLr8HQzj3_gge3hRNctSeUxm7ybHX0","pdfSize":"4485501","objectId":"0x0aa6dd5dcde2b5dd2d2632b10154b94eaee51a00e4d8691acce8b95458ab53a0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
