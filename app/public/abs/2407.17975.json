Stopping in this problem is only allowed at Poisson random\nintervention times, and jumps play a significant role not only through the\nstopping times but also in the recursive objective functional and model\ncoefficients. To solve the problem, we propose a decomposition method based on\nJacod-Pham that allows us to separate the problem into a series of sub-problems\nbetween each pair of consecutive Poisson stopping times. To represent the value\nfunction of the recursive optimal stopping problem when the initial time falls\nbetween two consecutive Poisson stopping times and the generator is\nconcave/convex, we leverage the comparison theorem of BSDEs with jumps. We then\napply the representation result to American option pricing in a nonlinear\nmarket with Poisson stopping constraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
