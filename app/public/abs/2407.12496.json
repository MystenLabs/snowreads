This\ntechnique, which involves levitating micro- and nano-scale objects in a vacuum\nwhere they exhibit high-quality motion, provides an essential platform for\nprecision measurements. Noted for their ultra-high sensitivity, levitated\nparticles hold potential for a wide range of real-world applications. This\nperspective article briefly introduces the principle of optical levitation and\nthe dynamics of levitated particles. It then reviews the emerging applications\nof levitated particles in ultrasensitive force and torque measurements,\nacceleration and rotation sensing, electric and magnetic field detection,\nscanning probe microscopy, localized vacuum pressure gauging, acoustic\ntransduction, and chemical and biological sensing. Moreover, we discuss the\npresent challenges and explore opportunities to minimize and integrate\nlevitation systems for broader applications. We also briefly review\noptomechanics with ion traps and magnetic traps which can levitate particles in\nhigh vacuum without laser heating.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
