We here present how the\nanalysis based on the use of this key quantity can be applied to the study of\nthe properties of coupled layers. To this aim, we first discuss how to extend\nthe popular worm algorithm to a layered sample, and in particular to the\nevaluation of the longitudinal helicity, that we introduce taking care of the\nfact that the virtual twist representing the elastic deformation one applies to\nproperly define the helicity modulus can act on a single layer or on all of\nthem. We then apply the method to investigate the bilayer XY-model, showing how\nthe helicity modulus can be used to determine the phase diagram of the model as\na function of temperature and inter-layer coupling strength\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
