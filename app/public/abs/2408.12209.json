The proposed algorithm\nis proved to converge at optimal convergence rates of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(1/\\sqrt{t}\\right)$ on the estimate of $R_i^*$ and\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(1/\\sqrt{t}\\right)$ on the optimization error of both smooth\nand non-smooth MERO. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
