Using observational\ndatasets ($H(z)$, Pantheon supernovae, and their combination), we constrain the\nmodel parameters $H_0$, $\\alpha$, $\\beta$, and $\\zeta$. The deceleration\nparameter transitions from positive to negative values around redshifts $z_t\n\\approx 0.80$ to $0.99 $, indicating current accelerated expansion. Moreover,\nthe effective equation of state parameter, $\\omega_{eff}$, resembles\nquintessence dark energy ($-1 < \\omega_{eff} < -\\frac{1}{3}$), with\ncorresponding values from respective datasets. Finally, we use the $Om(z)$\ndiagnostic, which confirms that our model demonstrates quintessence-like\nbehavior. Our findings underscore the significant role of bulk viscosity in\nunderstanding accelerated expansion in the universe within alternative gravity\ntheories.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
