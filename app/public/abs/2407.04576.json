Our focus is on the Glauber dynamics which\nupdates the color at a randomly chosen edge in each step. For a tree $T$ with\n$n$ vertices and maximum degree $\\Delta$, when the number of colors $q$\nsatisfies $q\\geq\\Delta+2$ then we prove that the Glauber dynamics has an\noptimal relaxation time of $O(n)$, where the relaxation time is the inverse of\nthe spectral gap. This is optimal in the range of $q$ in terms of $\\Delta$ as\nDyer, Goldberg, and Jerrum (2006) showed that the relaxation time is\n$\\Omega(n^3)$ when $q=\\Delta+1$. For the case $q=\\Delta+1$, we show that an\nalternative Markov chain which updates a pair of neighboring edges has\nrelaxation time $O(n)$. Moreover, for the $\\Delta$-regular complete tree we\nprove $O(n\\log^2{n})$ mixing time bounds for the respective Markov chain. Our\nproofs establish approximate tensorization of variance via a novel inductive\napproach, where the base case is a tree of height\n$\\ell=O(\\Delta^2\\log^2{\\Delta})$, which we analyze using a canonical paths\nargument.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
