In\nChristowiak et al. (2017), one of the layers of the material undergoes only\nlocal rotations while the other allows local rotation and plastic deformation\nalong a single slip system. On the other hand, real materials show an interplay\nof multiple directions of slip. Here we obtain the Gamma-limit for the problem\nwhere the number of slip directions is increased to two. When the slip systems\nare orthogonal, we derive the full homogenized energy based on generalized\nconvex envelopes of the original energy density. Since these envelopes are not\ncompletely known for angles between slip directions differing from the right\nangle, we present a partial, conditional homogenization result in this general\ncase. The analysis is based on a modification of the classical construction of\nlaminate microstructures but several nontrivial difficulties arise due to\nnonconvex constraints being present in the composite energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
