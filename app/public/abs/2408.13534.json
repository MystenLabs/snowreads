Recent work on CSI translation has shown some success using Large\nLanguage Models (LLMs) to adapt to different languages and cultures; however, a\ndeeper analysis is needed to examine the benefits and pitfalls of each method.\nIn this paper, we introduce the ChineseMenuCSI dataset, the largest for\nChinese-English menu corpora, annotated with CSI vs Non-CSI labels and a\nfine-grained test set. We define three levels of CSI figurativeness for a more\nnuanced analysis and develop a novel methodology for automatic CSI\nidentification, which outperforms GPT-based prompts in most categories.\nImportantly, we are the first to integrate human translation theories into\nLLM-driven translation processes, significantly improving translation accuracy,\nwith COMET scores increasing by up to 7 points.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
