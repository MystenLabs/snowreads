We\ncompared the results to understand how each tool categorizes and describes\nindividual reflections and multiple reflections as a whole. This study aims to\nexplore ways to bridge the gaps between qualitative, quantitative, and\ncomputational analyses of reflective practices in teacher education. This study\nfinds that to effectively integrate LLM analysis into teacher education,\ndeveloping an analysis method and result format that are both comprehensive and\nrelevant for preservice teachers and teacher educators is crucial.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
