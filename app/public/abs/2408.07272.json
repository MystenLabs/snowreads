Automated mathematical programming (AMP) has emerged to\nsimplify this process, but existing systems have limitations. This paper\nintroduces a novel methodology that uses recent advances in Large Language\nModel (LLM) to create and edit OR solutions from non-expert user queries\nexpressed using Natural Language. This reduces the need for domain expertise\nand the time to formulate a problem. The paper presents an end-to-end pipeline,\nnamed NL2OR, that generates solutions to OR problems from natural language\ninput, and shares experimental results on several important OR problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
