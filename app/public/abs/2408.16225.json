Under the boundary\nconditions \\begin{equation*} \\nu \\cdot (D(u) \\nabla u + u \\nabla v) = 0\n\\quad\\text{ and }\\quad v = M>0,\\end{equation*} we first demonstrate that for $m\n> 1$, or $m = 1$ with $0 < M < 2/(n-2)$, the system admits globally defined\nclassical solutions that are uniformly bounded in time for any choice of\nsufficiently smooth radial initial data. This result is further extended to the\ncase $0<m<1$ when $M$ is chosen to be sufficiently small, depending on the\ninitial conditions. In contrast, it is shown that for $0 < m < \\frac{2}{n}$,\nthe system exhibits blow-up behavior for sufficiently large $M$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
