After reproving the\nMurnaghan-Nakayama rule by vertex algebraic method, we formulate a new\niterative formula for characters of the generalized symmetric group. As\napplications, we find a numerical relation between the character values of\n$C_k\\wr S_n$ and modular characters of $S_{kn}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
