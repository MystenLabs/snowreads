Under the assumption that the first passage to the\nsubset $l(0)$ occurs in a finite time with certainty, we characterize the\nprobability law of $(\\tau_{\\max},I_{\\max},J(\\tau_{\\max}))$, where $I_{\\max}$ is\nthe running maximum level attained by process ${\\cal X}$ before its first visit\nto states in $l(0)$, $\\tau_{\\max}$ is the first time that the level process\n$\\{I(t): t\\geq 0\\}$ reaches the running maximum $I_{\\max}$, and\n$J(\\tau_{\\max})$ is the phase at time $\\tau_{\\max}$. Our methods rely on the\nuse of restricted Laplace-Stieltjes transforms of $\\tau_{\\max}$ on the set of\nsample paths $\\{I_{\\max}=i,J(\\tau_{\\max})=j\\}$, and related processes under\ntaboo of certain subsets of states. The utility of the resulting computational\nalgorithms is demonstrated in two epidemic models: the SIS model for\nhorizontally and vertically transmitted diseases; and the SIR model with\nconstant population size.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JuEOqfa4LX7lhHAz4Np0T0ACwRqfDHW4E9YIwHXhVFs","pdfSize":"512672"}
