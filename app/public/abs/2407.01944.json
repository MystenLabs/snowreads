In particular, exposure to\npolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a major concern, since these\ncompounds have been recognized as important contributors to the overall\ncarcinogenic risk of smoke exposure. In this work, gas and particle-phase PAH\nemissions from the combustion of Eastern White Pine (pinus strobus) were\nquantified using time-of-flight mass spectrometry over a range of burn\nconditions representative of wildfires and prescribed fires. These experiments\nallow for controlling conditions of fuel moisture, heat flux, and oxygen\nconcentration to understand their impact on PAH emissions. We find that optimal\nconditions for fuel moisture content of 20 - 30%, heat load onto the sample of\n60 - 70 kW/m$^2$, and oxygen concentrations of the burn environment of 5 - 15%\ncan reduce the emissions of the heavy molar weight PAHs by up to 77%. Our\nanalysis shows that the relative carcinogenic risk can be reduced by more than\n50% under optimal conditions, offering a way for reducing emission exposure\nfrom forest treatment activities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YTW5Olz6z8UWL4Fj-9n1cr_GwPnqDkCUbbjz6PPciw0","pdfSize":"1522725"}
