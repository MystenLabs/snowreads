The increasing integration of EV charging stations (EVCSs) in\nthe existing power grids require new scaleable control algorithms that maintain\nthe stability and resilience of the grid. Here, we present such a control\napproach using an averaged port-Hamiltonian model. In this approach, the\nunderlying switching behavior of the power converters is approximated by an\naveraged non-linear system. The averaged models are used to derive various\ntypes of stabilizing controllers, including the typically used PI controllers.\nThe pH modeling is showcased by means of a generic setup of an EVCS, where the\nbattery of the vehicle is connected to an AC grid via power lines, converters,\nand filters. Finally, the control design methods are compared for the averaged\npH system and validated using a simulation model of the switched charging\nstation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sIYuftKRDwncRNZJtdlH7ZPmWhZHJGpnSKEQsSmXYig","pdfSize":"1121754"}
