This has led to recent efforts to obtain these relationships with\nmachine learning, but representing a grain boundary structure in a manner\nsuitable for machine learning is not a trivial task. There are three key steps\ncommon to property prediction in grain boundaries and other variable-sized atom\nclustered structures. These are: (1) describe the atomic structure as a feature\nmatrix, (2) transform the variable-sized feature matrices of different\nstructures to a fixed length common to all structures, and (3) apply machine\nlearning to predict properties from the transformed feature matrices. We\nexamine these feature engineering steps to understand how they impact the\naccuracy of grain boundary energy predictions. A database of over 7000 grain\nboundaries serves to evaluate the different feature engineering combinations.\nWe also examine how these combination of engineered features provide\ninterpretability, or the ability to extract insightful physics from the\nobtained structure-property relationships.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
