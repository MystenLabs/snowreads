Although some tools can\nautomatically generate architectural diagrams, these hardly fully reflect the\narchitecture of the system. We propose the value of automatic architecture\nrecovery from multiple software artifacts, combined with the ability to\nmanually adjust recovered models and automate the recovery process. We present\na general approach to achieve this and describe a tool that generates\narchitectural diagrams for a software system by analyzing its software\nartifacts and unifying them into a comprehensive system representation. This\nrepresentation can be manually modified while ensuring that changes are\nreintegrated into the diagram when it is regenerated. We argue that adopting a\nsimilar approach in other types of documentation tools is possible and can\nrender similar benefits.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
