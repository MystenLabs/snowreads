These cumulants represent terms of cumulant expansion of\nthe free energy of discrete analogs of matrix models widely known in\ntheoretical and mathematical physics. Using a diagram technique, we show that\nthe leading term $F_k^{(q)}$ of the normalized cumulant of $k$-th order can be\nassociated with one or another family of tree-type diagrams, in dependence of\nthe asymptotic behavior of parameters $cR/N$ for non-closed walks and\n$c^2R/N^2$ for closed walks, respectively. Adapting the Pr\\\"ufer codification\nprocedure to such diagrams, we get explicit expressions for the number of\ntree-type diagrams of $k$ elements and show that in certain cases, $F_k^{(q)}$\ncan be bounded from above by the $k$-th moment of the sum of $k(q-1)+1$\nindependent Bernoulli random variables. These results allow us to prove Limit\nTheorems for the numbers of $q$-step walks in random graphs and to show that in\nthe additional limiting transition of infinite $q$, the term $F_k^{(q)}$,\nconsidered for large values of $k$, admits an upper bound that asymptotically\ncoincides with that of the $k$-th moment of the Compound Poisson distribution.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0cer9kAQAVlefWPc_l1xILOQbVkyvhRHxMAFd4SsEhs","pdfSize":"575135"}
