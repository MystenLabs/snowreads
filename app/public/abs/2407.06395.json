This\npaper describes a novel unfolding model for binary data that allows for\nheavy-tailed shocks to the underlying utilities. One of our key contributions\nis a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm that requires little or no parameter\ntuning, fully explores the support of the posterior distribution, and can be\nused to fit various extensions of our core model that involve (Bayesian)\nhypothesis testing on the latent construct. Our empirical evaluations of the\nmodel and the associated algorithm suggest that they provide better\ncomplexity-adjusted fit to voting data from the United States House of\nRepresentatives.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
