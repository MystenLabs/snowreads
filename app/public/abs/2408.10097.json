In this work we study the\nthermodynamic quasi-equilibrium of the relative population of photoexcited free\nquasi-electron/quasi-hole pairs, neutral-excitons and excitonic trions, in 2D\nmaterials that support such excitonic complexes with large binding energy. We\nderive and solve the general Saha equations which describe the detailed balance\nof such a system of photo-excited electronic degrees of freedom forming a\nmulti-component fluid of excitations in thermodynamic quasi-equilibrium.The\nsolution to these equations, for the special case of 2D perovskites where the\nreported exciton and excitonic trion binding-energies are of the order of\n0.3-0.4 eV for the former and 30-40 meV for the latter, reveals that while the\ncharge-neutral excitonic population dominates all other excitations, at room\ntemperature and below, the excitonic trion component can be the dominant\npopulation among charge carriers. We also argue that trionic hopping can take\nplace via a tunneling mechanism which is speculated to play a role in a novel\ncharge-transport mechanism.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
