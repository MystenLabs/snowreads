We study\nmatrix majorization in large samples and in the catalytic regime in the case\nwhere the columns of the matrices need not have equal support, as has been\nassumed in earlier works. We focus on two cases: either there are no support\nrestrictions (except for requiring a non-empty intersection for the supports)\nor the final column dominates the others. Using real-algebraic methods, we\nidentify sufficient and almost necessary conditions for majorization in large\nsamples or when using catalytic states under these support conditions. These\nconditions are given in terms of multi-partite divergences that generalize the\nR\\'enyi divergences. We notice that varying support conditions dramatically\naffect the relevant set of divergences. Our results find an application in the\ntheory of catalytic state transformation in quantum thermodynamics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Quantum Physics","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
