A particular question addressed in this paper is\nhow the space-time symmetry algebra is encoded on the world-sheet. A natural\nprescription for calculating the space-time OPEs from the world-sheet is\npresented in the hybrid formalism. An argument showing that the OPEs are\ncorrectly reproduced from the world-sheet is provided, together with a few\nexplicit calculations as consistency checks.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y61yeZq6QzXXEEYF819FoA-6j5OengTyLopfriczwt0","pdfSize":"592786","objectId":"0x354d7394a9fa13d61d4db2b5e214e1d8a66ce46bcb96a71bd8eb89771ebd8514","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
