This addresses an engineering shortcoming of\nthe inherently noncausal strategy of Daubechies and Sweldens for factoring\ndiscrete wavelet transforms, which was based on the Extended Euclidean\nAlgorithm for Laurent polynomials. The Causal Complementation Algorithm\nreproduces all lifting factorizations created by the causal version of the\nEuclidean Algorithm approach and generates additional causal factorizations,\nwhich are not obtainable via the causal Euclidean Algorithm, possessing\ndegree-reducing properties that generalize those furnished by the Euclidean\nAlgorithm. In lieu of the Euclidean Algorithm, the new approach employs\nGaussian elimination in matrix polynomials using a slight generalization of\npolynomial long division. It is shown that certain polynomial degree-reducing\nconditions are both necessary and sufficient for a causal elementary matrix\ndecomposition to be obtainable using the Causal Complementation Algorithm,\nyielding a formal definition of ``lifting factorization'' that was missing from\nthe work of Daubechies and Sweldens.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
