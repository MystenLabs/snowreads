Nevertheless, not many frameworks on sports games exist. In this\npaper, we present the tennis match simulation environment \\textit{Match Point\nAI}, in which different agents can compete against real-world data-driven bot\nstrategies. Next to presenting the framework, we highlight its capabilities by\nillustrating, how MCTS can be used in Match Point AI to optimize the shot\ndirection selection problem in tennis. While the framework will be extended in\nthe future, first experiments already reveal that generated shot-by-shot data\nof simulated tennis matches show realistic characteristics when compared to\nreal-world data. At the same time, reasonable shot placement strategies emerge,\nwhich share similarities to the ones found in real-world tennis matches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
