Our analysis reveals conceptual\nflaws within certain benchmark GNN models when operating under the assumption\nof edge-independent node labels, a condition commonly observed in benchmark\ngraphs employed for node classification. Approaching neighborhood aggregation\nfrom a statistical signal processing perspective, our investigation provides\nnovel insights which may be used to design more efficient GNN models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
