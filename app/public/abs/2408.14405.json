Conway's\ntopographs for integral binary quadratic forms. These are trees in the plane\nwith regions labeled by integers following a simple pattern. Each topograph can\ndisplay the values of a single form, or represent an equivalence class of\nforms. We give a new treatment of reduction of forms to canonical equivalence\nclass representatives by employing topographs and a novel continued fraction\nfor complex numbers. This allows uniform reduction for any positive, negative,\nsquare or non-square discriminant. Topograph geometry also provides new class\nnumber formulas, and short proofs of results of Gauss relating to sums of three\nsquares. Generalizations of the series of Hurwitz for class numbers give\nevaluations of certain infinite series, summed over the regions or edges of a\ntopograph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
