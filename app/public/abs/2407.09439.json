We\nalso establish a version of our combination theorem for discrete groups that\nare convex cocompact in $\\mathbb{P}(\\mathbb{R}^n)$ in the sense of\narXiv:1704.08711. In particular, we prove that a free product of two convex\ncocompact groups is convex cocompact, which implies that the free product of\ntwo Anosov groups is Anosov. We also prove a virtual amalgamation theorem over\nconvex cocompact subgroups generalizing work of Baker-Cooper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
