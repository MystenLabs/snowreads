In spite of this, the existing\nalgorithms used to generate conditional forecasts tend to be very\ncomputationally intensive, especially when working with large Vector\nAutoregressions or when multiple linear equality and inequality constraints are\nimposed at once. We introduce a novel precision-based sampler that is fast,\nscales well, and yields conditional forecasts from linear equality and\ninequality constraints. We show in a simulation study that the proposed method\nproduces forecasts that are identical to those from the existing algorithms but\nin a fraction of the time. We then illustrate the performance of our method in\na large Bayesian Vector Autoregression where we simultaneously impose a mix of\nlinear equality and inequality constraints on the future trajectories of key US\nmacroeconomic indicators over the 2020--2022 period.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UoH19ka363HPZq-RLVyfb-s0JytwoBINgLifUjydDeA","pdfSize":"1194062"}
