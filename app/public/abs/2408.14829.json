Past research has uncovered high vulnerability\nto simple imitation attacks that could lead to erroneous identification and\nsubsequent authentication of attackers. Similar to face recognition, imitation\nattacks can also be detected with Machine Learning. Attack detection systems\nuse a variety of facial features and advanced machine learning models for\nuncovering the presence of attacks. In this work, we assess existing work on\nliveness detection and propose a novel approach that promises high\nclassification accuracy by combining previously unused features with time-aware\ndeep learning strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XpdiNws3f0Lul0qmlYNBTmnT1BJXAjhrwO-_ll0yf_A","pdfSize":"3600308"}
