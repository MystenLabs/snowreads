This paper introduces a Bayesian RAIM algorithm with a\nstreamlined architecture for snapshot-type 3D cellular positioning. Unlike\ntraditional frequentist-type RAIM algorithms, it computes the exact posterior\nprobability density function (PDF) of the position vector as a Gaussian mixture\n(GM) model using efficient message passing along a factor graph. This Bayesian\napproach retains all crucial information from the measurements, eliminates the\nneed to discard faulty measurements, and results in tighter protection levels\n(PLs) in 3D space and 1D/2D subspaces that meet target integrity risk (TIR)\nrequirements. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the Bayesian RAIM\nalgorithm significantly outperforms a baseline algorithm, achieving over $50\\%$\nPL reduction at a comparable computational cost.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"T7yzvEg3G-tV6TAocJZOEZBmIMjRTxKY6a1aPfaw7ns","pdfSize":"3251409"}
