Our method concurrently simulates $n$\nchannels, reducing the upper bound on the excess information by half compared\nto one-dimensional methods. When used with higher-dimensional lattices, our\napproach achieves up to six times reduction on the upper bound. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate that the KL divergence between the distributions of the simulated\nand Gaussian channels decreases with the number of dimensions at a rate of\n$O(n^{-1})$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
