To demonstrate the feasibility of the approach, a\nresistor-capacitor circuit is simulated using an all-atom representation for\nresistor and capacitor. The simulated dynamics reproduce the expected charging\nprocess and Nyquist noise, the latter resulting from the thermal voltages\nacting on individual split charges. The method bears promise to model friction\ncaused by the motion of charged particles past metallic or highly polarizable\nmedia.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"myzCBts-WZOpD5DXUZRc0QcC-heSPpizyIgU5p4bzhs","pdfSize":"483731"}
