We\ndevelop a theoretical description of the magnetic properties of URhGe by\nconsidering a spin model with competing magnetic anisotropies. The model is\nanalyzed both analytically at zero temperature and with Monte Carlo simulations\nat finite temperatures. The constructed H-T phase diagram for a magnetic field\nparallel to the b-axis features a tricritical point on the line of phase\ntransitions between the ferromagnetic Ising state and the paramagnetic phase.\nWe also demonstrate that the asymptotic tricritical behavior of the order\nparameter and the correlation length is described by the mean-field critical\nexponents.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
