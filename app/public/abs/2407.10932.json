The concept of stability in this context concerns how, when\napproaching equality, sets $A$ and $B$ are close to homothetic convex sets. In\na recent breakthrough [FvHT23], the authors of this paper proved the following\nfolklore conjectures on the sharp stability for the Brunn-Minkowski inequality:\n  (1) A linear stability result concerning the distance from $A$ and $B$ to\ntheir respective convex hulls.\n  (2) A quadratic stability result concerning the distance from $A$ and $B$ to\ntheir common convex hull.\n  As announced in [FvHT23], in the present paper, we leverage (1) in\nconjunction with a novel optimal transportation approach to offer an\nalternative proof for (2).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
