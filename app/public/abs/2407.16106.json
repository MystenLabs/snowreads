However, these solvers are often insufficient for tackling\nhigher-order problems. In this paper, we introduce a novel and efficient solver\ndesigned specifically for HOBO (Higher-Order Binary Optimization) problem\nsettings. Our approach leverages advanced techniques to effectively manage the\ncomplexity and computational demands associated with high-dimensional\noptimization tasks. The proposed solver is a promising tool with significant\npotential for future extensions in terms of formulation. This solver holds\npromising potential for a wide range of applications in quantum computing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ovWIxmACxpBQTv9go77AFcBDTsfoxDtsgKc0PWidd-Y","pdfSize":"104447","objectId":"0x708db3ec9d0c40613ce4f61fc4ccf60aa76d4909f0c459060444da37948cbdef","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
