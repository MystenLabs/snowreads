To\nimprove the ill-posed nature of the inverse problem, it is a common practice to\nobserve the magnitude of linear measurements $\\boldsymbol{z}^{(1)} = A^{(1)}\n\\boldsymbol{x},..., \\boldsymbol{z}^{(L)} = A^{(L)}\\boldsymbol{x}$ using\nmultiple sensing matrices $A^{(1)},..., A^{(L)}$, with ptychographic imaging\nbeing a remarkable example of such strategies. Inspired by existing algorithms\nfor ptychographic reconstruction, we introduce stochasticity to Vector\nApproximate Message Passing (VAMP), a computationally efficient algorithm\napplicable to a wide range of Bayesian inverse problems. By testing our\napproach in the setup of phase retrieval, we show the superior convergence\nspeed of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
