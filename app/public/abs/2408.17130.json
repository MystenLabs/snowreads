Modeling hadron formation requires\nseveral assumptions and various phenomenological approaches. Utilizing\nstate-of-the-art Deep Learning algorithms, it is eventually possible to train\nneural networks to learn non-linear and non-perturbative features of the\nphysical processes. In this study, the prediction results of three trained\nResNet networks are presented, by investigating charged particle multiplicities\nat event-by-event level. The widely used Lund string fragmentation model is\napplied as a training-baseline at $\\sqrt{s}= 7$ TeV proton-proton collisions.\nWe found that neural-networks with $ \\gtrsim\\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ parameters can\npredict the event-by-event charged hadron multiplicity values up to $\nN_\\mathrm{ch}\\lesssim 90 $.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
