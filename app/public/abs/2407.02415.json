The weights of our measure include\nfactors that are universal symplectic characters, as well as a novel family of\n\"Down-Up Schur functions\" that we define and for which we prove new identities\nof Cauchy-Littlewood-type. Our main structural result is that the point process\ncorresponding to the symplectic Schur process is determinantal and we find an\nexplicit correlation kernel. We also present dynamics that preserve the family\nof symplectic Schur processes and explore an alternative sampling scheme, based\non the Berele insertion algorithm, in a special case. Finally, we study the\nasymptotics of the Berele insertion process and find explicit formulas for the\nlimit shape and fluctuations near the bulk and the edge. One of the limit\nregimes leads to a new kernel that resembles the symmetric Pearcey kernel.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
