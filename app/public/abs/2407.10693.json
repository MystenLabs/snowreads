FEL operation requires precise control of the shape and\nenergy of the extremely short electron bunches whose characteristics directly\ntranslate into the properties of the produced light. Control of short intense\nbeams is difficult due to beam characteristics drifting with time and complex\ncollective effects such as space charge and coherent synchrotron radiation.\nDetailed diagnostics of beam properties are therefore essential for precise\nbeam control. Such measurements typically rely on a destructive approach based\non a combination of a transverse deflecting resonant cavity followed by a\ndipole magnet in order to measure a beam's 2D time vs energy longitudinal\nphase-space distribution. In this paper, we develop a non-invasive virtual\ndiagnostic of an electron beam's longitudinal phase space at megapixel\nresolution (1024 x 1024) based on a generative conditional diffusion model. We\ndemonstrate the model's generative ability on experimental data from the\nEuropean X-ray FEL.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
