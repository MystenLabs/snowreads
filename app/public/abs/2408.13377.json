Our key observation is that querying a distance field at one\nconfiguration reveals a region of safe space whose radius is given by the\ndistance value, obviating the need for additional collision checking within the\nsafe region. We refer to such regions as safe bubbles, and show that safe\nbubbles can be obtained from any Lipschitz-continuous safety constraint.\nInspired by sampling-based planning algorithms, we present three algorithms for\nconstructing a safe bubble cover of free space, named bubble roadmap (BRM),\nrapidly exploring bubble graph (RBG), and expansive bubble graph (EBG). The\nbubble sampling algorithms are combined with a hierarchical planning method\nthat first computes a discrete path of bubbles, followed by a continuous path\nwithin the bubbles computed via convex optimization. Experimental results show\nthat the bubble-based methods yield up to 5- 10 times cost reduction relative\nto conventional baselines while simultaneously reducing computational efforts\nby orders of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
