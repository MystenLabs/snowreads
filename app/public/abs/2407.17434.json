Evaluated in terms of Euler angles,\nthis is closely related to integration over two- or three-dimensional unit\nspheres, a common problem discussed in numerical analysis. The computational\ncost of the integration depends significantly on the quadrature method, making\nthe selection of an appropriate method crucial for the feasibility of\nsimulations. After reviewing several classes of spherical quadrature methods in\nterms of their efficiency and error distribution, we derive guidelines for\nchoosing the best quadrature method for orientation averages and illustrate\nthese with three examples from chiral molecule physics. While Gauss quadratures\nallow for achieving numerically exact integration for a wide range of\napplications, other methods offer advantages in specific circumstances. Our\nguidelines can also by applied to higher-dimensional spherical domains and\nother geometries. We also present a Python package providing a flexible\ninterface to a variety of quadrature methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
