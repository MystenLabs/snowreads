We\nconsider a mixed effects model with Bayesian variable selection in the random\neffects using spike-and-slab priors and developed a variational Bayes inference\nscheme that can be applied to large data sets. An EM algorithm is proposed for\nthe model with normal errors where the posterior distribution of the variable\ninclusion parameters is approximated using an Occam's window approach. Placing\nthis approach within a variational Bayes scheme also the algorithm to be\nextended to the model with skew-t errors. The performance of the algorithm is\nevaluated in a simulation study and applied to a longitudinal model for elite\nathlete performance in the 100 metre sprint and weightlifting.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"GF5FOnMhnw8HxaSj_q_xDrIlXT9HNKuJdcSf06bqFp8","pdfSize":"607368"}
