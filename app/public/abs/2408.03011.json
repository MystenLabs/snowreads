Using the Bethe-Salpeter equation\nmethod, we obtain its mass as $3828.2$ MeV and its electromagnetic decay widths\nas $\\Gamma[\\eta_{_{c2}}(1D)\\rightarrow h_{_{c}}(1P)\\gamma]=284$ keV,\n$\\Gamma[\\eta_{_{c2}}(1D)\\rightarrow J/\\psi\\gamma]=1.04$ keV,\n$\\Gamma[\\eta_{_{c2}}(1D)\\rightarrow\\psi(2S)\\gamma]=3.08$ eV, and\n$\\Gamma[\\eta_{_{c2}}(1D)\\rightarrow\\psi(3770)\\gamma]=0.143$ keV. We estimate\nits full width to be about $366$ keV, and point out that the electromagnetic\ndecay partial width is very sensitive to its mass and show the variation of the\nwidth along with the mass in the range of $3800\\sim3872$ MeV. In our\ncalculation, the emphasis is put on the relativistic corrections. Our results\nshow that $\\eta_{_{c2}}\\rightarrow h_{_{c}}\\gamma$ is the non-relativistic $E1$\ntransition dominated $E1+M2+E3$ decay, and $\\eta_{_{c2}}\\rightarrow \\psi\\gamma$\nis the $M1+E2+M3+E4$ decay but the relativistic $E2$ transition contributes the\nmost.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
