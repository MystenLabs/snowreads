Along the way we provide sufficient conditions for the category of\nlocal modules to be rigid, pivotal and ribbon. We also discuss two ways to\nconstruct such commutative exact algebras. The first is the class of simple\ncurrent algebras and the second is using right adjoints of central tensor\nfunctors. Furthermore, we discuss Witt equivalence and its relation with\nextensions of VOAs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZaEGETzfdottbiOi1hZb0NCzGzPBBLG8YOfdPkJul0w","pdfSize":"594128"}
