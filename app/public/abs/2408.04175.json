Bregman\nmanifolds are induced by smooth strictly convex functions like the cumulant or\npartition functions of regular exponential families, the negative entropy of\nmixture families, or the characteristic functions of regular cones just to list\na few such convex Bregman generators. We describe the design of pyBregMan, a\nlibrary which implements generic operations on Bregman manifolds and\ninstantiate several common Bregman manifolds used in information sciences. At\nthe core of the library is the notion of Legendre-Fenchel duality inducing a\ncanonical pair of dual potential functions and dual Bregman divergences. The\nlibrary also implements the Fisher-Rao manifolds of categorical/multinomial\ndistributions and multivariate normal distributions. To demonstrate the use of\nthe pyBregMan kernel manipulating those Bregman and Fisher-Rao manifolds, the\nlibrary also provides several core algorithms for various applications in\nstatistics, machine learning, information fusion, and so on.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
