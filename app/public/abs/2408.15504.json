A\nfamous example of the observable implications of virtual photons -- vacuum\nfluctuations of the quantum electromagnetic field -- is the Casimir effect.\nSince quantum vacuum effects are weak, various mechanisms have been proposed to\nenhance and engineer them, ranging from static, e.g., strong optical\nresonances, to dynamic, e.g., systems with moving boundaries or time-varying\noptical properties, or a combination of them. In this Letter, we discuss the\nrole of material nonlocality (spatial dispersion) in dynamical Casimir effects\nin time-varying frequency-dispersive nanophotonic systems. We first show that\nlocal models may lead to nonphysical predictions, such as diverging emission\nrates of entangled polariton pairs. We then theoretically demonstrate that\nnonlocality regularizes this behavior by correcting the asymptotic response of\nthe system for large wavevectors and reveals physical effects missed by local\nmodels, including a significant broadening of the emission rate distribution,\nwhich are relevant for future experimental observations. Our work sheds light\non the importance of nonlocal effects in this new frontier of nanophotonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JCVLS1w3qY8HSJ6bUfR20-E6wPMwD4fed-t3y3YU2lo","pdfSize":"1853130"}
