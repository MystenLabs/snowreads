We focus our attention on the binary case (YES/NO\ndecisions) and \\textit{individual} guarantees for each of the participating\nagents. We introduce a novel notion, inspired by the popular maxi-min-share\n(MMS) for fair allocation. The agent expects to get as many decisions as if\nthey were to optimally partition the decisions among the agents, with an\nadversary deciding which of the agents decides on what bundle. We show an\nonline algorithm that guarantees the MMS notion for $n=3$ agents, an offline\nalgorithm for $n=4$ agents, and show that no online algorithm can guarantee the\n$MMS^{adapt}$ for $n\\geq 7$ agents. We also show that the Maximum Nash Welfare\n(MNW) outcome can only guarantee $O(\\frac{1}{n})$ of the MMS notion in the\nworst case.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"os8g9aK_fywFCVDfLaIjOqc22dhorBzfFaP5RsR5OxM","pdfSize":"210023"}
