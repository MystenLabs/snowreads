Using the Kane-Mele monolayer as a concrete model, we\ncomprehensively explore the various topological phases in the presence of\ninequivalent exchange fields and reveal the roles of the interfacial Rashba\neffect and external electric field in tuning topological valley-polarized\nstates. We find that valley-polarized states can be realized by introducing\nKane-Mele spin-orbit coupling and inequivalent exchange fields. Further\nintroducing Rashba spin-orbit coupling and an electric field into the system\ncan lead to diverse topological states, such as the valley-polarized quantum\nanomalous Hall effect with $\\mathcal{C}=~\\pm 1,\\pm 2$ and valley-contrasting\nstates with $\\mathcal{C}=0$. Remarkably, different valley-polarized topological\nstates can be continuously tuned by varying the strength and direction of the\nexternal electric field in a fixed system. Our work demonstrates the tunability\nof topological states in valley-polarized quantum anomalous Hall systems and\nprovides an ideal platform for applications in electronic transport devices in\ntopological valleytronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"n2TDA4eMYTePwANkUpIZET9OudXdSPaJv9DFV0pYiZg","pdfSize":"4622942"}
