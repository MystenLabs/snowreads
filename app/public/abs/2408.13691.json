It is shown in \\cite{HUA} (resp.\\cite{GEN}) that any\n$L^{\\infty}$ weak entropy solution of damped compressible Euler equation\nconverges to the Barenblatt solution with finite mass in $L^1$ norm, with\nconvergence rates depending on the adiabatic gas exponent $\\gamma$ in the case\nof $1<\\gamma<3$ (resp.$\\gamma\\ge2$). Whether or not these convergence rates can\nbe improved remains an interesting and challenging open question. In this\npaper, we obtain a better $L^1$ convergence rate than that in \\cite{GEN}, for\nany $\\gamma\\ge2$, through a new perspective on the relationship between the\ndensity function and the Barenblatt solution of the porous medium equation.\nFurthermore, making intensive analysis of some relevant convex functions, we\nare able to obtain the same form of $L^1$ convergence rate for $1<\\gamma<9/7$,\nwhich is better than that in \\cite{HUA} as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
