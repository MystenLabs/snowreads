We introduce DeepClair, a novel framework for portfolio selection.\nDeepClair leverages a transformer-based time-series forecasting model to\npredict market trends, facilitating more informed and adaptable portfolio\ndecisions. To integrate the forecasting model into a deep reinforcement\nlearning-driven portfolio selection framework, we introduced a two-step\nstrategy: first, pre-training the time-series model on market data, followed by\nfine-tuning the portfolio selection architecture using this model.\nAdditionally, we investigated the optimization technique, Low-Rank Adaptation\n(LoRA), to enhance the pre-trained forecasting model for fine-tuning in\ninvestment scenarios. This work bridges market forecasting and portfolio\nselection, facilitating the advancement of investment strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"qMtqmt78MVXd2cO2_r4DfbAatJ4fS5-PBNdqps8F-LU","pdfSize":"1567119"}
