Due to the complex\ndegradation, directly training a convolutional neural network (CNN) without\nprior cannot yield satisfactory results. In this work, we propose a generative\niris prior embedded Transformer model (Gformer), in which we build a\nhierarchical encoder-decoder network employing Transformer block and generative\niris prior. First, we tame Transformer blocks to model long-range dependencies\nin target images. Second, we pretrain an iris generative adversarial network\n(GAN) to obtain the rich iris prior, and incorporate it into the iris\nrestoration process with our iris feature modulator. Our experiments\ndemonstrate that the proposed Gformer outperforms state-of-the-art methods.\nBesides, iris recognition performance has been significantly improved after\napplying Gformer.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
