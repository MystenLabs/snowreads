Nuclear modification factors ($R_{\\mathrm\n{pPb}}$) of non-prompt $\\mathrm {D^0}$, $\\mathrm {D^+}$, and $\\mathrm\n{\\Lambda_{c}^{+}}$ are calculated as a function of the transverse momentum\n($p_{\\mathrm T}$) to investigate the modification of the momentum spectra\nmeasured in p$-$Pb collisions with respect to those measured in proton$-$proton\n(pp) collisions at the same energy. The $R_{\\mathrm {pPb}}$ measurements are\ncompatible with unity and with the measurements in the prompt charm sector, and\ndo not show a significant $p_{\\mathrm T}$ dependence. The $p_{\\mathrm\nT}$-integrated cross sections and $p_{\\mathrm T}$-integrated $R_{\\mathrm\n{pPb}}$ of non-prompt $\\mathrm {D^0}$ and $\\mathrm {D^+}$ mesons are also\ncomputed by extrapolating the visible cross sections down to $p_{\\mathrm T}$ =\n0. The non-prompt D-meson $R_{\\mathrm {pPb}}$ integrated over $p_{\\mathrm T}$\nis compatible with unity and with model calculations implementing modification\nof the parton distribution functions of nucleons bound in nuclei with respect\nto free nucleons. The non-prompt $\\mathrm {\\Lambda_{c}^{+}/D^{0}}$ and\n$\\mathrm{D^+/D^0}$ production ratios are computed to investigate hadronisation\nmechanisms of beauty quarks into mesons and baryons. The measured ratios as a\nfunction of $p_{\\mathrm T}$ display a similar trend to that measured for charm\nhadrons in the same collision system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
