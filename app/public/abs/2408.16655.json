In this paper, we develop optimal quantum\nalgorithms that estimate both the trace distance and the (square root) fidelity\nbetween pure states to within additive error $\\varepsilon$ using\n$\\Theta(1/\\varepsilon)$ queries to their state-preparation circuits,\nquadratically improving the long-standing folklore $O(1/\\varepsilon^2)$. At the\nheart of our construction, is an algorithmic tool for quantum square root\namplitude estimation, which generalizes the well-known quantum amplitude\nestimation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WIuDrxjmB2nYMffxhMhs9eSmWGGEQxgNE6ZA0f7wkLY","pdfSize":"408951"}
