It addresses the Semantic Shift Detection (SSD) task,\nwhich is crucial for understanding linguistic evolution, particularly in\nhistorical contexts. The study focuses on analyzing a set of Spanish target\nwords. To achieve this, a 19th-century Spanish corpus is constructed, and a\ncustomizable pipeline for SSD tasks is developed. This pipeline helps find the\nsenses of a word and measure their semantic change between two corpora using\nfine-tuned BERT-like models with old Spanish texts for both Latin American and\ngeneral Spanish cases. The results provide valuable insights into the cultural\nand societal shifts reflected in language changes over time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
