Although Vision Transformers (ViT) have\nrecently provided valuable features for JA, they fall short of fully addressing\nthese issues. Consequently, researchers frequently depend on expensive models\nand numerous regularization terms, resulting in long training times and\nchallenging hyperparameter tuning. We introduce the Spatial Joint Alignment\nModel (SpaceJAM), a novel approach that addresses the JA task with efficiency\nand simplicity. SpaceJAM leverages a compact architecture with only 16K\ntrainable parameters and uniquely operates without the need for regularization\nor atlas maintenance. Evaluations on SPair-71K and CUB datasets demonstrate\nthat SpaceJAM matches the alignment capabilities of existing methods while\nsignificantly reducing computational demands and achieving at least a 10x\nspeedup. SpaceJAM sets a new standard for rapid and effective image alignment,\nmaking the process more accessible and efficient.
