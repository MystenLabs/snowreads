Using transverse\ndiffractometry and Supergaussian plasma distribution modelling we extract the\nmain parameters of the plasma being the plasma density, width and shape with 20\nmicrometer spatial resolution throughout the plasma formation. The\nexperimentally recorded diffraction patterns fitted by the Supergaussian plasma\nmodel are found to capture unprecedentedly delicate traits in the evolution of\nthe plasma from its effective birth and on. Key features in the spatial\nevolution of the plasma such as the 'escape position', the 'turning point' and\nthe refocusing dynamics of the beam are identified and explored in details. Our\nwork provides experimental and theoretical access into the highly nonlinear\ndynamics of laser-induced air plasma.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b8rFJyDXdpMqYolik8KXHWyAhcBox8qsq7XsCzpWHbo","pdfSize":"3101605"}
