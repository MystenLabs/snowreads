However, how to\nefficiently implement CTQWs is a challenging issue. In this paper, we study\nimplementation of CTQWs on sparse graphs, i.e., constructing efficient quantum\ncircuits for implementing the unitary operator $e^{-iHt}$, where $H=\\gamma A$\n($\\gamma$ is a constant and $A$ corresponds to the adjacency matrix of a\ngraph). Our result is, for a $d$-sparse graph with $N$ vertices and evolution\ntime $t$, we can approximate $e^{-iHt}$ by a quantum circuit with gate\ncomplexity $(d^3 \\|H\\| t N \\log N)^{1+o(1)}$, compared to the general Pauli\ndecomposition, which scales like $(\\|H\\| t N^4 \\log N)^{1+o(1)}$. For sparse\ngraphs, for instance, $d=O(1)$, we obtain a noticeable improvement.\nInterestingly, our technique is related to graph decomposition. More\nspecifically, we decompose the graph into a union of star graphs, and\ncorrespondingly, the Hamiltonian $H$ can be represented as the sum of some\nHamiltonians $H_j$, where each $e^{-iH_jt}$ is a CTQW on a star graph which can\nbe implemented efficiently.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
