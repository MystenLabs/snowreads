We study\nthe effect of the Cu spacer thickness on the strain-induced gyrotropic\nfrequency shift in double-vortex structures comprising of magnetostrictive\nCoFeB and nonmagnetostricitve Py layers. For the two stacked vortices with\ndifferent eigen-frequencies, the strain-induced magnetoelastic anisotropy leads\nto the downshift of the gyration frequency of the magnetostricitve vortex. We\nshow that for increased dipolar coupling between the layers (i.e. decreased\nspacer thickness), a strain-induced frequency pulling regime is obtained, where\nthe resonance frequency of the nonmagnetostrictive Py vortex is upshifted\ntowards the gyration resonance of the magnetostrictive CoFeB vortex. This\nresult offers an additional degree of freedom for the manipulation of the\ndynamical regimes and synchronization conditions in spintronic oscillators,\ncontrolled by voltage and tunable by strain\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
