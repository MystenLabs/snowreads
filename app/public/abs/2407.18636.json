For any two\nvertices $x$ and $y$ in $D$, the distance from $x$ to $y$ is the minimum length\nof a path from $x$ to $y$.

In this\npaper, we show that for any real number $\\gamma>0$ there exists a constant\n$n_0=n_0(\\gamma)$, such that every digraph on $n\\geq n_0$ vertices with the\nminimum in- and out-degree at least $(2/3+\\gamma)n$ contains the reverse square\nof a Hamiltonian cycle.
