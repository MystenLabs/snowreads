Among the electromechanical materials being explored,\nthin-film lithium niobate stands out for its strong piezoelectric properties\nand low acoustic loss. However, in nearly all existing lithium niobate\nelectromechanical devices, the configuration is such that the electrodes are in\ndirect contact with the mechanical resonator. This configuration introduces an\nundesirable mass-loading effect, giving rise to spurious modes and additional\ndamping. Here, we present an electromechanical platform that mitigates this\nchallenge by leveraging a flip-chip bonding technique to separate the\nelectrodes from the mechanical resonator. By offloading the electrodes from the\nresonator, our approach yields a substantial increase in the quality factor of\nthese resonators, paving the way for enhanced performance and reliability for\ntheir device applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
