Despite these problems, models should be explainable to enable human\ntrust in the models' decisions to ensure wider adoption in high-risk\nsituations. In this paper, we propose PRECISe, an explainable-by-design model\nmeticulously constructed to concurrently address all three challenges.\nEvaluation on 2 imbalanced medical image datasets reveals that PRECISe\noutperforms the current state-of-the-art methods on data efficient\ngeneralization to minority classes, achieving an accuracy of ~87% in detecting\npneumonia in chest x-rays upon training on <60 images only. Additionally, a\ncase study is presented to highlight the model's ability to produce easily\ninterpretable predictions, reinforcing its practical utility and reliability\nfor medical imaging tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"N82CwTM19dHFLLLk-EYhWW2wzOLblEu7MnHu_WOOpNA","pdfSize":"9854070"}
