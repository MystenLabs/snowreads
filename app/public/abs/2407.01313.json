The approaches leverage adaptive variational quantum\nalgorithms for state preparation and propagation. Using automatically generated\ncompact circuits, the dynamical evolution is performed over sufficiently long\ntimes to achieve adequate frequency resolution of the response functions. We\nshowcase accurate Green's function calculations using a statevector simulator\non classical hardware for Fermi-Hubbard chains of 4 and 6 sites, with maximal\nansatz circuit depths of 65 and 424 layers, respectively, and for the molecule\nLiH with a maximal ansatz circuit depth of 81 layers. Additionally, we consider\nan antiferromagnetic quantum spin-1 model that incorporates the\nDzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction to illustrate calculations of the third-order\nnonlinear susceptibilities, which can be measured in two-dimensional coherent\nspectroscopy experiments. These results demonstrate that real-time approaches\nusing adaptive parameterized circuits to evaluate linear and nonlinear response\nfunctions can be feasible with near-term quantum processors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
