In particular we generalize the\nLichnerowicz inequality and the Faber-Krahn inequality to fiber bundles, and\nprove a counterpart to Cheng's $\\lambda_1$ comparison theorem under a lower\nRicci curvature bound.\n  By applying these, it is shown that $\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_k$ of a fiber\nbundle given by a Riemannian submersion with totally geodesic fibers of\nsufficiently positive Ricci curvature are respectively equal to\n$\\lambda_1,\\cdots,\\lambda_k$ of its base, and $\\lambda_1$ of a (possibly\nsingular) fibration with Euclidean subsets as fibers is no less than\n$\\lambda_1$ of the disk bundle obtained by replacing each fiber with a\nEuclidean disk of the same dimension and volume.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
