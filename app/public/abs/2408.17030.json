By utilizing the findings in\n\\citet{Zhang.X.2021_ILQM}, we directly present the feedback representation to\nthe rational reaction of the follower. For the leader's problem, we derive the\noptimality system through the variational method and study its unique\nsolvability from the Hilbert space point of view. We construct the explicit\noptimal control for the leader based on the solution to coupled differential\nRiccati equations (CDREs, for short) and obtain the solvability of CDREs under\nthe one-dimensional framework. Finally, we provide two concrete examples to\nillustrate the results developed in this paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
