The\nframework gives centerstage to the set of matchings an agent anticipates would\nensue should they remain unmatched, which we refer to as the agent's\nconjectures. A collection of conjectures, together with a pairwise stability\nand individual rationality requirement given the conjectures, defines a\nsolution concept for the economy. We identify a sufficient\ncondition--consistency--for a family of conjectures to lead to a nonempty\nsolution (cf. Hafalir, 2008). As an application, we introduce two families of\nconsistent conjectures and their corresponding solution concepts:\ncontinuation-value-respecting dynamic stability, and the extension to dynamic\nmarkets of the solution concept in Hafalir (2008), sophisticated dynamic\nstability.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
