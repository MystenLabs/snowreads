This\noccurs even in a non-cosmological setup in scalar-tensor theories such as\nkhronometric theory. We study a black hole moving slowly relative to the\npreferred slicing defined by the scalar field. We consider a family of\nhigher-order scalar-tensor theories that extend khronometric theory. The action\nis characterized by one constant parameter and one arbitrary function of the\nkinetic term of the scalar field. A slowly moving black hole is described by a\ndipole perturbation of a black hole at rest. We treat the metric and\nscalar-field perturbations consistently, derive a single master equation for\nthe coupled system, and reconstruct the metric for a slowly moving black hole\nfrom the master variable. In this way, we revisit and generalize the previous\nstudies. For generic theories in the family we consider, we find a solution\nthat is regular outside the universal horizon and agnostic to the arbitrary\nfunction in the action.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DFveVrJPaKqCtj_v9Z3M_EVAAv10c6WMTzbMQpGULzU","pdfSize":"759749"}
