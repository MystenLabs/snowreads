In this work, we\nfocus on studying the $f$- and $p$- quadrupolar oscillation modes, which couple\nwith gravitational waves. We construct two different EOS ensembles, one without\nand one with a first-order phase transition, and examine how $f$- and $p$-modes\nmight help us differentiate them. We find ensemble specific exclusion regions\nin the $65\\%$ and $95\\%$ confidence contours of the frequency-damping time\nrelations. The exclusion regions become more prominent for the higher-order\noscillation modes. However, these modes have higher frequencies, which are\nbeyond the detection capabilities of present gravitational wave detectors. The\nquasi-universal relations of dimensionless quantities prove to be ineffective\nin differentiating the EOS ensembles, as they obscure the details of the EOS.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
