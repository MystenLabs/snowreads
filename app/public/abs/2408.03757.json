Many\ncombinatorial optimization problems can be formulated in Boolean SAT logic --\neither as k-SAT decision problems or Max k-SAT optimization problems, with\nconflict-driven (CDCL) solvers being the most prominent. Despite their ability\nto handle large instances, CDCL-based solvers have fundamental scalability\nlimitations. In light of this, we propose recently-developed quadratic\nunconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) solvers as an alternative platform for\n3-SAT problems. To utilize them, we implement a 2-step [3-SAT]-[Max\n2-SAT]-[QUBO] conversion procedure and present a rigorous proof to explicitly\ncalculate the number of both satisfied and violated clauses of the original\n3-SAT instance from the transformed Max 2-SAT formulation. We then demonstrate,\nthrough numerical simulations on several benchmark instances, that digital QUBO\nsolvers can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy on 78-variable 3-SAT benchmark\nproblems. Our work facilitates the broader use of quantum annealers on noisy\nintermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, as well as their quantum-inspired\ndigital counterparts, for solving 3-SAT problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
