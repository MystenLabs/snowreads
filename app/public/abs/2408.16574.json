The\nupper bound holds for a class of fields closely related to the $\\star$-scale\ninvariant Gaussian fields in arbitrary number of dimensions, and the lower\nbound holds for the Gaussian free field with zero spatial average on the torus.\nThe upper bound is obtained by a modification of the method that was used in\n\\cite{LRV}, and the lower bound is obtained by applying the Donsker--Varadhan\nvariational formula.\n  We also give the probabilistic path integral formulation of the massless\nSinh--Gordon model on a torus of side length $R$, and study its partition\nfunction $R$ tends to infinity. We apply the small deviation bounds for\nGaussian multiplicative chaos to obtain lower and upper bounds for the\nlogarithm of the partition function, leading to the existence of a non-zero and\nfinite subsequential infinite volume limit for the free energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZXqE3YNXLSY508zNPx13fyxUnzAzRy5QxedjrM2jCs8","pdfSize":"298735"}
