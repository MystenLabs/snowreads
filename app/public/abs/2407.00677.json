The problem setting consists\nof a server with a library of files and a set of access caches. Each user,\nequipped with a private cache, connects to a distinct $r-$subset of the access\ncaches. The server populates both types of caches with files in uncoded format.\nFor this setting, we provide an achievable scheme and derive a lower bound on\nthe number of transmissions for this scheme. We also present a lower and upper\nbound for the optimal worst-case rate under uncoded placement for this setting\nusing the rates of the Maddah-Ali--Niesen scheme for dedicated and\ncombinatorial multi-access coded caching settings, respectively. Further, we\nderive a lower bound on the optimal worst-case rate for any general placement\npolicy using cut-set arguments. We also provide numerical plots comparing the\nrate of the proposed achievability scheme with the above bounds, from which it\ncan be observed that the proposed scheme approaches the lower bound when the\namount of memory accessed by a user is large. Finally, we discuss the\noptimality w.r.t worst-case rate when the system has four access caches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
