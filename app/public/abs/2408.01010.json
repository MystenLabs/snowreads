In opposite to the most papers in\nleterature, we consider that there exist some inderdependence between the\nprimary random variables, which is achieved by a combination of a new\ndependence structure with some two-dimensional heavy-tailed classes of\ndistributions. Further we introduce a new approach in two-dimensional regular\nvarying distributions, and we study some closure properties of this, and of\nother two-dimensional classes. Our results contain the finite-time ruin\nprobability in a two-dimensional discrete time risk model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"xfaNZqO0777bqReGLIrfJsjNi1qRpMoBOFVxa4EXUhU","pdfSize":"425685"}
