We prove that our\npolynomial is an invariant of stuquandles. Furthermore, we use the invariant of\nstuquandles to define a polynomial invariant of stuck links. As a byproduct, we\nobtain a polynomial invariant of RNA foldings. Lastly, we provide explicit\ncomputations of our polynomial invariant for both stuck links and RNA foldings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
