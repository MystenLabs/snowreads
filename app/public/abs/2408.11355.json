Prior related work\nfocused on algorithm development to tackle data heterogeneity. However, the\ndual problem of coopetition, i.e., FL collaboration and market competition,\nremains under-explored. This paper studies the FL coopetition using a dynamic\ntwo-period game model. In period 1, an incumbent company trains a local model\nand provides model-based services at a chosen price to users. In period 2, an\nentrant company enters, and both companies decide whether to engage in FL\ncollaboration and then compete in selling model-based services at different\nprices to users. Analyzing the two-period game is challenging due to data\nheterogeneity, and that the incumbent's period one pricing has a temporal\nimpact on coopetition in period 2, resulting in a non-concave problem. To\naddress this issue, we decompose the problem into several concave sub-problems\nand develop an algorithm that achieves a global optimum. Numerical results on\nthree public datasets show two interesting insights. First, FL training brings\nmodel performance gain as well as competition loss, and collaboration occurs\nonly when the performance gain outweighs the loss. Second, data heterogeneity\ncan incentivize the incumbent to limit market penetration in period 1 and\npromote price competition in period 2.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
