Consequently, the estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects\n(HTE) has been attracting attention. While various estimation methods have been\ndeveloped for a single outcome, there are still limited approaches for\nestimating HTE for multiple outcomes. Accurately estimating HTE remains a\nchallenge especially for datasets where there is a high correlation between\noutcomes or the presence of outliers. Therefore, this study proposes a method\nthat uses a robust reduced-rank regression framework to estimate treatment\neffects and identify effective subgroups. This approach allows the\nconsideration of correlations between treatment effects and the estimation of\ntreatment effects with an accurate low-rank structure. It also provides robust\nestimates for outliers. This study demonstrates that, when treatment effects\nare estimated using the reduced rank regression framework with an appropriate\nrank, the expected value of the estimator equals the treatment effect. Finally,\nwe illustrate the effectiveness and interpretability of the proposed method\nthrough simulations and real data examples.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
