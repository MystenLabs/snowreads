This is due to the computational resource constraints imposed by\nthe time evolution in the 6-dimensional phase space, which requires broad\nspatial and temporal scales. In this study, we develop a quantum-classical\nhybrid Vlasov-Maxwell solver. Specifically, the Vlasov solver implements the\nHamiltonian simulation based on Quantum Singular Value Transformation (QSVT),\ncoupled with a classical Maxwell solver. We perform numerical simulation of a\n1D advection test and a 1D1V two-stream instability test on the Qiskit-Aer-GPU\nquantum circuit emulator with an A100 GPU. The computational complexity of our\nquantum algorithm can potentially be reduced from the classical $O(N^6T^2)$ to\n$O(\\text{poly}(\\log(N),N,T))$ for the $N$ grid system and simulation time $T$.\nFurthermore, the numerical analysis reveals that our quantum algorithm is\nrobust under larger time steps compared with classical algorithms with the\nconstraint of Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy (CFL) condition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zaVcTi4MfcOpJj4gmmR6Ob4R_sFGlRLuNcr-1ke5_iQ","pdfSize":"1204040"}
