The core cause of ASD is\nexcessive stress-induced postnatal release of corticotropin-releasing hormone\n(CRH). CRH competes with urocortins for binding to the CRH2 receptor, impairing\ntheir essential function in the utilization of glucose for growth. This results\nin impaired development of all brain areas depending on CRH2, including areas\nthat are central in social development and eye gaze learning, and low-level\nsensory areas. Excessive CRH also induces excessive release of adrenal\nandrogens (mainly DHEA), which impairs the long-term plasticity function of\ngonadal steroids. I show that these two effects can explain all of the known\nsymptoms and properties of ASD. The theory is supported by strong diverse\nevidence, and points to very early detection biomarkers and preventive\npharmaceutical treatments, one of which seems to be very promising.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
