STEAM\nencourages multidisciplinary, student-centered approaches like project-based\nand inquiry-based learning, promoting real-world problem-solving. However,\nsignificant challenges arise in implementing STEAM, particularly for teachers\nwho often lack interdisciplinary training and face rigid school structures.\nAssessing STEAM outcomes also remains complex. The paper highlights the need\nfor reforms in teacher education to support interdisciplinary teaching, along\nwith addressing \"disciplinary egocentrism\" in higher education. Despite these\nchallenges, STEAM has shown promise in enhancing student engagement,\ncreativity, and critical thinking. To unlock its full potential, systemic\nchanges in curriculum design, educational practices, and teacher training are\nessential.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
