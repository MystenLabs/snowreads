Motivated by methods in spectral clustering, we also obtain\nmodular conditions on fixed point counts of certain permutation sums for the\nexistence of collections of mutually disconnected maximal cliques. We use these\nmodular obstructions to analyze the structure of maximal cliques in $X_N$ for\nsmall values of $N$. We culminate in a short, elementary proof of the\nnonexistence of a solution to Euler's $36$ Officer Problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MrLVZy9TATk6-C6WJyR4IjVtSGLtauxD4ft25UfPgrA","pdfSize":"397735"}
