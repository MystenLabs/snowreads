Our work aims to generalize reframing\nbased on the subreddit r/ChangeMyView (CMV). We build a dataset that leverages\nCMV's community's interactions and conventions to identify high-value,\ncommunity-recognized utterances that produce changes of perspective. With this\ndata, we widen the scope of the direction of reframing since the changes in\nperspective do not only occur in neutral or positive directions. We fine tune\ntransformer-based models, make use of a modern LLM to refine our dataset, and\nexplore challenges in the dataset creation and evaluation around this type of\nreframing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iZBIci9VVFcdb9jLrxk8ebLZ6RQGeA8Nfn-qNfgrP8I","pdfSize":"764699"}
