Data-driven predictive methods, especially those\nutilizing machine learning techniques, have emerged to handle these\ncomplexities in urban delivery demand management problems. One particularly\npressing problem that has not yet been sufficiently studied is the joint\nestimation and prediction of city-wide delivery demand. To this end, we\nformulate this problem as a graph-based spatiotemporal learning task. First, a\nmessage-passing neural network model is formalized to capture the interaction\nbetween demand patterns of associated regions. Second, by exploiting recent\nadvances in large language models, we extract general geospatial knowledge\nencodings from the unstructured locational data and integrate them into the\ndemand predictor. Last, to encourage the cross-city transferability of the\nmodel, an inductive training scheme is developed in an end-to-end routine.\nExtensive empirical results on two real-world delivery datasets, including\neight cities in China and the US, demonstrate that our model significantly\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines in these challenging tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
