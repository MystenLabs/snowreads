Methods of this category can solve a wide\nrange of PDEs with high accuracy, typically by transforming the problems into\nhighly nonlinear optimization problems of neural network parameters. This work\nreviews several deep learning solvers proposed a few years ago, including PINN,\nWAN, DRM, and VPINN. Numerical results are provided to make comparisons amongst\nthem and address the importance of loss formulation and the optimization\nmethod. A rigorous error analysis for PINN is also presented. Finally, we\ndiscuss the current limitations and bottlenecks of these methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
