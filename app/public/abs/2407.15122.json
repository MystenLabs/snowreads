The proposed work\nenables perception-aware motion control for a quadrotor UAV to detect and\nnavigate to objects of interest such as wind turbines and electric towers. The\ndistance to the object of interest was estimated utilizing RGB as the primary\nsensory input. For the needs of the study, the Microsoft AirSim simulator was\nused. As a first step, a YOLOv8 model was integrated providing the basic\nposition setpoints towards the detection. From the YOLOv8 inference, a target\nyaw angle was derived. The subsequent algorithms, combining performant in\ncomputational terms computer vision methods and YOLOv8, actively drove the\ndrone to measure the height of the detection. Based on the height, an estimate\nof the depth was retrieved. In addition to this step, a convolutional neural\nnetwork was developed, namely ActvePerceptionNet aiming at active YOLOv8\ninference. The latter was validated for wind turbines where the rotational\nmotion of the propeller was found to affect object confidence in a near\nperiodical fashion. The results of the simulation experiments conducted in this\nstudy showed efficient object height and distance estimation and effective\nlocalization.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
