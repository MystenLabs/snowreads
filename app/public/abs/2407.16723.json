However, ahead of the war in\nUkraine Europe began to suffer from substantially increased and volatile gas\nprices which culminated in the aftermath of the North Stream 1 explosion. This\nshock changed both trend and volatility structure of the prices and has\nconsiderable effects on forecasting models. In this study we investigate\nwhether modern machine learning methods such as neural networks are more\nresilient against such changes than statistical models such as autoregressive\nmoving average (ARMA) models with conditional heteroskedasticity, or\ncopula-based time series models. Thereby the focus lies on interval forecasting\nand applying respective evaluation measures. As data, the Front Month prices\nfrom the Dutch Title Transfer Facility, currently the predominant European\nexchange, are used. We see that, during the shock period, most models\nunderestimate the variance while overestimating the variance in the after-shock\nperiod. Furthermore, we recognize that, during the shock, the simpler models,\ni.e. an ARMA model with conditional heteroskedasticity and the multilayer\nperceptron (a neural network), perform best with regards to prediction interval\ncoverage. Interestingly, the widely-used long-short term neural network is\noutperformed by its competitors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
