Our\nconstruction circumvents the causal obstruction to formulating QFT in de Sitter\ndue to event horizons. There aren't any in static Einstein. The `unitary gauge'\ndescription of the theory is realized by the zonal harmonics $P_\\ell(\\hat n\n\\cdot \\hat n')$. We verify that interactions with conformally invariant\nexternal sources are mediated only by these modes. Hence these modes comprise\nthe complete basis of the \"bulk\" theory. When the theory is cut off in the UV\nthe basis dimension scales as the Bekenstein-Hawking formula.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
