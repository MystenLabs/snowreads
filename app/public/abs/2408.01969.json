In this\nwork, we propose a framework that achieves the aforementioned by generating\nsemantically edited inputs, known as counterfactual interventions, which change\nthe model prediction, thus providing a form of counterfactual explanations for\nthe model. We test our framework on two NLP tasks - binary sentiment\nclassification and topic classification - and show that the generated edits are\ncontrastive, fluent and minimal, while the whole process remains significantly\nfaster that other state-of-the-art counterfactual editors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
