Additionally, we provide explicit descriptions of hyperk\\\"ahler\nmanifolds of K3$^{[n]}$-type with Picard ranks below this crucial value (e.g.,\n$\\rho(X)=3$) that are not birational to such moduli spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
