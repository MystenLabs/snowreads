Restricting to the case where the Maxwell field is aligned, i.e.,\nthe spacetime is algebraically special, we provide an exhaustive classification\nof supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman spacetimes in the four-dimensional ${\\cal\nN}=2$ gauged supergravity. The differential constraints that arise from the\nintegrability conditions of the Killing spinor equation enable us to\nsystematically reconstruct the metric. We derive the explicit form of the\nKilling spinor either by directly integrating the Killing spinor equation or by\ncasting the solution into the canonical form of supersymmetric solutions given\nin hep-th/0307022. In any case, the supersymmetric Robinson-Trautman solution\ngenerically exhibits a naked singularity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
