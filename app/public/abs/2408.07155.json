In this study, we present a combined\napproach using genetic algorithms and deep learning models to address two\ncritical aspects of drug discovery: the generation of novel tyrosine kinase\ninhibitors and the prediction of their bioactivity. The generative model\nleverages genetic algorithms to create new small molecules with optimized ADMET\n(absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion, and toxicity) and\ndrug-likeness properties. Concurrently, a deep learning model is employed to\npredict the bioactivity of these generated molecules against tyrosine kinases,\na key enzyme family involved in various cellular processes and cancer\nprogression. By integrating these advanced computational methods, we\ndemonstrate a powerful framework for accelerating the generation and\nidentification of potential tyrosine kinase inhibitors, contributing to more\nefficient and effective early-stage drug discovery processes.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
