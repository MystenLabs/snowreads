One of the principal\nchallenges in this field is the complexity of existing algorithms. The\nGirvan-Newman algorithm, which uses the betweenness metric as a measure of node\nsimilarity, is one of the most representative algorithms in this area. This\nstudy employs the same method to evaluate the relevance of using local\nsimilarity metrics for community detection. A series of local metrics were\ntested on a set of networks constructed using the Girvan-Newman basic\nalgorithm. The efficacy of these metrics was evaluated by applying the base\nalgorithm to several real networks with varying community sizes, using\nmodularity and NMI. The results indicate that approaches based on local\nsimilarity metrics have significant potential for community detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
