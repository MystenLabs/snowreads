To be\nprecise for $ N \\in \\mathbb{Z}_+,\\;N \\gg1 $ we obtain a magnetic envelope/ion\ndensity pair of the form\n  $$ \\psi_*(t, x)= e^{i\\alpha(t)}\\lambda(t) W(\\lambda(t)x) + \\eta(t, x),\n\\;n_*(t,x) = \\lambda^2(t) W^2(\\lambda(t) x) + \\chi(t,x), $$\n  where $ W(x) = (1 + \\frac{|x|^2}{8})^{-1}$, $\\alpha(t) = \\alpha_0 \\log(t)$,\n$\\lambda(t)= t^{-\\frac{1}{2}-\\nu}$ with large $\\nu > 1 $ and further\n  $$\n  i \\partial_t \\psi_* + \\Delta \\psi_* + n_* \\psi_* = \\mathcal{O}(t^N),\\; \\Box\nn_* - \\Delta (|\\psi_*|^2) = \\mathcal{O}(t^N),\\;\\;\\eta(t) \\to \\eta_0, \\chi(t)\n\\to \\chi_0,\n  $$\n  as $ t \\to 0^+$ in a suitable sense. The method of construction is inspired\nby matched asymptotic regions and approximation procedures in the context of\nblow up solutions introduced by the first author jointly with W.
