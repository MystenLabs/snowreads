This paper examines the gaps and overlaps between LMs\nand the brain at different levels of analysis, emphasizing the importance of\nlooking beyond input-output behavior to examine and compare the internal\nprocesses of these systems. We discuss how insights from neuroscience, such as\nsparsity, modularity, internal states, and interactive learning, can inform the\ndevelopment of more biologically plausible language models. Furthermore, we\nexplore the role of scaling laws in bridging the gap between LMs and human\ncognition, highlighting the need for efficiency constraints analogous to those\nin biological systems. By developing LMs that more closely mimic brain\nfunction, we aim to advance both artificial intelligence and our understanding\nof human cognition.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
