Yet, to fully unlock this\npotential, requirements imposed by various stakeholders must be fulfilled,\nregarding, e.g., efficiency or trust assumptions. While many of these\nrequirements can be addressed by deploying advanced secure computation\nparadigms such as fully homomorphic encryption, certain aspects require an\nintegration with additional privacy-preserving technologies.\n  In this work, we perform a qualitative requirements elicitation based on\nselected real-world use cases. We match the derived requirements categories\nagainst the features and guarantees provided by available technologies. For\neach technology, we additionally perform a maturity assessment, including the\nstate of standardization and availability on the market. Furthermore, we\nprovide a decision tree supporting application developers in identifying the\nmost promising technologies available matching their needs. Finally, existing\ngaps are identified, highlighting research potential to advance the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
