Through spinodal\ndecomposition or condensation nuclei, the phase-separated state with non-zero\nmomentum can be achieved. In this scenario, we observe a gap between coexisting\nphases, arising not only from the variations in energy density, but also from\nthe distinctions in momentum density or longitudinal pressure. These\ndisparities are characterized by flow velocity and latent heat. Furthermore, by\nintroducing an inhomogeneous scalar external source to simulate a fixed\nobstacle, we reveal the dynamical response of momentum loss in the moving\nsystem. Notably, starting from an initial phase-separated state with uniform\nflow velocity, and subsequently interacting it with an obstacle, we find that\nthe moving high-energy phase exhibits four characteristic dynamical behaviors\n-- rebounding, pinning, passing, and splitting. These behaviors depend on the\nvelocity of the phase and the strength of the obstacle.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
