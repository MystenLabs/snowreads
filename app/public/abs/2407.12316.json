The Gaussian approximation opens\nup the possibility to verify asymptotic validity of a multiplier bootstrap\nprocedure and, even further, to derive the corresponding rate of convergence. A\nsmall simulation study sheds light on the finite sample properties of this\nbootstrap proposal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w-zANfi8DMHguhb9rpldnJauk3R2O50bjreOvnWsHJ4","pdfSize":"305656"}
