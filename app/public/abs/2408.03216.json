However, the\ndifficulty in obtaining ultra-high resolution Diffusion MRI scans poses a\nproblem in training neural networks to obtain high-resolution dMRI scans. Here\nwe hypothesise that the inclusion of structural MRI images, which can be\nacquired at much higher resolutions, can be used as a guide to obtaining a more\naccurate high-resolution dMRI output. To test our hypothesis, we have\nconstructed a novel framework that incorporates structural MRI scans together\nwith dMRI to obtain high-resolution dMRI scans. We set up tests which evaluate\nthe validity of our claim through various configurations and compare the\nperformance of our approach against a unimodal approach. Our results show that\nthe inclusion of structural MRI scans do lead to an improvement in\nhigh-resolution image prediction when T1w data is incorporated into the model\ninput.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
