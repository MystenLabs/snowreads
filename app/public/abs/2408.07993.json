In\nparticular, the nonhomogeneous term $f(x,u)$ is assumed optimally to satisfy\nunform Dini continuity condition in $u$ and modified $C^{1,1}$ Newtonian\npotential condition in $x$. For unbounded coefficients, if $a_{ij}$ is\n$C_{n}^{-1,1}$ at $x_{0}\\in\\Omega$ with small modulus, $b_{i}\\in L^{q}(\\Omega)$\nfor some $q>n$, the solution is $C^{1}$ at $x_{0}$. Furthermore, if\n$a_{ij},~b_{i}$ are Dini continuous at $x_{0}$, the solution is $C^{1,1}$ at\n$x_{0}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
