Although weakly supervised methods offer higher annotation\nefficiency, their performance is far behind due to the unclear visual\ndemarcations between foreground and background in camouflaged images. In this\npaper, we explore the potential of using boxes as prompts in camouflaged scenes\nand introduce the first weakly semi-supervised COD method, aiming for\nbudget-efficient and high-precision camouflaged object segmentation with an\nextremely limited number of fully labeled images. Critically, learning from\nsuch limited set inevitably generates pseudo labels with serious noisy pixels.\nTo address this, we propose a noise correction loss that facilitates the\nmodel's learning of correct pixels in the early learning stage, and corrects\nthe error risk gradients dominated by noisy pixels in the memorization stage,\nultimately achieving accurate segmentation of camouflaged objects from noisy\nlabels. When using only 20% of fully labeled data, our method shows superior\nperformance over the state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
