Although the information needs of\nsoftware practitioners have been studied extensively, the impact of AI-assisted\ntools on their needs and information-seeking behaviors remains largely\nunexplored. To addresses this gap, we conducted a mixed-method study to\nunderstand AI-assisted information seeking behavior of practitioners and its\nimpact on their perceived productivity and skill development. We found that\ndevelopers are increasingly using AI tools to support their information\nseeking, citing increased efficiency as a key benefit. Our findings also\namplify caveats that come with effectively using AI tools for information\nseeking, especially for learning and skill development, such as the importance\nof foundational developer knowledge that can guide and inform the information\nprovided by AI tools. Our efforts have implications for the effective\nintegration of AI tools into developer workflows as information retrieval and\nlearning aids.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0p0RX5LyxIW5UdXP7MjkHOsD-Fdw5ZPbXAucX7Zm0VE","pdfSize":"206373"}
