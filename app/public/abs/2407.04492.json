For an\nabelian group $G$ and an $n$-element subset $Y \\subseteq G$ we show that if $m\n\\ll s^2/(\\log n)^2$, then the number of subsets $A \\subseteq Y$ with $|A| = s$\nand $|A + A| \\leq m$ is at most \\[2^{o(s)}\\binom{\\frac{m+\\beta}{2}}{s},\\] where\n$\\beta$ is the size of the largest subgroup of $G$ of size at most\n$\\left(1+o(1)\\right)m$. This bound is sharp for $\\mathbb{Z}$ and many other\ngroups. Our result improves the one of Campos and nearly bridges the remaining\ngap in a conjecture of Alon, Balogh, Morris, and Samotij.\n  We also explore the behaviour of uniformly chosen random sets $A \\subseteq\n\\{1,\\ldots,n\\}$ with $|A| = s$ and $|A + A| \\leq m$. Under the same assumption\nthat $m \\ll s^2/(\\log n)^2$, we show that with high probability there exists an\narithmetic progression $P \\subseteq \\mathbb{Z}$ of size at most $m/2 + o(m)$\ncontaining all but $o(s)$ elements of $A$. Analogous results are obtained for\nasymmetric sumsets, improving results by Campos, Coulson, Serra, and W\\\"otzel.\nThe main tool behind our proofs is a graph container theorem combined with a\nvariant of an asymmetric hypergraph container theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
