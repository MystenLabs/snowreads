Recent enhancements of the framework have realized the efficient\nimplementation of large objects, by introducing versioning and data striping\ntechniques. In this work, we identify performance bottlenecks of the Ares's\nvariants by utilizing distributed tracing, a popular technique for monitoring\nand profiling distributed systems. We then propose optimizations across all\nversions of Ares, aiming in overcoming the identified flaws, while preserving\ncorrectness. We refer to the optimized version of Ares as Ares II, which now\nfeatures a piggyback mechanism, a garbage collection mechanism, and a batching\nreconfiguration technique for improving the performance and storage efficiency\nof the original Ares. We rigorously prove the correctness of Ares II, and we\ndemonstrate the performance improvements by an experimental comparison (via\ndistributed tracing) of the Ares II variants with their original counterparts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"i7d73F09EABq8ewWm8XoV82jRH8mlAXOilRxq_7DEd0","pdfSize":"1885290"}
