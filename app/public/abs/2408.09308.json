However, most works neglect the quantum-inherent shot\nnoise, let alone the effect of current noisy devices. Here, we present a\ncomprehensive study of quantum linear response (qLR) theory obtaining\nspectroscopic properties on simulated fault-tolerant quantum computers and\npresent-day near-term quantum hardware. This work introduces novel metrics to\nanalyze and predict the origins of noise in the quantum algorithm, proposes an\nAnsatz-based error mitigation technique, and highlights the significant impact\nof Pauli saving in reducing measurement costs and noise. Our hardware results\nusing up to cc-pVTZ basis set serve as proof-of-principle for obtaining\nabsorption spectra on quantum hardware in a general approach with the accuracy\nof classical multi-configurational methods. Importantly, our results exemplify\nthat substantial improvements in hardware error rates and measurement speed are\nnecessary to lift quantum computational chemistry from proof-of-concept to an\nactual impact in the field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
