The complex band structure of the insulator is taken into\naccount, and an analytical formula for tunneling conductance and TMR is\nderived. Numerical calculations using a tight-binding model validate the\nanalytical formula. The complex nature of insulator's band structure leads to\nsignificant oscillations in tunneling conductance and TMR as functions of\nbarrier thickness. It is demonstrated that these TMR oscillations are not\ncaused by quantum confinement within the barrier, but are instead analogous to\nclassical two-slit optical interference.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
