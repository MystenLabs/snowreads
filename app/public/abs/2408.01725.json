We introduce a\ndrama machine framework that coordinates interactions between LLM agents\nplaying different 'Ego' and 'Superego' psychological roles. In roleplay\nsimulations, this design allows intersubjective dialogue and intra-subjective\ninternal monologue to develop in parallel. We apply this framework to two\ndramatic scenarios - an interview and a detective story - and compare character\ndevelopment with and without the Superego's influence. Though exploratory,\nresults suggest this multi-agent approach can produce more nuanced, adaptive\nnarratives that evolve over a sequence of dialogical turns. We discuss\ndifferent modalities of LLM-based roleplay and character development, along\nwith what this might mean for conceptualization of AI subjectivity. The paper\nconcludes by considering how this approach opens possibilities for thinking of\nthe roles of internal conflict and social performativity in AI-based\nsimulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
