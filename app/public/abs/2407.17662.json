It examines vacancy and interstitial\ndiffusion mechanisms, the application of Fick's laws, and their impact on\nprocesses such as phase precipitation and recrystallization in metals and\nalloys. Additionally, it addresses its relevance in grain growth, diffusion\nwelding, and sintering, which are critical processes to improve the properties\nof materials with engineering applications in various areas such as biomedical,\nelectrical, and chemistry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"eqJmH80t3yHoANLq_kXK_rlnKJAM3p5MZYoGkazTsl8","pdfSize":"86480"}
