We often add exceptions or change our\nminds, and thus norms can conflict over time. Therefore, to maintain an\naccurate mental model of other's norms, and thus to avoid social friction, such\nconflicts must be detected and resolved quickly. Formalizing this process has\nbeen the focus of various deontic logics and normative multi-agent systems. We\naim to bridge the gap between these two fields here. We contribute a defeasible\ndeontic calculus with inheritance and prove that it resolves norm conflicts.\nThrough this analysis, we also reveal a common resolution strategy as a red\nherring. This paper thus contributes a theoretically justified axiomatization\nof norm conflict detection and resolution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
