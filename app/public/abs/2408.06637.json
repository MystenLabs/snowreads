This formula includes the\nextension of the work by Kenyon and Peres (1996) on planar sofic sets and\nyields an exact value for the dimension of certain sofic sets in $\\mathbb{R}^3$\nor higher. We also calculate the Minkowski dimension of sofic sets and\nestablish a sufficient and presumably necessary condition for planar sofic sets\nto have the same Minkowski and Hausdorff dimension. The condition can be\nregarded as a generalization of the classical result for Bedford-McMullen\ncarpets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
