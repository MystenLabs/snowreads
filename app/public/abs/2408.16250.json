This is done by constructing an explicit set of\ngenerators for each invariant ring in question. We also propose a conjecture\nconcerning the action of the Steenrod algebra and the Dickson algebra on a\ncertain naturally occurring filtration of the invariant ring under the general\nlinear group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KNK0qUKCMbBiAqBipWR8jY8BCG12Zz8hINUqWiKeXEs","pdfSize":"302426"}
