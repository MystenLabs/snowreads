We show that all\nfree-by-cyclic groups are equationally Noetherian. As a corollary, we deduce\nthat the set of exponential growth rates of a free-by-cyclic group is well\nordered. Along the way, we prove that free-by-cyclic groups with polynomially\ngrowing monodromies of infinite order admit non-elementary 4-acylindrical\nactions on trees. We show that the splittings arising from the improved\nrelative train track machinery of Bestvina-Feighn-Handel are 2-acylindrical\nwhen the growth is at least quadratic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
