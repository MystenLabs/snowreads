Phys.\nA48(2015), no.4, 0405001, 15 pp.]. For a random recursive tree of size $n$, let\nevery site have probability ${p \\in (0,1)}$ to remain and with probability\n$(1-p)$ to be removed. As $n\\to\\infty,$ we show that the proportion of the\nremaining clusters of size $k$ is of order $k^{-1-\\frac{1}{p}}$, resulting in a\nYule-Simon distribution; the largest cluster size is of order $n^{p}$, and\nadmits a non-trivial scaling limit. The proofs are based on the embedding of\nthis model in the multi-type branching processes, and a coupling with the\nbond-percolation on random recursive trees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
