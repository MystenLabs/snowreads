The pattern matching approach and\nthe field solver for capacitance extraction have the drawbacks of inaccuracy\nand large computational cost, respectively. Recent work \\cite{yang2023cnn}\nproposes a grid-based data representation and a convolutional neural network\n(CNN) based capacitance models (called CNN-Cap), which opens the third way for\n3-D capacitance extraction to get accurate results with much less time cost\nthan field solver. In this work, the techniques of neural architecture search\n(NAS) and data augmentation are proposed to train better CNN models for 3-D\ncapacitance extraction. Experimental results on datasets from different designs\nshow that the obtained NAS-Cap models achieve remarkably higher accuracy than\nCNN-Cap, while consuming less runtime for inference and space for model\nstorage. Meanwhile, the transferability of the NAS is validated, as the once\nsearched architecture brought similar error reduction on coupling/total\ncapacitance for the test cases from different design and/or process technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
