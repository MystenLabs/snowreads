Congestion pricing\nis effective in reducing demand to sustainable levels, but also controversial,\nas it introduces equity issues and systematically discriminates lower-income\ngroups. Karma is a non-monetary, fair, and efficient resource allocation\nmechanism, that employs an artificial currency different from money, that\nincentivizes cooperation amongst selfish individuals, and achieves a balance\nbetween giving and taking. Where money does not do its job, Karma achieves\nsocially more desirable resource allocations by being aligned with consumers'\nneeds rather than their financial power. This work highlights the value\nproposition of Karma, gives guidance on important Karma mechanism design\nelements, and equips the reader with a useful software framework to model Karma\neconomies and predict consumers' behaviour. A case study demonstrates the\npotential of this feasible alternative to money, without the burden of\nadditional fees.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RNkwswo28pw5aoVnup7ahSkZ4ufPSkuwNilVFd86iss","pdfSize":"1355244"}
