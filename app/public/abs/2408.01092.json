Here, we identify yet another class of distinct\nphenomena that is hinged on EPs, namely, the emergence of a series of\nnon-Hermitian conservation laws. We demonstrate these distinct phenomena\nconcretely in the non-Hermitian Heisenberg chain and formulate a general theory\nfor identifying these emergent non-Hermitian conservation laws at EPs. By\nestablishing a one-to-one correspondence between the constant of motions at EPs\nand those in corresponding auxiliary Hermitian systems, we trace their physical\norigin back to the presence of emergent symmetries in the auxiliary systems.\nConcrete simulations on quantum circuits show that these emergent conserved\ndynamics can be readily observed in current digital quantum computing systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
