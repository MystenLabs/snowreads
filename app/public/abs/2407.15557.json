The convergence analysis of the algorithm is discussed as\nwell. We test the proposed method in the polarization image and color facial\nimage representation. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hierarchical\nnonnegative least squares method for the QNMF model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
