Utilizing techniques from computational geometry,\nspecifically higher-degree Voronoi diagrams, we navigate to the optimal\nsubspace for PCA even in the presence of outliers. This approach achieves an\noptimal solution with a time complexity of\n$n^{d+\\mathcal{O}(1)}\\text{poly}(n,d)$. Additionally, we present a randomized\nalgorithm with a complexity of $2^{\\mathcal{O}(r(d-r))} \\times \\text{poly}(n,\nd)$. This algorithm samples subspaces characterized in terms of a Grassmannian\nmanifold. By employing such sampling method, we ensure a high likelihood of\ncapturing the optimal subspace, with the success probability $(1 - \\delta)^T$.\nWhere $\\delta$ represents the probability that a sampled subspace does not\ncontain the optimal solution, and $T$ is the number of subspaces sampled,\nproportional to $2^{r(d-r)}$. Our use of higher-degree Voronoi diagrams and\nGrassmannian based sampling offers a clearer conceptual pathway and practical\nadvantages, particularly in handling large datasets or higher-dimensional\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
