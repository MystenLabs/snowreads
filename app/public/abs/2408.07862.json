The ability of an AI model to correctly classify\nnovel malware is dependent on the quality of the features it is trained with\nand the authenticity of the features is dependent on the analysis tool.\nPeekaboo, a Dynamic Binary Instrumentation tool defeats evasive malware to\ncapture its genuine behavior. The ransomware Assembly instructions captured by\nPeekaboo, follow Zipf's law, a principle also observed in natural languages,\nindicating Transformer models are particularly well suited to binary\nclassification. We propose Pulse, a novel framework for zero day ransomware\ndetection with Transformer models and Assembly language. Pulse, trained with\nthe Peekaboo ransomware and benign software data, uniquely identify truly new\nsamples with high accuracy. Pulse eliminates any familiar functionality across\nthe test and training samples, forcing the Transformer model to detect\nmalicious behavior based solely on context and novel Assembly instruction\ncombinations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DmGzoKo_fn8iSaELAak_OK42mPfH5rxq-sLI5mtHInQ","pdfSize":"4653273"}
