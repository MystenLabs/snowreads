Warm dark matter or fuzzy dark matter models predict lower\nabundances of small mass dark matter halos as compared to the standard cold\ndark matter. This will result in a reduction in the number of strongly lensed\nGW events, especially at small time delays. Using the number of lensed events\nand the lensing time delay distribution, we can put a lower bound on the mass\nof the warm/fuzzy dark matter particle from a catalog of lensed GW events. The\nexpected bounds from GW strong lensing from next-generation detectors are\nsignificantly better than the current constraints.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
