However, predicting the drum\nwater level in boilers is challenging due to complex non-linear process\ndynamics originating from long-time delays and interrelations, as well as\nmeasurement noise. This paper investigates the application of Transformer-based\nmodels for predicting drum water levels in a steam boiler plant. Leveraging the\ncapabilities of Transformer architectures, this study aims to develop an\naccurate and robust predictive framework to anticipate water level fluctuations\nand facilitate proactive control strategies. To this end, a prudent pipeline is\nproposed, including 1) data preprocess, 2) causal relation analysis, 3) delay\ninference, 4) variable augmentation, and 5) prediction. Through extensive\nexperimentation and analysis, the effectiveness of Transformer-based approaches\nin steam drum water level prediction is evaluated, highlighting their potential\nto enhance operational stability and optimize plant performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
