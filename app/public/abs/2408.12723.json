Moreover, subject to ratios\nconjectures, we prove that murmurations arise for elliptic curves ordered by\nheight, and for quadratic twists of a fixed elliptic curve. We demonstrate the\nexistence of murmurations for these arithmetic families using results from\nrandom matrix theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
