Within the framework of\ncircuit-based quantum computation, the sum-over-paths interpretation of quantum\nprobability amplitudes leads to the emergence of sums of exponentiated\npolynomials. In contrast, the matrix permanent is a combinatorial object that\nplays a crucial role in photonic by describing the probability amplitudes of\nlinear optical computations. To connect the two, we introduce a general method\nto encode an $\\mathbb F_2$-valued polynomial with complex coefficients into a\ngraph, such that the permanent of the resulting graph's adjacency matrix\ncorresponds directly to the amplitude associated the polynomial in the\nsum-over-path framework. This connection allows one to express quantum\namplitudes arising from qubit-based circuits as permanents, which can naturally\nbe estimated on a photonic quantum device.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
