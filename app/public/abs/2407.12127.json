Such a treatment is\nnecessary in some laboratory plasmas, whose volume is constrained but whose\npressure can vary. Solutions are derived for the evolution of clouds,\naccounting for pressure variation and interactions between conduction fronts.\nAdditional stable configurations and secondary instabilities are derived, which\nmay be relevant to fusion plasmas and to the study of photoionized plasma in\nthe laboratory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
