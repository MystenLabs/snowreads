Lorenz: if the ground field is infinite then\nbialgebra or Hopf products are finite-dimensional precisely when the factors\nare, with at most one of dimension $>1$; over finite fields the necessary and\nsufficient condition is instead that factors be finite-dimensional with at most\nfinitely many of dimension $>1$; finally, these statements hold for coalgebras\nas well, provided the family is finite. We also characterize (a) finite field\nextensions as precisely those whose underlying scalar extension functor\npreserves coalgebra, or bialgebra, or Hopf algebra products (correcting an\nerror in the literature); (b) algebraic field extensions as those along which\nfinite coalgebra (bialgebra, Hopf algebra) products are preserved; and (c)\nagain algebraic field extensions as precisely those which intertwine cofree\ncoalgebras on vector spaces, or cofree bialgebras (Hopf algebras) on algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
