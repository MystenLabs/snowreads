Traditional classification methods\nfalter due to the intricatestructures of these micrographs. This study\nintroduces an innovative architecture that leverages the generative\ncapabilities of zero-shot prompting in Large Language Models (LLMs) such as\nGPT-4(language only), the predictive ability of few-shot (in-context) learning\nin Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) such as GPT-4(V)ision, and fuses knowledge\nacross image based and linguistic insights for accurate nanomaterial category\nprediction. This comprehensive approach aims to provide a robust solution for\nthe automated nanomaterial identification task in semiconductor manufacturing,\nblending performance, efficiency, and interpretability. Our method surpasses\nconventional approaches, offering precise nanomaterial identification and\nfacilitating high-throughput screening.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XneWdtpcNjTlVVHvJrIFGCRI03BamIkxzEJmglds1Gc","pdfSize":"3909344"}
