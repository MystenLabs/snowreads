To verify the extended Babinet's\nrelations, we investigate two types of reflective metasurfaces embedding\nself-complementary structures, which produce $\\pi$-phase difference between two\northogonal linear polarizations under specific conditions required for the\nextended Babinet's relations. Both theoretical and experimental studies\ndemonstrate a metasurface-based half-wave plate with a reflective metasurface\nincluding single self-complementary structures in the terahertz regions. In\naddition, we study a reflective metasurface with embedded self-complementary\nstructures with phase gradient in reflection, and demonstrate simultaneous\nimplementation of anomalous reflection and polarization conversion with high\nefficiency.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
