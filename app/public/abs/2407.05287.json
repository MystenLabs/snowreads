For example, electronic health\nrecords are commonly collected over several time periods and then used to\npersonalize treatment decisions. Existing works for this task have mostly\nfocused on model-based learners (i.e., learners that adapt specific\nmachine-learning models). In contrast, model-agnostic learners -- so-called\nmeta-learners -- are largely unexplored. In our paper, we propose several\nmeta-learners that are model-agnostic and thus can be used in combination with\narbitrary machine learning models (e.g., transformers) to estimate HTEs over\ntime. Here, our focus is on learners that can be obtained via weighted\npseudo-outcome regressions, which allows for efficient estimation by targeting\nthe treatment effect directly. We then provide a comprehensive theoretical\nanalysis that characterizes the different learners and that allows us to offer\ninsights into when specific learners are preferable. Finally, we confirm our\ntheoretical insights through numerical experiments. In sum, while meta-learners\nare already state-of-the-art for the static setting, we are the first to\npropose a comprehensive set of meta-learners for estimating HTEs in the\ntime-varying setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
