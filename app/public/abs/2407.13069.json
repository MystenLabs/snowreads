With\nthe advance of large language models (LLMs), some studies utilized the models\nfor annotation and sentiment analysis. However, the relationship between the\naccuracy and the hyper-parameters of LLMs is yet to be thoroughly examined. In\naddition, the issues of variability and reproducibility of results from each\ntrial of LLMs have rarely been considered in existing literature. Since actual\nhuman annotation uses majority voting to resolve disagreements among\nannotators, this study introduces a majority voting mechanism to a sentiment\nanalysis model using local LLMs. By a series of three analyses of online\nreviews on restaurant evaluations, we demonstrate that majority voting with\nmultiple attempts using a medium-sized model produces more robust results than\nusing a large model with a single attempt. Furthermore, we conducted further\nanalysis to investigate the effect of each aspect on the overall evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p3QlZjHf2PADMsKmLg-nRF9tkaNlPW3WERfNEMmiHwM","pdfSize":"492364","objectId":"0x49df1f4435a436edac599ed74fb81792d131e1ab6221d4708f8f99b9a527a0d9","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
