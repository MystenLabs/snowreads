Integrable nonlinear lattice equations possess a profound\nmathematical structure that enables them to revert to continuous integrable\nequations in the continuous limit, particularly retaining integrable properties\nsuch as conservation laws, Hamiltonian structure, and multiple soliton\nsolutions. The pseudo grid-based physics-informed convolutional-recurrent\nnetwork (PG-PhyCRNet) is proposed to investigate the localized wave solutions\nof integrable lattice equations, which significantly enhances the model's\nextrapolation capability to lattice points beyond the temporal domain. We\nconduct a comparative analysis of PG-PhyCRNet with and without pseudo grid by\ninvestigating the multi-soliton solutions and rational solitons of the Toda\nlattice and self-dual network equation. The results indicate that the\nPG-PhyCRNet excels in capturing long-term evolution and enhances the model's\nextrapolation capability for solitons, particularly those with steep waveforms\nand high wave speeds. Finally, the robustness of the PG-PhyCRNet method and its\neffect on the prediction of solutions in different scenarios are confirmed\nthrough repeated experiments involving pseudo grid partitioning.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
