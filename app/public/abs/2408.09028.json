In this work, we introduce Temporally-Relative\nDuplicate Pruning (TRDP), a technique for duplicate detection and removal in\nboth classic and continuous-time MAPF domains. TRDP is a simple procedure which\ncloses the long-standing theoretic loophole of incompleteness for CBS by\ndetecting and avoiding the expansion of duplicate states. TRDP is shown both\ntheoretically and empirically to ensure termination without a significant\nimpact on runtime in the majority of problem instances. In certain cases, TRDP\nis shown to increase performance significantly\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
