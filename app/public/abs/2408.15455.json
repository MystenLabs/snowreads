Here the backreaction problem in 1D\ncondensates is considered from the perspective of energy and momentum\nconservation. By assuming the validity of Bogoliubov theory, the backreaction\nequations are used to identify the contributions to the system energy and\nmomentum coming from quantum fluctuations and condensate corrections. The\nbackreaction is solved for a condensate trapped in a ring configuration and\nsuch that particle interactions are continuously switched on. It is shown that\nthe energy in the condensate cannot be addressed without taking into account\nhow the system entered the interacting regime, and even for homogeneous\ncondensates the power transferred to the condensate by quantum fluctuations\nshowcases an intricate non-monotonic pattern.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
