The control approach exploits the inherent cascaded structure of\nthe vehicle dynamics and is divided into control designs at the kinematics\nlevel and the kinetics level. A controller with a low-gain feature is designed\nat the kinematics level by incorporating the cascaded system method,\npersistency of excitation, and the small-gain theorem. Furthermore, a PD+\ncontroller is designed to achieve the velocity tracking at the kinetics level.\nThe proposed control laws are partially linear and saturated linear and easy to\nimplement. Based on a leader-follower scheme, our control approach applies to\nthe formation tracking control problem of multi-vehicle systems under a\ndirected spanning tree topology. Our main results guarantee uniform global\nasymptotic stability for the closed-loop system, which implies robustness with\nrespect to perturbations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
