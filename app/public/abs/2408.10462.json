Soil moisture measurement technique of the proposed sensor is based\non the complex permittivity sensing property of a DPS in time domain. Soil\nrelative permittivity which varies with its moisture content is measured by\nburying the DPS under a soil mass and changing its phase difference while\nexcited with a 114 MHz sine wave (single tone). DPS output phase and magnitude\nare compared with the reference signal and measured with a phase/loss detector.\nThe proposed sensor exhibits accuracy better than +-1.2 percent at the highest\nVolumetric Water Content (VWC=30 percent) for sandy-type soil. Precise design\nguide is developed and simulations are performed to achieve a highly sensitive\nsensor. The measurement results validate the accuracy of theoretical analysis\nand design procedure. Owning the advantages of low profile, low power\nconsumption, and high sensitivity makes the proposed TDT-SMS a good candidate\nfor precision farming and IoT systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
