We also give a complete\ninvariant specific to the case of unital Kirchberg algebras with finitely\ngenerated K-groups and provide a useful tool to classify the Cuntz--Krieger\nalgebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
