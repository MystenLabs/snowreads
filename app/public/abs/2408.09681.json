Rydberg atom sensor\nhas rapidly developed in recent years, capitalizing on its calibration-free\nSI-traceability, large polarizabilities and transition dipole moments. A\nRydberg atom sensor is capable of sensitively detecting electric field signals\nfrom DC to THz. In this work, we demonstrate low frequency communication using\nRydberg atoms in a vapor cell with two parallel electrode plates inside. Three\nmodulations, BPSK, OOK, and 2FSK, are used for the communication by Rydberg\natom receiver near 100kHz. We have measured the SNR of the modulated low\nfrequency signal received by Rydberg atoms at various emission voltages.\nMeanwhile, we have demonstrated IQ constellation diagram, EVM and eye diagram\nof the demodulated signal at different symbol rate. The EVM is measured to be\n8.8% when the symbol rate is 2Kbps, 9.4% when the symbol rate is 4Kbps, and\n13.7% when the symbol rate is 8Kbps. The high-fidelity digital color image\ntransmission resulted in a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 70dB. This study\nproves that Rydberg-atom receiver can finely work in low frequency\ncommunication.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"kaetlGK7EyAnY3i7_jNT7ermJVGQdV9sWl3Np4czfyQ","pdfSize":"1402197"}
