A non-Markovian environment\nwith unbounded parameters is considered, which is more realistic in practical\nfinancial scenarios compared to the Markovian setting. The optimal consumption\nand investment strategies are derived using the martingale optimal principle\nand quadratic backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) whose\nsolutions admit some exponential moment. This integrability property plays a\ncrucial role in establishing a key martingale argument. In addition, the paper\nalso examines the associated dual problem and several models within the\nspecified parameter framework.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
