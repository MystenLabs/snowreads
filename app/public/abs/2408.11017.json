We are interested in identifying a winning committee for the second stage\nthat overlaps as much as possible with the first-stage committee. We show a\nfull complexity dichotomy for the class of Thiele rules: this problem is\ntractable for Approval Voting (AV) and hard for all other Thiele rules\n(including, in particular, Proportional Approval Voting and the\nChamberlin-Courant rule). We extend this dichotomy to the greedy variants of\nThiele rules. We also explore this problem from a parameterized complexity\nperspective for several natural parameters. We complement the theory with\nexperimental analysis: e.g., we investigate the average number of changes in\nthe committee as a function of changes in voters' preferences and the role of\nties.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
