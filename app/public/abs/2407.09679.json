Existing physics-informed neural\nnetworks often emphasize short-term physics constraints, leaving the proper\npreservation of long-term conservation less explored. We introduce Neural\nCharacteristic Trajectory Fields, a novel representation utilizing Eulerian\nneural fields to implicitly model Lagrangian fluid trajectories. This\ntopology-free, auto-differentiable representation facilitates efficient flow\nmap calculations between arbitrary frames as well as efficient velocity\nextraction via auto-differentiation. Consequently, it enables end-to-end\nsupervision covering long-term conservation and short-term physics priors.\nBuilding on the representation, we propose physics-informed trajectory learning\nand integration into NeRF-based scene reconstruction. We enable advanced\nobstacle handling through self-supervised scene decomposition and seamless\nintegrated boundary constraints. Our results showcase the ability to overcome\nchallenges like occlusion uncertainty, density-color ambiguity, and\nstatic-dynamic entanglements.
