In contrast to previous works\nwith a fixed NS temperature, we dynamically determine the formation of\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC) for a given set of DM parameters, namely the\nDM-neutron scattering cross-section ($\\sigma_{\\chi n}$), the thermal average of\nDM annihilation cross-section ($\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle$) and the DM mass\n($m_\\chi$). For both non-annihilating and annihilating DM with $\\langle\\sigma\nv\\rangle \\leq 10^{-26}{~\\rm cm^3~ s^{-1}}$, the BEC forms for $m_\\chi \\lesssim\n10 ~{\\rm TeV}$. In case of non-annihilating DM, observations of old NS allow\n$\\sigma_{\\chi n}\\lesssim 10^{-52}~{\\rm cm^2}$ for $10 {~\\rm MeV} \\leq m_{\\chi}\n\\lesssim 10 {~\\rm GeV}$ (with BEC) and $\\sigma_{\\chi n}\\lesssim 10^{-47}~{\\rm\ncm^2}$ for $5 {~\\rm TeV} \\lesssim m_\\chi \\lesssim 30 {~\\rm PeV} $ (without\nBEC). This analysis shows the mass window, $10 {~\\rm GeV} \\lesssim m_\\chi\n\\lesssim 5 {~\\rm TeV}$ unconstrained, subject only to direct detection\nexperiments. In the annihilating DM scenario, the exclusion limits on DM\nparameters become weaker and even vanish for typical WIMP annihilation\ncross-section. However, the late-time heating of the NS enables us to probe the\nregion with $\\sigma_{\\chi n}\\gtrsim 10^{-47}~{\\rm cm^2}$, using the James Webb\nSpace Telescope in the foreseeable future. When our results are viewed in the\ncontext of indirect searches of DM, it provides a lower limit on the\n$\\langle\\sigma v\\rangle$, which is sensitive to the DM thermal state.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uvMLQojUSx2HSjyAkMbFhvZtyyTYiFim4Mf9X3Q_12k","pdfSize":"740806"}
