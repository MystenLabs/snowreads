Buyers have heterogeneous private values that depend\non how many others also consume the good. In optimum, an endogenous number of\nthe highest types shares consumption, and we provide an algorithm that\nimplements this allocation in dominant strategies. We apply our insights to\ndigital content creation, and we are able to rationalize features seen in\nmonetization schemes in this industry such as voluntary contributions,\ncommunity subsidies, and exclusivity bids.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
