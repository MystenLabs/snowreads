We are interested in the propagation of the semiclassical measures\nassociated to solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation for the canonical\nsubLaplacian $\\Delta_{\\mathbb E}$ and at different time-scales $\\tau$. In\nparticular, for $\\tau=1$ we recover a quantum-classical correspondence where we\nobserve the fundamental role of abnormal extremal lifts of the Engel group and\nare able to discuss the speed of the propagation of the singularities.\nFurthermore, in order to understand the dispersive nature of the subLaplcian,\nwe are led to develop a second-microlocal analysis on particular cones in our\nphase space. This is done by relating the quasi-contact structure of the group\n${\\mathbb E}$ to its semiclassical analysis via harmonic analysis. As a\nconsequence, we are able to prove obstruction to local smoothness-type\nestimates and Strichartz estimates for the Engel subLaplacian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1Ih3Wc3kYJ3TrWvZeHwEr9jBKG9oC4zILcisFzjSWL8","pdfSize":"714600"}
