In recent years, astrophysical models with two\nfluids have gain popularity, especially in their ability to model dark matter\nadmixed neutron stars.Just as is the case of single-fluid stars, a stability\ncriterion based on the background equations has been developed -- the critical\ncurve for the particle numbers of the two fluids in the two-dimensional\nconfiguration space determines a one-dimensional sequence that labels the\nmarginally stable configurations -- but its validity depends on the linear\nstability of radial perturbations which remains unstudied. In this paper, we\nestablish a set of stability criteria for two perfect-fluid relativistic stars\nby carefully studying the radial mode perturbation equations. We prove that\nmodes are complete, have real eigenvalues with a minimum eigenvalue (i.e. a\nfundamental mode), thus a configuration is stable if and only if the\nfundamental mode is positive. As a consequence, our work formally and\nrigorously proves these necessary conditions for the stability criterion based\non the background equations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
