Rev. Lett. 131, 121402 (2023)]; and the small-mass-ratio,\ngravitational self-force regime, in which the flux has now been calculated to\nsecond perturbative order in the mass ratio (2SF) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 151102\n(2021)]. We compare these results and find excellent agreement for the total\nflux, showing consistency between the two calculations at all available PN and\nSF orders. However, although the total fluxes agree, we find disagreements in\nthe fluxes due to individual spherical-harmonic modes of the waveform, strongly\nsuggesting the two waveforms might be in different asymptotic frames.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
