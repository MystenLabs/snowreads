The HSURF system, consists of 3 different kinds of platforms:\nfloater, sinker and robotic fishes. The collaborative control of the 3\nplatforms allows a remotely based operator to control the fish in order to\nvisit and inspect several targets underwater following a complex trajectory. A\nshared autonomy solution shows to be the most suitable, in order to minimize\nthe effect of limited bandwidth and relevant delay intrinsic to acoustic\ncommunications. The control architecture is described and preliminary results\nof the acoustically teleoperated visits of multiple targets in a testing pool\nare provided.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"umD1TFDCBlCpucx8kzdW-TMZaLksrBkJdDSeKboNvDM","pdfSize":"1102251"}
