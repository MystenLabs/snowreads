As an application, we prove that any\ncomplete intrinsic hyperbolic space with atleast two points in the Gromov\nboundary can be uniformized by densities induced by Busemann functions.\nFurthermore, we establish that there exists a natural identification of the\nGromov boundary of $X$ with the metric boundary of the deformed space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KiuKgfA8QkE2kxqKUhUDVLEgGCBCx42ehFYKAwZdxnE","pdfSize":"249276"}
