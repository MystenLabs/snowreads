These spaces are equipped with\nboth an elliptic $\\mathbb{G}_m$-action and a Hamiltonian $\\mathbb{G}_m$-action,\nwith finitely many fixed points. On these spaces one can consider geometric\ncategory $\\mathcal{O}$: the category of (holonomic) modules supported on the\nLagrangian attracting set of the Hamiltonian action. We show that there exists\na local generator in geometric category $\\mathcal{O}$ whose dg endomorphism\nring, cohomologically supported on the Lagrangian attracting set, is derived\nequivalent to the category of all DQ-modules. This is a version of Koszul\nduality generalizing the equivalence between D-modules on a smooth variety and\ndg-modules over the de Rham complex.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
