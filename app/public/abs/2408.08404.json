It is based on a controlled gate that applies a\nsqueezing operation on a SQUID-terminated resonator conditioned on the state of\na dispersively coupled qubit. This controlled-squeeze gate, when combined with\nGaussian operations on the resonator, is universal. We explore the use of this\ntool to map an arbitrary qubit state into a superposition of squeezed states.\nIn particular, we target a bosonic code with well-defined superparity which\nmakes photon losses detectable by nondemolition parity measurements. We analyze\nthe possibility of implementing this using state-of-the-art circuit QED tools\nand conclude that it is within reach of current technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
