The problem\ninvolves a home run hit by Mickey Mantle on May 22, 1963, which he famously\ncalled ``the hardest ball I ever hit''. Is this home run truly one for the\nrecord books, or has it been eclipsed by players in the modern era? Modeling\nthe trajectory of a baseball involves consideration of both wind resistance and\nthe Magnus effect, and is an interesting application of numerical solution of\nordinary differential equations. Ultimately, the answer is that Mantle would\ncompare favorably to the most powerful batters currently playing, but to arrive\nat that conclusion we must reflect on the plausibility of results and sources\nof uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
