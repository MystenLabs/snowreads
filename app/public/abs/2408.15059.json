In this work, we\ntheoretically present a novel type of beam splitter capable of separating a\nlight beam into its two-mode bright and dark components. We propose a prototype\nbased on an optical cross-cavity system resonantly coupled to a $\\Lambda$-type\nthree-level atom. The dark component of the incoming light is transmitted\nbecause the antisymmetric collective mode of the cavity setup is decoupled from\nthe atom. Meanwhile, in a high-cooperativity regime, the bright component is\nreflected due to Autler-Townes splitting, which arises from the strong coupling\nbetween the atom and the symmetric collective mode of the cavity setup.\nAlthough the device requires only a two-level atom to operate, using a\nthree-level atom allows the device to be turned on or off by controlling the\natomic ground state. Our results pave the way for new applications of beam\nsplitters that leverage the collective properties of light. Manipulating and\nexploiting this additional degree of freedom can advance the field of quantum\noptics and contribute to the development of quantum technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
