The main idea consists in combining the\nidentity with a known integral representation and resorting to the binomial\ntheorem. The same procedure is applied to a variant of the Touchard identity\nproposed by Callan a few years ago. The method presented here can be\ngeneralized to derive additional integral representations from known ones,\nprovided that the latter have a well-suited form and lend themselves to an\nanalytical summation under the integral sign.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
