Although\nit is often said that ``gauge-invariant formulations in general-relativistic\nperturbations are equivalent to complete gauge-fixing approaches,'' as the\nresult of this comparison, we conclude that the derived solutions through the\nproposed gauge-invariant formulation and those through a ``conventional\ncomplete gauge-fixing approach'' are different. It is pointed out that there is\na case where the boundary conditions and initial conditions are restricted in a\nconventional complete gauge-fixing approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
