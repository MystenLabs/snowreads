Besides the existence and\nuniqueness of solutions, we study the convergence of the solutions when $s\\to\n1$ to the classical problem. We also study the continuous dependence with\nrespect to the level-set function $v$, yielding an existence result for a\ntwo-phase obstacle-type problem with an implicit level-set function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dx3zHCW8y6KQSQvvBIHcKqTj1IDp3jdWfZueS6yBv6Y","pdfSize":"249303","objectId":"0x0f6da7155511b01d9dc5fc6ea20ed420bcf3f92a4560bd5666ff34bb6ce76a6c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
