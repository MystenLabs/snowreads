The time-dependence of\nthe system state is analytically calculated using Laplace transform methods,\nand a closed-form expression for the transition rate is obtained. Atoms in the\ngas transition to the adsorbed state through a Feshbach resonance that has\ncontributions from a distribution of vibrational modes of the membrane. The\nresonance can decay with the creation of a phonon to complete the adsorption\nprocess. The adsorption rate at low membrane temperature agrees with the golden\nrule estimate to lowest order in the coupling constant for values greater than\na critical coupling strength. Below this critical coupling strength, the\nadsorption rate is exponentially suppressed by a phonon reduction factor whose\nexponent diverges with increasing adsorbent size. The rate changes\ndiscontinuously with coupling strength for low temperature membranes, and the\nmagnitude of the discontinuity decreases with increasing temperature. These\nvariational results suggest the quantum adsorption model may contain a\nfirst-order phase transition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
