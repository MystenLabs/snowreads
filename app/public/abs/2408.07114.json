Hyperspectral anomaly detection\n(HS-AD) helps characterize the captured scenes and separates them into anomaly\nand background classes. It is vital in agriculture, environment, and military\napplications such as RSTA (reconnaissance, surveillance, and target\nacquisition) missions. We previously designed an equal voting ensemble of\nhyperspectral unmixing and three unsupervised HS-AD algorithms. We later\nutilized a supervised classifier to determine the weights of a voting ensemble,\ncreating a hybrid of heterogeneous unsupervised HS-AD algorithms with a\nsupervised classifier in a model stacking, which improved detection accuracy.\nHowever, supervised classification methods usually fail to detect novel or\nunknown patterns that substantially deviate from those seen previously. In this\nwork, we evaluate our technique and other supervised and unsupervised methods\nusing general hyperspectral data to provide new insights.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
