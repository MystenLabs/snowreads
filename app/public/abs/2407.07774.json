The formula expresses these values in terms of modified\nHall-Littlewood polynomials evaluated at the Satake parameter attached to the\nrepresentation. Our proof is combinatorial and very simple. It utilizes\nMacdonald's formula and the unramified computation of the Ginzburg-Kaplan\nintegral. This addresses a question of Lapid-Mao.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
