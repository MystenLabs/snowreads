However, the chemical complexity of MPEAs poses a\nsignificant challenge in visualizing composition-property relationships in\nhigh-dimensional design spaces. Without effective visualization techniques,\ndesigning chemically complex alloys is practically impossible. In this\nmethods/protocols article, we present a `toolbox' of visualization techniques\nthat allow for meaningful and insightful visualizations of MPEA composition\nspaces and property spaces. Our contribution to this toolbox are UMAP\nprojections of entire alloy spaces. We deploy this visualization tool-kit on\nthe following MPEA case studies: 1) Visualizing literature reviews, 2)\nconstraint-satisfaction alloy design scheme, 3) Bayesian optimization alloy\ndesign campaigns. Furthermore, we show how this method can be applied to any\nbarycentric design space. While there is no one-size-fits-all visualization\ntechnique, our toolbox offers a range of methods and best practices that can be\ntailored to specific MPEA research needs. This article is intended for\nmaterials scientists interested in performing research on multi-principal\nelement alloys, chemically complex alloys, or high entropy alloys, and is\nexpected to facilitate the discovery of novel and tailored properties in MPEAs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
