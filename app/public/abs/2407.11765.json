However, traditional data acquisition processes are slow,\nsubject to delays, and performed at a low frequency. We address this\n'ragged-edge' problem with a two-step framework. The first step is a supervised\nlearning model predicting observed low-frequency figures. We propose a\nneural-network-based nowcasting model that exploits mixed-frequency,\nhigh-dimensional data. The second step uses the elasticities derived from the\nprevious step to interpolate unobserved high-frequency figures. We apply our\nmethod to nowcast countries' yearly research and development (R&D) expenditure\nseries. These series are collected through infrequent surveys, making them\nideal candidates for this task. We exploit a range of predictors, chiefly\nInternet search volume data, and document the relevance of these data in\nimproving out-of-sample predictions. Furthermore, we leverage the high\nfrequency of our data to derive monthly estimates of R&D expenditures, which\nare currently unobserved. We compare our results with those obtained from the\nclassical regression-based and the sparse temporal disaggregation methods.\nFinally, we validate our results by reporting a strong correlation with monthly\nR&D employment data.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
