However, recent deep learning innovations\nare challenging this dominance. We introduce Mambular, an adaptation of the\nMamba architecture optimized for tabular data. We extensively benchmark\nMambular against state-of-the-art models, including neural networks and\ntree-based methods, and demonstrate its competitive performance across diverse\ndatasets. Additionally, we explore various adaptations of Mambular to\nunderstand its effectiveness for tabular data. We investigate different pooling\nstrategies, feature interaction mechanisms, and bi-directional processing. Our\nanalysis shows that interpreting features as a sequence and passing them\nthrough Mamba layers results in surprisingly performant models. The results\nhighlight Mambulars potential as a versatile and powerful architecture for\ntabular data analysis, expanding the scope of deep learning applications in\nthis domain.\n  The source code is available at https://github.com/basf/mamba-tabular.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
