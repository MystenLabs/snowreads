Given a\nmatrix factorization of $f$ and another of $g$, the tensor product of matrix\nfactorizations, which was first introduced by Kn\\\"orrer and later generalized\nby Yoshino, produces a matrix factorization of the sum $f+g$. We will study the\ntensor product of $d$-fold matrix factorizations, with a particular emphasis on\nunderstanding when the construction has a non-trivial direct sum decomposition.\nAs an application of our results, we construct indecomposable maximal\nCohen-Macaulay and Ulrich modules over hypersurface domains of a certain form.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qrXerEjGLGvgborO7hKK705lEEC3JduxuyX3u_Oo8kE","pdfSize":"351523"}
