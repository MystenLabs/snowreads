The use of\nretro-reflectors in constructing spatially separated laser resonators (SSLR)\nenables a self-aligning wireless transmission system with the self-reproducing\nresonant beam, i.e. resonant beam system (RBS). However, it's effective Field\nof View (FoV) is physically limited by the size of retroreflectors and still\nrequires significant improvement. This restricts the transmitter from providing\nseamless wireless connectivity and power supply to receivers within a large\ndynamic movement range. In this paper, we propose an FoV-enlarged resonant beam\nsystem operating at a meter distance by incorporating a telescope. The\ntelescope plays a crucial role in minimizing the extra loss inflicted on the\ngain medium, which typically arises from the deviation of the resonant beam\nwithin the cavity. Further, we construct the proposed telescope-based RBS and\nexperimentally demonstrate that the design could expand the FoV to 28$^\\circ$\nover 1 m transmission distance is about triple that of the ordinary RBS design.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
