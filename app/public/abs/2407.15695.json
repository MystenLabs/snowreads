However, to those without sufficient experience, engaging with\nbusinesses and friends across the internet can be daunting due to the ever\npresent danger of scammers and thieves, to say nothing of the myriad of\npotential computer viruses. Like a forest rich with both edible and poisonous\nplants, those familiar with the norms inhabit it safely with ease while\nnewcomers need a guide. However, reliance on a human digital guide can be\ntaxing and often impractical. We propose and pilot a simple but unexplored\nidea: could an LLM provide the necessary support to help the elderly who are\nseparated by the digital divide safely achieve digital autonomy?\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"knw9SNVi6GDRguPhy5XG9WrSUzeM1oHSaU__9I4V5hs","pdfSize":"73284"}
