They were first introduced in 2001 by Breiman and they perform with\naccuracy in high dimensional settings. In this article, we consider, a\nsimplified kernel-based random forest algorithm called simplified directional\nKeRF (Kernel Random Forest). We establish the asymptotic equivalence between\nsimplified directional KeRF and centered KeRF, with additional numerical\nexperiments supporting our theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
