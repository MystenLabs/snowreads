The extremely large MR in WTe$_2$ is still not adequately understood.\nHere, we systematically study the effect of Mo substitution on the quantum\noscillations in the MR in WTe$_2$. The MR decreases with Mo substitution,\nhowever, the carrier concentrations extracted from the quantum oscillations\nshow that the charge compensation improves. We believe that earlier\ninterpretations based on the two-band theory, which attribute the decrease in\nMR to charge imbalance, could be incorrect due to over-parametrization. We\nattribute the decrease in MR in the presence of charge compensation to a fall\nin transport mobility, which is evident from the residual resistivity ratio\ndata. The quantum scattering time and the effective masses do not change within\nexperimental errors upon substitution.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fjYNKdjBa4lW7JkXo-QBfKyExbdyuqXVAlVhj5u7m0E","pdfSize":"2810267","objectId":"0x7b69f77a8b08df16741a6cb94841a9ccb1735026b7e32acb0b7f7f1777864770","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
