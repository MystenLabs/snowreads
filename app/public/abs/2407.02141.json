Compared to their counterparts with short-ranged\ninteractions, long-range interacting systems display novel physics, such as\nnonlinear light cones for the propagation of information or inequivalent\nthermodynamic ensembles. In this work, we consider generic long-range open\nquantum systems in arbitrary dimensions and focus on the so-called strong\nlong-range regime. We prove that in the thermodynamic limit local properties,\ncaptured by reduced quantum states, are described by an emergent\nnon-interacting theory. Here, the dynamics factorizes and the individual\nconstituents of the system evolve independently such that no correlations are\ngenerated over time. In this sense, long-range interacting systems are locally\nnon-interacting. This has significant implications for their relaxation\nbehavior, for instance in relation to the emergence of long-lived\nquasi-stationary states or to the absence of thermalization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
