In this work, we computationally\nsimulate the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol from vinyl alcohol on the surface\nof amorphous solid water in a two-step synthesis involving a OH addition and a\nH abstraction reaction. In total, we considered all reaction possibilities of\nthe 1,1 and 1,2-OH addition to vinyl alcohol followed by H-abstraction or\nH-addition reactions on the resulting radicals. The combination of these\nreactions is capable of explaining the formation of (Z)-1,2-ethenediol provided\na suprathermal diffusion of OH. We also conclude that our proposed formation\npathway is not selective and also yields other abstraction and addition\nproducts. Key in our findings is the connection between the adsorption modes of\nthe reactants and intermediates and the stereoselectivity of the reactions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
