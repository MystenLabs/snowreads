Motivated by\nconsiderations from quantum physics -- in particular, understanding nearest\nneighbor interactions in quantum spin systems -- we consider iid GUE acting on\nmultipartite state spaces, with a mixing component on some sites and identity\non the remaining sites. We show that under proper assumptions on the dimension\nof the sites, strong asymptotic freeness still holds. Our proof relies on an\ninterpolation technology recently introduced by Bandeira, Boedihardjo and van\nHandel.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qbkjGp16HXBiZxNWy69WNeqriNBecmscdMIC7eQEkqU","pdfSize":"215017","objectId":"0x6cc428a99b44302c8b1a993f04af67f0c4ae7cbb8ae969555b62e08f39380363","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
