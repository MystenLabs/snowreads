We consider a\npossible generalization to $n$ dimensions, based on the permutohedral lattice\n$A^*_n$. The central lines of the generalized prisms are going to be oriented\nin $n+1$ different directions (parallel to the shortest non-zero vectors of\n$A^*_n$). The projection of the lines oriented in any direction along that\ndirection to a hyperplane perpendicular to it is required to be a translation\nof the corresponding projection of $A^*_n$, and the minimal distance between\nlines oriented in any two given directions should be maximal. It is shown that\nthis is possible if $n$ is a prime power. Also, the proportion of $n$-space\nthat is covered is calculated for $n \\in \\{4, 5\\}$, and an alternative\ngeneralization is briefly considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WTznhNSIq5Bd0ljfEs-QuLRVlmrrR37I6-QUIsJmTZE","pdfSize":"95838"}
