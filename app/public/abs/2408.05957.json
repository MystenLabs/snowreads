We use\ntwo different methods to transfer the perturbation equations into the form of\nhypergeometric differential equations and obtain the same quasinormal\nfrequencies. These purely imaginary spectra are shown to be independent of the\nspin of the perturbation and match those of the so-called acceleration modes of\naccelerating black holes after taking the Minkowski limit. This implies that\nthe acceleration modes actually originate from the pure accelerating spacetime\nand the appearance of black holes would deform the spectra. In addition, we\ncalculate the quasinormal frequencies of scalar, electromagnetic and\ngravitational perturbations of $D$-dimensional de Sitter spacetime and compare\nthem with previous results to verify the validity of our method.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
