In response to these limitations, this paper introduces an\ninnovative generative model designed to transform SAR images into more\nintelligible optical images, thereby enhancing the interpretability of SAR\nimages. Specifically, our model backbone is based on the recent diffusion\nmodels, which have powerful generative capabilities. We employ SAR images as\nconditional guides in the sampling process and integrate color supervision to\ncounteract color shift issues effectively. We conducted experiments on the\nSEN12 dataset and employed quantitative evaluations using peak signal-to-noise\nratio, structural similarity, and fr\\'echet inception distance. The results\ndemonstrate that our model not only surpasses previous methods in quantitative\nassessments but also significantly enhances the visual quality of the generated\nimages.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
