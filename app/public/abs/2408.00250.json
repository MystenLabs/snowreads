Motivated by an earlier result of Bugeaud and\nNguyen, we let $E_{k,d}$ be the set of $(c_1,\\ldots,c_k)\\in\\mathbb{R}_{\\geq\n0}^k$ such that\n$\\vert\\alpha_0\\vert\\vert\\alpha_1\\vert^{c_1}\\cdots\\vert\\alpha_k\\vert^{c_k}\\geq\n1$ for any algebraic integer $\\alpha$ of degree $d$, where we label its Galois\nconjugates as $\\alpha_0,\\ldots,\\alpha_{d-1}$ with $\\vert\\alpha_0\\vert\\geq\n\\vert\\alpha_1\\vert\\geq\\cdots \\geq \\vert\\alpha_{d-1}\\vert$. First, we give an\nexplicit description of $E_{k,d}$ as a polytope with $2^k$ vertices. Then we\nprove that for $d>3k$, for every $(c_1,\\ldots,c_k)\\in E_{k,d}$ and for every\n$\\alpha$ that is not a root of unity, the strict inequality\n$\\vert\\alpha_0\\vert\\vert\\alpha_1\\vert^{c_1}\\cdots\\vert\\alpha_k\\vert^{c_k}>1$\nholds. We also provide a quantitative version of this inequality in terms of\n$d$ and the height of the minimal polynomial of $\\alpha$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
