These craft can find use\nfor both naval operations and civil transportation due to special properties,\nincluding the low above-water hull profile, reduced wave drag in some speed\nregimes, and potentially better seaworthiness. However, hydrodynamics of these\nmarine craft is not well studied. In this work, computational modeling is\nundertaken to explore steady hydrodynamic characteristics of several\nsemi-submersible hull variations in a range of speeds in deep-water and\nfinite-depth conditions. The validation and verification study is conducted\nusing experimental data obtained with a Suboff model in a near-surface regime.\nParametric simulations are performed for this hull and two others generated by\nmodifying the original Suboff geometry to produce narrow and wide hull shapes\nwith similar volumes. The computational results indicate that the narrow hull\nexcels in deep water, having lower drag and experiencing lower downward suction\nforce and smaller longitudinal moment. However, in shallow-water operations,\nthe narrow hull exhibits noticeably larger resistance than other hulls with the\nsame displacement due to smaller gap between the hull and sea floor. Main\nhydrodynamic characteristics of the studied hulls and illustrations of wave\npatterns are presented in the paper. These findings can be useful for designers\nof semi-submersible vehicles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
