SPECTR is designed for observing the transmission spectra of\ntransiting exoplanets. Unique features of SPECTR are its long slit length of 10\narcminutes which facilitates observing the target and the comparison star\nsimultaneously, and its wide slit width to minimize slit losses. SPECTR will be\nused to survey exoplanets, such as those identified by the Transiting Exoplanet\nSurvey Satellite (TESS), providing information about their radii across the\nwavelength range. In this paper, we present the design of SPECTR and the\nobservational results of the partial transit of HD 189733 b and a full transit\nof Qatar-8 b. Analyses show the SPECTR's capability on the white light curves\nwith an accuracy of one ppt. The transmission spectrum of HD 189733 b shows\ngeneral agreement with previous studies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
