A clique $C$ in $\\Gamma$ is called regular whenever for\nany vertex out of $C$, the number of its neighbors in $C$ is independent of the\nchoice of vertex. A Neumaier graph is a non-complete edge-regular graph with a\nregular clique. In this paper, we study vertex-transitive Neumaier graphs. We\ngive a necessary and sufficient condition under which a vertex-transitive\nNeumaier graph is strongly regular. We also identify Neumaier Cayley graphs\nwith small valency at most $10$ among vertex-transitive Neumaier graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"o-tsy-CVfD6OGoclySndEtB6et7jrOjIZQdZ6mE1Nww","pdfSize":"428635"}
