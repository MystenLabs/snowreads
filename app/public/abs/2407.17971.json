The consistent description of the rich phenomenology of nuclear\nsystems indeed requires the introduction of reductionist approaches that\nconstruct nuclei directly from interacting nucleons by solving the associated\nquantum many-body problem. In this context, so-called \\textit{ab initio}\nmethods offer a promising route by deriving controlled (and systematically\nimprovable) approximations both to the inter-nucleon interaction and to the\nsolutions of the many-body problem. From a technical point of view,\napproximately solving the many-body Schr\\\"odinger equation in heavy open-shell\nsystems typically requires the construction and contraction of large mode-4\n(mode-6) tensors that need to be stored repeatedly. Recently, a new\ndimensionality reduction method based on randomized singular value\ndecomposition has been introduced to reduce the numerical cost of many-body\nperturbation theory. This work applies this lightweight formalism to the study\nof the Germanium isotopic chain, where standard approaches would be too\nexpansive to run. Inclusion of triaxiality is found to improve the overall\nagreement with experimental data on differential quantities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
