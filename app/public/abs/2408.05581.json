It is\nshown that the surface energy density $\\sigma$ is positive, while the surface\npressure $\\mathcal{P}$ is negative, resulting in $\\sigma +\\mathcal{P}<0$,\nthereby signaling a violation of the null energy condition, a necessary\ncondition for holding a wormhole open. For a Morris-Thorne wormhole, matter\nthat violates the null energy condition is referred to as \"exotic.\" For the\nthin-shell wormholes in this paper, however, the violation has a physical\nexplanation since it is a direct consequence of the embedding theory in\nconjunction with the assumption of conformal symmetry. These properties avoid\nthe need to hypothesize the existence of the highly problematical exotic\nmatter.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
