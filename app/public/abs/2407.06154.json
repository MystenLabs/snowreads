Passive Wi-Fi sensing\nrepresents a new paradigm for recognizing human and robotic arm activities,\nutilizing channel state information (CSI) measurements to identify activities\nin indoor environments. In this paper, a novel machine learning approach based\non discrete wavelet transform and vision transformers for robotic arm activity\nrecognition from CSI measurements in indoor settings is proposed. This method\noutperforms convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory\n(LSTM) models in robotic arm activity recognition, particularly when LoS is\nobstructed by barriers, without relying on external or internal sensors or\nvisual aids. Experiments are conducted using four different data collection\nscenarios and four different robotic arm activities. Performance results\ndemonstrate that wavelet transform can significantly enhance the accuracy of\nvisual transformer networks in robotic arms activity recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
