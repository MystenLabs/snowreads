This part\nintroduces the principles and categories of FDA jammer and proposes the FDA\njamming signal model based on the two cases of phased-MIMO radar, phased-array\n(PA) radar and FDA-MIMO radar. Moreover, the effects of FDA jamming on matched\nfiltering and spatial filtering of PA and FDA-MIMO radar are analyzed.\nNumerical results verify the theoretical analysis and validate the\neffectiveness of the proposed FDA jamming in countering phased-MIMO radar.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
