However, existing methods for\nFPCA do not apply when functional observations are truncated, e.g., the\nmeasurement instrument only supports recordings within a pre-specified\ninterval, thereby truncating values outside of the range to the nearest\nboundary. A naive application of existing methods without correction for\ntruncation induces bias. We extend the FPCA framework to accommodate truncated\nnoisy functional data by first recovering smooth mean and covariance surface\nestimates that are representative of the latent process's mean and covariance\nfunctions. Unlike traditional sample covariance smoothing techniques, our\nprocedure yields a positive semi-definite covariance surface, computed without\nthe need to retroactively remove negative eigenvalues in the covariance\noperator decomposition. Additionally, we construct a FPC score predictor and\ndemonstrate its use in the generalized functional linear model. Convergence\nrates for the proposed estimators are provided. In simulation experiments, the\nproposed method yields better predictive performance and lower bias than\nexisting alternatives. We illustrate its practical value through an application\nto a study with truncated blood glucose measurements.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
