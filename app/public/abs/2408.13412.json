Comparing the obtained $\\kappa_{\\rm el}$ and\nexperimentally measured $\\kappa$, the temperature dependence of phonons\ncontribution to thermal conductivity, $\\kappa_{\\rm ph}=\\kappa-\\kappa_{\\rm el}$,\nis inferred and analyzed based on the formula by Holland. Comparison of the\nGeTe and Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ with different types of crystal structures, i.e., GeTe\nbeing of a semiordered zigzag nanostructure like a disrupted herringbone\nstructure while Mg$_3$Sb$_2$ of rather uniform amorphous structure, discloses\nthat size effects on temperature dependence of $\\kappa_{\\rm ph}$ is large in\nthe former, while very small in the latter.\n  Hence, it is concluded that not only the size of the grain but also its shape\nhas an important influence on $\\kappa_{\\rm ph}$ and then $ZT$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
