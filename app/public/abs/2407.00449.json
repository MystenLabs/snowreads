It allows\nneural networks to use arithmetic based on arbitrary algebras. The key point is\nto observe that algebra multiplication can be represented as a rank three\ntensor and use this tensor in every algebraic operation. This approach is\nattractive for neural network libraries that support effective tensorial\noperations. It agrees with previous implementations for four-dimensional\nalgebras.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
