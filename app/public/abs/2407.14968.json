We\nconduct ablative studies of molecular representation, decoder model, and\nsurrogate model training scheme. The experiments suggest that an autogressive\nTransformer decoder with GroupSELFIES achieves the best average properties for\nthe random generation task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
