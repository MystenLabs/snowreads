To begin, we provide essential background\ninformation on Leibniz 2-algebras and its cohomology theory. Next, we examine\nthe inducibility of pairs of automorphisms and derivations, with a focus on the\nanalog of Wells exact sequences in the context of Leibniz 2-algebras. We then\nanalyze the analogue of Wells short exact sequences as they relate to\nautomorphisms and derivations within this framework. Finally, we investigate\nthe special case of crossed modules over Leibniz algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
