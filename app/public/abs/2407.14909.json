When the conformal Einstein field equations\nhold, this news tensor yields the correct expression for the radiative\ncomponents of the rescaled Weyl tensor at infinity with vanishing cosmological\nconstant in arbitrary conformal gauge. Also, a generalised transport equation\nfor the Geroch tensor is derived. Important differences between null\nhypersurfaces in the bulk of the space-time and null infinity with vanishing\ncosmological constant are reviewed, and their impact on the role of the news is\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
