For large-scale\narchitectures, one of the most crucial parameters is the efficiency at which\nentanglement can be created and detected. Here, we maximize the efficiency for\nthe detection of hybrid entanglement between a nuclear spin qubit in diamond\nwith a photonic time-bin qubit. Our approach relies on an optimal\nimplementation of the photonic qubit analyzer, for which we use a high-speed\nelectro-optic deflector to direct photons deterministically along the optimal\ninterferometer paths. This way, we completely eliminate all cases in which\nphotons are randomly lost due to the propagation in the wrong interferometer\npath. In this first demonstration experiment, we use nitrogen-vacancy center in\ndiamond, for which we immediately demonstrate the presence of the entanglement.\nAn extension to other spin-photon entanglement systems is straightforward.\nFurther, our scheme can be used in the framework of quantum repeater networks,\nincluding spectral and temporal multiplexing strategies. Our results thus pave\nthe way for the future high-performance quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
