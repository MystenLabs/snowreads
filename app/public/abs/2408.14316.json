Furthermore, we prove\nthat, for shear waves, such radius of convergence cannot be smaller than $1/2$\ntimes the gap size. Finally, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is\ngapped whenever the total scattering cross-section (expressed as a function of\nthe energy) is bounded below by a positive non-zero constant. These results,\ncombined with well-established covariant stability criteria, allow us to derive\na rigorous upper bound on the shear viscosity of relativistic dilute gases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
