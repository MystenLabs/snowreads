This paper\npresents a novel approach to equipping LLMs with product knowledge by training\nthem to respond contextually to synthetic search queries that include product\nIDs. We delve into an extensive analysis of this method, evaluating its\neffectiveness, outlining its benefits, and highlighting its constraints. The\npaper also discusses the potential improvements and future directions for this\napproach, providing a comprehensive understanding of the role of LLMs in\nproduct recommendations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-Dmjx1BdzavSSKRu7aqmXeBYr2H8stRlehS8SLqENPQ","pdfSize":"1342476"}
