However, adversarial attacks, particularly through\nthe injection of adversarial examples (AEs), pose serious challenges to the\nsecurity of VFL models. In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities\nthrough developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a\npractical scenario where the adversary is able to adaptively corrupt a subset\nof clients. We formulate the problem of finding optimal attack strategies as an\nonline optimization problem, which is decomposed into an inner problem of\nadversarial example generation (AEG) and an outer problem of corruption pattern\nselection (CPS). Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the\nformulated CPS problem and a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose the\nThompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm for the\nadversary to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients for corruption.\nThe key idea of E-TS is to introduce an estimation of the expected maximum\nreward for each arm, which helps to specify a small set of competitive arms, on\nwhich the exploration for the optimal arm is performed. This significantly\nreduces the exploration space, which otherwise can quickly become prohibitively\nlarge as the number of clients increases. We analytically characterize the\nregret bound of E-TS, and empirically demonstrate its capability of efficiently\nrevealing the optimal corruption pattern with the highest attack success rate,\nunder various datasets of popular VFL tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
