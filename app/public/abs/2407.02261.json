While deep learning techniques have significantly enhanced\nefficiency and reduced costs, the privacy-sensitive nature of medical imaging\ndata complicates centralized storage and model training. Furthermore,\nlow-resource healthcare organizations face challenges related to communication\noverhead and efficiency due to increasing data and model scales. This paper\nproposes a novel privacy-preserving medical image classification framework\nbased on federated learning to address these issues, named FedMIC. The\nframework enables healthcare organizations to learn from both global and local\nknowledge, enhancing local representation of private data despite statistical\nheterogeneity. It provides customized models for organizations with diverse\ndata distributions while minimizing communication overhead and improving\nefficiency without compromising performance. Our FedMIC enhances robustness and\npractical applicability under resource-constrained conditions. We demonstrate\nFedMIC's effectiveness using four public medical image datasets for classical\nmedical image classification tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
