Drawing ideas\nfrom physical amplifier design, this paper aims to address these issues with a\nnew differentiable digital signal processing (DDSP)-based model, called ``DDSP\nguitar amp,'' that models the four components of a guitar amp (i.e., preamp,\ntone stack, power amp, and output transformer) using specific DSP-inspired\ndesigns. With a set of time- and frequency-domain metrics, we demonstrate that\nDDSP guitar amp achieves performance comparable with that of black-box\nbaselines while requiring less than 10\\% of the computational operations per\naudio sample, thereby holding greater potential for usages in real-time\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jQI5RxFhIlvfuFVD-GrEwj4CeTxV1rVZtwbtIeTvvlI","pdfSize":"2777329"}
