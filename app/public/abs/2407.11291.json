Joseph says that any nilpotent or semisimple element $z$ in\nthe Weyl algebra $A_1$ over some algebracally closed field $K$ of characterstic\n0 has a normal form up to the action of the automorphism group of $A_1$. It is\nshown in this note that the normal form corresponds to some unique pair of\nintegers $(k,n)$ with $k\\ge n\\ge 0$, and will be called the Joseph norm form of\n$z$. Similar results for the symplectic Poisson algebra $S_1$ are obtained. The\nDixmier conjecture can be reformulated as follows: For any nilpotent element\n$z\\in A_1$ whose Joseph norm corresponds to $(k,n)$ with $k>n\\ge 1$, there\nexists no $w\\in A_1$ with $ [z,w]=1$. It is known to hold true if $k$ and $n$\nare coprime. In this note we show that the assertion also holds if $k$ or $n$\nis prime. Analogous results for the Jacobian conjecture for $K[X,Y]$ are\nobtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vcgA96y3dkvjOH7kPbnf0b3PeyxSc_T9exgKxZ7vufE","pdfSize":"241600"}
