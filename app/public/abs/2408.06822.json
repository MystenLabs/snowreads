Nevertheless, TEEs'\nintegrity protection does not extend to the state saved on disk. Furthermore,\nmodern cloud-native applications heavily rely on orchestration (e.g., through\nsystems such as Kubernetes) and, thus, have their services frequently\nrestarted. During restarts, attackers can revert the state of confidential\nservices to a previous version that may aid their malicious intent. This paper\npresents CRISP, a rollback protection mechanism that uses an existing runtime\nfor Intel SGX and transparently prevents rollback. Our approach can constrain\nthe attack window to a fixed and short period or give developers the tools to\navoid the vulnerability window altogether. Finally, experiments show that\napplying CRISP in a critical stateful cloud-native application may incur a\nresource increase but only a minor performance penalty.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Operating Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZYxlr25MdilN3mXqVdrbzzuHg2w9vCw5mUsrKU34vG4","pdfSize":"935995"}
