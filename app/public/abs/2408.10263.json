We\npropose a quick decision rule using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to\nassess the suitability of KAN: if data can be effectively separated in two\ndimensions using splines, KAN may outperform traditional models; otherwise,\nother methods could be more appropriate. We also introduce a heuristic approach\nto hyperparameter tuning, significantly reducing computational costs. These\nfindings suggest that while KAN has potential, its use should be guided by\ndata-specific assessments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
