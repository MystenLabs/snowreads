Data curation is a time-consuming process for a\nlarge volume of data, making it challenging and expensive to deploy data\nanalytics platforms in new environments. Transfer learning (TL) mechanisms\npromise to mitigate data sparsity and model complexity by utilizing pre-trained\nmodels for a new task. Despite the triumph of TL in fields like computer vision\nand natural language processing, efforts on complex ST models for anomaly\ndetection (AD) applications are limited. In this study, we present the\npotential of TL within the context of AD for the Hadron Calorimeter of the\nCompact Muon Solenoid experiment at CERN. We have transferred the ST AD models\ntrained on data collected from one part of a calorimeter to another. We have\ninvestigated different configurations of TL on semi-supervised autoencoders of\nthe ST AD models -- transferring convolutional, graph, and recurrent neural\nnetworks of both the encoder and decoder networks. The experiment results\ndemonstrate that TL effectively enhances the model learning accuracy on a\ntarget subdetector. The TL achieves promising data reconstruction and AD\nperformance while substantially reducing the trainable parameters of the AD\nmodels. It also improves robustness against anomaly contamination in the\ntraining data sets of the semi-supervised AD models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
