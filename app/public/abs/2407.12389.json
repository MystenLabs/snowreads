Unfortunately, it has been difficult to\nconstruct a consistent quantitative framework for such comparisons. However,\nrecent advances in AI (Artificial Intelligence) and ML (Machine Learning) are\nproviding new methods for ASR (automatic speech recognition) and NLP (natural\nlanguage processing) that can be brought to bear on this problem. Using the\nBatchalign2 program (Liu et al., 2023), we have been transcribing and linking\ndata for the CHILDES database and have applied the UD (Universal Dependencies)\nframework to provide a consistent and comparable morphosyntactic analysis for\n27 languages. These new resources open possibilities for deeper crosslinguistic\nstudy of language learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Lcr_Gdt6wnOFV7ZBFIpdSQy4SAp3dJRtbSm4vHsCyWw","pdfSize":"760245","objectId":"0xccf62363ab4b928a231166fc9f348739f3ddf692cb826f5f3e07e720a2bc60c2","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
