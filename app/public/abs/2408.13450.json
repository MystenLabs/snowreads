However, both the precision and accuracy of\nthese search techniques is limited by the presence or absence of specific\nkeywords, making literature review akin to searching for needles in a haystack.\nWe present vitaLITy 2, a solution that uses a Large Language Model or LLM-based\napproach to identify semantically relevant literature in a textual embedding\nspace. We include a corpus of 66,692 papers from 1970-2023 which are searchable\nthrough text embeddings created by three language models. vitaLITy 2\ncontributes a novel Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture and can\nbe interacted with through an LLM with augmented prompts, including\nsummarization of a collection of papers. vitaLITy 2 also provides a chat\ninterface that allow users to perform complex queries without learning any new\nprogramming language. This also enables users to take advantage of the\nknowledge captured in the LLM from its enormous training corpus. Finally, we\ndemonstrate the applicability of vitaLITy 2 through two usage scenarios.\nvitaLITy 2 is available as open-source software at\nhttps://vitality-vis.github.io.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
