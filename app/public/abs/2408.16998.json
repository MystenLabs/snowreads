In this study, we employ a\ndeep-neural network potential derived from ab initio molecular dynamics to\nconduct extensive simulations of single-layer graphenewater systems with\ndifferent levels of oxidation (carbon/oxygen ratio) of the graphene layer.\nRemarkably, our findings reveal a one-order-of-magnitude enhancement in heat\ntransfer upon oxidizing graphene with hydroxyl or epoxide groups at the\ngraphene surface, underscoring the significant tunability of heat transfer\nwithin this system. Given the same oxidation ratio, more dispersed locations of\nfunctional groups on graphene surface leads to faster heat dissipation to\nwater.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s3cgBIX7SqzKoCUOM-KjyZRaU9j6oxH8CxXu8Ee2iI0","pdfSize":"6311578"}
