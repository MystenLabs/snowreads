We followed the spectral evolution of the nova until it entered the\nnebular phase. The expansion velocity of the ejecta reached $\\sim$780\n$\\mathrm{km\\,s^{-1}}$. The fluxes of the neutral [O I] lines at wavelengths\n6300, 6364, and 5577 $\\r{A}$ were used to calculate the electron temperature\nand the mass of neutral oxygen in the ejecta. We found average values $T_e =\n4890\\,K$ ,$M_{OI} = 2.54 \\times 10^{-5}\\, M_{\\odot}$ which are consistent with\nthe values calculated for other novae. We modeled the nova's ejected envelope\n515 days after its discovery and found that the log elemental abundances by\nnumber relative to Hydrogen of the envelope are He = -0.7, C = -5.5, O = -2.5,\nN = -2.0 and Ne = -4.0.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WVdd5uOSICZAa4dh6_OGLPis9eUh0uCnlqNNovHJ96A","pdfSize":"2298002"}
