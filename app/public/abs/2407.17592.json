In this method, extreme\nvalues are down-weighted because of their lower likelihood values, which yields\nrobust estimates. In this work, we study the properties of the ML$q$E for\nspatial data with replicates. We investigate the asymptotic properties of the\nML$q$E for Gaussian random fields with a Mat\\'ern covariance function, and\ncarry out simulation studies to investigate the numerical performance of the\nML$q$E. We show that it can provide more robust and stable estimation results\nwhen some of the replicates in the spatial data contain outliers. In addition,\nwe develop a mechanism to find the optimal choice of the hyper-parameter $q$\nfor the ML$q$E. The robustness of our approach is further verified on a United\nStates precipitation dataset. Compared with other robust methods for spatial\ndata, our proposal is more intuitive and easier to understand, yet it performs\nwell when dealing with datasets containing outliers.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SB3wc1bttYoxVbngSBvU9IR2FsZO1oRyOHWbK3Pna5k","pdfSize":"650832","objectId":"0xd4c6b26f4909ecf049e25118f8b18085ed543173c0ed49e8226513a5b82fbfa4","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
