For any\n$c$ Coxeter element of $\\mathfrak{S}_{\\lambda_1+k-1}$, we construct a bijection\nfrom fillings of $\\lambda$ to reverse plane partitions. We recover two previous\ngeneralizations of the Robinson--Schensted--Knuth correspondence for particular\nchoices of Coxeter element depending on $\\lambda$: one based on the work of,\namong others, Burge, Hillman, Grassl, Knuth, and uniformly presented by\nGansner; the other developed by Garver, Partrias, and Thomas, and independently\nby Dauvergne, called Scrambled RSK. Our results in this paper develop the\ncombinatorial consequence of our previous work of type $A_{\\lambda_1+k}$\nquivers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
