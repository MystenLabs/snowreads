This is suitable to derive constraints in the presence of\ngravity, in a way that is robust with respect to radiative corrections. Our\nmethod not only allows us to avoid the Coulomb pole, but also the singularities\nassociated with calculable loop effects, which would otherwise diverge.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
