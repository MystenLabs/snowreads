For $n \\to \\infty$, $1/v_n(\\mathbf{r}) =\nu_{n-1}(\\mathbf{r})/u_{n}(\\mathbf{r})$ converges to the lowest eigenenergy\n$E_1$ of ${\\hat H}$ whereas $u_{\\infty}(\\mathbf{r})$ yields the corresponding\nwave function $\\psi_1(\\mathbf{r})$. For large but finite $n$, $v_n(\\mathbf{r})$\ncan be approximated by a piecewise constant function $v_n(\\mathbf{r}) \\simeq\nv_n^{(m)}$ for $\\mathbf{r} \\in \\Omega_m$ and yields progressively improving\nestimations of eigenenergies $E_m = 1/v_n^{(m)}$ of locally fundamental\neigenstates $\\psi_m(\\mathbf{r}) \\propto u_{n}(\\mathbf{r})$ in spatial domains\n$\\Omega_m$. These general results are illustrated by a number of examples in\none dimension: box potential, sequence of randomly placed infinite potential\nbarriers, smooth and spatially uncorrelated random potentials, quasiperodic\npotential.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
