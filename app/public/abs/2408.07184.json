However,\ndespite its powerful analytical utility and potential to improve music\nunderstanding and generation, SchA has rarely been utilized by the computer\nmusic community. This is in large part due to the paucity of available\nhigh-quality data in a computer-readable format. With a larger corpus of\nSchenkerian data, it may be possible to infuse machine learning models with a\ndeeper understanding of musical structure, thus leading to more \"human\"\nresults. To encourage further research in Schenkerian analysis and its\npotential benefits for music informatics and generation, this paper presents\nthree main contributions: 1) a new and growing dataset of SchAs, the largest in\nhuman- and computer-readable formats to date (>140 excerpts), 2) a novel\nsoftware for visualization and collection of SchA data, and 3) a novel,\nflexible representation of SchA as a heterogeneous-edge graph data structure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
