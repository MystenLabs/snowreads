The FSWT\nperturbatively eliminates the oscillatory components in the driven Hamiltonian\nby solving operator-valued Sylvester equations. We show how to solve these\nSylvester equations without knowledge of the eigenstates of the undriven\nmany-body system, using the driven Hubbard model as an example. In the limit of\nhigh driving frequencies, these solutions reduce to the well-known\nhigh-frequency limit of the Floquet-Magnus expansion. We anticipate this method\nwill be useful for describing multi-orbital and long-range interacting systems\ndriven in-gap.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Em1xNJHGRwMKfDCIufu1ks4FxOi1l_LELHI8mM68bTM","pdfSize":"1832011"}
