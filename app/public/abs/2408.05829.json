We address this problem through\npresenting HGEN, a fully automated pipeline that leverages LLMs to transform\nsource code through a series of six stages into a well-organized hierarchy of\nformatted documents. We evaluate HGEN both quantitatively and qualitatively.\nFirst, we use it to generate documentation for three diverse projects, and\nengage key developers in comparing the quality of the generated documentation\nagainst their own previously produced manually-crafted documentation. We then\npilot HGEN in nine different industrial projects using diverse datasets\nprovided by each project. We collect feedback from project stakeholders, and\nanalyze it using an inductive approach to identify recurring themes. Results\nshow that HGEN produces artifact hierarchies similar in quality to manually\nconstructed documentation, with much higher coverage of the core concepts than\nthe baseline approach. Stakeholder feedback highlights HGEN's commercial impact\npotential as a tool for accelerating code comprehension and maintenance tasks.\nResults and associated supplemental materials can be found at\nhttps://zenodo.org/records/11403244\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
