This\npaper introduces a framework for automated knowledge graph learning from time\nseries data, specifically tailored for industrial applications. Our framework\naddresses the complexities inherent in industrial datasets, transforming them\ninto knowledge graphs that improve decision-making, process optimization, and\nknowledge discovery. Additionally, it employs Granger causality to identify key\nattributes that can inform the design of predictive models. To illustrate the\npractical utility of our approach, we also present a motivating use case\ndemonstrating the benefits of our framework in a real-world industrial\nscenario. Further, we demonstrate how the automated conversion of time series\ndata into knowledge graphs can identify causal influences or dependencies\nbetween important process parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
