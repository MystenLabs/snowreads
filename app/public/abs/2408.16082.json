We employ a mixed quantum-classical approach that\ncombines Ehrenfest dynamics for molecular vibrations with the hierarchical\nequations of motion method for the electronic degrees of freedom. This approach\ntreats the molecular vibrations in a nonequilibrium manner, which is crucial\nfor the dynamics of molecular nanojunctions. To explore the effect of\nvibrational dynamics on spin selectivity, we also introduce a new figure of\nmerit, the displacement polarization, which quantifies the difference in\nvibrational displacements for opposing lead magnetizations. We analyze the\ndynamics of single trajectories, investigating how the spin selectivity depends\non voltage and electronic-vibrational coupling. Furthermore, we investigate the\ndynamics and temperature dependence of ensemble-averaged observables. We\ndemonstrate that spin selectivity is correlated in time with the vibrational\npolarization, indicating that dynamics of the molecular vibrations is the\ndriving force of CISS in this model within the Ehrenfest approach.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
