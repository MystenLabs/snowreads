PTA collaborations around the world have recently announced evidence\nof a nanohertz gravitational wave background (GWB), which may be produced by a\npopulation of supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). The GWB is often\nmodeled as following a power-law power spectral density (PSD); however, a GWB\nproduced by a cosmological population of SMBHBs is expected to have a more\ncomplex power spectrum due to the discrete nature of the sources. In this\npaper, we investigate using a $t$-process PSD to model the GWB, which allows us\nto fit for both the underlying power-law amplitude and spectral index as well\nas deviations from that power law, which may be produced by individual nearby\nbinaries. We create simulated data sets based on the properties of the NANOGrav\n15-year data set, and we demonstrate that the $t$-process PSD can accurately\nrecover the PSD when deviations from a power-law are present. With longer timed\ndatasets and more pulsars, we expect the sensitivity of our PTAs to improve,\nwhich will allow us to precisely measure the PSD of the GWB and study the\nsources producing it.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
