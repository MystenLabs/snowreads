Learning temporal properties has crystallized as an effective\nmean to explain complex temporal behaviors. Several efficient algorithms have\nbeen designed for learning temporal formulas. However, the theoretical\nunderstanding of the complexity of the learning decision problems remains\nlargely unexplored. To address this, we study the complexity of the passive\nlearning problems of three prominent temporal logics, Linear Temporal Logic\n(LTL), Computation Tree Logic (CTL) and Alternating-time Temporal Logic (ATL)\nand several of their fragments. We show that learning formulas using an\nunbounded amount of occurrences of binary operators is NP-complete for all of\nthese logics. On the other hand, when investigating the complexity of learning\nformulas with bounded amount of occurrences of binary operators, we exhibit\ndiscrepancies between the complexity of learning LTL, CTL and ATL formulas\n(with a varying number of agents).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
