We introduce a\nfunctional framework of generalized dynamic principal component analysis\n(GDPCA). The concept of GDPCA aims for better adaptation to possible\nnonstationary features of the series. We define the functional generalized\ndynamic principal component (GDPC) as static factor time series in a functional\ndynamic factor model and obtain the multivariate GDPC from a truncation of the\nfunctional dynamic factor model. GDFPCA uses a minimum squared error criterion\nto evaluate the reconstruction of the original functional time series. The\ncomputation of GDPC involves a two-step estimation of the coefficient vector of\nthe loading curves in a basis expansion. We provide a proof of the consistency\nof the reconstruction of the original functional time series with GDPC\nconverging in mean square to the original functional time series. Monte Carlo\nsimulation studies indicate that the proposed GDFPCA is comparable to dynamic\nfunctional principal component analysis (DFPCA) when the data generating\nprocess is stationary, and outperforms DFPCA and FPCA when the data generating\nprocess is non-stationary. The results of applications to real data reaffirm\nthe findings in simulation studies.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
