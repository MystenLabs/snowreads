We study the random all-to-all\ninteracting fermionic Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model and prove that, in\ncontrast, (I) the low-energy states have polynomial circuit depth, yet (II) the\nannealed and quenched free energies agree to inverse-polynomially low\ntemperatures, ruling out a glassy phase transition in this sense. These results\nare derived by showing that fermionic and spin systems significantly differ in\ntheir \\emph{commutation index}, which quantifies the non-commutativity of\nHamiltonian terms. Our results suggest that low-temperature strongly\ninteracting fermions, unlike spins, belong in a classically nontrivial yet\nquantumly easy phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
