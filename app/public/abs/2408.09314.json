In the near-continuum flow regime, analytical temperature profiles\nare derived, based on which the first and second temperature jump coefficients\nare extracted from the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Analytical\nexpressions for temperature jump coefficients are fitted over a wide range of\ninelastic collision number and accommodation coefficient.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
