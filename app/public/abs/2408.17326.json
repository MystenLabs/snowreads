These discovered process models depict the actual execution of a process\nand serve as a foundational element for conformance checking, performance\nanalyses, and many other applications. While most of the current process\ndiscovery algorithms primarily rely on a single event log for model discovery,\nadditional sources of information, such as process documentation and domain\nexperts' knowledge, remain untapped. This valuable information is often\noverlooked in traditional process discovery approaches. In this paper, we\npropose a discovery technique incorporating such knowledge in a novel inductive\nmining approach. This method takes a set of user-defined or discovered rules as\ninput and utilizes them to discover enhanced process models. Our proposed\nframework has been implemented and tested using several publicly available\nreal-life event logs. Furthermore, to showcase the framework's effectiveness in\na practical setting, we conducted a case study in collaboration with UWV, the\nDutch employee insurance agency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B3pA6Da_7ToZrB1zoVIADcl6fj9mpwRpJod48RqPM8I","pdfSize":"1472032"}
