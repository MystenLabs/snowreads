Here, we present\nan optimization algorithm which combines machine learning techniques and tensor\nnetwork methods. The said algorithm runs on classical hardware and finds\nshallow, accurate quantum circuits by minimizing scalar cost functions. The\ngradients relevant for the optimization process are computed using the reverse\nmode automatic differentiation technique implemented on top of the time-evolved\nblock decimation algorithm for matrix product states. A variation of the ADAM\noptimizer is utilized to perform a gradient descent on the manifolds of charge\nconserving unitary operators to find the optimal quantum circuit. The efficacy\nof this approach is demonstrated by finding the ground states of spin chain\nHamiltonians for the Ising, three-state Potts and the massive Schwinger models\nfor system sizes up to L=100. The first ten excited states of these models are\nalso obtained for system sizes L=24. All circuits achieve high state fidelities\nwithin reasonable CPU time and modest memory requirements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
