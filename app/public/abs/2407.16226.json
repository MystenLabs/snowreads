Our characterization naturally\ngeneralizes the same-sign characterization used by Chudnovsky and Seymour in\ntheir famous 2007 paper proving the real-rootedness of independence polynomials\nof claw-free graphs, thus fully settling a question left open in their paper.\nOur methods are generally speaking elementary, utilizing mainly linear algebra\nand the established theory of interlacing polynomials, with a bit of invariant\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
