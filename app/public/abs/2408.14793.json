Here we demonstrate that FEB can arise in a simplified model\nincorporating altermagnetism. By enhancing the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model on a\nsquare lattice with additional altermagnetic and Zeeman fields perpendicular to\nthe 2D plane, we uncover the emergence of FEB that are distinct from the bulk\nbands across the entire Brillouin zone and over broad parameter regimes. We\ncalculate topological phase diagrams, highlighting the strong topological\nproperties characterized by the Chern number and the weak topological\nproperties marked by the winding number. Furthermore, we provide analytical\nresults of the energy spectrum and the wave functions of the FEB. We also study\nthe robustness of the FEB, showcasing its resilience against various\nperturbations such as geometric rotation, energy spectrum asymmetry, and spin\ncoupling. Our findings advance our understanding of FEB and may pave new\navenues for further exploration of topological phases in quantum materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
