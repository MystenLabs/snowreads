This is applied to get a new uniform bound for points on diagonal\nquadric surfaces, and to a problem about the representation of integers as a\nsum of four unlike powers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F8lesdw5AHfYc5PhHKN5fxoGEXfyBglvH_yYmyjSpRw","pdfSize":"281734"}
