The idea is that a small agent operating in a\nmuch bigger world cannot store all information that the world has to offer. To\nperform well, the agent must be carefully designed to ingest, retain, and eject\nthe right information. To enable the development of performant continual\nlearning agents, a number of synthetic environments have been proposed.\nHowever, these benchmarks suffer from limitations, including unnatural\ndistribution shifts and a lack of fidelity to the \"small agent, big world\"\nframing. This paper aims to formalize two desiderata for the design of future\nsimulated environments. These two criteria aim to reflect the objectives and\ncomplexity of continual learning in practical settings while enabling rapid\nprototyping of algorithms on a smaller scale.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
