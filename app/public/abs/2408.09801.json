Also the measurement of\nmultipartite entanglement in mixed states amid decoherence presents a\nformidable task. Employing reservoir memory offers a means to attenuate the\ndecoherence dynamics impacting multipartite entanglement, slowing its\ndegradation. In this work, we investigate the distribution of entanglement in\ntripartite systems for both pure and mixed states under a structured dephasing\nenvironment at finite temperature under both Markovian and Non-Markovian\ndynamics. Here, we consider situation where the three qubits in a common\nreservoir and also the situation where each qubit is in a local bosonic\nreservoir. We have also shown that the robustness of a quantum system to\ndecoherence depends on the distribution of entanglement and its interaction\nwith the different configurations of the bath. When each qubit has its own\nlocal environment, the system exhibits different dynamics compared to when all\nthree qubits share a common environment. Furthermore, in the presence of the\nreservoir memory, the sustainability of distribution of entanglement in a\ntripartite system under dephasing dynamics is significantly enhanced.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6jF54-uNi6yApYU75Q-ZPEHH6owWc1pj9MWVX1IiNxg","pdfSize":"900513"}
