Thematic maps pose a number of\nunique challenges for responsiveness, such as inflexible aspect ratios that do\nnot easily adapt to varying screen dimensions, or densely clustered visual\nelements in urban areas becoming illegible at smaller scales. However, design\nguidance on how to best address these issues is currently lacking. We conducted\ndesign sessions with eight professional designers and developers of web-based\nthematic maps for information visualization. Participants were asked to\nredesign a given map for various screen sizes and aspect ratios and to describe\ntheir reasoning for when and how they adapted the design. We report general\nobservations of practitioners' motivations, decision-making processes, and\npersonal design frameworks. We then derive seven challenges commonly\nencountered in responsive maps, and 17 strategies to address them, such as\nrepositioning elements, segmenting the map, or using alternative\nvisualizations. We compile these challenges and strategies into an illustrated\ncheat sheet targeted at anyone designing or learning to design responsive maps.\nThe cheat sheet is available online:\nhttps://responsive-vis.github.io/map-cheat-sheet\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
