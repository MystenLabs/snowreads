Recently, text-based molecule design has emerged, inspired by\nnext-generation AI tasks analogous to foundational vision-language models. Our\nstudy explores the use of knowledge-augmented prompting of large language\nmodels (LLMs) for the zero-shot text-conditional de novo molecular generation\ntask. Our approach uses task-specific instructions and a few demonstrations to\naddress distributional shift challenges when constructing augmented prompts for\nquerying LLMs to generate molecules consistent with technical descriptions. Our\nframework proves effective, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) baseline\nmodels on benchmark datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"E5J_DLlmnfPl0fhbVC-OAimK3wUxTrsalMv5hr42WF8","pdfSize":"425747"}
