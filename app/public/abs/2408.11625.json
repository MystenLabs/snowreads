Among these, the Iterative\nRational Krylov Algorithm (IRKA) is widely regarded as a benchmark for\nconstructing $\\mathcal{H}_2$-optimal reduced-order models. However, a key\nchallenge in its data-driven implementation lies in the need for transfer\nfunction samples and their derivatives, which must be updated iteratively.\nConducting new experiments to acquire these samples each time IRKA updates the\ninterpolation data is impractical. Additionally, for discrete-time systems,\nobtaining transfer function samples at frequencies outside the unit circle is\nchallenging, as these are not easily accessible through measurements. This\npaper proposes a method to sample the transfer function and its derivative\noffline using frequency or time-domain data, which is commonly measured for\nvarious design and analysis purposes in industry. By leveraging this approach,\nthere is no need to directly measure transfer function samples at interpolation\npoints, as these can be generated offline using the pre-existing data. This\nfacilitates the offline implementation of IRKA within the frequency- or\ntime-domain Loewner framework. The approach is also extended to discrete-time\nsystems in this work. A numerical example is provided to validate the\ntheoretical findings presented.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
