Today's large-scale\nfloor plan datasets predominantly feature simple floor plan layouts, typically\nrepresenting single-apartment dwellings only. To compensate for the mismatch\nbetween current datasets and the real world, we develop \\textbf{Modified Swiss\nDwellings} (MSD) -- the first large-scale floor plan dataset that contains a\nsignificant share of layouts of multi-apartment dwellings. MSD features over\n5.3K floor plans of medium- to large-scale building complexes, covering over\n18.9K distinct apartments. We validate that existing approaches for floor plan\ngeneration, while effective in simpler scenarios, cannot yet seamlessly address\nthe challenges posed by MSD. Our benchmark calls for new research in floor plan\nmachine understanding. Code and data are open.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l-u35bzDI28ST47MLG_VgXwy5p4RBdE0B_zAtcDSIpc","pdfSize":"6208341"}
