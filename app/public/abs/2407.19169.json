In this paper, we propose a jump filter within the discontinuous\nGalerkin (DG) method to mitigate these oscillations. This filter operates\nlocally based on jump information at cell interfaces, targeting high-order\npolynomial modes within each cell. Besides its localized nature, our proposed\nfilter preserves key attributes of the DG method, including conservation, $L^2$\nstability, and high-order accuracy. We also explore its compatibility with\nother damping techniques, and demonstrate its seamless integration into a\nhybrid limiter. In scenarios featuring strong shock waves, this hybrid\napproach, incorporating this jump filter as the low-order limiter, effectively\nsuppresses numerical oscillations while exhibiting low numerical dissipation.\nAdditionally, the proposed jump filter maintains the compactness of the DG\nscheme, which greatly aids in efficient parallel computing. Moreover, it boasts\nan impressively low computational cost, given that no characteristic\ndecomposition is required and all computations are confined to physical space.\nNumerical experiments validate the effectiveness and performance of our\nproposed scheme, confirming its accuracy and shock-capturing capabilities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
