In addition, on the basis of a (Fenchel) duality\ntheory on the discrete level, we derive an $\\textit{a priori}$ error identity\nthat applies to the approximation of the primal formulation using the\nCrouzeix-Raviart element and to the approximation of the dual formulation using\nthe Raviart-Thomas element, and leads to quasi-optimal error decay rates\nwithout imposing additional assumptions on the contact set and in arbitrary\nspace dimensions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
