Our results agree with\npreviously published data computed using an approximated form for the\nthree-body polarizability, and are extended to the low-temperature regime by\nincluding exchange effects. Additionally, the uncertainty of $C_\\varepsilon$ is\nrigorously determined for the first time by propagating the uncertainties of\nthe potential and polarizability surfaces; this uncertainty is much larger than\nthe contribution from the dipole-moment surface to $C_\\varepsilon$. Our results\ncompare reasonably well with the limited experimental data. The\nfirst-principles values of $C_\\epsilon$ computed in this work will enhance the\naccuracy of primary temperature and pressure metrology based on measurements of\nthe dielectric constant of helium.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"_y7msVBzVK86EpYAdH1vKGRY34kSsIm6T63j48QyFzA","pdfSize":"1098624"}
