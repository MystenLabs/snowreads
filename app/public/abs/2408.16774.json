OAM signals emitted\nby uniform circular array (UCA) are widely regarded to go through the\nBessel-form channels. However, the channel gains corresponding to the\nBessel-form channels are with low signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) on OAM-modes and\nit is difficult to achieve high capacity using all OAM modes. To achieve\nmaximum capacity offered by OAM multiplexing for wireless backhaul\ncommunications, in this paper we propose the optimal UCA design, which selects\nthe optimal OAM-modes and radius of receive UCA. We formulate the capacity\nmaximization problem and divide it into two subproblems for obtaining the\ncorresponding optimal UCA design for OAM multiplexing based wireless backhaul\ncommunications. In particular, the optimal radius of the receive UCA is firstly\nderived. Then, we propose an mode selection scheme to choose appropriate\nOAM-modes for data transmission to maximize the capacity. Extensive simulations\nobtained validate that the capacity of OAM multiplexing can be significantly\nincreased with our developed scheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
