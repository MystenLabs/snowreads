Despite extensive efforts to\ndemonstrate the existence of an RVB phase in the Hubbard model, a definitive\nrealisation has proven elusive. Here, we present a concise, realistic, and\nelegant solution to this longstanding problem by demonstrating analytically\nthat an RVB spin liquid, exhibiting spin-charge separation, emerges as the\nground state of doped Mott insulators on corner-sharing tetrahedral lattices\nwith frustrated hopping near half-filling -- a manifestation of the\ncounter-Nagaoka effect. We confirm numerically that this result holds for\nfinite-size systems, finite dopant density, and small exchange interactions.\nWhile much attention has been devoted to the emergence of new states from\ngeometrically frustrated interactions, our work demonstrates that kinetic\nenergy frustration in doped Mott insulators may be pivotal to stabilise robust,\ntopologically ordered states in real materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mNVlWQDYX_7I9UM-g1MBdj8QOHq5oz8y62GwCoe2NwY","pdfSize":"18884462"}
