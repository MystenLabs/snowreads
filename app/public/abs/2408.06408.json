Here we make the\nimportant observation that the quadratic interactions of axion dark matter lead\nto a divergence of the axion field value resulting in a non-physical parameter\nspace for values of the decay constant of $f\\lesssim 10^{15}$ GeV. We identify\nexperimental observables impacted by this effect and those that can avoid it.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xBfWDlAVVoIiDcH2UZX1KUcxiWLSkHV9PzCOvIuky7c","pdfSize":"496518"}
