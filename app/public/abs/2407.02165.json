To this end, we propose the WildAvatar dataset, a web-scale\nin-the-wild human avatar creation dataset extracted from YouTube, with\n$10,000+$ different human subjects and scenes. WildAvatar is at least\n$10\\times$ richer than previous datasets for 3D human avatar creation. We\nevaluate several state-of-the-art avatar creation methods on our dataset,\nhighlighting the unexplored challenges in real-world applications on avatar\ncreation. We also demonstrate the potential for generalizability of avatar\ncreation methods, when provided with data at scale. We publicly release our\ndata source links and annotations, to push forward 3D human avatar creation and\nother related fields for real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
