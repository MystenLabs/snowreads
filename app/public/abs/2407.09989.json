The nonequilibrium can be realized by external nongradient driving\non the medium particles or by their (athermal) active self-propulsion. The\nresulting friction on the probe is explicit as a time-correlation for medium\nobservables and is decomposed into two terms, one entropic and proportional to\nthe noise amplitude as in the Einstein relation for equilibrium media, and a\nfrenetic term that can take both signs. As illustration, we give the exact\nexpressions for the friction and noise of a probe in a rotating run-and-tumble\nmedium and in a sheared overdamped medium. In both examples, we find an\ninteresting transition to absolute negative probe friction as the\nnonequilibrium medium exhibits sufficient and persistent rotational current.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
