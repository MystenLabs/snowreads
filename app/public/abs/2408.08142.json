This study evaluates the impact of a custom data preprocessing pipeline\non ten machine learning models predicting COVID-19 mortality using data from\nOur World in Data (OWID). Our pipeline differs from a standard preprocessing\npipeline through four key steps. Firstly, it transforms weekly reported totals\ninto daily updates, correcting reporting biases and providing more accurate\nestimates. Secondly, it uses localised outlier detection and processing to\npreserve data variance and enhance accuracy. Thirdly, it utilises computational\ndependencies among columns to ensure data consistency. Finally, it incorporates\nan iterative feature selection process to optimise the feature set and improve\nmodel performance. Results show a significant improvement with the custom\npipeline: the MLP Regressor achieved a test RMSE of 66.556 and a test R-squared\nof 0.991, surpassing the DecisionTree Regressor from the standard pipeline,\nwhich had a test RMSE of 222.858 and a test R-squared of 0.817. These findings\nhighlight the importance of tailored preprocessing techniques in enhancing\npredictive modelling accuracy for COVID-19 mortality. Although specific to this\nstudy, these methodologies offer valuable insights into diverse datasets and\ndomains, improving predictive performance across various contexts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
