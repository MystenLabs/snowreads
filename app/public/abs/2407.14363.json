This device\nexhibits relaxation oscillator behavior with DC voltage-controlled frequency\ntuning and DC current bias. The device frequency is modulated via the tunnel\njunction, which induces localized heating by injecting quasiparticles. This\nheating mechanism modulates the nanowire switching current, enabling relaxation\noscillations when it falls below the bias current. We demonstrate the device\noperating principles and characterize its performance across various\nparameters, including different choices of shunt resistor, shunt inductance,\nand bath temperature ranging from 20 mK to 1 K. The device showed oscillation\nwith a frequency range approximately between 1 GHz and 10 GHz and total energy\ndissipation per cycle of $\\sim100$ zJ. Our results suggest that this design\noffers a promising platform for compact, tunable superconducting oscillators in\nthe microwave spectrum with potential applications in quantum information\nprocessing, microwave technology, and ultra-low-power electronics. The\nstraightforward frequency control mechanism and integration potential make this\ndevice an attractive candidate for superconducting microwave local oscillators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
