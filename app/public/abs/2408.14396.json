The new force carrier has a\nrelatively stronger coupling with the beyond standard model (BSM) sector, while\nits interaction with the SM fields is much weaker. This weaker coupling is\ninduced through mixing mechanisms, specifically via gauge kinetic mixing and\nthe $Z-Z'$ mixing. We consider a scenario where the new gauge boson decays\nmostly to charge-neutral long-lived particles and/or dark matter (DM). We show\nhow producing and detecting this heavier invisible $Z'$, that will be beyond\nthe reach of even the very high luminosity LHC, becomes possible if it is\nproduced in association with an energetic photon at the future muon collider.\nThe on-shell production of the $Z'$ will lead to a peak in the photon energy\ndistribution, following the so-called radiative return phenomena and can lead\nto the accurate determination of the $Z'$ mass and its interaction with SM\nparticles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sFCWoYZcmrbcRu_k-OFgV70ZPa5Td7JD0L4GxOfqz54","pdfSize":"1015209"}
