(SICOMP'19) and Cygan\net al. (TALG'20), has proven to be one of the most powerful tools for\nparameterized graph cut problems in recent years. Unfortunately, all known\nconstructions require at least $\\Omega_k\\left(mn^2\\right)$ time, given an\nundirected graph with $n$ vertices, $m$ edges, and cut-size parameter $k$. In\nthis work, we show the first close-to-linear time parameterized algorithm that\ncomputes an unbreakable decomposition. More precisely, for any $0<\\epsilon\\leq\n1$, our algorithm runs in time $2^{O(\\frac{k}{\\epsilon} \\log\n\\frac{k}{\\epsilon})}m^{1 + \\epsilon}$ and computes a $(O(k/\\epsilon), k)$\nunbreakable tree decomposition of $G$, where each bag has adhesion at most\n$O(k/\\epsilon)$.\n  This immediately opens up possibilities for obtaining close-to-linear time\nalgorithms for numerous problems whose only known solution is based on\nunbreakable decomposition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
