This raises a natural question: How optimal can\npolynomial-time algorithms reach? Whereas algorithms for computing\nconstant-factor optimal solutions have been developed, the constant factor is\ngenerally very large, limiting their application potential. In this work, among\nother breakthroughs, we propose the first low-polynomial-time MAPF algorithms\ndelivering $1$-$1.5$ (resp., $1$-$1.67$) asymptotic makespan optimality\nguarantees for 2D (resp., 3D) grids for random instances at a very high $1/3$\nagent density, with high probability. Moreover, when regularly distributed\nobstacles are introduced, our methods experience no performance degradation.\nThese methods generalize to support $100\\%$ agent density. Regardless of the\ndimensionality and density, our high-quality methods are enabled by a unique\nhierarchical integration of two key building blocks. At the higher level, we\napply the labeled Grid Rearrangement Algorithm (RTA), capable of performing\nefficient reconfiguration on grids through row/column shuffles. At the lower\nlevel, we devise novel methods that efficiently simulate row/column shuffles\nreturned by RTA. Our implementations of RTA-based algorithms are highly\neffective in extensive numerical evaluations, demonstrating excellent\nscalability compared to other SOTA methods. For example, in 3D settings,\n\\rta-based algorithms readily scale to grids with over $370,000$ vertices and\nover $120,000$ agents and consistently achieve conservative makespan optimality\napproaching $1.5$, as predicted by our theoretical analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
