The classes of Fourier integral operators\n$I^\\mu_{\\rho,1-\\rho}(X,Y;C)$ considered here are associated with complex\ncanonical relations $C$, i.e. they are parametrised by a complex-valued phase\nfunction. Our analysis also includes the case of real canonical relations,\nnamely, the class of Fourier integral operators with real-valued phase\nfunctions. The nuclear trace in the sense of Grothendieck is investigated for\nthese operators as well as the validity of the Grothendieck-Lidskii formula on\nLebesgue spaces. Criteria are presented in terms of the factorisation condition\nfor the complex canonical relation. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nmembership of Fourier integral operators in Schatten-von Neumann classes are\npresented in the case where the Schatten index $r>0$ belongs to the set\n$\\mathbb{N} $ and sharp sufficient conditions are presented in the general case\n$r>0$. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the\nmembership of Fourier integral operators to the ideal of trace class operators\nand to the ideal of Hilbert-Schmidt operators on $L^2(X)$. The rate of decay of\neigenvalues and the trace of Fourier integral operators is also investigated in\nboth settings, in the Hilbert space case of $L^2(X)$ using Schatten-von Neumann\nproperties and in the context of the Banach spaces $L^p(X),$ $1<p<\\infty,$\nutilising the notion of $r$-nuclearity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2NkTw_GLhK36IbLqzQIzLPCCDQYaaulXSPdgBtkeUWQ","pdfSize":"463034"}
