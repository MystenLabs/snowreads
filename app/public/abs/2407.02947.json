In particular, if $X$ is an analytic subvariety of $\\mathbb C^n$, we\nderive expressions for analytic invariants defined in terms of the module\n$\\Theta_X$ of logarithmic vector fields of $X$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
