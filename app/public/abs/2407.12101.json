However, the context window is\ntypically limited to several thousand tokens, which limits the number of\nretrieved passages that can inform a model's response. For this reason, it's\nimportant to avoid occupying context window space with redundant information by\nensuring a degree of diversity among retrieved passages. At the same time, the\ninformation should also be relevant to the current task. Most prior methods\nthat encourage diversity among retrieved results, such as Maximal Marginal\nRelevance (MMR), do so by incorporating an objective that explicitly trades off\ndiversity and relevance. We propose a novel simple optimization metric based on\nrelevant information gain, a probabilistic measure of the total information\nrelevant to a query for a set of retrieved results. By optimizing this metric,\ndiversity organically emerges from our system. When used as a drop-in\nreplacement for the retrieval component of a RAG system, this method yields\nstate-of-the-art performance on question answering tasks from the Retrieval\nAugmented Generation Benchmark (RGB), outperforming existing metrics that\ndirectly optimize for relevance and diversity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PxI9xEok8rbS8V-sn7cYww59wexRnGoD03rQEjRS340","pdfSize":"606125"}
