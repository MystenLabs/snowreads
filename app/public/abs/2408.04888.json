In\nparticular, computing histograms in the \\emph{local} model of privacy has been\nthe focus of a fruitful recent line of work, and various algorithms have been\nproposed, achieving the order-optimal $\\ell_\\infty$ error in the high-privacy\n(small $\\varepsilon$) regime while balancing other considerations such as time-\nand communication-efficiency. However, to the best of our knowledge, the\npicture is much less clear when it comes to the medium- or low-privacy regime\n(large $\\varepsilon$), despite its increased relevance in practice. In this\npaper, we investigate locally private histograms, and the very related\ndistribution learning task, in this medium-to-low privacy regime, and establish\nnear-tight (and somewhat unexpected) bounds on the $\\ell_\\infty$ error\nachievable. As a direct corollary of our results, we obtain a protocol for\nhistograms in the \\emph{shuffle} model of differential privacy, with accuracy\nmatching previous algorithms but significantly better message and communication\ncomplexity.\n  Our theoretical findings emerge from a novel analysis, which appears to\nimprove bounds across the board for the locally private histogram problem. We\nback our theoretical findings by an empirical comparison of existing algorithms\nin all privacy regimes, to assess their typical performance and behaviour\nbeyond the worst-case setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
