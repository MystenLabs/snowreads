Traditional\ncybersecurity measures fail to defend against APTs. Cognitive vulnerabilities\ncan significantly influence attackers' decision-making processes, which\npresents an opportunity for defenders to exploit. This work introduces\nPsybORG$^+$, a multi-agent cybersecurity simulation environment designed to\nmodel APT behaviors influenced by cognitive vulnerabilities. A classification\nmodel is built for cognitive vulnerability inference and a simulator is\ndesigned for synthetic data generation. Results show that PsybORG$^+$ can\neffectively model APT attackers with different loss aversion and confirmation\nbias levels. The classification model has at least a 0.83 accuracy rate in\npredicting cognitive vulnerabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
