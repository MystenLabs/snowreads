An important challenge is that\ngroup interactions often leads to nonlinear synergistic effects. However,\nprevious models mainly focus on deterministic nonlinearity where the arise of\nsynergy or discounting effect is determined by certain conditions, ignoring\nuncertainty and stochasticity in real-world systems. Here, we develop a\nprobabilistic framework to study the cooperative behavior in stochastic\nnonlinear public goods games. Through both analytical treatment and Monte Carlo\nsimulations, we provide comprehensive understanding of social dilemmas with\nstochastic nonlinearity in both well-mixed and structured populations. We find\nthat increasing the degree of nonlinearity makes synergy more advantageous when\ncompeting with discounting, thereby promoting cooperation. Interestingly, we\nshow that network reciprocity loses effectiveness when the probability of\nsynergy is small. Moreover, group size exhibits nonlinear effects on group\ncooperation regardless of the underlying structure. Our findings thus provide\nnovel insights into how stochastic nonlinearity influences the emergence of\nprosocial behavior.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
