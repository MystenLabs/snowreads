A Roman Dominating function $f$\nis said to be an \\emph{Independent Roman Dominating function} (or IRDF), if\n$V_1\\cup V_2$ forms an independent set, where $V_i=\\{v\\in V~\\vert~f(v)=i\\}$,\nfor $i\\in \\{0,1,2\\}$. The total weight of $f$ is equal to $\\sum_{v\\in V} f(v)$,\nand is denoted as $w(f)$. The \\emph{Independent Roman Domination Number} of\n$G$, denoted by $i_R(G)$, is defined as min$\\{w(f)~\\vert~f$ is an IRDF of\n$G\\}$. For a given graph $G$, the problem of computing $i_R(G)$ is defined as\nthe \\emph{Minimum Independent Roman Domination problem}. The problem is already\nknown to be NP-hard for bipartite graphs. In this paper, we further study the\nalgorithmic complexity of the problem.\n  In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm to solve the Minimum\nIndependent Roman Domination problem for distance-hereditary graphs, split\ngraphs, and $P_4$-sparse graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
