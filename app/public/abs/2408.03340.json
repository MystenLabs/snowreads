In this\nwork, we investigate the trade-offs in frame sampling methods for Video & Frame\nRetrieval using natural language questions. We explore the balance between the\nquantity of sampled frames and the retrieval recall score, aiming to identify\nefficient video frame sampling strategies that maintain high retrieval efficacy\nwith reduced storage and processing demands. Our study focuses on the storage\nand retrieval of image data (video frames) within a vector database required by\nVideo RAG pattern, comparing the effectiveness of various frame sampling\ntechniques. Our investigation indicates that the recall@k metric for both\ntext-to-video and text-to-frame retrieval tasks using various methods covered\nas part of this work is comparable to or exceeds that of storing each frame\nfrom the video. Our findings are intended to inform the selection of frame\nsampling methods for practical Video RAG implementations, serving as a\nspringboard for innovative research in this domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
