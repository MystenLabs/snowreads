MC-EIU is enabling technology for many\nhuman-computer interfaces. However, there is a lack of available datasets in\nterms of annotation, modality, language diversity, and accessibility. In this\nwork, we propose an MC-EIU dataset, which features 7 emotion categories, 9\nintent categories, 3 modalities, i.e., textual, acoustic, and visual content,\nand two languages, i.e., English and Mandarin. Furthermore, it is completely\nopen-source for free access. To our knowledge, MC-EIU is the first\ncomprehensive and rich emotion and intent joint understanding dataset for\nmultimodal conversation. Together with the release of the dataset, we also\ndevelop an Emotion and Intent Interaction (EI$^2$) network as a reference\nsystem by modeling the deep correlation between emotion and intent in the\nmultimodal conversation. With comparative experiments and ablation studies, we\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed EI$^2$ method on the MC-EIU\ndataset. The dataset and codes will be made available at:\nhttps://github.com/MC-EIU/MC-EIU.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
