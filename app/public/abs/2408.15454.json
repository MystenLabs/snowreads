We\nconsider a setting where samples are drawn from multiple groups, each following\na distribution with unknown mean and variance parameters. We introduce a novel\nsampling strategy, motivated simply by Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, which\nminimizes the variance of the population mean estimator by allocating samples\nproportionally to both the group size and the standard deviation. This approach\nimproves the efficiency of sampling by focusing resources on groups with\ngreater variability, thereby enhancing the precision of the overall estimate.\nAdditionally, we extend our method to a two-stage sampling procedure in a Bayes\napproach, named BayesSRW, where a preliminary stage is used to estimate the\nvariance, which then informs the optimal allocation of the remaining sampling\nbudget. Through simulation examples, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our\napproach in reducing estimation uncertainty and providing more reliable\ninsights in applications ranging from user experience surveys to\nhigh-dimensional peptide array studies.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
