This approach enables each Gaussian\nto exhibit a richer representation by accommodating varying colors and\nopacities across its surface, significantly enhancing rendering quality\ncompared to traditional methods. To demonstrate the merits of our approach, we\nhave adapted the Mini-Splatting architecture to integrate textured Gaussians\nwithout increasing the number of Gaussians. Our experiments across multiple\nreal-world datasets show that Textured-GS consistently outperforms both the\nbaseline Mini-Splatting and standard 3DGS in terms of visual fidelity. The\nresults highlight the potential of Textured-GS to advance Gaussian-based\nrendering technologies, promising more efficient and high-quality scene\nreconstructions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JN6AcjXyrysVm0C2JzGbisNy0K3GKwc9SaWTr9dJ7_I","pdfSize":"18129713","objectId":"0xecd42ded2ddf036a096c664f1841d0b3fe519a399ec1bf4eb561bd5944d86e05","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
