These two technologies have made significant\nprogress and can generate realistic images. However, many communities tend to\nconfuse the two, because both generate the desired image based on the input\nimage and both cover the two definitions of content and style. In fact, there\nare indeed significant differences between the two, and there is currently a\nlack of clear explanations to distinguish the two technologies, which is not\nconducive to the advancement of technology. We hope to serve the entire\ncommunity by introducing the differences and connections between image-to-image\ntranslation and style transfer. The entire discussion process involves the\nconcepts, forms, training modes, evaluation processes, and visualization\nresults of the two technologies. Finally, we conclude that image-to-image\ntranslation divides images by domain, and the types of images in the domain are\nlimited, and the scope involved is small, but the conversion ability is strong\nand can achieve strong semantic changes. Style transfer divides image types by\nsingle image, and the scope involved is large, but the transfer ability is\nlimited, and it transfers more texture and color of the image.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
