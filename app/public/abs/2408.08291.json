While for-profit companies collect user data through the APIs of\ntheir models, using it internally to improve their own models, the open source\nand research community lags behind.\n  We introduce the ShareLM collection, a unified set of human conversations\nwith large language models, and its accompanying plugin, a Web extension for\nvoluntarily contributing user-model conversations. Where few platforms share\ntheir chats, the ShareLM plugin adds this functionality, thus, allowing users\nto share conversations from most platforms. The plugin allows the user to rate\ntheir conversations, both at the conversation and the response levels, and\ndelete conversations they prefer to keep private before they ever leave the\nuser's local storage. We release the plugin conversations as part of the\nShareLM collection, and call for more community effort in the field of open\nhuman-model data.\n  The code, plugin, and data are available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P00rB_ssGixdk6JhHLE60X-wwVriV28dbZOf4IYDfiA","pdfSize":"971640"}
