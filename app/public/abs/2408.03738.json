Block maxima (BM), an\napproach in EVT that seeks estimates of parameters of the generalized extreme\nvalue distribution (GEV), can be generalized to take into account not just the\nmaximum realization from a given dataset, but the r largest order statistics\nfor a given r. In this work we propose a parameter estimation method that\ncombines the r largest order statistic (r-LOS) extension of BM with permutation\nbootstrapping: surrogate realizations are obtained by randomly reordering the\noriginal data set, and then r-LOS is applied to these shuffled measurements -\nthe mean estimate computed from these surrogate realizations is the desired\nestimate. We used synthetic observations and real meteorological time series to\nverify the performance of our method; we found that the combination of r-LOS\nand bootstrapping resulted in estimates more accurate than when either approach\nwas implemented separately.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
