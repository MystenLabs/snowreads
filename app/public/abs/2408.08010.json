We first\ncompute the quasi-normal mode (QNM) spectrum of operators with dimension\n$\\Delta$ and spin $s=0,\\pm 1/2$. The leading QNMs and their overtones display\nqualitatively different behavior depending on the branch of qBTZ solution;\nbranch 1 is a conical singularity dressed with a horizon while branch 2 is a\nquantum-corrected BTZ black hole. Hence the relaxation of probe matter\ndistinguishes the type of singularity cloaked by the horizon. We then turn to\npole-skipping locations where Green's functions are not unique. At these\npoints, frequency is proportional to temperature, but momentum exhibits complex\ntemperature dependence due to quantum effects. Under the assumption that the\npole-skipping point closest to the origin reflects quantum chaos, we infer the\nlikely behavior of the quantum Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity in the\ndual theory. Finally, we examine pole collisions in complex momentum space,\nshowing that quantum corrections imprint a unique signature on the analytic\nstructure of the poles in retarded Green's functions, resulting in\nlevel-crossing phenomena that differ notably from the level-touching phenomena\nin the uncorrected BTZ geometry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
