Containers offer a\nlightweight deployment option but pulling images from central repositories can\ncause delays. This article presents a novel declarative approach and\nopen-source prototype for replicating container images across the cloud-edge\ncontinuum. Considering resource availability, network QoS, and storage costs,\nwe leverage logic programming to (i) determine optimal initial placements via\nAnswer Set Programming (ASP) and (ii) adapt placements using Prolog-based\ncontinuous reasoning. We evaluate our solution through simulations, showcasing\nhow combining ASP and Prolog continuous reasoning can balance cost optimisation\nand prompt decision-making in placement adaptation at increasing infrastructure\nsizes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"oU4ZTza7rdGo1CiAW4JerwIDrHoYq8BBeWG2sgPEguI","pdfSize":"740936"}
