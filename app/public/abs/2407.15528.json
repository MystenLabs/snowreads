This activity is\ncurrently measured using a network of ground-based magnetometers, typically\nconsisting of extensive installations at established observatory sites. We show\nthat this network can be enhanced by the addition of remote quantum\nmagnetometers which combine high sensitivity with intrinsic calibration. These\nnodes utilize scalable hardware and run independently of wired communication\nand power networks. We demonstrate that optically pumped magnetometers,\nutilizing mass-produced and miniaturized components, offer a single scalable\nsensor with the sensitivity and stability required for space weather\nobservation. We describe the development and deployment of an off-grid magnetic\nsensing node, powered by a solar panel, present observed data from periods of\nlow and high geomagnetic activity, and compare it to existing geomagnetic\nobservatories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_DbSHaw1Po4BYWedxf-73fSM8qd_5ryDY-mckm7Ov-o","pdfSize":"927219"}
