They exchange\nthe quantity with agents existing within their interaction radii. It is shown\nin the paper that the distribution of the quantity of agents is robustly\ngoverned by Zipf's law for a small density of agents independent of the number\nof agents and the type of interaction, despite the simplicity of the rules. The\nmodel can exhibit other power laws with different exponents and the Gaussian\ndistributions. The difference in the mechanism underlying Zipf's law and other\npower laws are studied by mapping the systems into graphs and investigating\nquantities characterizing the mapped graph. Thus, this model suggests one of\nthe origins of Zipf's law, i.e., the most common fundamental characteristics\nnecessary for Zipf's law to appear.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZFMIvRXKs95mfBqHn69roGkYVeUsQGbKtCD3u1UAzCE","pdfSize":"1441978"}
