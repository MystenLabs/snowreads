This process has three options: 1) AI autonomously\nclassifies, 2) learning to complement, where AI collaborates with users, and 3)\nlearning to defer, where AI defers to users. Despite their interconnected\nnature, these options have been studied in isolation rather than as components\nof a unified system. In this paper, we address this weakness with the novel\nHAI-CC methodology, called Learning to Complement and to Defer to Multiple\nUsers (LECODU). LECODU not only combines learning to complement and learning to\ndefer strategies, but it also incorporates an estimation of the optimal number\nof users to engage in the decision process. The training of LECODU maximises\nclassification accuracy and minimises collaboration costs associated with user\ninvolvement. Comprehensive evaluations across real-world and synthesized\ndatasets demonstrate LECODU's superior performance compared to state-of-the-art\nHAI-CC methods. Remarkably, even when relying on unreliable users with high\nrates of label noise, LECODU exhibits significant improvement over both human\ndecision-makers alone and AI alone.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
