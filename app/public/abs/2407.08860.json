Our final set of equations, which feature various\ncollisional (dissipative and scattering) contributions and two corresponding\nindependent stochastic force terms, are consistent with generalized\nfluctuation-dissipation type relations in the limit of thermal equilibrium\nbetween the particles.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
