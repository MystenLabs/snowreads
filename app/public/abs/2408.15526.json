In addition to the diffeomorphism, the action enjoys the extra\ngauge symmetry with the second derivatives of the scalar gauge parameter. This\nsymmetry gauges out all the local degrees of freedom (DoF's), while some global\nDoF's survive. The Hamiltonian constrained analysis confirms that the model\ndoes not have any local DoF. The world sheet of the string turns out to be a\ncylinder with time-like axis. The global DoF's of this string describe one\nsingle irreducible massive $3d$ particle with spin. The particle momentum is a\nconserved vector directed along the cylinder axis while the momentum square is\na fixed constant determined by the parameters in the action. The total angular\nmomentum is a conserved vector that defines the position of the axis of the\ncylinder whose specific value is defined by initial data, while the spin, being\nthe product of momentum and angular momentum is fixed by the parameters in the\nstring Lagrangian.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
