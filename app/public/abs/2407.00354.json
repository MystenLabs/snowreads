We give a\nmathematical description of the process in which the best adapted trait is\nselected in a given environment created by the total population. It is\nexhibited that the long-time limit of the unique solution to the nonlocal\nequation is given by a Dirac mass centered at the peak of the fitness within or\nat the boundary of the region where the initial data is positive. Specially, If\nthe peak of the fitness can't be in the support of the solution, then the\ninfinite time blow-up of the solution occurs near the boundary of the region\nwhere the solution is positive. Moreover, our numerical results facilitate a\ndeeper understanding of identifying the position of the centers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"aYMIdNqieWjpKMb_30bmqwktOUb2G5F7am1jQ6Pi1p8","pdfSize":"129137","objectId":"0x4f2a50aa54394ac384ce99eef096bb8aad32ee5406471f3fc16b648cf221783a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
