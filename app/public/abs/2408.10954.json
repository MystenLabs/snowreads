Here we show that an in-plane magnetic field combined with\na transverse electric field can induce an insulator-metal (IM) transition in\nbilayer graphene. Our study of the magnetic response reveals that the orbital\nmagnetic susceptibility changes from diamagnetic to paramagnetic around the\ntransition point. We discuss several strategies to observe the IM transition,\nswitch the diamagnetism, and more generally control the band structure of\nstacked 2D materials at experimentally accessible magnetic fields.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8SfHzy2IZ4_ann1ljenFvbBWsFI9vGLIbpM_m3PusJ0","pdfSize":"2507523"}
