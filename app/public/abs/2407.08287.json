But the design of hierarchical color maps elicits different\nrequirements to those of color maps for tabular data. Within this paper, we\nmake an initial effort to put design rules from the color map literature into\nthe context of hierarchical color maps. We investigate the impact of several\ndesign decisions and provide recommendations for various analysis scenarios.\nThus, we lay the foundation for objective quality criteria to evaluate\nhierarchical color maps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ppYpGkHr5ZqPJpM4t_ZMb9BasEA5rHpM81VQkICLc-4","pdfSize":"240320"}
