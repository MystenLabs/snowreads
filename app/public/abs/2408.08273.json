However, there is a significant\ntime and materials investment required to build new physical Escape Rooms, and\nprior attempts to create digital escape rooms have resulted in games that lack\nthe immersive qualities that make physical escape rooms so compelling. This\npaper presents ESCape the Classroom, a web framework for creating virtual\nreality educational escape rooms (VR EERs) that can be delivered to any\nweb-connected device. The framework is equipped with essential tools to design\nand deploy intricate, multi-room VR escape experiences using HTML and\nWeb-Components. It is designed to be used by educators with rudimentary\nprogramming skills, eliminating the need for advanced game programming or\ndevelopment expertise. VR EERs created with this platform can be published\nonline as WebXR sites that are compatible with a broad spectrum of VR hardware,\nincluding the Meta Quest 3, allowing educators to share the experiences they\ncreate while bypassing the need for additional software installations on\ndevices. This paper will present the design and implementation of ESCape the\nClassroom, and discuss the potential for this platform to be used in\neducational settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
