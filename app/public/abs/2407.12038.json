While current\ntext-to-speech (TTS) technology can generate high-quality audio, its ability to\nconvey complex emotions and controlled detail content remains limited. This\nconstraint leads to a discrepancy between the generated audio and human\nsubjective perception in practical applications like companion robots for\nchildren and marketing bots. The core issue lies in the inconsistency between\nhigh-quality audio generation and the ultimate human subjective experience.\nTherefore, this challenge aims to enhance the persuasiveness and acceptability\nof synthesized audio, focusing on human alignment convincing and inspirational\naudio generation. A total of 19 teams have registered for the challenge, and\nthe results of the competition and the competition are described in this paper.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
