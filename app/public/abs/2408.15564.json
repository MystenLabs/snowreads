In this study,\nwe investigate nonreciprocal heat transport in Majorana systems, specifically\nfocusing on the Kitaev chiral spin liquid under external magnetic fields. Our\ntheoretical examination focuses on effects of open boundaries in which the\nMajorana edge modes exist, and the inversion symmetry is broken, which leads to\nthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). Through perturbation theory, we\ndemonstrate that DMI induces asymmetric hopping, resulting in the asymmetry of\nthe Majorana band. The results of nonreciprocal heat currents are presented for\nvarious directions of external magnetic fields, and we discuss the relation\nbetween the current and the field-directions. The potential exists to\nmanipulate both of the directions and magnitude of the non-dissipative current\nby varying external magnetic fields and apply to non-dissipative heat transfer\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
