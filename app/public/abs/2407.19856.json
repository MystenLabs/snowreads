Even before such extra scalars are\nfound, one can probe them by using the fact that theories with multiple Higgs\ndoublets allow for substantial deviations of the couplings of $h_{125}$ from\ntheir SM values. Indeed, the observed couplings already place stringent limits\non such theories. We investigate the curious possibility that $h_{125}$ couples\nto the top quark mostly as a scalar, while it couples to the bottom quark\nmostly as a pseudoscalar. This possibility was allowed by 2017 data for the\nso-called C2HDM; a two Higgs doublet model with a single source of explicit CP\nviolation. It was shown recently that this possibility disappears when using\nthe full experimental data of 2024. Here we discuss a three Higgs doublet with\nexplicit CP violation (C3HDM), and show that the curious CP-even/CP-odd $t$/$b$\npossibility is partly resuscitated, prompting further experimental exploration\nof this prospect.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
