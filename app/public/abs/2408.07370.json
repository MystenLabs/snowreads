The goal is to find a partition of the edges into\nstars that minimizes the maximum number of stars a node is contained in while\nsimultaneously satisfying node-specific capacities. We design and analyze an\nefficient polynomial time algorithm with a runtime of $\\mathcal{O}(|E|^2)$ that\ndetermines an optimal partition. Moreover, we explicitly provide a closed form\nof an optimal value for some graph classes. We generalize our algorithm to find\neven an optimal star partition of linear hypergraphs, multigraphs, and graphs\nwith self-loop. We use flow techniques to design an algorithm for the star\npartitioning problem with an improved runtime of $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(\\Delta)\n\\cdot |E| \\cdot \\min\\{|V|^{\\frac{2}{3}},|E|^{\\frac{1}{2}}\\})$, where $\\Delta$\nis maximum node degree in $G$. In contrast to the unweighted setting, we show\nthat a node-weighted decision variant of this problem is \\texttt{strongly\nNP-complete} even without capacity constraints. Furthermore, we provide an\nextensive comparison to the problem of minimizing the minimum indegree\nsatisfying node capacity constraints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
