{"id":"2408.05403","title":"The trouble with pilot-wave theory: a critical evaluation","authors":"Antony Valentini","authorsParsed":[["Valentini","Antony",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 10 Aug 2024 01:45:59 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-13","timestamp":1723254359000,"abstract":"  Objections to pilot-wave theory frequently come in three\nmutually-contradictory categories: that the theory is too bizarrely different\nfrom ordinary physics, that the theory is not radically different enough, and\nthat the physics of pilot-wave theory is after all just the same as quantum\nphysics. After a brief review of pilot-wave theory, we critically evaluate\nthese objections. We show how the radical nature of pilot-wave theory is often\nmisunderstood or overlooked. We highlight the novelty of its dynamics, and\nclarify its implications for our understanding of measurement, as well as\ndiscussing the status of Lorentz invariance, conservation laws, and the Born\nrule. We examine Einstein's early work on pilot-wave theory and argue that he\nturned away from it for reasons which are no longer compelling. We urge that\nthe theory be understood on its own terms, as a generalised nonequilibrium\ntheory empirically distinct from quantum mechanics, with all its potentially\nrevolutionary implications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
