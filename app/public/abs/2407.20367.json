We show that arbitrary\nregularizations preserve the favorable local convergence properties of the\nmethod, and construct a special type of regularization used to prevent\nconvergence to complex minima. We compare several variants of the method\napplied to training neural networks with real and complex parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
