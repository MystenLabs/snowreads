Plenty of different devices have been proposed as a platform\nto observe the superconducting diode effect. In this work we discuss the\npossibility of a highly efficient superconducting diode design with\ncontrollable polarity. We propose the mesoscopic device that consists of two\nseparated superconducting islands with proximity induced ferromagnetism\ndeposited on top of the three-dimensional topological insulator. Using the\nquasiclassical formalism of the Usadel equations we demonstrate that the sign\nof the diode efficiency can be controlled by magnetization tuning of a single\nsuperconducting island. Moreover, we show that the diode efficiency can be\nsubstantially increased in such device. We argue that the dramatic increase of\nthe diode efficiency is due to competing contribution of the two\nsuperconducting islands to the supercurrent with single helical bands linked\nthrough the topological insulator surface.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
