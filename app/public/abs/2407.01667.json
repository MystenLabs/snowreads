With respect to standard\nthermal leptogenesis, our mechanism lowers by two orders of magnitude the RHN\nmass, or the tuning in the RHN mass splittings, needed to reproduce the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe and neutrino masses. We find that ALP leptogenesis\nrequires $m_a > 10^{4}$ GeV and $f_a > 10^{11}$ GeV for the ALP mass and decay\nconstant, and predicts an early period of matter domination induced by the ALP\nin parts of its parameter space. We finally provide a viable supersymmetric\nrealisation of ALP leptogenesis where the ALP is the $R$-axion, which\naccommodates GeV gravitino dark matter and predicts RHN below 10 TeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
