Traditional image\ncompression methods, while reducing bandwidth, often degrade image quality.\nThis paper explores a novel approach using generative AI to reconstruct images\nat the edge or client-side. We develop a framework that leverages text prompts\nand provides additional conditioning inputs like Canny edges and color palettes\nto a text-to-image model, achieving up to 99.8% bandwidth savings in the best\ncases and 92.6% on average, while maintaining high perceptual similarity.\nEmpirical analysis and a user study show that our method preserves image\nmeaning and structure more effectively than traditional compression methods,\noffering a promising solution for reducing bandwidth usage and improving\nInternet affordability with minimal degradation in image quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
