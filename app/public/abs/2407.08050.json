Therefore, we\ndevelop a method to acquire a sensor state equation of the musculoskeletal hand\nusing a recurrent neural network with parametric bias. By using this network,\nthe hand can realize recognition of the grasped object, contact simulation,\ndetection, and control, and can cope with deterioration over time,\nirreproducibility of initialization, etc. by updating parametric bias. We apply\nthis study to the hand of the musculoskeletal humanoid Musashi and show its\neffectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
