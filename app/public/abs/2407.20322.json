These data enable more robust spectral characterization compared to\nlower-resolution spectra from the discovery paper and more than double the\navailable astrometric and radial-velocity baseline. HD 33632 Ab's spectrum is\nwell reproduced by a field L8.5--L9.5 dwarf. Using the Exo-REM atmosphere\nmodels, we derive a best-fit temperature, surface gravity and radius of $T_{\\rm\neff}$ = 1250 $K$, log(g) = 5, and $R$ = 0.97 $R_{\\rm J}$ and a solar C/O ratio.\nAdding the SOPHIE radial-velocity data enables far tighter constraints on the\ncompanion's orbital properties (e.g. $i$=${46.6}_{-5.7}^{+2.9}$$^{o}$) and\ndynamical mass (${51.7}_{-2.5}^{+2.6}$$M_{\\rm J}$) than derived from imaging\ndata and \\textit{Gaia} eDR3 astrometry data alone. HD 33632 Ab should be a\nprime target for multi-band imaging and spectroscopy with the James Webb Space\nTelescope and the Roman Space Telescope's Coronagraphic Instrument, shedding\ndetailed light on HD 33632 Ab's clouds and chemistry and providing a key\nreference point for understanding young exoplanet atmospheres.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
