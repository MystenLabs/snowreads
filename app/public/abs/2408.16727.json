The key\ningredient in our discussion is the homotopy algebraic perspective on\nperturbative quantum field theory. Using this technology, we show that both\ntheories are semi-classically equivalent, that is, we construct a\nquasi-isomorphism between the cyclic $L_\\infty$-algebras governing both field\ntheories. This confirms a conjecture from the literature. Furthermore, we also\nshow that the Yang-Mills action is obtained by integrating out an infinite\ntower of auxiliary fields in the Chern-Simons action, that is, the two theories\nare related by homotopy transfer. Given its simplicity, this Chern-Simons\naction should form a fruitful starting point for analysing perturbative\nproperties of Yang-Mills theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
