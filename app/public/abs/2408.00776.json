State-of-the-art\nconstrained nonlinear model predictive controllers (NMPC) generate whole-body\ntrajectories for a given contact sequence. However, these approaches are\ncomputationally expensive at run-time. Hence it is desirable to offload some of\nthis computation to an offline phase. In this paper, we hypothesize that\nconditioning a learned policy on the locations and timings of contact is a\nsuitable representation for learning a single policy that can generate multiple\ngaits (contact sequences). In this way, we can build a single generalist policy\nto realize different gaited and non-gaited locomotion skills and the\ntransitions among them. Our extensive simulation results demonstrate the\nvalidity of our hypothesis for learning multiple gaits for a biped robot.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
