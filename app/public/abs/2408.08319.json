The LASSO algorithm, based on $\\lone$ regularization, provides an\nefficient and robust to address this problem, but it fails in the regime of\nvery high compression rate. Here we present two algorithms based on\n$\\lzero$-norm regularization instead that outperform the LASSO in terms of\ncompression rate in the Gaussian design setting for measurement matrix. These\nalgorithms are based on the Approximate Survey Propagation, an algorithmic\nfamily within the Approximate Message Passing class. In the large system limit,\nthey can be rigorously tracked through State Evolution equations and it is\npossible to exactly predict the range compression rates for which perfect\nsignal reconstruction is possible. We also provide a statistical physics\nanalysis of the $\\lzero$-norm noiseless compressive sensing model. We show the\nexistence of both a replica symmetric state and a 1-step replica symmmetry\nbroken (1RSB) state for sufficiently low $\\lzero$-norm regularization. The\nrecovery limits of our algorithms are linked to the behavior of the 1RSB\nsolution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
