The proof was quite complicated and required\nhigh smoothness. Here we present a direct simple proof of this result which\nworks in $C^1$-smoothness. In addition we prove the semi-local and local\nversions of the result\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
