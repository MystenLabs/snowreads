Our approach integrates\nlight intrinsic decomposition into the Gaussian splatting framework, enabling\nreal-time relighting of 3D objects. To unify surface and volumetric material\nwithin a cohesive appearance model, we adopt a light- and view-dependent\nscattering representation via bidirectional spherical harmonics. Our model does\nnot use a specific surface normal-related reflectance function, making it more\ncompatible with volumetric representations like Gaussian splatting, where the\nnormals are undefined. We demonstrate our method by reconstructing and\nrendering objects with complex materials. Using One-Light-At-a-Time (OLAT) data\nas input, we can reproduce photorealistic appearances under novel lighting\nconditions in real time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mdKPEVADCA-iqwM_8Fphja7k-EJo_4th8uJQ0q4xnIg","pdfSize":"2579889"}
