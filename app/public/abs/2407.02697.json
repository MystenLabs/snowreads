There are many wearable devices\navailable to track different health data. However, tracking pain is mostly done\nby using pen and paper or mobile apps. In collaboration with a healthcare\nprofessional we designed a portable pain tracker, PainBit. To gain an\nunderstanding of patients' perspectives on our tracker, we conducted two case\nstudies with patients living with chronic pain. We asked patients to use\nPainBit for two weeks and later conducted semi-structured interviews with them.\nPatients found PainBit useful for tracking their pain and they preferred using\na physical device, PainBit, to track their pain over using a mobile phone.\nPatients suggested reducing the size and weight of PainBit in the next\niterations. We report on the lessons learnt through our design process and the\nevaluation studies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aguS7X7dzzqoraIzNDNtMuLKfu1RBOFYeFPD3rP-0Pc","pdfSize":"968431","objectId":"0x1e7a5f6e30f215afb1836da8ac290af11fb9df3cfec26fc5e1737e5f59db4c53","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
