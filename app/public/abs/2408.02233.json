Existing methods primarily employ diverse neural network structures\nfor modeling case descriptions directly, failing to effectively leverage\nmulti-source external knowledge. We propose a prompt learning framework-based\nmethod that simultaneously leverages multi-source heterogeneous external\nknowledge from a legal knowledge base, a conversational LLM, and related legal\narticles. Specifically, we match knowledge snippets in case descriptions via\nthe legal knowledge base and encapsulate them into the input through a hard\nprompt template. Additionally, we retrieve legal articles related to a given\ncase description through contrastive learning, and then obtain factual elements\nwithin the case description through a conversational LLM. We fuse the embedding\nvectors of soft prompt tokens with the encoding vector of factual elements to\nachieve knowledge-enhanced model forward inference. Experimental results show\nthat our method achieved state-of-the-art results on CAIL-2018, the largest\nlegal charge prediction dataset, and our method has lower data dependency. Case\nstudies also demonstrate our method's strong interpretability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KbsK6kzBwjXuEqfi44hfLCdirtC1nfZ2XZDeH8nRhZ4","pdfSize":"1133708"}
