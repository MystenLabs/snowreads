It has been applied to a wide range of fields including\neducation, sport, psychological diagnosis, etc. By providing better awareness\nof cognitive status, it can serve as the basis for personalized services such\nas well-designed medical treatment, teaching strategy and vocational training.\nThis paper aims to provide a survey of current models for cognitive diagnosis,\nwith more attention on new developments using machine learning-based methods.\nBy comparing the model structures, parameter estimation algorithms, model\nevaluation methods and applications, we provide a relatively comprehensive\nreview of the recent trends in cognitive diagnosis models. Further, we discuss\nfuture directions that are worthy of exploration. In addition, we release two\nPython libraries: EduData for easy access to some relevant public datasets we\nhave collected, and EduCDM that implements popular CDMs to facilitate both\napplications and research purposes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
