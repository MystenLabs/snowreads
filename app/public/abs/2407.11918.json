Regulators from the US,\nUK, and Europe have argued that it is based on the assumption that Google\nSearch dominates the market for horizontal (a.k.a. \"general\") web search.\nGoogle disputes this, claiming that competition extends to all vertical (a.k.a.\n\"specialized\") search engines, and that under this market definition it does\nnot have monopoly power. In this study we present the first analysis of Google\nSearch's market share under both horizontal and vertical segmentation of online\nsearch. We leverage observational trace data collected from a panel of US\nresidents that includes their web browsing history and copies of the Google\nSearch Engine Result Pages they were shown. We observe that Google Search\nreceives 71.8% of participants' queries when compared to other horizontal\nsearch engines, and that participants' search sessions begin at Google greater\nthan 50% of the time in 24 out of 30 vertical market segments (which comprise\nalmost all of our participants' searches). Our results inform the consequential\nand ongoing debates about the market power of Google Search and the\nconceptualization of online markets in general.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
