Among these bound-state\nsolutions are ground states, which are defined as solutions of a variational\nproblem. We give a sufficient condition for existence and orbital stability of\nground states, and use it to verify that ground states exist and are stable\nover a wider range of nonlinearities than for the nonregularized nonlinear\nSchr\\\"odinger equation. We also give another sufficient and almost necessary\ncondition for stability of general bound states, and show that some stable\nbound states exist which are not ground states.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
