ALL constitutes approximately 25% of pediatric cancers.\nEarly diagnosis and treatment of ALL are crucial for improving patient\noutcomes. The task of identifying immature leukemic blasts from normal cells\nunder the microscope can prove challenging, since the images of a healthy and\ncancerous cell appear similar morphologically. In this study, we propose a\nbinary image classification model to assist in the diagnostic process of ALL.\nOur model takes as input microscopic images of blood samples and outputs a\nbinary prediction of whether the sample is normal or cancerous. Our dataset\nconsists of 10661 images out of 118 subjects. Deep learning techniques on\nconvolutional neural network architectures were used to achieve accurate\nclassification results. Our proposed method achieved 94.3% accuracy and could\nbe used as an assisting tool for hematologists trying to predict the likelihood\nof a patient developing ALL.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
