This phenomenon can be explained by considering the accretion of dark\nenergy, which is responsible for cosmological expansion, into these black\nholes. In this paper, we investigate the perturbative interaction of a black\nhole with a real scalar field $\\phi$ (which can represent dark energy) in a\ncosmological background using an appropriate metric. We derive solutions for\nthe field $\\phi(t, r)$, the black hole mass $M(t)$, and the expansion rate\n$H(t)$, and discuss the behaviour of the scalar field $\\phi$ in the vicinity of\nthe black hole, with respect to exterior and interior observers. We obtain the\nenergy density of $\\phi$ inside of the black hole and find that energy density\nconverges and tends to take a non-vanishing fixed values (stable) at late time\nof cosmological expansion. We find that on horizon surfaces, it is possible to\nmake the field $\\phi$ continuous and bounded (maybe differentiable) function.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
