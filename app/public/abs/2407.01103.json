Its inference model faces poor generalization issue due to inter-city\ndomain-shift. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) offers a potential solution\nfor improving TriSU model generalization, but suffers from slow convergence\nrate because of vehicles' surrounding heterogeneity across cities. Going beyond\nexisting HFL works that have deficient capabilities in complex tasks, we\npropose a rapid-converged heterogeneous HFL framework (FedRC) to address the\ninter-city data heterogeneity and accelerate HFL model convergence rate. In our\nproposed FedRC framework, both single RGB image and RGB dataset are modelled as\nGaussian distributions in HFL aggregation weight design. This approach not only\ndifferentiates each RGB sample instead of typically equalizing them, but also\nconsiders both data volume and statistical properties rather than simply taking\ndata quantity into consideration. Extensive experiments on the TriSU task using\nacross-city datasets demonstrate that FedRC converges faster than the\nstate-of-the-art benchmark by 38.7%, 37.5%, 35.5%, and 40.6% in terms of mIoU,\nmPrecision, mRecall, and mF1, respectively. Furthermore, qualitative\nevaluations in the CARLA simulation environment confirm that the proposed FedRC\nframework delivers top-tier performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
