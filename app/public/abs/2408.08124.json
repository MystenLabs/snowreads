The simulation demonstrates that the\nself-packaged microcavity can effectively mitigate the potential impact of\nconventional field emission transistors on surrounding solid-state circuits,\nthereby improving the frequency performance and stability of the device. The\nproposed design exhibits a cutoff frequency at the sub-terahertz level.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
