At different values of exposed frequency, the absorbent nature\nvaries in human body. One of the major factors to be taken into consideration\nfor designing 6G mobile antenna is the biological effect and Electromagnetic\nField Exposure (EMF).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
