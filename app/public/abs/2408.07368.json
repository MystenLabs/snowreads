Specifically, the organizer might want to maximize utilitarian\nsocial welfare, maximize egalitarian social welfare, or simply guarantee that\nevery agent will have at least one friend within his coalition. However, in\nmany situations, the organizer is not familiar with the friendship connections,\nand he needs to obtain them from the agents. In this setting, a manipulative\nagent may falsely report friendship connections in order to increase his\nutility. In this paper, we analyze the complexity of finding manipulation in\nsuch $k$-coalitional games on graphs. We also introduce a new type of\nmanipulation, socially-aware manipulation, in which the manipulator would like\nto increase his utility without decreasing the social welfare. We then study\nthe complexity of finding socially-aware manipulation in our setting. Finally,\nwe examine the frequency of socially-aware manipulation and the running time of\nour algorithms via simulation results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
