Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) has demonstrated remarkable proficiency in tasks such as motor control,\nhandling perceptual input, and managing stochastic environments. These\nadvancements have been enabled in part by the availability of benchmarks. In\nthis work we introduce PUZZLES, a benchmark based on Simon Tatham's Portable\nPuzzle Collection, aimed at fostering progress in algorithmic and logical\nreasoning in RL. PUZZLES contains 40 diverse logic puzzles of adjustable sizes\nand varying levels of complexity; many puzzles also feature a diverse set of\nadditional configuration parameters. The 40 puzzles provide detailed\ninformation on the strengths and generalization capabilities of RL agents.\nFurthermore, we evaluate various RL algorithms on PUZZLES, providing baseline\ncomparisons and demonstrating the potential for future research.
