This whitepaper\nexplores how to address possible harmful consequences of computing technologies\nthat might be difficult to anticipate, and thereby mitigate or address. It\nstarts from the assumption that very few harms due to technology are\nintentional or deliberate; rather, the vast majority result from failure to\nrecognize and respond to them prior to deployment. Nonetheless, there are\nconcrete steps that can be taken to address the difficult problem of\nanticipating and responding to potential harms from new technologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
