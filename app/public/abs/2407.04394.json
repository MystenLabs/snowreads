Nonetheless, even in this\nsimple model system, the complex thermodynamics of crystal nuclei can sometimes\ngive rise to counterintuitive results, such as the recent observation that the\npressure inside a critical nucleus is lower than that of the surrounding fluid,\nseemingly clashing with the strictly positive Young--Laplace pressure we would\nexpect in liquid droplets. Here, we re-derive many of the founding equations\nassociated with crystal nucleation, and use the hard-sphere model to\ndemonstrate how they give rise to this negative pressure difference. We exploit\nthe fact that, in the canonical ensemble, a nucleus can be in a (meta)stable\nequilibrium with the fluid, and measure the surface stress for both flat and\ncurved interfaces. Additionally, we explain the effect of defects on the\nchemical potential inside the crystal nucleus. Lastly, we present a simple,\nfitted thermodynamic model to capture the properties of the nucleus, including\nthe work required to form critical nuclei.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
