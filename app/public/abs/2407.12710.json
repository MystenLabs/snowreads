In this paradigm, we permit the\nsystem to defer a subset of its tasks to the expert. Although there are\ncurrently systems that follow this paradigm and are designed to optimize the\naccuracy of the final human-AI team, the general methodology for developing\nsuch systems under a set of constraints (e.g., algorithmic fairness, expert\nintervention budget, defer of anomaly, etc.) remains largely unexplored. In\nthis paper, using a $d$-dimensional generalization to the fundamental lemma of\nNeyman and Pearson (d-GNP), we obtain the Bayes optimal solution for\nlearn-to-defer systems under various constraints. Furthermore, we design a\ngeneralizable algorithm to estimate that solution and apply this algorithm to\nthe COMPAS and ACSIncome datasets. Our algorithm shows improvements in terms of\nconstraint violation over a set of baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
