A prominent example is the Iterated Fission Probability method,\nwhich relies on the simulation of the fission chains descending from an\nancestor neutron: the neutron population at an asymptotic fission generation\nyields an estimate of the importance function (and hence of the adjoint\nfundamental eigenmode) at the phase-space coordinates of the ancestor neutron.\nIn this paper we first establish rigorous results concerning the moments of the\nasymptotic neutron population stemming from a single initial particle, with\nspecial focus on the average and the variance. Then, we propose a simple\nbenchmark configuration where exact solutions are derived for these moments,\nwhich can be used for the verification of new functionalities of production\nMonte Carlo codes involving the Iterated Fission Probability method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ayf_mdNn0vsWvhEZXp7WYXFXlWNAHuJR_IZrwD2D364","pdfSize":"691258"}
