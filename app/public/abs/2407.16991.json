The momentum dependence of nucleon optical\npotential (OP) in NM at the saturation density $\\rho_0$ is shown to be due\nmainly to its exchange term up to $k\\approx 2$ fm$^{-1}$, so that the Pauli\nnonlocality is expected to be the main origin of the nucleon effective mass at\nlow momenta. Because nucleons in neutron-rich NM at $\\rho\\approx \\rho_0$ are\neither weakly bound or unbound by the in-medium nucleon-nucleon interaction,\nthe determination of the effective mass of nucleon scattered on targets with\nneutron excess at low energies should be of interest for the mean-field studies\nof neutron star matter. For this purpose, the folding model is used to\ncalculate the nonlocal nucleon OP for the optical model analysis of elastic\nnucleon scattering on $^{40,48}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr, and $^{208}$Pb targets at\nenergies $E<50$ MeV, to probe the model reliability and validate the WKB local\napproximation to obtain the local folded nucleon OP. The nucleon effective mass\n$m^*$ is then carefully deduced from the momentum dependence of the local\nfolded nucleon OP which is resulted from the Pauli nonlocality of the exchange\nterm. The neutron-proton effective mass splitting determined at\n$\\rho\\approx\\rho_0$ from the central strength of the real folded nucleon OP for\n$^{48}$Ca, $^{90}$Zr, and $^{208}$Pb targets has been found to depend linearly\non the neutron-proton asymmetry parameter as $m^*_{n-p}\\approx (0.167\\pm\n0.018)\\delta$, in a good agreement with the recent empirical constraints.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
