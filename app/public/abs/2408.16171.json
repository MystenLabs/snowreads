To mitigate this\nnoise, a static system is employed that minimizes the quantum noise within the\nmeasurement band. However, since gravitational wave inspiral signals are a\nsingle frequency changing over time, only noise at the chirp frequency needs to\nbe minimized. Here we demonstrate dynamically tracking a target signal using an\noptical spring, resulting in an increased signal to noise ratio (SNR). We\nreport on a SNR increase by up to a factor of 40 when compared to a static\nconfiguration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LTcrU4_a2KgeCWu4Vdx-NqQuFTL63h7z9a9cXTFViGk","pdfSize":"1879628"}
