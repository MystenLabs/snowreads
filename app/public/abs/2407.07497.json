{"id":"2407.07497","title":"Quantum Technology masters: A shortcut to the quantum industry?","authors":"Simon Goorney, Borja Munoz, Jacob Sherson","authorsParsed":[["Goorney","Simon",""],["Munoz","Borja",""],["Sherson","Jacob",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 10 Jul 2024 09:32:12 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 12:27:04 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-16","timestamp":1720603932000,"abstract":"  In this article, we investigate a growing trend in the worldwide Quantum\nTechnology (QT) education landscape, that of the development of masters\nprograms, intended to provide graduates with the knowledge and skills to take a\njob in the quantum industry, while serving a much shorter timeline than a\ndoctoral degree. Through a global survey, we identified 86 masters programs,\nwith substantial growth since 2021. Over time masters have become increasingly\ninterdisciplinary, organised by multiple faculties or through joint degree\nprograms, and offer more hands-on experiences such as internships in companies.\nInformation from program organisers and websites suggests that the intended\ncareer destinations of their graduates are a diverse range of industries, and\ntherefore masters programs may be a boon to the industrialisation of quantum\ntechnologies. Finally, we identify a range of national efforts to grow the\nquantum workforce of many countries, quantum program enhancements, which\naugment the content of existing study programs with quantum content. This may\nfurther contribute to the growth and viability of masters programs as a route\nto the quantum industry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
