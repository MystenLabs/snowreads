We introduce Terracorder -- a\nversatile multi-sensor device -- and showcase its exceptionally low power\nconsumption using an on-device reinforcement learning scheduler. We prototype a\nunique device setup for biodiversity monitoring and compare its battery life\nusing our scheduler against a number of fixed schedules; the scheduler captures\nmore than 80% of events at less than 50% of the number of activations of the\nbest-performing fixed schedule. We then explore how a collaborative scheduler\ncan maximise the useful operation of a network of devices, improving overall\nnetwork power consumption and robustness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yI-w9bOJYErbY0XRLSRDuY-53-XRP3KYHJ7ITtzevjE","pdfSize":"2076500"}
