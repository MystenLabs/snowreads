This process could be partially automatized to facilitate\nthe educator's role. Nevertheless, the decisions performed by prevalent\ndeep-learning models are hardly understandable, which may impair the acceptance\nof such a technology in music education curricula. Our work employs explainable\ndescriptors for difficulty estimation in symbolic music representations.\nFurthermore, through a novel parameter-efficient white-box model, we outperform\nprevious efforts while delivering interpretable results. These comprehensible\noutcomes emulate the functionality of a rubric, a tool widely used in music\neducation. Our approach, evaluated in piano repertoire categorized in 9\nclasses, achieved 41.4% accuracy independently, with a mean squared error (MSE)\nof 1.7, showing precise difficulty estimation. Through our baseline, we\nillustrate how building on top of past research can offer alternatives for\nmusic difficulty assessment which are explainable and interpretable. With this,\nwe aim to promote a more effective communication between the Music Information\nRetrieval (MIR) community and the music education one.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Zu0zEuVpocWA5LA7c0tgbcmKNGHUd4iFKJZdM0YQIj8","pdfSize":"690463","txDigest":"DHxWuW2fwq1CcdtP9QJPTFVUP2Cw6RpM1d5QYv7W35Vc","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
