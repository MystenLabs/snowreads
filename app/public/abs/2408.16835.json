Thus, appropriate\nmodelling of devices to ensure that their operations are consistent with the\nmodels assumed in the security proof is imperative. In this paper, we explore\nthe Trojan horse attack (THA) using Measurement Device Independent (MDI) QKD\nintegrated photonic chips and how to avoid some of the security vulnerabilities\nusing only on-chip components. We show that a monitor photodiode paired\nappropriately with enough optical isolation, given the sensitivity of the\nphotodiode, can detect high power sniffing attacks. We also show that the\nplacement of amplitude modulators with respect to back reflecting components\nand their switching time can be used to thwart a THA.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
