Nonetheless, most existing approaches\nfail to account for the dynamic nature of databases, which renders them\nineffective for real-world applications characterized by evolving data and\nworkloads. This paper introduces NeurDB, an AI-powered autonomous database that\ndeepens the fusion of AI and databases with adaptability to data and workload\ndrift. NeurDB establishes a new in-database AI ecosystem that seamlessly\nintegrates AI workflows within the database. This integration enables efficient\nand effective in-database AI analytics and fast-adaptive learned system\ncomponents. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that NeurDB substantially\noutperforms existing solutions in managing AI analytics tasks, with the\nproposed learned components more effectively handling environmental dynamism\nthan state-of-the-art approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
