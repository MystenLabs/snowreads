By introducing a governing\nequation for the auxiliary variable through the ionic concentration equations,\nwe reconstruct the original equations into an equivalent system and develop a\nfirst-order decoupled and linearized scheme. This scheme preserves\nnon-negativity and mass conservation of the concentration components and is\nunconditionally energy stable. We derive the rigorous error estimates in the\ntwo dimensional case for the ionic concentrations, electric potential, velocity\nand pressure in the $L^2$- and $H^1$-norms. Numerical examples are presented to\nvalidate the proposed scheme.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8iOxrvsEEs61l1upTG7yVP-i-TD65y-L_7Mza9LH4Og","pdfSize":"619655"}
