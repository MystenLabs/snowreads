Its numerical simulation is plagued by a high\ncomputational cost due to the size of the typical computational domain and the\nneed for high resolution to capture the full spectrum of turbulent scales. In\nthis paper, we present a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) for the 2QGE\nthat drastically reduces the computational time to predict ocean dynamics,\nespecially when there are variable physical parameters. The main building\nblocks of our ROM are: i) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and ii) long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. Snapshots data are\ncollected from a high-resolution simulation for part of the time interval of\ninterest and for given parameter values in the case of variable parameters. POD\nis applied to each field variable to extract the dominant modes and a LSTM\nmodel is trained on the modal coefficients associated with the snapshots for\neach variable. Then, the trained LSTM models predict the modal coefficients for\nthe remaining part of the time interval of interest and for a new parameter\nvalue. To illustrate the predictive performance of our POD-LSTM ROM and the\ncorresponding time savings, we consider an extension of the so-called\ndouble-gyre wind forcing test. We show that the POD-LSTM ROM is accurate in\npredicting both time-averaged fields and time-dependent quantities (modal\ncoefficients, enstrophy, and kinetic energy), even when retaining only 10-20\\%\nof the singular value energy of the system. The computational speed up for the\nprediction is about up to 1E+07 compared to a finite volume based full order\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
