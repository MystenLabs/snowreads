Based on lessons learned in the mathematical\ncontext defined by the Andrews-Curtis conjecture, we propose algorithmic\nimprovements that can be relevant in other domains with ultra-sparse reward\nproblems. Although our case study can be formulated as a game, its shortest\nwinning sequences are potentially $10^6$ or $10^9$ times longer than those\nencountered in chess. In the process of our study, we demonstrate that one of\nthe potential counterexamples due to Akbulut and Kirby, whose status escaped\ndirect mathematical methods for 39 years, is stably AC-trivial.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
