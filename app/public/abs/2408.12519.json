However, measuring, and simulating protein dynamics is\nchallenging and time-consuming. While machine learning holds promise in\ndeciphering the determinants of protein dynamics from structural information,\nmost existing methods for protein representation learning operate at the\nresidue level, ignoring the finer details of atomic interactions. In this work,\nwe propose for the first time to use graph neural networks (GNNs) to learn\nprotein representations at the atomic level and predict B-factors from protein\n3D structures. The B-factor reflects the atomic displacement of atoms in\nproteins, and can serve as a surrogate for protein flexibility. We compared\ndifferent GNN architectures to assess their performance. The Meta-GNN model\nachieves a correlation coefficient of 0.71 on a large and diverse test set of\nover 4k proteins (17M atoms) from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), outperforming\nprevious methods by a large margin. Our work demonstrates the potential of\nrepresentations learned by GNNs for protein flexibility prediction and other\nrelated tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
