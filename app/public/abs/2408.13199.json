Here we report on the\npolarimetric analysis of the bright GRB 180720B using the \\Fermi Gamma-ray\nBurst Monitor (GBM). We rely on the detection of photons that scattered off\nEarth's atmosphere and into GBM from this burst. Polarized gamma-rays will\nexhibit a characteristic pattern when scattering off the atmosphere that\ndiffers from an unpolarized beam. We compare the measured photon counts in the\nGBM detectors with extensive simulations of polarized beams to derive the most\nprobable polarization degree (PD) and angle (PA). For the entire GRB, we find\nPD$=72^{+24}_{-30}\\% ~(1\\sigma)$ and PA$=91^{+11}_{-9}$ deg ($1\\sigma$,\nequatorial frame). Interestingly, the PA value is broadly consistent with an\nearly optical PA measurement by the Kanata telescope, starting shortly after\nthe end of the prompt emission. The consistency of PAs lends support for this\nmethod. The relatively high polarization degree (albeit with large\nuncertainties) agrees with similar past measurements suggesting that some GRBs\nmight be highly polarized. This will be confirmed or refuted by the upcoming\ndedicated GRB polarimeters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
