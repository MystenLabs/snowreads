Although the\nGrover algorithm can accelerate search speeds, current research indicates that\nthe Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) method can still enhance security by\nincreasing the length of the secret key. However, the AES method involves\nmultiple modes in implementation, and not all modes are secure. Therefore, this\nstudy proposes a normalized Gini impurity (NGI) to verify the security of each\nmode, using encrypted images as a case study for empirical analysis.\nFurthermore, this study primarily compares the Electronic Codebook (ECB) mode,\nCipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode, Counter (CTR) mode, Counter with CBC-Message\nAuthentication Code (MAC) (CCM) mode, and Galois Counter Mode (GCM).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
