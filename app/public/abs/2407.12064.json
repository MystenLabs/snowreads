In this work, we propose a unified\nframework - LiteGPT - for the medical imaging. We leverage multiple pre-trained\nvisual encoders to enrich information and enhance the performance of\nvision-language models. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study\nto utilize vision-language models for the novel task of joint localization and\nclassification in medical images. Besides, we are pioneers in providing\nbaselines for disease localization in chest X-rays. Finally, we set new\nstate-of-the-art performance in the image classification task on the\nwell-benchmarked VinDr-CXR dataset.
