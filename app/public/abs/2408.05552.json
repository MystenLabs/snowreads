In the main theorem it\nis shown that the multiple cohomology of that complexes is given by the factor\nspace of products of reduction operators. In particular, we compute explicit\ntorsor structure of the genus $g$ multiple cohomology of the families of\nhorizontal complexes with spaces of of canonical converging reductive\ndifferential forms for a $C_2$-cofinite quasiconformal strong-conformal field\ntheory-type vertex operator algebra associated to a complex curve. That\nprovides an equivalence of multiple cohomology to factor spaces of products of\nsums of reduction functions with actions of the group of local coordinates\nautomorphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
