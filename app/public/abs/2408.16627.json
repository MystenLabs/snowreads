As such, it plays a crucial role in\nunderstanding the mysterious nature of quantum physics represented by\nSchr\\\"odinger's cat, for example. Quantum decoherence is also a source of\nquantum noise that has to be well under control in quantum computing and in\nvarious experiments based on quantum technologies. Here we point out that\nquantum decoherence can be captured by $\\textit{complex}$ saddle points in the\nFeynman path integral in much the same way as quantum tunneling can be captured\nby instantons. In particular, we present some first-principle calculations in\nthe Caldeira-Leggett model, which reproduce the predicted scaling behavior of\nquantum decoherence with respect to the parameters of the environment such as\nthe temperature and the coupling to the system of interest. We also discuss how\nto extend our work to general models by Monte Carlo calculations using a\nrecently developed method to overcome the sign problem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7ifo8_KtQKBCat8EQyTl8FjpirS6YKlYfvZ6b3l4zVQ","pdfSize":"516298"}
