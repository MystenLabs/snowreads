Although existing safety analytics\nstudies have made remarkable progress, they suffer from imbalanced datasets, a\ncommon problem in safety analytics, resulting in prediction inaccuracies. This\ncan lead to management problems, e.g., incorrect resource allocation and\nimproper interventions. To overcome the imbalanced data problem, we extend the\ntheory of accident triangle to claim that the importance of data samples should\nbe based on characteristics such as injury severity, accident frequency, and\naccident type. Thus, three oversampling methods are proposed based on assigning\ndifferent weights to samples in the minority class. We find robust improvements\namong different machine learning algorithms. For the lack of open-source safety\ndatasets, we are sharing three imbalanced datasets, e.g., a 9-year nationwide\nconstruction accident record dataset, and their corresponding codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R4Dck4aEpNSQjt8hCKPaXDqIp6lkSMcZJ95_8Ft2Ah4","pdfSize":"1857844"}
