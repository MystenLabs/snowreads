Utilizing a novel combination of Graph Neural Networks\naugmented with an extensible Knowledge Graph, this Recommender System is\noperational in production, delivering personalized and context-aware nudges to\nover 1.1 million care recipients daily. This enterprise deployment marks one of\nthe largest AI-driven health behavior change initiatives, accommodating diverse\nhealth conditions and wearable devices. Rigorous evaluation reveals\nstatistically significant improvements in health outcomes, including a 6.17%\nincrease in daily steps and 7.61% more exercise minutes. Moreover, user\nengagement and program enrollment surged, with a 13.1% open rate compared to\nbaseline systems' 4%. Demonstrating scalability and reliability, NudgeRank\noperates efficiently on commodity compute resources while maintaining\nautomation and observability standards essential for production systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
