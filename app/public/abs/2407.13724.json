We investigate the controlled generation\nand manipulation of excitons and their complexes in monolayer (1L) MoSe2-WSe2\nlateral heterostructure (LHS), directly grown via water-assisted chemical vapor\ndeposition. Using a field-effect transistor design by incorporating a few-layer\ngraphene back gate, single-layer graphene edge contact and encapsulation with\nfew-layer hexagonal boron nitride, we achieve precise electrical tuning of\nexciton complexes and their transfer across 1D interfaces. At cryogenic\ntemperatures (4 K), photoluminescence and photocurrent maps reveal the\nsynergistic effect of local electric field and interface phenomena in the\nmodulation of excitons, trions, and free carriers. We observe spatial\nvariations in exciton and trion densities driven by exciton-trion conversion\nunder electrical manipulation. The first-principle density functional theory\ncalculation reveals significant band modification at the lateral interfaces and\ngraphene-TMDs contact region. Furthermore, we demonstrate the versatility of 2D\nTMDS LHS in hosting and manipulating quantum emitters, achieving precise\ncontrol over narrow-band emissions through modulating carrier injection and\nelectrical biasing. This work extends the boundary of the present understanding\nof excitonic behaviour within lateral heterojunctions, highlighting the\npotential for controlled exciton manipulation across 1D interfaces and paving\nthe way for next-generation electro-optical quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9wHo6ktgcp3NjImI5LZHo7h-IlbAsVzucI3AUmDzYIQ","pdfSize":"1927916"}
