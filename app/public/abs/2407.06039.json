We demonstrate how to modify\nthe transformer neural network for applications in physics. Our model achieved\nhigh accuracy in predicting parameters such as VCSEL's eigenenergy, quality\nfactor, and threshold material gain, based on the laser's structure. This model\ntrains faster and predicts more accurately compared to traditional neural\nnetworks. The transformer architecture we propose is also suitable for\napplications in other fields.
