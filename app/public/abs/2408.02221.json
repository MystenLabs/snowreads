Numerous anti-counterfeiting techniques\nhave been proposed, among which the use of inherent, unclonable irregularities\nof paper surfaces has shown considerable potential as a high-performance\neconomical solution. Prior works do not consider supply chains cohesively,\neither focusing on creating or improving unclonable identifiers or on securing\ndigital records of products. This work aims to systematically unify these two\nseparate but connected research areas by comprehensively analyzing the needs of\nsupply chains. We construct a generalized paper-based authentication framework\nand identify important shortcomings and promising ideas in the existing\nliterature. Next, we do a stage-wise security analysis of our consolidated\nframework by drawing inspiration from works in signal processing, cryptography,\nand biometric systems. Finally, we examine key representative scenarios that\nillustrate the range of practical and technical challenges in real-world supply\nchains, and we outline the best practices to guide future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LrYkUMZulVymtXOZnmE-WRF4Z9JGwFQGsQCq9tQf_TI","pdfSize":"21123490","txDigest":"6Jx8xuAKkHj1JRqFPH2pNM7NHSVm2hyCE3SikuPSmcT7","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
