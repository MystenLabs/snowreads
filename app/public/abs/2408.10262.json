Recently, publishers that might previously\nhave been considered `predatory' have established their bona fides, at least to\nthe extent that they are included in citation impact scores such as the\nfield-weighted citation impact (FWCI). These are sometimes called `grey'\npublishers (MDPI, Frontiers, Hindawi). In this paper, we show that the citation\nlandscape for these grey publications is significantly different from the\nmainstream landscape and that affording publications in these venues the same\nstatus as publications in mainstream journals may significantly distort metrics\nsuch as the FWCI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
