The escape fraction shows significant scatter\nbetween galaxies, and anisotropic, spatial variation within them, motivating\nfurther study of the underlying physical factors responsible for these trends.\nWe perform numerical radiation hydrodynamic simulations of idealized clouds\nwith different gas surface densities (compactness) $\\Sigma \\sim 10^2$--$10^5 \\,\nM_{\\odot} \\rm{pc}^{-2}$, meant to emulate star cluster-forming clumps ranging\nfrom conditions typical of the local Universe to the high ISM-pressure\nconditions more frequently encountered at high redshift. Our results indicate\nthat dense compact star clusters with $\\Sigma \\gtrsim 10^4 \\, M_{\\odot}\n\\rm{pc}^{-2}$ efficiently leak LyC photons, with cloud-scale\nluminosity-weighted average escape fractions $\\gtrsim 80\\%$ as opposed to\n$\\lesssim 10\\%$ for $\\Sigma \\sim 100 \\, M_{\\odot} \\rm{pc}^{-2}$. This occurs\ndue to higher star formation efficiencies and shorter dynamical timescales at\nhigher $\\Sigma$; the former results in higher intrinsic LyC emission, and the\nlatter implies rapid evolution, with a burst of star formation followed by\nrapid gas dispersal, permitting high LyC escape well before the intrinsic LyC\nemission of stellar populations drop ($\\sim 4 \\, \\mathrm{Myr}$). LyC escape in\ndense clouds is primarily facilitated by highly ionized outflows driven by\nradiation pressure on dust with velocities $ \\sim 3$ times the cloud escape\nvelocity. We also vary the (assumed) dust abundances ($Z_{\\rm{d}}$) and find a\nvery mild increase ($\\sim 10%$) in the escape fraction for $\\sim 100$ lower\n$Z_{\\mathrm{d}}$. Our results suggest a scenario in which localized compact\nbursts of star formation in galaxies are disproportionately productive sites of\nLyC leakage.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D0Y1GyVPN8EdfOLfdNQGul7yObRNwOmK6XdmDdVKjNo","pdfSize":"3611247"}
