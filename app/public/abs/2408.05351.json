Despite the promises\nof quantum advantage, the applicability of quantum devices has been limited to\nfew qubits on hardware that experiences decoherence due to noise. One proposed\nmethod to get around this challenge is distributed quantum computing (DQC).\nLike classical distributed computing, DQC aims at increasing compute power by\nspreading the compute processes across many devices, with the goal to minimize\nthe noise and circuit depth required by quantum devices. In this paper, we\ncover the fundamental concepts of DQC and provide insight into where the field\nof DQC stands with respect to the field of chemistry -- a field which can\npotentially be used to demonstrate quantum advantage on noisy-intermediate\nscale quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
