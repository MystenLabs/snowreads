However, it is\nunclear how peer reviewers recognize or misjudge AI-augmented manuscripts. To\ninvestigate the impact of AI-augmented writing on peer reviews, we conducted a\nsnippet-based online survey with 17 peer reviewers from top-tier HCI\nconferences. Our findings indicate that while AI-augmented writing improves\nreadability, language diversity, and informativeness, it often lacks research\ndetails and reflective insights from authors. Reviewers consistently struggled\nto distinguish between human and AI-augmented writing but their judgements\nremained consistent. They noted the loss of a \"human touch\" and subjective\nexpressions in AI-augmented writing. Based on our findings, we advocate for\nreviewer guidelines that promote impartial evaluations of submissions,\nregardless of any personal biases towards GenAI. The quality of the research\nitself should remain a priority in reviews, regardless of any preconceived\nnotions about the tools used to create it. We emphasize that researchers must\nmaintain their authorship and control over the writing process, even when using\nGenAI's assistance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GQZba3LXKgfBezvxzSYwX60p4Q7eZNRnO8W6qvWTMNs","pdfSize":"11940515"}
