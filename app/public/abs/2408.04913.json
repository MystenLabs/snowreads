This paper examines recent methods that have\nbeen proposed to embed knowledge bases in description logic into vector spaces\nthrough the lens of their geometric-based semantics. We identify several\nrelevant theoretical properties, which we draw from the literature and\nsometimes generalize or unify. We then investigate how concrete embedding\nmethods fit in this theoretical framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qVNCjZ9AbOSJPthTrv7g7nhE0CHA7RVmkWVeJmWPTro","pdfSize":"680945"}
