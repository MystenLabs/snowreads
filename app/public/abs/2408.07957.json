This method operates on packet group and employs dynamic buffer delay\ncombined with HARQ strategy for transmission. By defining the QoE based on\nmetrics such as buffer delay, Forward Error Correction (FEC) redundancy, and\ndata recovery rate, the proposed method derives its closed-form expression\nthrough rigorous mathematical modeling and analysis. The optimal transmission\nparameters, i.e., the buffer delay and the FEC redundancy, are then determined\nand implemented, guaranteeing the real-time performance, transmission\nefficiency, and data recovery rate of video communication. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that the proposed method aligns well with its theoretical\nexpectations, and that it can provide up to 13.7% higher QoE compared to\nexisting methods and increase the tolerance for packet loss rate from 15%-22%\nto up to 31% while maintaining a high QoE.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
