As a consequence, we improve lower\nbounds for the $L^p$-$L^q$ norm of the corresponding maximal operator for a\nrange of $p$, $q$. Moreover, our construction can be generalised from parabolas\nto a family of curves with cinematic curvature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
