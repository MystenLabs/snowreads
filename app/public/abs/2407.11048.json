The challenge involves detecting transportation modes\nusing shuffled, non-overlapping 5-second windows of phone movement data, with\nexactly one of the three available modalities (accelerometer, gyroscope,\nmagnetometer) randomly missing. Data analysis indicated a significant\ndistribution shift between train and validation data, necessitating a magnitude\nand rotation-invariant approach. We utilize traditional machine learning,\nfocusing on robust processing, feature extraction, and rotation-invariant\naggregation. An ablation study showed that relying solely on the frequently\nused signal magnitude vector results in the poorest performance. Conversely,\nour proposed rotation-invariant aggregation demonstrated substantial\nimprovement over using rotation-aware features, while also reducing the feature\nvector length. Moreover, z-normalization proved crucial for creating robust\nspectral features.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
