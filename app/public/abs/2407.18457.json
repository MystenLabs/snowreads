The RNN-Scaling\nmethod modifies the optimization objective by increasing the weight of boundary\nequations, resulting in a more accurate approximation. We propose the boundary\nprocessing techniques on the rectangular domain that enforce the RNN method to\nsatisfy the non-homogeneous Dirichlet and clamped boundary conditions exactly.\nWe further prove that the RNN-BP method is exact for some solutions with\nspecific forms and validate it numerically. Numerical experiments demonstrate\nthat the RNN-BP method is the most accurate among the three methods, the error\nis reduced by 6 orders of magnitude for some tests.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
