The resulting limit\nrepresentations can be used to obtain the distributions of pathwise functionals\nwith respect to the so-called tail process. For instance, we may recover the\nconvergence of a censored Hill estimator, and we further investigate two\ngoodness-of-fit statistics for the tail of the loss distribution. Using the the\nlatter limit theorems, we propose two rules for selecting a suitable number of\norder statistics, both based on test statistics derived from the functional\nconvergence results. The effectiveness of these selection rules is investigated\nthrough simulations and an application to a real dataset comprised of French\nmotor insurance claim sizes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
