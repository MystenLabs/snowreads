We expand on previous studies by comparing the behavior\nof 1D and 2D simulations (of different polarization) with 3D PIC simulations at\nhigh resolutions across five orders of magnitude of laser intensity, enabling\nus to study multiple regimes of laser-proton acceleration. We find that key\noutput metrics such as maximum proton energy depend on a complex interplay of\nboth simulation dimensionality and laser intensity regime. Differences between\nsimulation predictions generally increase for higher laser intensity regimes,\nmaking 3D simulations especially important for quantitative predictions of\nnext-generation laser experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
