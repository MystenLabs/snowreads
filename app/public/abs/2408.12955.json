We use light curves from the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS),\nwhich observed HO Tel in three sectors, to determine its photometric properties\nand a precise orbital ephemeris. We augment these results with radial velocity\nmeasurements from Surgit et al. to determine the masses and radii of the\ncomponent stars: M_A = 1.906 +/- 0.031 Msun, M_B = 1.751 +/- 0.034 Msun, R_A =\n2.296 +/- 0.027 Rsun and R_B = 2.074 +/- 0.028 Rsun. Combined with temperature\nmeasurements from Surgit et al. and optical-infrared apparent magnitudes from\nthe literature, we find a distance to the system of 280.8 +/- 4.6 pc which\nagrees well with the distance from the Gaia DR3 parallax measurement.\nTheoretical predictions do not quite match the properties of the system, and\nthere are small discrepancies in measurements of the spectroscopic orbits of\nthe stars. Future observations from Gaia will allow further investigation of\nthese issues.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
