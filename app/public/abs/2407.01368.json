From this we deduce that the twisted\ntraces of these harmonic modular functions are integers. Additionally, we\ncompute the twisted traces of Eisenstein series on hyperbolic $3$-space in\nterms of Dirichlet $L$-functions and divisor sums.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
