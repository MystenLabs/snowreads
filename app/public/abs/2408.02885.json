It is aimed at identifying when it is possible to convert a\ngiven coherent state to another using only incoherent operations. In this\npaper, we give a complete characterization of state convertibility under\ngenuinely incoherent operations. It is found that convexity of the robustness\nof coherence plays a central role. Based on this, the majorization condition of\ndetermining convertibility from pure states to mixed states under strictly\nincoherent operations is provided. Moreover, maximally coherent states in the\nset of all states with fixed diagonal elements are determined. It is somewhat\nsurprising that convexity of the robustness of coherence can also decide\nconversion between off-diagonal parts of coherent states. This might be a big\nstep to answer completely the question of state convertibility for mixed states\nunder incoherent operations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dKxHFhur1NtHY8mgJTqjPu1y_lEB1J-eDkzPeBuDq0g","pdfSize":"173335"}
