It is intriguing\nto explore the new detection opportunities that may arise if both particle\ntypes coexist. Part of the authors already investigated this scenario in a\nprevious publication, within a simplified model containing an ALP and a single\nHNL, identifying particularly promising processes that could be searched for at\nthe LHC. In this paper, we first consider the same setup with a broader range\nof both production processes and final states, both at the High-Luminosity LHC\nand at a future muon collider. Subsequently, we expand it to the more realistic\nscenario with at least two HNLs, necessary to describe the active neutrino\nmasses. Different phenomenological signals are expected and we examine the\ncomplexities that emerge in this setup. This study paves the way for dedicated\nanalysis at (forthcoming) colliders, potentially pinpointing the dynamics of\nALPs and HNLs.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
