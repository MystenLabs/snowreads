The constructed operator generalizes Fock's unitary\ntransformation, originally defined between the discrete spectra of the\nattractive Coulomb operator and the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the sphere, to\nthe setting of continuous spectra. Among other connections, this map explains\nwhy the scattering matrices are the same in these two different settings, and\nit also provides an explicit formula for the Poisson operator of the Coulomb\nHamiltonian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
