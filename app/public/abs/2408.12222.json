Although much effort has been made\nto study the (2x1) reconstruction of the most stable (104) surface, the origin\nof this reconstruction remains unclear. Here, we carefully investigate the\natomic and electronic structures of calcite (104) via density functional theory\nmethods with van der Waals corrections. The results unambiguously show that the\ndriving force for this reconstruction is the intrinsic demands of surface atoms\nto increase the coordination numbers. On reconstructing, calcite (104) forms\nfour additional Ca-O bonds per (2x1) unit cell. Besides, phonon spectrums\nindicate both unreconstructed and reconstructed surfaces are dynamically\nstable. Finally, by applying the climbing image nudged elastic band method, an\nenergy barrier is predicted during the reconstructing. This work delivers a\nfull picture for the formation of calcite (104)-(2x1) reconstruction and can\ngreatly advance the understanding of surface science for calcite.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
