Motivated by\nMazur's analogy between prime numbers and knots, we define for every finite kei\n$\\mathcal{K}$ an analogous coloring invariant $\\textrm{col}_{\\mathcal K}(n)$ of\nsquare-free integers. This is achieved by defining a fundamental kei for every\nsuch $n$. We conjecture that the asymptotic average order of\n$\\textrm{col}_{\\mathcal K}$ can be predicted to some extent by the colorings of\nrandom braid closures. This conjecture is fleshed out in general, building on\nprevious work, and then proven for several cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P1M6yenGzsUJ11QdLQGgsnYK6JJb5REVHraxsdF6Wm8","pdfSize":"3612051"}
