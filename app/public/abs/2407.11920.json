Assuming unitary evolution in the\nmicroscopic system, we examine the resulting dynamics in the coarse-grained\nsystem using the assignment map. We investigate both a two-qubit system, with\nswap and controlled-not gates, and $n$-qubit systems, configured either in an\nIsing spin chain or with all-to-all interactions. We demonstrate that these\ndynamics exhibit atypical quantum behavior, such as non-linearity and\nnon-Markovianity. Furthermore, we find that these dynamics depend on the\ninitial coarse-grained state and establish conditions for general microscopic\ndynamics under which linearity is preserved. As the effective dynamics induced\nby our coarse-grained description of many-body quantum systems diverge from\nconventional quantum behavior, we anticipate that this approach could aid in\ndescribing the quantum-to-classical transition and provide deeper insights into\nthe effects of coarse-graining on quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
