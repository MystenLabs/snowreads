Departing from the conventional practice of using explicit\nglobal representations for camera pose, we propose a novel overparameterized\nrepresentation that models camera poses as learnable rigid warp functions. We\nestablish that modeling the rigid warps must be tightly coupled with\nconstraints and regularization imposed. Specifically, we highlight the critical\nimportance of enforcing invertibility when learning rigid warp functions via\nneural network and propose the use of an Invertible Neural Network (INN)\ncoupled with a geometry-informed constraint for this purpose. We present\nresults on synthetic and real-world datasets, and demonstrate that our approach\noutperforms existing baselines in terms of pose estimation and high-fidelity\nreconstruction due to enhanced optimization convergence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
