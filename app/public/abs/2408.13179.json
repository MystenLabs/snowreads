Specifically, we propose\naugmented versions of functional classification trees and functional random\nforests, incorporating a new tool for assessing the importance of functional\nprincipal components. This tool provides an ad-hoc method for determining\nunbiased permutation feature importance in functional data, particularly when\ndealing with correlated features derived from successive derivatives. Our study\ndemonstrates that these additional features can significantly enhance the\npredictive power of functional classifiers. Experimental evaluations on both\nreal-world and simulated datasets showcase the effectiveness of the proposed\nmethodology, yielding promising results compared to existing methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
