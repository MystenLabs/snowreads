Despite considerable efforts in\nattack detection, intrusion detection systems remain mostly reactive,\nresponding to specific patterns or observed anomalies. This work proposes a\nproactive approach to anticipate and mitigate malicious activities before they\ncause damage. This paper proposes a novel network intrusion prediction\nframework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Long Short Term\nMemory (LSTM) networks. The framework incorporates two LLMs in a feedback loop:\na fine-tuned Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model for predicting\nnetwork traffic and a fine-tuned Bidirectional Encoder Representations from\nTransformers (BERT) for evaluating the predicted traffic. The LSTM classifier\nmodel then identifies malicious packets among these predictions. Our framework,\nevaluated on the CICIoT2023 IoT attack dataset, demonstrates a significant\nimprovement in predictive capabilities, achieving an overall accuracy of 98%,\noffering a robust solution to IoT cybersecurity challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LPuuxw_jfbgkvnXmNkJ9WguGGB9aDDKAd-X4f5MTipE","pdfSize":"374686"}
