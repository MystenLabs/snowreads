By utilizing position-dependent measured gradient value of\nlocal objective function and local information interactions among neighboring\nagents, a set of auxiliary systems is constructed to cooperatively seek the\noptimal solution. The DPTCO problem is then converted to the prescribed-time\nstabilization problem of an interconnected error system. A prescribed-time\nsmall-gain criterion is proposed to characterize prescribed-time stabilization\nof the system, offering a novel approach that enhances the effectiveness beyond\nexisting asymptotic or finite-time stabilization of an interconnected system.\nUnder the criterion and auxiliary systems, innovative adaptive prescribed-time\nlocal tracking controllers are designed for subsystems. The prescribed-time\nconvergence lies in the introduction of time-varying gains which increase to\ninfinity as time tends to the prescribed time. Lyapunov function together with\nprescribed-time mapping are used to prove the prescribed-time stability of\nclosed-loop system as well as the boundedness of internal signals. Finally,\ntheoretical results are verified by one numerical example.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
