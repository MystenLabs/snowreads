The primary implementation methods include leveraging\nrefined prompts and fine-tuning on role-specific datasets. However, these\nmethods suffer from insufficient precision and limited flexibility\nrespectively. To achieve a balance between flexibility and precision, we\nconstruct a Hierarchical Identity Role-Playing Framework (HIRPF) based on\nidentity theory, constructing complex characters using multiple identity\ncombinations. We develop an identity dialogue dataset for this framework and\npropose an evaluation benchmark including scale evaluation and open situation\nevaluation. Empirical results indicate the remarkable efficacy of our framework\nin modeling identity-level role simulation, and reveal its potential for\napplication in social simulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
