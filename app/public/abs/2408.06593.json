Investigating the properties of these transients plays important\nroles in their identification, understanding the jet structure and constraining\npopulation of the star and compact object in AGN disks. In this work, we intend\nto study the propagation and emission of a two-component GRB jet (a fast narrow\ncomponent and wide slow one) in the AGN disk. We consider the influence of wind\nfrom the short and long GRB progenitors, which would reconstruct the\nsurrounding density distribution and form a cavity in the AGN disk. We find\nthat the long GRB jets will be chocked, the dynamcis and the emission are\nresemble to the case without cavity. The narrow and wide cocoon breakout\nemission can be detected by EP and HXMT, respectively. For short GRBs, we\nexpect a non-thermal afterglow emission from the wide jet and a cocoon breakout\nemission from the chocked narrow jet, which can be monitored by EP and HXMT,\nrespectively. Therefore, the joint observations by EP and HXMT might be helpful\nto distinguish the type of GRBs in the AGN disk and the jet components.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
