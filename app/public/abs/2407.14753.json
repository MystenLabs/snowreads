We utilized the 1.2-m\ntelescope at Mount Abu Infrared observatory for optical observations of the Be\ncompanion star. The outburst reached a peak X-ray flux of approximately 11 Crab\nin the 15-50 keV range, marking the highest ever recorded X-ray outburst from\nthe pulsar. We conducted optical observations in the 6000-7200 angstrom range\nbefore, during, and after the X-ray outburst, aiming to examine the evolution\nof the circumstellar disc of the Be star from February 2020 to February 2022.\nOur optical spectra displayed prominent emission lines at 6563 angstrom (H I),\n6678 angstrom (He I), and 7065 angstrom (He I). Notably, the H$\\alpha$ line\nexhibited significant variability in the spectra. Prior to and during the\noutburst, the line profiles appeared single-peaked, and asymmetric with broad\nred and blue wings, respectively. However, post-outburst observations revealed\na double-peaked profile with asymmetry in the blue wing. Our pre-outburst\nobservations confirmed a larger Be circumstellar disc that diminished in size\nas the outburst progressed. Additionally, the observed variations in the\nH$\\alpha$ line profile and parameters indicate the presence of a highly\nmisaligned, precessing, and warped Be disc.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
