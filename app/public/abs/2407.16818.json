The proximate damped\nLy$\\alpha$ absorption acts as a natural coronagraph, removing the quasar\nemission over $\\sim$40 {\\AA} in wavelength, and allows us to detect extended\nLy$\\alpha$ emission without the necessity of subtracting the quasar emission.\nThis natural coronagraph permits the investigation of the quasar environment\ndown to its inner regions ($r < 20$ kpc), where galaxy interactions or feedback\nprocesses should have the most noticeable effects. Our observations reveal a\ndense environment, with a highly asymmetric Ly$\\alpha$ emission within $2\"$\n($\\sim 15$ kpc), possibly shaped by a companion galaxy, and a southern\nextension of the nebulae at about 50~kpc, with rotation-like kinematic\nsignature. The width of the Ly$\\alpha$ emission is broadest closer to the\nquasar, indicating perturbed kinematics as expected if interactions and\nsignificant gas flows are present. The foreground absorbing system itself is\nredshifted by $\\approx $400 km/s relative to the background quasar, and\ntherefore is likely arising from gas moving towards the quasar. Finally two\nadditional Ly$\\alpha$ emitters are detected with $>10\\,\\sigma$ significance at\n96 and 223 kpc from the quasar, making this field overdense relative to other\nsimilar observations of quasars at $z\\sim 3$. Our results support the\nhypothesis that quasars with proximate neutral/molecular absorption trace rich\nenvironments where galaxy interactions are at play and motivates further\nstudies of H$_2$-selected quasars to shed light on feeding and feedback\nprocesses.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
