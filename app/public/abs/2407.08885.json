This technique is particularly useful in\nsurveillance and monitoring applications. Although it is still a nascent field\nof research, there have been several approaches proposed over the last two\ndecades varying with the application, optimization type, nature of data feed,\netc. The primary data required for these algorithms arises from some sort of\nobject tracking method. In this paper, we discuss different spatio-temporal\ndata representations suitable for different applications. We also present a\nformal definition for the video synopsis algorithm. We further discuss the\nassumptions and modifications to this definition required for a simpler version\nof the problem. We explore the application of a packing algorithm to solve the\nproblem of video synopsis. Since the nature of the data is three dimensional,\nwe consider 3D packing problems in the discussion. This paper also provides an\nextensive literature review of different video synopsis methods and packing\nproblems. Lastly, we examine the different applications of this algorithm and\nhow the different data representations discussed earlier can make the problem\nsimpler. We also discuss the future directions of research that can be explored\nfollowing this discussion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
