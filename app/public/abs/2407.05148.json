Many motion generation methods for locomotion have been\nproposed including reinforcement learning (RL). RL locomotion policies offer\ngreat versatility and generalizability along with the ability to experience new\nknowledge to improve over time. This work presents a velocity-based RL\nlocomotion policy for the REEM-C robot. The policy uses a periodic reward\nformulation and is implemented in Brax/MJX for fast training. Simulation\nresults for the policy are demonstrated with future experimental results in\nprogress.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
