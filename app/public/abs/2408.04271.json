To this end, we consider three\narchitectures of RIS: locally passive diagonal (LP-D), globally passive\ndiagonal (GP-D), and globally passive beyond diagonal (GP-BD). In a globally\npassive RIS, the power of the output signal of the RIS is not greater than its\ninput power, but some RIS elements can amplify the signal. In a locally passive\nRIS, every element cannot amplify the incident signal. We show that these RIS\narchitectures can substantially improve energy efficiency (EE) if the static\npower of the RIS elements is not too high. Moreover, GP-BD RIS, which has a\nhigher complexity and static power than LP-D RIS and GP-D RIS, provides better\nspectral efficiency, but its EE performance highly depends on the static power\nconsumption and may be worse than its diagonal counterparts.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
