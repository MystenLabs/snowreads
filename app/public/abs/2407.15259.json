In\nadditional to observational data, background knowledge (BK), which could be\nattained from human expertise or experiments, is usually introduced for\nuncovering causal relations. This raises an open problem that in the presence\nof latent variables, what causal relations are identifiable from observational\ndata and BK. In this paper, we propose two novel rules for incorporating BK,\nwhich offer a new perspective to the open problem. In addition, we show that\nthese rules are applicable in some typical causality tasks, such as determining\nthe set of possible causal effects with observational data. Our rule-based\napproach enhances the state-of-the-art method by circumventing a process of\nenumerating block sets that would otherwise take exponential complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
