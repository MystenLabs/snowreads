The aim of this paper is to construct an\nanalogue of Green's functions for planar quasiregular mappings of degree two\nand constant complex dilatation. These Green's functions are dynamically\nnatural, in that they semi-conjugate our quasiregular mappings to the real\nsquaring map. However, they do not share the same regularity properties as\nGreen's functions of polynomials. We use these Green's functions to investigate\nproperties of the boundary of the escaping set and give several examples to\nillustrate behavior that does not occur for the dynamics of quadratic\npolynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
