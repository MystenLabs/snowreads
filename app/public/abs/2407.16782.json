In this article, we prove that every\nhereditary torsion theory on the Eilenberg-Moore category of modules over a\nmonad $U$ is differential. Further, if $\\delta:U\\longrightarrow U$ denotes a\nderivation on a monad $U$, then we show that every $\\delta$-derivation on a\n$U$-module $M$ extends uniquely to a $\\delta$-derivation on the module of\nquotients of $M$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
