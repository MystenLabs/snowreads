We propose an adaptive\nimportance sampling for solving the problem. In our proposal, we restrict the\nimportance point process to the family of homogeneous Poisson point processes,\nwhich enables us to generate quickly independent samples of the importance\npoint process. The optimal intensity of the importance point process is found\nby applying the cross-entropy minimization method. In the proposed scheme, the\nexpected value of the function and the optimal intensity are iteratively\nestimated in an adaptive manner. We show that the proposed estimator converges\nto the target value almost surely, and prove the asymptotic normality of it. We\nexplain how to apply the proposed scheme to the estimation of the intensity of\na stationary pairwise interaction point process. The performance of the\nproposed scheme is compared numerically with the Markov chain Monte Carlo\nsimulation and the perfect sampling.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
