Human beings\nexpress their emotion using certain words, speech (tone, pitch, speed) or\nfacial expression. Artificial Intelligence approach to emotion classification\nare largely based on learning from textual information. However, public\ndatasets containing text and speech data provide sufficient resources to train\nmachine learning algorithms for the tack of emotion classification. In this\npaper, we present novel bimodal deep learning-based architectures enhanced with\nattention mechanism trained and tested on text and speech data for emotion\nclassification. We report details of different deep learning based\narchitectures and show the performance of each architecture including rigorous\nerror analyses. Our finding suggests that deep learning based architectures\ntrained on different types of data (text and speech) outperform architectures\ntrained only on text or speech. Our proposed attention-based bimodal\narchitecture outperforms several state-of-the-art systems in emotion\nclassification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
