We also deduce the\nasymptotic expansion of connected k-regular graphs using standard techniques\nfor divergent series developed by Wright (1970) and Bender (1975), and quantify\nits closeness to the asymptotic expansion of k-regular graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
