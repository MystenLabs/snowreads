To date,\nprotein sequencing relies on mass spectrometry, with some novel edman\ndegregation based platforms able to sequence non-native peptides. Current\nprotein sequencing techniques face limitations in accurately identifying all\namino acids, hindering comprehensive proteome analysis. Our method simulates\npartial sequencing data by selectively masking amino acids that are\nexperimentally difficult to identify in protein sequences from the UniRef\ndatabase. This targeted masking mimics real-world sequencing limitations. We\nthen modify and finetune a ProtBert derived transformer-based model, for a new\ndownstream task predicting these masked residues, providing an approximation of\nthe complete sequence. Evaluating on three bacterial Escherichia species, we\nachieve per-amino-acid accuracy up to 90.5% when only four amino acids ([KCYM])\nare known. Structural assessment using AlphaFold and TM-score validates the\nbiological relevance of our predictions. The model also demonstrates potential\nfor evolutionary analysis through cross-species performance. This integration\nof simulated experimental constraints with computational predictions offers a\npromising avenue for enhancing protein sequence analysis, potentially\naccelerating advancements in proteomics and structural biology by providing a\nprobabilistic reconstruction of the complete protein sequence from limited\nexperimental data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
