First, we\nintroduce a notion of discontinuous, bounded variation solution associated with\nthis system and establish an equivalent representation formula for it, inspired\nby the approach known in delay-free impulsive control as the `graph\ncompletions' method. Then, thanks to this equivalent formulation, we prove\nwell-posedness properties of these solutions and also derive necessary\noptimality conditions in the form of a Maximum Principle for an associated\nminimization problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MerPVsITRzYSaRXlWDCMs1W6IcGXaQaL3JzifmgRea8","pdfSize":"413632"}
