If separation of the well-known Verblunsky (Schur)\ncoefficients occurs in Khrushchev formulas, the separation of the so the called\nnew Verblunsky-type coefficients occurs in the interpolation formulas of the\n$S$-nodes theory. General asymptotic inequalities (and equalities) for the\n$S$-nodes, with application to the block Hankel matrices, are derived using\nthis approach. Another asymptotic inequality, needed in the proofs and\nimportant in itself, is derived in Appendix B.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
