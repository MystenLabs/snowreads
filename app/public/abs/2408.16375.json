This\npaper diverges from conventional approaches by exploring three fundamental yet\nunderinvestigated aspects: training policy, data efficiency, and evaluation\nrobustness. We introduce EasyChauffeur, a reproducible and effective planner\nfor both imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) on Waymax, a\nGPU-accelerated simulator. Notably, our findings indicate that the\nincorporation of on-policy RL significantly boosts performance and data\nefficiency. To further enhance this efficiency, we propose SNE-Sampling, a\nnovel method that selectively samples data from the encoder's latent space,\nsubstantially improving EasyChauffeur's performance with RL. Additionally, we\nidentify a deficiency in current evaluation methods, which fail to accurately\nassess the robustness of different planners due to significant performance\ndrops from minor changes in the ego vehicle's initial state. In response, we\npropose Ego-Shifting, a new evaluation setting for assessing planners'\nrobustness. Our findings advocate for a shift from a primary focus on network\narchitectures to adopting a holistic approach encompassing training strategies,\ndata efficiency, and robust evaluation methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
