The temperature gradients\nthey create deem the fluid's viscosity spatially dependent, therefore violating\nthe linearity of the problem, making a full description of velocity and\npressure fields challenging. Using energy dissipation analysis and Lorentz\nReciprocal Theorem, we show that it is still possible to study global\nproperties of such hot suspensions. Namely, we calculate the effective\nviscosity of a dilute hot suspension, adding a correction that includes\ncontributions from the bulk fluid and the particles themselves. As examples of\nthis method, we derive the effective viscosity of a suspension of spherical\nparticles with different heat distributions. We show that when the particles\nare non-Brownian and are all oriented in the same direction, the viscosity is\nno longer isotropic and depends on the direction of the shear relative to the\norientation of the particles. If the particles' orientation is fixed due to an\nexternal field, the stress tensor is no longer symmetric, and the viscosity has\nodd components.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wKGrqdwQPN6v4-YolYcjja1G1hXxqB7hTArej8lrRWs","pdfSize":"965585","txDigest":"95sdvgDhCGkCwdYSepVqVEapK1EnnbjfNyb5oCtVDbb8","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
