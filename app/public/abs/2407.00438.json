This paper introduces AI\nAge Discrepancy, a novel metric derived from machine learning analysis of\npreoperative abdominal CT scans, as a potential indicator of frailty and\npostoperative risk in kidney cancer patients. This retrospective study of 599\npatients from the 2023 Kidney Tumor Segmentation (KiTS) challenge dataset found\nthat a higher AI Age Discrepancy is significantly associated with longer\nhospital stays and lower overall survival rates, independent of established\nfactors. This suggests that AI Age Discrepancy may provide valuable insights\ninto patient frailty and could thus inform clinical decision-making in kidney\ncancer treatment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
