Visual localization, particularly\nmonocular camera position estimation, offers a solution by determining the\ncamera's pose solely through visual cues. However, this task is challenging due\nto limited data from a single camera. To tackle these challenges, we organized\nthe AISG-SLA Visual Localization Challenge (VLC) at IJCAI 2023 to explore how\nAI can accurately extract camera pose data from 2D images in 3D space. The\nchallenge attracted over 300 participants worldwide, forming 50+ teams. Winning\nteams achieved high accuracy in pose estimation using images from a car-mounted\ncamera with low frame rates.
