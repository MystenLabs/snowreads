The recent\nadvent of large language models (LLMs) has paved a new avenue for AHD, with\ninitial efforts focusing on framing AHD as an evolutionary program search (EPS)\nproblem. However, inconsistent benchmark settings, inadequate baselines, and a\nlack of detailed component analysis have left the necessity of integrating LLMs\nwith search strategies and the true progress achieved by existing LLM-based EPS\nmethods to be inadequately justified. This work seeks to fulfill these research\nqueries by conducting a large-scale benchmark comprising four LLM-based EPS\nmethods and four AHD problems across nine LLMs and five independent runs. Our\nextensive experiments yield meaningful insights, providing empirical grounding\nfor the importance of evolutionary search in LLM-based AHD approaches, while\nalso contributing to the advancement of future EPS algorithmic development. To\nfoster accessibility and reproducibility, we have fully open-sourced our\nbenchmark and corresponding results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
