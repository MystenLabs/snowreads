We consider\nvectorial functions that are not necessarily permutations, but are, in some\nsense, almost bijective. In this context, we define an almost lifting as a\nBoolean function for which there is an upper bound on the number of collisions\nof its lifted functions that does not depend on $n$. We show that if a Boolean\nfunction with diameter $k$ is an almost lifting, then the maximum number of\ncollisions of its lifted functions is $2^{k-1}$ for any $n$. Moreover, we\nsearch for functions in the class of almost liftings that have good\ncryptographic properties and for which the non-bijectivity does not cause major\nsecurity weaknesses. These functions generalize the well-known map $\\chi$ used\nin the Keccak hash function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BcRgltyNk4WXt8pXdxxbXhJHhdt5SQDjOgdNi8FhsRY","pdfSize":"432841"}
