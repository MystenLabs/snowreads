The solution is a\nparameterized algorithm based on treewidth. Additionally, we show how the\ncircuit view of e-graphs allows us to apply simplification techniques that are\nnot possible when operating directly on e-graphs. While the core parameterized\nalgorithm may be adapted to work directly on e-graphs, the simplification\nresults show why the circuit view is helpful.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QaKGCy3df2_iTIfgZ0qZiPl5naGc3ves3btjyzF_c6I","pdfSize":"518295"}
