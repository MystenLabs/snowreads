In the\npast, relatively simple physics-motivated priors have been considered for such\napproaches, using assumptions such as constant velocity or acceleration. This\npaper presents an approach to incorporating exogenous control inputs, such as\nvelocity or acceleration commands, into the continuous Gaussian process\nstate-estimation framework. It is shown that this approach generalizes across\ndifferent domains in robotics, making it applicable to both the estimation of\ncontinuous-time trajectories for mobile robots and continuum-robot shapes.\nResults show that incorporating control inputs leads to more informed priors,\npotentially requiring less measurements and estimation nodes to obtain accurate\nestimates. This makes the approach particularly useful in situations in which\nlimited sensing is available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
