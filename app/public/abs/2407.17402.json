Deep learning-based\napproaches have demonstrated significant advancements in reconstructing\nirregularly missing seismic data through supervised and unsupervised methods.\nNonetheless, substantial challenges remain, such as generalization capacity and\ncomputation time cost during the inference. Our work introduces a\nreconstruction method that uses a pre-trained generative diffusion model for\nimage synthesis and incorporates Deep Image Prior (DIP) to maintain data\nconsistency when reconstructing missing traces in seismic images. The proposed\nmethod has demonstrated strong robustness and high reconstruction capability\nfor field and synthetic seismic images with different levels of structural\ncomplexity, even in scenarios where test images were outside the training\ndomain. This indicates that our method can handle the high geological\nvariability of different exploration targets. Additionally, compared to other\nstate-of-the-art seismic reconstruction methods using diffusion models, our\napproach reduces the number of neural function evaluations by up to 4x.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
