We highlight three complex tasks that are\nof critical interest to book historians: clustering, element discovery, and\nunsupervised change localization. For each of these tasks, we introduce an\nevaluation benchmark, and we adapt and evaluate state-of-the-art models. Our\nRey's Ornaments dataset is designed to be a representative example of a set of\nornaments historians would be interested in. It focuses on an XVIIIth century\nbookseller, Marc-Michel Rey, providing a consistent set of ornaments with a\nwide diversity and representative challenges. Our results highlight the\nlimitations of state-of-the-art models when faced with real data and show\nsimple baselines such as k-means or congealing can outperform more\nsophisticated approaches on such data.
