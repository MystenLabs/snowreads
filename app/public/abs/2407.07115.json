The Hydrodynamic Cavitation\nMethod for water treatment gives the highest reduction in Turbidity (100%), the\nsecond highest reduction in TSS (83.86%), and the lowest reduction in Na+\n(8.47%), according to the study and analysis of various quality parameters.\nWhen compared to CPCB Water Quality Criteria, treated water is suitable for\noutdoor bathing; it again satisfies the standards for classes SW-I, SW-II,\nSW-III, SW-IV and SW-V, i.e., treated sea water can be used for a variety of\npurposes, including bathing, contact water sports, commercial fishing,\nmariculture, ecologically sensitive zones, aesthetics, harbour, waters\nNavigation and Controlled water disposal. The SAR value of treated water, which\nis 1.72, indicates it is appropriate for all types of soil and crops. The\ntreated water's WQI, which is 65, showed that it is of Fair quality and may be\nused for industrial and irrigation uses. Water quality can be improved by\nrecycling the treated water for an additional 24 hours using the hydrodynamic\ncavitation method. Recycling of one time treated sea water will result in\nhigher-quality water that can be used for a variety of purposes.\n  The Hydrodynamic Cavitation method by using venturi - orifice is proven to be\nthe most effective over the other methods. Because it does not require any\nchemical reagent, hence does not produce any hazardous chemical waste, and\nmaintains an eco-friendly and economically sustainable, environment benign\ntechnique for the treatment of Seawater.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
