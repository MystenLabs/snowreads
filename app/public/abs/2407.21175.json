We\ndescribe an explicit presentation for the cohomology ring\n$Z\\cong\\mathsf{Ext}^*_{\\mathcal{N}S_n}(\\mathbb{Z},\\mathbb{Z})$, with $n-i$ new\ngenerators in degree $i$ for $0< i<n$, and all relations are quadratic. We show\nthat this $\\mathsf{Ext}$ ring is $\\mathbb{Z}$-free, and that it is a semiprime\nNoetherian affine polynomial identity (PI) ring with Poincar\\'e series\n$1/(1-t)^{n-1}$ and PI degree $2^{n-2}$. For any field of coefficients\n$\\mathbf{k}$, we show that\n$\\mathsf{Ext}^*_{\\mathbf{k}\\mathcal{N}S_n}(\\mathbf{k},\\mathbf{k})$ is\n$\\mathbf{k}\\otimes_{\\mathbb{Z}} Z$. Similar results hold for other finite\nCoxeter types. In the final section we show that $Z$ is a Koszul algebra whose\nKoszul dual is a signed version of the nilcactus algebra, an algebra closely\nrelated to the cactus group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"E2_rQEx2DHH6e8E7L8vOOif-X43xWgTa7zfvpfrTI6w","pdfSize":"297145"}
