We\nhighlight the differences between the `background wedge' and the `operator\nreconstruction wedges,' providing a resolution to the paradox raised in\n\\cite{Bao:2019hwq}. Additionally, we elucidate the distinctions between four\ndifferent `operator reconstruction wedges' and demonstrate how to enhance the\nproof for the absence of global symmetries in geometrical states in AdS/CFT\n\\cite{Harlow:2018jwu, Harlow:2018tng} as an example of these distinctions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
