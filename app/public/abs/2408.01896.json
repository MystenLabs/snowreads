However, using only\nthe native token upper-bounds the value eligible for staking by the market\ncapitalization of the native token. In contrast, the remote staking of another\ncrypto asset from a provider chain provides an avenue to improve the consumer\nchain's economic security. In this paper, we present the first known remote\nstaking protocols with guaranteed optimal economic safety: whenever there is a\nsafety violation on the consumer chain, at least one third of the provider's\nstake securing the consumer chain is slashed. To achieve this goal for a broad\nrange of provider and consumer chains, two independent contributions are made:\n1) a remote unbonding protocol that ensures slashing before the stake is\nunbonded on the provider chain if there is safety violation on the consumer\nchain; 2) a protocol to slash stake even without smart contracts on the\nprovider chain. The remote staking protocol is analyzed and implemented in the\ncase where the provider chain is Bitcoin and the consumer chain is a Cosmos SDK\nchain running the Tendermint consensus protocol.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
