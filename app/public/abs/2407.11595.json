However, this methodology often\nencountered limitations when dealing with large-scale and complex problems and\nmanaging dynamic and massive data, resulting in inefficiencies and limited\nperformance of traditional communication systems and methods. As such, wireless\ncommunications have embraced the revolutionary impact of artificial\nintelligence and machine learning, giving birth to more adaptive, efficient,\nand intelligent systems and algorithms. This technological shift opens a road\nto intelligent information transmission and processing. This overview article\ndiscusses the typical roles of machine learning in intelligent wireless\ncommunications, as well as its features, challenges, and practical\nconsiderations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
