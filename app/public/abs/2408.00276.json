However, coupling between classical and quantum degrees of freedom\nand the exponential growth of the Hilbert space present significant challenges.\nCurrent machine learning approaches for predicting such dynamics, while\npromising, remain unknown in their error bounds, sample complexity, and\ngeneralizability. In this work, we establish a generic theoretical framework\nfor analyzing quantum-classical adiabatic dynamics with learning algorithms.\nBased on quantum information theory, we develop a provably efficient adiabatic\nlearning (PEAL) algorithm with logarithmic system size sampling complexity and\nfavorable time scaling properties. We benchmark PEAL on the Holstein model, and\ndemonstrate its accuracy in predicting single-path dynamics and ensemble\ndynamics observables as well as transfer learning over a family of\nHamiltonians. Our framework and algorithm open up new avenues for reliable and\nefficient learning of quantum-classical dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
