There\nare two different flows of ideas. One approach is based on Morse Lemma. The\nother is based on analyticity which proves that the number of solutions to the\ninverse problems is generically isolated for some particular class of dynamical\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TZ-ONyw9EJRzVfcDl8FiChSBOI6uuRVhw13_QW5A3nA","pdfSize":"192870"}
