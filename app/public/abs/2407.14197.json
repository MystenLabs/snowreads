GGSC is inspired by graph signal processing theory and uses\ntwo branches to compress the primitive center and attributes. We split the\nwhole GS sample via KDTree and clip the high-frequency components after the\ngraph Fourier transform. Followed by quantization, G-PCC and adaptive\narithmetic coding are used to compress the primitive center and attribute\nresidual matrix to generate the bitrate file. GGSS is the first work to explore\ntraditional GS compression, with advantages that can reveal the GS distortion\ncharacteristics corresponding to typical compression operation, such as\nhigh-frequency clipping and quantization. Second, based on GGSC, we create a GS\nQuality Assessment dataset (GSQA) with 120 samples. A subjective experiment is\nconducted in a laboratory environment to collect subjective scores after\nrendering GS into Processed Video Sequences (PVS). We analyze the\ncharacteristics of different GS distortions based on Mean Opinion Scores (MOS),\ndemonstrating the sensitivity of different attributes distortion to visual\nquality. The GGSC code and the dataset, including GS samples, MOS, and PVS, are\nmade publicly available at https://github.com/Qi-Yangsjtu/GGSC.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
