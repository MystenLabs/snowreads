Zeeman splittings of the $e$EDM sensitive\nlevels have significant implications to control and suppress important\nsystematic effects due to stray magnetic field in experiments for $e$EDM\nsearches. The electric-field-dependent g factors of the lowest rotational level\nof the first excited bending vibrational mode of $^{174}$YbOH are calculated.\nl-doublet levels with small g factors difference are found and main\ncontributions to the difference are determined.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
