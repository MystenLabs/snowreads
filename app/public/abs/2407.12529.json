Recent studies on query\nrewriting, such as query2doc, query2expand and querey2cot, rely on the internal\nknowledge of Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a relevant passage to add\ninformation to the query. Nevertheless, the efficacy of these methodologies may\nmarkedly decline in instances where the requisite knowledge is not encapsulated\nwithin the model's intrinsic parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel\nstructured query rewriting method called Crafting the Path tailored for\nretrieval systems. Crafting the Path involves a three-step process that crafts\nquery-related information necessary for finding the passages to be searched in\neach step. Specifically, the Crafting the Path begins with Query Concept\nComprehension, proceeds to Query Type Identification, and finally conducts\nExpected Answer Extraction. Experimental results show that our method\noutperforms previous rewriting methods, especially in less familiar domains for\nLLMs. We demonstrate that our method is less dependent on the internal\nparameter knowledge of the model and generates queries with fewer factual\ninaccuracies. Furthermore, we observe that \\name{} demonstrates superior\nperformance in the retrieval-augmented generation scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
