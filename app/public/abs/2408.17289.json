Reaching the desired accuracy using\ntraditional techniques often requires avoiding lines contaminated by stellar\nvariability and/or changing tellurics, and thus discarding a large fraction of\nthe spectrum, lowering precision. New data-driven methods can help achieve\nextremely precise and accurate RVs by enabling the use of a larger fraction of\nthe available data. While there exist methods for modeling telluric features or\nthe stellar variability individually, there is a need for additional tools that\nare capable of modeling them simultaneously at the spectral level. Here we\npresent StellarSpectraObservationFitting.jl (SSOF), a Julia package for\nmeasuring Doppler shifts and creating data-driven models (with fast,\nphysically-motivated Gaussian Process regularization) for the time-variable\nspectral features for both the telluric transmission and stellar spectrum,\nwhile accounting for the wavelength-dependent instrumental line-spread\nfunction. We demonstrate SSOF's state-of-the-art performance on data from the\nNEID RV spectrograph on the WIYN 3.5m Telescope for multiple stars. We show\nSSOF's, ability to accurately identify and characterize spectral variability\nand provide $\\sim$2-6x smaller photon-limited errors over the NEID CCF-based\npipeline and match the performance of SERVAL, a leading template-based\npipeline, using only observed EPRV spectra.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
