Our analysis reveals a density gradient\noriented towards the north-west, while the magnetic field strength gradient\naligns with the Galactic plane, pointing eastward. Additionally, utilizing this\nmagnetic field map, we have derived the spatial distributions of the cut-off\nfrequency and maximum energy of electrons in Tycho's SNR. We further comment on\nthe implications of these findings for interpreting the gamma-ray emission from\nTycho's SNR.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
