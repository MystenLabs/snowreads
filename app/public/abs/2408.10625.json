In this work, we investigated systematically the\nvibrational and superconducting properties of H3Se in Im-3m phase under\npressures ranging from 75 to 200 GPa. Our approach combines the stochastic\nself-consistent harmonic approximation with first-principles calculations to\naddress effects from the quantum and anharmonic vibrations of ions. It turns\nout that these effects significantly modify the crystal structure, increasing\nthe inner pressure by about 8 GPa compared to situations where they are\nignored. The phonon spectra suggest that with these effects included, the\ncrystal can be stabilized at pressures as low as 50 GPa, much lower than the\npreviously predicted value of over 100 GPa. Our calculations also highlight the\ncritical role of quantum and anharmonic effects on electron-phonon coupling\nproperties. Neglecting these factors could result in a substantial\noverestimation of the superconducting critical temperature, by approximately 25\nK at 125 GPa, for example.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_qMvx8-3phXqlSOB6VjyqJaG7NaHis0-9njlxKsD0zk","pdfSize":"1175790"}
