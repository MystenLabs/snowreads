We enumerate alternating sign matrices whose key avoids a\ngiven set of permutation patterns in several instances. We show that ASMs whose\nkey avoids $231$ are permutations, thus any known enumeration for a set of\npermutation patterns including $231$ extends to ASMs. We furthermore enumerate\nby the Catalan numbers ASMs whose key avoids both $312$ and $321$. We also show\nASMs whose key avoids $312$ are in bijection with the gapless monotone\ntriangles of [Ayyer, Cori, Gouyou-Beauchamps 2011]. Thus key-avoidance\ngeneralizes the notion of $312$-avoidance studied there. Finally, we enumerate\nASMs with a given key avoiding $312$ and $321$ using a connection to Schubert\npolynomials, thereby deriving an interesting Catalan identity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oUJPBEUauP1rnjPmghDX32XHrF_HTbWomDNhpqSTOVo","pdfSize":"315602"}
