{"id":"2407.08533","title":"There is no disk mass budget problem of planet formation","authors":"Sofia Savvidou and Bertram Bitsch","authorsParsed":[["Savvidou","Sofia",""],["Bitsch","Bertram",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 11 Jul 2024 14:20:20 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-12","timestamp":1720707620000,"abstract":"  The inferred dust masses from Class II protoplanetary disk observations are\nlower than or equal to the masses of the observed exoplanet systems. This poses\nthe question of how planets form if their natal environments do not contain\nenough mass. This hypothesis has entered the literature as the \"mass budget\nproblem\" of planet formation. We utilize numerical simulations of planet\nformation via pebble and gas accretion, including migration, in a viscously\nevolving protoplanetary disk, while tracing the time evolution of the dust\nmass. As expected, we find that the presence of a giant planet in the disk can\ninfluence the evolution of the disk itself and prevent rapid dust mass loss by\ntrapping the dust outside its orbit. Early formation is crucial for giant\nplanet formation, as we found in our previous work; therefore, our findings\nstrengthen the hypothesis that planet formation has already occurred or is\nongoing in Class II disks. Most importantly, we find that the optically thin\ndust mass significantly underestimates the total dust mass in the presence of a\ndust-trapping deep gap. We also show that the beam convolution would smear out\nthe feature from a deep gap, especially if the planet forms in the inner disk.\nSuch hidden dust mass, along with early planet formation, could be the answer\nto the hypothetical mass budget problem.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
