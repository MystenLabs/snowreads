Recently,\nresearchers have started focusing on searching for all other sources within the\nfield observed, including the vast population of background galaxies. Toward a\npopulation of galaxies in the background toward the Vela supernova remnant, we\nsearch for technosignatures, spectral and temporal features consistent with our\nunderstanding of technology. We set transmitter power limits for the detection\nof signals in a population of over 1,300 galaxies within a single field of view\nobserved with the Murchison Widefield Array.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
