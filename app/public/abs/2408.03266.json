As the\ncoupling constant is increased, the bipolarons first appear as extended (but\nfinite radius) soliton-type states. They subsequently decrease in radius until\ntheir size reaches the inter-atomic scale. We present the first numerically\nexact solution of the bipolaron problem from quadratic EPI in the presence of\nboth on-site Hubbard and long-range Coulomb repulsion, and compute estimates of\nthe largest superconducting transition temperature within the bipolaron\nmechanism. We find that $T_c/\\Omega$ ratios, where $\\Omega$ is the optical\nphonon frequency, can be several times larger than what one may expect from the\nlinear EPI provided the phonon frequency is increased by orders of magnitude on\noccupied sites. Electron-electron repulsion can be tolerated at the expense of\nstronger EPI and the most detrimental effect comes from the Coulomb potential\nbecause it easily eliminates extended soliton states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
