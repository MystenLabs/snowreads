{"id":"2407.02086","title":"On polynomial kernelization for Stable Cutset","authors":"Stefan Kratsch, Van Bang Le","authorsParsed":[["Kratsch","Stefan",""],["Le","Van Bang",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 2 Jul 2024 09:23:41 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-03","timestamp":1719912221000,"abstract":"  A stable cutset in a graph $G$ is a set $S\\subseteq V(G)$ such that vertices\nof $S$ are pairwise non-adjacent and such that $G-S$ is disconnected, i.e., it\nis both stable (or independent) set and a cutset (or separator). Unlike general\ncutsets, it is $NP$-complete to determine whether a given graph $G$ has any\nstable cutset. Recently, Rauch et al.\\ [FCT 2023] gave a number of\nfixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms, time $f(k)\\cdot |V(G)|^c$, for\nStable Cutset under a variety of parameters $k$ such as the size of a (given)\ndominating set, the size of an odd cycle transversal, or the deletion distance\nto $P_5$-free graphs. Earlier works imply FPT algorithms relative to\nclique-width and relative to solution size.\n  We complement these findings by giving the first results on the existence of\npolynomial kernelizations for \\stablecutset, i.e., efficient preprocessing\nalgorithms that return an equivalent instance of size polynomial in the\nparameter value. Under the standard assumption that $NP\\nsubseteq coNP/poly$,\nwe show that no polynomial kernelization is possible relative to the deletion\ndistance to a single path, generalizing deletion distance to various graph\nclasses, nor by the size of a (given) dominating set. We also show that under\nthe same assumption no polynomial kernelization is possible relative to\nsolution size, i.e., given $(G,k)$ answering whether there is a stable cutset\nof size at most $k$. On the positive side, we show polynomial kernelizations\nfor parameterization by modulators to a single clique, to a cluster or a\nco-cluster graph, and by twin cover.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
