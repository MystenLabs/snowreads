Despite\nthe significant contribution in the field of urban studies and geography, CPT\nhas limited in suggesting an index that captures its key ideas. By analyzing\nvarious urban big data of Seoul, we demonstrate that PCI and ECI effectively\nidentify the key ideas of CPT, capturing the spatial structure of a city that\nassociated with the distribution of economic activities, infrastructure, and\nmarket orientation in line with the CPT. These metrics for urban centrality\noffer a modern approach to understanding the Central Place Theory and tool for\nurban planning and regional economic strategies without privacy issues.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
