The static spherically symmetric solutions describe the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om-like black hole and ReissnerNordstr\\\"om-(anti) de\nSitter-like black hole, while the stationary and axially symmetric soltuions\ndescribe Kerr-Newman-like black hole and Kerr-Newman-(anti) de Sitter-like\nblack hole. We utilize the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism to study the shadows of\nthe black holes. Additionally, we investigate the effect of the electric charge\nand Lorentz-violating parameters on the radius of the shadow reference circle\nand the distortion parameter. We find that the radius of the reference circle\ndecreases with the Lorentz-violating parameter and charge parameter, while the\ndistortion parameter increases with the Lorentz-violating parameter and the\ncharge parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cIIC9w7Gcz0DooeQfAglAPW0MwL3RblqpKnO7fkvmWg","pdfSize":"910401","objectId":"0xf3deca0c0bcc9938ea795cc6f4eae2b26d0dc8277fce2e2bfa36d93f1391c0d7","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
