Intense THz lasers, therefore, lead to examining nonlinear optical\neffects in such magnets. Employing an unbiased numerical method, we calculate\nthe laser-pulse driven harmonic spectra of the Shastry-Sutherland magnets,\nwhich is well known as the model of a quantum frustrated magnet\n$SrCu_2(BO_3)_2$. As a result, nonlinear responses of triplons and a\ntwo-triplon bound state are observed through the Zeeman or magnetoelectric\ncouplings between the laser and the electron spin. Furthermore, we find that\none can obtain information on magnetic anisotropy and symmetry from the spectra\nby manipulating external fields or two-color lasers. Our results indicate that\nlaser-driven harmonic spectra are useful as a probe of less-detectable quantum\nmany-body states in frustrated magnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
