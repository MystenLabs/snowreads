They have found significant applications in\nsimulating lattice gauge theories approaching relevant problems in high-energy\nphysics. Compared to Monte Carlo methods, they do not suffer from the sign\nproblem, allowing them to explore challenging regimes such as finite chemical\npotentials and real-time dynamics. Further development is required to tackle\nfundamental challenges, such as accessing continuum limits or computations of\nlarge-scale quantum chromodynamics. In this work, we review the\nstate-of-the-art of Tensor Network methods and discuss a possible roadmap for\nalgorithmic development and strategies to enhance their capabilities and extend\ntheir applicability to open high-energy problems. We provide tailored estimates\nof the theoretical and computational resource scaling for attacking large-scale\nlattice gauge theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
