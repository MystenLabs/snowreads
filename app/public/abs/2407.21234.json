Here, we present\nthe asteroseismic detection of solar-like oscillations at 4-minute timescales\n($\\nu_{\\mathrm{max}}\\sim4300\\mu$Hz) in the nearby K-dwarf $\\sigma$ Draconis\nusing extreme precision Doppler velocity observations from the Keck Planet\nFinder and 20-second cadence photometry from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey\nSatellite. The star is the coolest dwarf star to date with both velocity and\nluminosity observations of solar-like oscillations, having amplitudes of\n$5.9\\pm0.8\\,$cm$\\,\\text{s}^{-1}$ and $0.8\\pm0.2$ ppm, respectively. These\nmeasured values are in excellent agreement with established luminosity-velocity\namplitude relations for oscillations and provide further evidence that mode\namplitudes for stars with $T_{\\mathrm{eff}}<\\,5500\\,$K diminish in scale\nfollowing a $(L/M)^{1.5}$ relation. By modeling the star's oscillation\nfrequencies from photometric data, we measure an asteroseismic age of\n$4.5\\pm0.9\\,\\rm{(ran)} \\pm 1.2\\,\\rm{(sys)}$ Gyr. The observations demonstrate\nthe capability of next-generation spectrographs and precise space-based\nphotometry to extend observational asteroseismology to nearby cool dwarfs,\nwhich are benchmarks for stellar astrophysics and prime targets for directly\nimaging planets using future space-based telescopes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
