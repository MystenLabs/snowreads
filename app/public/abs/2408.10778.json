We present an\n$\\varepsilon$-factorised differential equation for the 40 master integrals. The\nalphabet consists of 29 dlog-forms with algebraic arguments, involving six\nsquare roots. As these square roots are not simultaneously rationalizable, we\nexpress the master integrals in terms of iterated integrals. In addition, we\nexpress the H-graph with unit powers of the propagators up to weight four in\nterms of multiple polylogarithms in compact form.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
