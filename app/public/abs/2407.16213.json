These singularities usually emerge in real space\naccidentally and are unstable due to the vectorial property of the electric\nfield. In this paper, we show that topologically protected electric dark spots\ncan emerge in metal scatterers under external excitation. The material property\nof metal imposes a boundary condition that reduces the vectorial electric field\non the metal surface to a scalar field. The phase singularity of this scalar\nfield has zero amplitude and carries a well-defined topological charge\ncorresponding to an electric dark spot. The topological electric dark spots\ngive rise to the superoscillation phenomenon with a divergent local wavenumber.\nWe uncover the global charge conservation property of the dark spots on the\nscatterers' surfaces and demonstrate their stability under different\nperturbations. We also demonstrate the manipulation of the dark spots'\ntopological charge and spatial location. The results open a new avenue for\nnanophotonic near-field manipulations and may find applications in optical\nmetrology, optical sensing, and super-resolution imaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
