We propose to use existing computer vision and optical\ncharacter recognition techniques to build a grounded context from the comic\nstrip image content, such as panels, characters, text, reading order and the\nassociation of bubbles and characters. Then we infer character identification\nand generate comic book script with context-aware panel description including\ncharacter's appearance, posture, mood, dialogues etc. We believe that such\nenriched content description can be easily used to produce audiobook and eBook\nwith various voices for characters, captions and playing sound effects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
