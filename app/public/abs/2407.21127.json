First, we provide teachers with a\npotential syllabus for teaching survey research, including learning objectives,\nlectures, and examples of practical assignments. Thereafter, we provide\nactionable advice on how to teach the topics related to each learning\nobjective, including survey design, sampling, data collection, statistical and\nqualitative analysis, threats to validity and reliability, and ethical\nconsiderations. The chapter is complemented by online teaching resources,\nincluding slides covering an entire course.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gi7M7X0yc5CKIgeE0WicpsgVou32-6ZDz4-Py91q888","pdfSize":"629996"}
