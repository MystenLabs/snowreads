We consider the hypothesis that the GW\nsignature is produced by domain walls (DWs) arising in the doublet left-right\nsymmetric model (DLRSM) due to the spontaneous breaking of the discrete parity\nsymmetry. The DW network consists of two types of DWs, namely $Z_2$ and $LR$\nDWs, which have different surface tensions. We find kink solutions for both\ntypes of DWs and obtain the parametric dependence of the surface tension.\nConsidering the GW signal from the DLRSM DW model with and without the\ncontribution from supermassive black hole binaries, we perform a Bayesian\nanalysis using the PTA data to estimate the posterior distribution and identify\nbest-fit parameter ranges. The PTA data favors a parity-breaking scale of\n$\\mathcal{O}(10^5)$\\,GeV, and a biased potential $V_{\\rm{bias}}\\sim\n(\\mathcal{O}(100)\\,\\rm{MeV})^4$. The model with only DLRSM DWs is slightly\nfavored over the model where additional SMBHB contribution is considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SqJDaxRjKPBI_fO8eQiMey1anlCIXeOMibYQIY2KCKk","pdfSize":"994306"}
