When we specialize our result to the case of\nDrinfeld modules, an explicit formula for these third kind periods is\nestablished. We also prove the algebraic independence of periods of the first,\nthe second, and the third kind for Drinfeld modules of arbitrary rank. This\ngeneralizes prior results of Chang for rank $2$ Drinfeld modules.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
