The ultra-deep images\nobtained with the Gemini telescope, which has the deepest imaging data till\nnow, confirm the presence of tidal tails in DF4, suggesting its tidal\nformation. To enhance tidal effects, we consider the self-interaction among DM\nparticles. Using an N-body simulation in the scenario of self-interacting dark\nmatter (SIDM), we reproduce a DM-deficient galaxy that is consistent with all\nobservational data of DF4. Specifically, our simulation result yields an\nextremely low DM-to-star mass ratio and a radial surface brightness profile\nvery similar to that from deep images, showing accurate tidal features. By\nperforming simulations with similar tidal effects and various cross-sections of\nSIDM, we show a significant impact of SIDM on the DM-to-star mass ratio in the\ncentral region of the galaxy. Our work confirms the tidal formation of DF4 in\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZlJ2k_v3i5nd1FNszXOWgmXFzIf8Hi4_KJDNqmq9x2s","pdfSize":"462405","txDigest":"FLrTQoT3EWhBW67KAMqBL4bU8823QhLDiRjRWbxbe2eV","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
