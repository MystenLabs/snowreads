We view the effectiveness of Borel\nsummation as a regularity property of the solution, and we show that the\nsolutions of certain differential equation and integration problems are regular\nin this sense. By taking a geometric perspective on the Laplace and Borel\ntransforms, we also clarify why \"Borel regular\" solutions are associated with\nspecial points on the Borel plane. The particular classes of problems we look\nat are level 1 ODEs and exponential period integrals over one dimensional\nLefschetz thimbles. To expand the variety of examples available in the\nliterature, we treat various examples of these problems in detail.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
