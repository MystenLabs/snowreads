In this setting, the causal structure is identifiable, but,\nin general, it is not possible to identify the specific causal effects.\nInstead, a finite number of different causal effects result in the same\nobservational distribution. Most existing algorithms for identifying these\ncausal effects use overcomplete independent component analysis (ICA), which\noften suffers from convergence to local optima. Furthermore, the number of\nlatent variables must be known a priori. To address these issues, we propose an\nalgorithm that operates recursively rather than using overcomplete ICA. The\nalgorithm first infers a source, estimates the effect of the source and its\nlatent parents on their descendants, and then eliminates their influence from\nthe data. For both source identification and effect size estimation, we use\nrank conditions on matrices formed from higher-order cumulants. We prove\nasymptotic correctness under the mild assumption that locally, the number of\nlatent variables never exceeds the number of observed variables. Simulation\nstudies demonstrate that our method achieves comparable performance to\novercomplete ICA even though it does not know the number of latents in advance.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bcmXhhfLZuWTpzq-IbCOsUCM9CxzT8BvO-MkgiiMp4w","pdfSize":"341054"}
