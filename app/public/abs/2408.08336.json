We highlight pros and cons of various\nrepresentations and we discuss some methods of generating/switching between the\nrepresentations. We finally present two concrete applications in life science\nand industry. Despite its theoretical nature, our discussion is in general\nmotivated by, and biased towards real-world challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OmzjEPgWcwAxWWfpQAWlQMiD_1OIVHYQhTVoFWmTYpE","pdfSize":"4811942"}
