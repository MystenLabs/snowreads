With recent advances in deep learning, a\nplethora of deep learning-based approaches for Key Information Extraction have\nbeen proposed under the umbrella term Document Understanding that enable the\nprocessing of complex business documents. The goal of this systematic\nliterature review is an in-depth analysis of existing approaches in this domain\nand the identification of opportunities for further research. To this end, 96\napproaches published between 2017 and 2023 are analyzed in this study.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
