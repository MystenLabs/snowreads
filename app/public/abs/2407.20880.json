As an example, we explore the case of a metasurface that\nrotates a single input polarization, showing we can parameterize the set of\nequivalent reciprocal metasurfaces in terms of a single complex parameter.\nThrough allowing dissipation and gain within the response, the surface can have\nmany different functionalities in the orthogonal polarization, opening up a new\nroute for the design of multiplexed metasurfaces.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oa1m18DmGp-G08N3dzSucDq_8t8POKki4SeWS5VR4m4","pdfSize":"1209821"}
