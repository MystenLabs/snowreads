An undirected graph $G$ is said to be $(2,3)$-orientable if there exists\na friendly (0,1)-labeling of the vertices of $G$ such that about one third of\nthe edges are incident to vertices labeled the same. That is, there is some\ndigraph that is an orientation of $G$ that is $(2,3)$-cordial. Examples of the\nsmallest noncordial/non-$(2,3)$-orientable graphs are given and upper bounds on\nthe possible number of edges in a cordial/$(2,3)$-orientable graph are\npresented. It is also shown that if $T$ is a linear operator on the set of all\nundirected graphs on $n$ vertices that strongly preserves the set of cordial\ngraphs or the set of $(2,3)$-orientable graphs then $T$ is a vertex\npermutation..\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"vMeYAt2L-w3sguSOindByEkh8cMqgh0LRa72mYif9TI","pdfSize":"146649"}
