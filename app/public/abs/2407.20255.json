The study\nshows that the Microstructure and electrochemical properties of CSHs are\naffected by nitrogen doping. It is found that nitrogen is embedded in the\ncarbon layer with graphite nitrogen, pyridine nitrogen, and pyrrole nitrogen,\nso as to the surface morphology was changed and reduced the disorder of the\nmaterials. The electrochemical test results show that the introduction of\nnitrogen elements can increase the reversible capacity of the material, with\nthe first discharge capacity reaching above 426.35 mAh g-1, and the rate\nperformance also improves. When triethylenetetramine and pre-carbonized corn\nstarch are carbonized at a mass ratio of 1:9, the obtained material has a\nreversible capacity of 122.04 mAh g-1 at a rate of 2 C. During the\ncarbonization process, the nitrogen in triethylenetetramine is doped into the\ncarbon materials, improving the electrochemical performance of the material.\nKeywords: Lithium-ion battery; Hard carbon; Corn starch; Nitrogen doping;\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EYrR4NF2rBs5q1ZYCyTwtWjVR1S5EE67dY9n2W3tx64","pdfSize":"820438","objectId":"0xcb0b886fc4324a9d9a42a178719ca49c85bf7316c0f19b056934d199560a021f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
