Recent high-resolution MHD simulations of these streams showed a\nsignificant amplification of the intergalactic magnetic field in the shear\nlayer around them. In this work we estimate the magnetisation of high-redshift\ngalaxies that would result purely due to the accretion of already magnetised\ngas from cold streams. We use the mass inflow rates and saturated magnetic\nfield values from cold stream simulations as input to a simple analytic model\nthat calculates the galactic magnetic field purely from mass accretion. Our\nmodel predicts average magnetic field strengths that exceed $\\rm\\mu G$ values\nat $z\\sim 2-3$ for inflow rates above $0.1 \\, \\rm{M_{\\odot} yr^{-1}}$. For high\ninflow rates, our model results are consistent with the recent detection of a\nstrong magnetic field in a $z=2.6$ galaxy by Geach et al. (2023). Within the\nassumptions of our simple model, magnetised cold streams emerge as a viable\nmechanism for seeding a dynamically important galactic magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
