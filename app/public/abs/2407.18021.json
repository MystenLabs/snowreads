Our research presents an analysis of quantum randomized\nsmoothing, how data encoding and perturbation modeling approaches can be\nmatched to achieve meaningful robustness certificates. By utilizing an\ninnovative approach integrating Grover's algorithm, a quadratic sampling\nadvantage over classical randomized smoothing is achieved. This strategy\nnecessitates a basis state encoding, thus restricting the space of meaningful\nperturbations. We show how constrained $k$-distant Hamming weight perturbations\nare a suitable noise distribution here, and elucidate how they can be\nconstructed on a quantum computer. The efficacy of the proposed framework is\ndemonstrated on a time series classification task employing a Bag-of-Words\npre-processing solution. The advantage of quadratic sample reduction is\nrecovered especially in the regime with large number of samples. This may allow\nquantum computers to efficiently scale randomized smoothing to more complex\ntasks beyond the reach of classical methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
