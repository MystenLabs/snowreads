We aim to maximize the secrecy rate\nthrough port selection and power control. Although the problem is non-convex,\nwe show that the optimal solution can be found. Simulation results show that by\nusing the FAS technique and the proposed jamming scheme, the secrecy rate of\nthe system can be significantly increased.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
