Our UAVs integrate advanced sensor suites\nand robust motion planning algorithms to autonomously navigate and explore\nthese complex environments. We validated our approach through comprehensive\nsimulation experiments in PX4 Gazebo and Airsim Unreal Engine 4 environments.\nReal-world wind tests and exploration experiments demonstrate the UAVs'\ncapability to operate stably under diverse environmental conditions without GPS\nassistance. This study highlights the practicality and resilience of our UAV\nprototypes in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
