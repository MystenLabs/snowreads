{"id":"2408.04373","title":"The role of central places in exposure segregation","authors":"Andrew Renninger, Mateo Neira and Elsa Arcaute","authorsParsed":[["Renninger","Andrew",""],["Neira","Mateo",""],["Arcaute","Elsa",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 8 Aug 2024 11:15:45 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-09","timestamp":1723115745000,"abstract":"  Here we show that \"exposure segregation\" - the degree to which individuals of\none group are exposed to individuals of another in day-to-day mobility - is\ndependent on the structure of cities, and the importance of downtowns in\nparticular. Recent work uses aggregated data to claim that the location of\namenities can inhibit or facilitate interactions between groups: if a city is\nresidentially segregated, as many American cities are, then amenities between\nsegregated communities should encourage them to mix. We show that the\nrelationship between \"bridging\" amenities and socio-economic mixing breaks down\nwhen we examine the amenities themselves, rather than the urban aggregates. For\nexample, restaurants with locations that suggest low expected mixing do not,\nmuch of the time, have low mixing: there is only a weak correlation between\nbridging and mixing at the level of the restaurant, despite a strong\ncorrelation at the level of the supermarket. This is because downtowns - and\nthe bundle of amenities that define them - tend not to be situated in bridge\nareas but play an important role in drawing diverse groups together.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
