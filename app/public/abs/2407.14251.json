To\naddress these, we introduced personalized federated learning in multi-tier\narchitecture (PerMFL) to obtain optimized and personalized local models when\nthere are known team structures across devices. We provide theoretical\nguarantees of PerMFL, which offers linear convergence rates for smooth strongly\nconvex problems and sub-linear convergence rates for smooth non-convex\nproblems. We conduct numerical experiments demonstrating the robust empirical\nperformance of PerMFL, outperforming the state-of-the-art in multiple\npersonalized federated learning tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
