This approach leverages a single set of\nreduced bases, allowing for efficient and simultaneous emulation across\nmultiple channels and potential parameters, significantly reducing\ncomputational storage and accelerating calculations. Demonstrated through\n\\(n\\)+\\(^{40}\\)Ca and \\(^{11}\\)Be+\\(^{64}\\)Zn elastic scattering, our method\nachieves high accuracy and efficiency. This emulator exhibits stable and\nreliable performance without anomalies inherent in other techniques, showcasing\nits robustness.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
