In less than a year practitioners and researchers witnessed a rapid\nand wide implementation of Generative Artificial Intelligence. The daily\navailability of new models proposed by practitioners and researchers has\nenabled quick adoption. Textual GAIs capabilities enable researchers worldwide\nto explore new generative scenarios simplifying and hastening all timeconsuming\ntext generation and analysis tasks.\n  Motivation. The exponentially growing number of publications in our field\nwith the increased accessibility to information due to digital libraries makes\nconducting systematic literature reviews and mapping studies an effort and\ntimeinsensitive task Stemmed from this challenge we investigated and envisioned\nthe role of GAIs in evidencebased software engineering.\n  Future Directions. Based on our current investigation we will follow up the\nvision with the creation and empirical validation of a comprehensive suite of\nmodels to effectively support EBSE researchers\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"klxNED54egpXk5ds01X_Rm9iTGtsMzrYKnDSs0Iyb9U","pdfSize":"116266"}
