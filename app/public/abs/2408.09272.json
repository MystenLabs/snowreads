We show that the per-tile entropy is bounded above by $\\log_2 n$. This\nbound improves the best previously known bounds of $n-1$ for general regions,\nand the asymptotic upper bound of $\\log_2 (en)$ for growing rectangles, due to\nChen and Kargin.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
