The average on-resistance was ~75 ohm. mm (~21\nmiliohm. cm^2) for LGD = 20 microns. Breakdown voltage reached >3 kV (tool\nlimit) before passivation however it reduced to ~2 kV after SiN surface\npassivation and field plates. The apparent high breakdown voltage prior to\npassivation can possibly be attributed to the field plate effect of the charged\ntrap states of the surface. The breakdown voltage and RON demonstrated a strong\nlinear correlation in a scattered plot with ~50 measured transistors. In pulsed\nIV measurements with 100 microsecond pulse width and 40 V of off-state bias\n(tool limit), the dynamic RON increased by ~5% compared to DC RON and current\ncollapse was <10%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kHjzhO5Kz_Uh1uc5FuvnhPf__FdP1venv_1cmKU4Y70","pdfSize":"1079607","objectId":"0x9e29bf778046e5e7508ce07bb2296bea88ecb9358184b4bd9e2666c9430ed894","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
