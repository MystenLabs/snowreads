Of particular focus is the potential for this material\nto exhibit a phonon thermal Hall effect induced by spin-phonon interactions. We\nfind that spin-orbit coupling significantly enriches the form of these\ninteractions, and imbues them with chirality that is conducive to generating\nfinite phonon Berry curvatures. We show that this leads to a phonon thermal\nHall effect that qualitatively reproduces the measured field dependence of\n$\\kappa_{xy}$ without requiring a field-induced spin liquid.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
