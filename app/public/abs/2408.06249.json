The parameter associated\nwith the geometrical deformation in the Glauber model is tuned to reproduce the\nempirical multiplicity probability distributions correctly. Subsequently, the\nparticle spectra and collective flows for Au+Au and U+U collisions are\nevaluated using a hybrid hydrodynamic code CHESS. We analyze the effects of the\ndegrees of freedom associated with the IC on the final-state flow harmonics by\nexploring the parameter space of the former. The connection between the\ndeformation parameters, specifically $\\beta_2$ and $\\beta_4$, and the flow\nanisotropies is scrutinized. In particular, deviations in elliptic flow at\n$p_{\\mathrm{T}}\\sim 2$ GeV are observed at smaller values of $\\beta_2$ in Au+Au\ncollisions. On the other hand, for U+U collisions, the averaged overall flow\nharmonics are found to be less sensitive to the geometrical parameters. Despite\nthe difference in the model's specifications, our findings largely confirm\nthose obtained in the literature employing different approaches, which indicate\nthat flow harmonics can be used as a sensible probe for the initial geometry\nfluctuations and to discriminate between different theoretical models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
