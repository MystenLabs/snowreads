While fiber frequency combs\nhave demonstrated the most stable optical links, they are not ideal for\napplications that require very low SWaP-C. Here, we demonstrate two-way time\nand frequency transfer using electro-optic combs that have a direct path to\nfull chip-scale integration. This two-way electro-optic time and frequency\ntransfer system demonstrated instabilities as low as 15 fs at 1 s of averaging\ntime. These results show a pathway to highly stable, agile and low SWaP-C time\ntransfer networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
