However, prevailing methods often erroneously focus on\nbackground areas, neglecting the capture of genuinely effective discriminative\ninformation from the subject, thus impeding practical application. To\nfacilitate research into the impact of background noise on models and enhance\ntheir ability to concentrate on the subject's discriminative features, we\npropose an engineered pipeline that leverages the capabilities of SAM and Detic\nto create fine-grained datasets with only foreground subjects, devoid of\nbackground. Extensive cross-experiments validate this approach as a\npreprocessing step prior to training, enhancing algorithmic performance and\nholding potential for further modal expansion of the data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
