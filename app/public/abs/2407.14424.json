For smooth geometries, we show optimal\nconvergence rates in the $L^2(\\Omega)$ norm for the scalar variable.\nConvergence rates for the $L^2(\\Omega)$-norm error of the gradient of the\nscalar variable as well as vectorial variable are also derived. Numerical\nexamples illustrate the analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
