Our tests provide promising results with 65\\% accuracy in genre\nclassification and 79\\% accuracy in success prediction, leveraging a DistilBERT\nmodel for genre classification and BERT embeddings for release year prediction.\nSupport Vector Machines outperformed other models in predicting the release\nyear, achieving the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) of 14.18. Our study\noffers insights that have the potential to revolutionize our relationship with\nmusic by addressing the shortcomings of current approaches in properly\nunderstanding the emotional intricacies of song lyrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
