These engagement surfaces\nperform an increasing range of functions, including recommending new products\nfor purchase, reminding customers of their orders and providing delivery\nnotifications. Understanding the causal effect of engagement surfaces on value\ndriven for customers and businesses remains an open scientific question. In\nthis paper, we develop a dynamic causal model at scale to disentangle value\nattributable to an ES, and to assess its effectiveness. We demonstrate the\napplication of this model to inform business decision-making by understanding\nreturns on investment in the ES, and identifying product lines and features\nwhere the ES adds the most value.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gjRis-1E9r2SXP6_t0fYeAtECJpmaDxJpT5nxgtHNBM","pdfSize":"1278868"}
