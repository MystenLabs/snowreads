TMNRE avoids an explicit\ncalculation of the likelihood, which instead is estimated from simulated data,\nunlike in traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. This\nconsiderably speeds up, by several orders of magnitude, the computation of the\nposterior distributions, which allows to perform the Bayesian analysis of an\notherwise computationally prohibitive number of benchmark points. In this\narticle we demonstrate that, in the TMNRE framework, it is possible to include,\ncombine, and remove different datasets in a modular fashion, which is fast and\nsimple as there is no need to re-train the machine learning algorithm or to\ndefine a combined likelihood. In order to assess the performance of this\nmethod, we consider the case of WIMP DM with spin-dependent and independent\ninteractions with protons and neutrons in a xenon experiment. After validating\nour results with MCMC, we employ the TMNRE procedure to determine the regions\nwhere the DM parameters can be reconstructed. Finally, we present CADDENA, a\nPython package that implements the modular Bayesian analysis of direct\ndetection experiments described in this work.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
