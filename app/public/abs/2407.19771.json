Here we determine the characteristic polynomial of\n$\\mathscr{P}(\\mathbb{Z}_m \\times \\mathbb{Z}_{n})$ for any positive integers $m$\nand $n$. Additionally, for some particular values of $m$ and $n$, we simplify\nthe above characteristic polynomials and provide the full spectrum in a few\ncases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
