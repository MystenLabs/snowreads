The results show that despite radial bar charts are the most\npopular visualization for activity data on smartwatches, the users' preferences\nmight be influenced by their familiarity with these charts. These findings from\nthis survey will be valuable for designers, developers, and researchers who are\ninterested in creating innovative and effective solutions for activity\nvisualization on smartwatches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
