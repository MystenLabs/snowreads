This study presents a novel\napproach using Large Language Models (LLMs) to detect Hands-on-Keyboard (HOK)\ncyberattacks. Our method involves converting endpoint activity data into\nnarrative forms that LLMs can analyze to distinguish between normal operations\nand potential HOK attacks. We address the challenges of interpreting endpoint\ndata by segmenting narratives into windows and employing a dual training\nstrategy. The results demonstrate that LLM-based models have the potential to\noutperform traditional machine learning methods, offering a promising direction\nfor enhancing EDR capabilities and apply LLMs in cybersecurity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9MsdkMqV7ZPXh2iFO4CkjtTcNXGR54x50HUJa4i7ncY","pdfSize":"471567","txDigest":"C2F1ow91FjWKSR4VSjhmiTvj15yHevTT4MeQFJ2SW5u8","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
