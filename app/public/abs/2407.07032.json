This is why measuring these has become important for both industry and\nscientific applications. For industrial applications, the greatest need is to\nmeasure dense particulates, in-situ, and non-destructively. In theory, this\ncould be achieved with acoustics: the standard method is to send an acoustic\nwave through the particulate and then attempt to measure the effective wave\nspeed and attenuation. A major obstacle here is that it is not clear how to\nrelate the effective wave speed and attenuation to the reflection and\ntransmission coefficients, which are far easier to measure. This is because it\nhas been very difficult to mathematically account for different background\nmediums. In this paper we resolve this obstacle. We present how to account for\ndifferent background mediums for a simple case, to help comprehension: a\nhalfspace filled with a random particulate, where the background of the\nhalfspace is different to the exterior medium. The key to solving this problem\nwas to derive a systematic extension of a widely used closure approximation:\nthe quasi-crystalline approximation (QCA). We present some numerical results to\ndemonstrate that the reflection coefficient can be easily calculated for a\nbroad range of frequencies and particle properties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
