If multiple\npublications are selected as seeds, specific suggestions for related literature\ncan be made based on the number of incoming and outgoing citation links to this\nselection. Interactively adding recommended publications to the selection\nrefines the next suggestion and incrementally builds a relevant collection of\npublications. Following this approach, the paper presents a search and foraging\napproach, PUREsuggest, which combines citation-based suggestions with augmented\nvisualizations of the citation network. The focus and novelty of the approach\nis, first, the transparency of how the rankings are explained visually and,\nsecond, that the process can be steered through user-defined keywords, which\nreflect topics of interests. The system can be used to build new literature\ncollections, to update and assess existing ones, as well as to use the\ncollected literature for identifying relevant experts in the field. We\nevaluated the recommendation approach through simulated sessions and performed\na user study investigating search strategies and usage patterns supported by\nthe interface.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
