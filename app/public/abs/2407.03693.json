We consider the cases where\nthere is a connected non-Abelian symmetry group containing the torus. For\n$\\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-manifolds, we show that the only possibility are structures\nwith a cohomogeneity-two action of $T^{3} \\times \\mathrm{SU}(2)$. We then\nspecialise the analysis to holonomy $G_{2}$, to Calabi-Yau geometries in real\ndimension six and to hyperK\\\"ahler four-manifolds. Finally, we consider weakly\ncoherent triples on $\\mathbb{R} \\times \\mathrm{SU}(2)$, and their extensions\nover singular orbits, to give local examples in the $\\mathrm{Spin}(7)$-case\nthat have singular orbits where the stabiliser is of rank one.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
