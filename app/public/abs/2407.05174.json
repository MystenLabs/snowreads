This\nleads the performance of FL to be significantly degraded, as the global model\ntends to struggle to converge. To solve this problem, we propose Differentially\nPrivate Synthetic Data Aided Federated Learning Using Foundation Models\n(DPSDA-FL), a novel data augmentation strategy that aids in homogenizing the\nlocal data present on the clients' side. DPSDA-FL improves the training of the\nlocal models by leveraging differentially private synthetic data generated from\nfoundation models. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by\nevaluating it on the benchmark image dataset: CIFAR-10. Our experimental\nresults have shown that DPSDA-FL can improve class recall and classification\naccuracy of the global model by up to 26% and 9%, respectively, in FL with\nNon-IID issues.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"va2RSO1ZU46WrEfilblib5HKcYPMJpNjuMyclAgNC6E","pdfSize":"922287"}
