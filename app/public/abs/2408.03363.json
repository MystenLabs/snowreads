Our formalism applies\nto simple Michelson interferometers and can be generalized to more advanced\nsetups. We demonstrate that the proper time observable for a plane GW is\nequivalent to the detector strain commonly used by the GW community, though now\nthe common framework can be easily generalized for other types of signals, such\nas dark matter clumps or spacetime fluctuations from quantum gravity. We\nprovide a simple recipe for computing the proper time observable for a general\nmetric perturbation in linearized gravity and explicitly show that it is\ninvariant under diffeomorphisms of the perturbation, as any physical observable\nshould be.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
