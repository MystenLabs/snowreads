Our study is carried out at spatial\ninfinity where minimal and non-minimal couplings exhibit very different\nasymptotic properties: while the former generically cannot be neglected at\ninfinity, the latter can. Electromagnetic non-minimal couplings are in that\nrespect similar to gravitational minimal couplings, which are also\nasymptotically subdominant. Because the non-minimally interacting model is\nasymptotic to the free one, its asymptotic symmetries are the same as the ones\nof the free theory, i.e., described by angle-dependent $u(1)$ gauge\ntransformations. We also analyse the duality symmetry and show that it is\nbroken to its compact subgroup by the asymptotic conditions. Finally, we\nconsider logarithmic gauge transformations and use them to simplify the\nsymmetry algebra.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
