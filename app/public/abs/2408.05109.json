The performance of NL2SQL has been\ngreatly enhanced with the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs). In this\nsurvey, we provide a comprehensive review of NL2SQL techniques powered by LLMs,\ncovering its entire lifecycle from the following four aspects: (1) Model:\nNL2SQL translation techniques that tackle not only NL ambiguity and\nunder-specification, but also properly map NL with database schema and\ninstances; (2) Data: From the collection of training data, data synthesis due\nto training data scarcity, to NL2SQL benchmarks; (3) Evaluation: Evaluating\nNL2SQL methods from multiple angles using different metrics and granularities;\nand (4) Error Analysis: analyzing NL2SQL errors to find the root cause and\nguiding NL2SQL models to evolve. Moreover, we provide a rule of thumb for\ndeveloping NL2SQL solutions. Finally, we discuss the research challenges and\nopen problems of NL2SQL in the LLMs era.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
