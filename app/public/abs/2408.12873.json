For this regular BH\nsolution with spherical symmetry, we examine the stability of the Cauchy\nhorizon from both classic and quantum mechanics viewpoints. We find that the\nclassical perturbations do not lead to mass inflation at the Cauchy horizon,\nindicating classically stability, while quantum fluctuations cause it to be\nunstable quantum mechanically.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9h5zyBUVGkdKpDe2hSjiVsfmtsteirG4UkVBkHucTz4","pdfSize":"160084"}
