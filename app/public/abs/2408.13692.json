This process, called rheotaxis, has been studied extensively in\nNewtonian fluids. However, most microorganisms thrive in non-Newtonian fluids\nthat contain suspended polymers such as mucus and biofilms. Here, we\ninvestigate the rheotatic behavior of E. coli near walls in non-Newtonian\nfluids. Our experiments demonstrate that bacterial upstream swimming is\nenhanced by an order of magnitude in shear-thinning polymeric fluids relative\nto Newtonian fluids. This result is explained by direct numerical simulations,\nrevealing a torque that promotes the alignment of bacteria against the flow.\nFrom this analysis, we develop a theoretical model that accurately describes\nexperimental rheotatic data in both Newtonian and shear-thinning fluids.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
