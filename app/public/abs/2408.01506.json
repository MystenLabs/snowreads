Our algorithm\nleverages reinforcement learning, offering increased flexibility in reproducing\nvarious noise models compared to conventional techniques such as randomized\nbenchmarking or heuristic noise models. The effectiveness of the RL agent has\nbeen validated through simulations and testing on real superconducting qubits.\nAdditionally, we provide practical use-case examples for the study of renowned\nquantum algorithms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qlGCoz-8CcMorCb-dfKu0pLfqYEaTkNZcFZNm9HjZMk","pdfSize":"707901"}
