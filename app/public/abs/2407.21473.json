Perfect strategies are basic\ntools for some fundamental results in quantum computation and crucial resources\nfor some applications in quantum information. Here, we address the problem of\nproducing qudit-qudit perfect quantum strategies with a small number of\nsettings. For that, we exploit a recent result showing that any perfect quantum\nstrategy induces a Kochen-Specker set. We identify a family of KS sets in even\ndimension $d \\ge 6$ that, for many dimensions, require the smallest number of\northogonal bases known: $d+1$. This family was only defined for some $d$. We\nfirst extend the family to infinitely many more dimensions. Then, we show the\noptimal way to use each of these sets to produce a bipartite perfect strategy\nwith minimum input cardinality. As a result, we present a family of perfect\nquantum strategies in any $(2,d-1,d)$ Bell scenario, with $d = 2^kp^m$ for $p$\nprime, $m \\geq k \\geq 0$ (excluding $m=k=0$), $d = 8p$ for $p \\geq 19$, $d=kp$\nfor $p > ((k-2)2^{k-2})^2$ whenever there exists a Hadamard matrix of order\n$k$, other sporadic examples, as well as a recursive construction that produces\nperfect quantum strategies for infinitely many dimensions $d$ from any\ndimension $d'$ with a perfect quantum strategy. We identify their associated\nBell inequalities and prove that they are not tight, which provides a second\ncounterexample to a conjecture of 2007.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
