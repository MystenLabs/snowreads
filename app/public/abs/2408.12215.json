Yet, the details of their non-trivial infrared limit\nhave remained open in general. Here we suggest that non-perturbative\nrenormalization group flow into the strong-coupling regime induces strong\nfluctuations of the theta-parameter, with the consequence that the instanton\ndensity is suppressed, the target-space topology effectively altered, and the\ntarget-space metric driven off reality and into geometrostasis. Assuming this\nheuristic scenario and combining it with a Cauchy process of target-space\ndeformation, we present a detailed argument that the O(3) nonlinear sigma model\nat theta = pi, known to be the effective field theory for critical\nantiferromagnetic quantum spin chains with large half-integer spin,\nrenormalizes to the conformal field theory of a U(1) boson compactified at a\nspecial radius with SU(2) symmetry. A closely related scenario applies to\nPruisken's nonlinear sigma model for the integer quantum Hall transition.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
