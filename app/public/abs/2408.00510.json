Due to manufacturing constraints, the\noptimization problem falls into the class of NP-complete mixed-integer\nnonlinear programming problems. To tackle this difficulty, we obtain a relaxed\nproblem from a multiplicative split of the relative density and a penalization\napproach. The sensitivities of the objective function are derived such that any\ngradient-based solver might be applied for the iterative update of the design\nvariables. In a next step, we introduce a material model that is parametric in\nthe design variables of interest and suitable to describe the isotropic\ndeformation behavior of quasi-stochastic lattices. For that, we derive and\nimplement further physical constraints and enhance a physics-augmented neural\nnetwork from the literature that was formulated initially for rhombic\nmaterials. Finally, to illustrate the applicability of the method, we\nincorporate the material model into our computational framework and exemplary\noptimize two-and three-dimensional benchmark structures as well as a complex\naircraft component.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
