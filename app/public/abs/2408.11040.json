In this problem, we aim to\noptimize a concave utility function depending on the flows over a graph.\nHowever, unlike the classic network flows literature, we also allow for a\nconcave relationship between the input and output flows of edges. This\nnonlinear gain describes many physical phenomena, including losses in power\nnetwork transmission lines. We outline an efficient algorithm for solving this\nproblem which parallelizes over the graph edges. We provide an open source\nimplementation of this algorithm in the Julia programming language package\nConvexFlows.jl. This package includes an interface to easily specify these flow\nproblems. We conclude by walking through an example of solving for an optimal\npower flow using ConvexFlows.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
