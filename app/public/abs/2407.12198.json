The recent advent of moir\\'{e}\nsuperlattices provided a versatile platform with great tunability to explore\ndoping physics in systems with strong interplay between strong correlation and\nnontrivial topology. Here we study the effect of electron doping in the quantum\nanomalous Hall insulator realized in TMD moir\\'{e} superlatice at filling\n$\\nu=1$, which can be described by the canonical Kane-Mele-Hubbard model. By\nsolving the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model using an unrestricted real-space\nHartree-Fock method, we find that doping generates quantum anomalous Hall\ncrystals (QAHC) and topological domain walls. In the QAHC, the doping induces\nskyrmion spin textures, which hosts one or two electrons in each skyrmion as\nin-gap states. The skyrmions crystallize into a lattice, with the lattice\nparameter being tunable by the density of doped electrons. Remarkably, we find\nthat the QAHC can survive even in the limit of vanishing Kane-Mele topological\ngap for a significant range of fillings. Furthermore, doping can also induce\ndomain walls separating topologically distinct domains with different electron\ndensities, hosting chiral localized modes.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Pl774c2a8dAmDEQhcnvWuE8ZwS2NolVDz490CcWZnag","pdfSize":"17399328"}
