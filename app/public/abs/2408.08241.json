Here, a family of\nparameter-dependent integrable lattice models is presented, which realize\ndifferent TDLs in a given CFT as the parameter is varied. These models are\nbased on the general quantum-inverse scattering construction, and involve\ninhomogeneities of the spectral parameter. Both defect hamiltonians and\n(defect) line operators are obtained in closed form. By varying the\ninhomogeneities, renormalization group flows between different TDLs (such as\nthe Verlinde lines associated with the Virasoro primaries $(1,s)$ and $(s,1)$\nin diagonal minimal CFTs) are then studied using different aspects of the\nBethe-ansatz as well as ab-initio numerical techniques. Relationships with the\nanisotropic Kondo model as well as its non-Hermitian version are briefly\ndiscussed\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tkphQc-4oNKDqBF7OqnKssTIsXx3DP1Xw_jBl0vh1yo","pdfSize":"1328890"}
