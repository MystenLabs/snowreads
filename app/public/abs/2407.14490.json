However, the optimal\nparameter searching process of QAOA is greatly affected by noise. Larger\nproblems yield bigger graphs, requiring more qubits and making their outcomes\nhighly noise-sensitive. This paper introduces Red-QAOA, leveraging energy\nlandscape concentration via a simulated annealing-based graph reduction.\n  Red-QAOA creates a smaller (distilled) graph with nearly identical parameters\nto the original graph. The distilled graph produces a smaller quantum circuit\nand thus reduces noise impact. At the end of the optimization, Red-QAOA employs\nthe parameters from the distilled graph on the original graph and continues the\nparameter search on the original graph. Red-QAOA outperforms state-of-the-art\nGraph Neural Network (GNN)-based pooling techniques on 3200 real-world\nproblems. Red-QAOA reduced node and edge counts by 28% and 37%, respectively,\nwith a mean square error of only 2%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
