We test this conjecture in various dimensions and\nwith many examples involving different continuous symmetry structures,\nincluding non-Abelian and non-invertible symmetries, as well as higher groups.\nFor instance, we find that many Abelian SymTFTs are dual to free theories of\nGoldstone bosons or generalized Maxwell fields, while non-Abelian SymTFTs\nrelate to non-linear sigma models with target spaces defined by the symmetry\ngroups. We also extend our analysis to include the non-invertible\n$\\mathbb{Q}/\\mathbb{Z}$ axial symmetry, finding it to be dual to axion-Maxwell\ntheory, and a non-Abelian 2-group structure in four dimensions, deriving a new\nparity-violating interaction that has implications for the low-energy dynamics\nof U(N) QCD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
