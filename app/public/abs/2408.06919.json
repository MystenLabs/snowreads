In this article, we prove a relative version for Lagrangians\nwith Legendrian boundary. This gives interior chords of arbitrary large length,\nprovided the twist condition introduced in arXiv:2011.06562 is satisfied. The\nmotivation comes from finding spatial consecutive collision orbits of arbitrary\nlarge length in the spatial circular restricted three-body problem, which are\nrelevant for gravitational assist in the context of orbital mechanics. This is\nan application of a local version of wrapped Floer homology, which we introduce\nas the open string analogue of local Floer homology for closed strings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
