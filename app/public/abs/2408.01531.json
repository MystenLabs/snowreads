After a brief discussion of the fundamentals of the kinetic\ntheory in curved spacetime, the Einstein-Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations in\nterms of gauge invariant quantities is established without neglecting the\nequations of motion associated with the dynamics of the non-radiative\ncomponents of the metric tensor. The established theory is applied to a\nnon-collisional electron-positron plasma, leading to a dispersion relation for\ngravitational waves in this model system. The problem of Landau damping is\naddressed and some attention is given to the issue of the energy exchanges\nbetween the plasma and the gravitational wave. In a future paper, a more\ncomplete set of approximate dispersion relations for waves and oscillations in\nplasmas will be presented, including the dynamics of non-radiative components\nof the metric tensor, with special attention to the problems of the Landau\ndamping and of the energy exchanges between matter, the electromagnetic field\nand the gravitational field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
