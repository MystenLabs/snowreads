These states have been proposed as promising\ncandidates to study Majorana bound states (MBSs) in a highly tunable setup.\nHowever, it is unclear whether and how PMMs observed in real systems are\nactually connected to the topological phase of the full Kitaev chain. Here, we\nstudy PMMs using a microscopic model and show that, in the long chain limit,\nnot all PMMs are related to topological states. Rather, in long chains, some\nPMMs evolve into trivial highly localized low-energy states. We provide an\nanalytical explanation for the occurrence of these states and show that there\nis no clear conductance signature that is able to distinguish PMMs that evolve\ninto true topological states from PMMs that evolve into trivial states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
