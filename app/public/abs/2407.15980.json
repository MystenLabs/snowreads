This answers an open problem of Yan, Xiang and Dragan [CGTA\n'12] and improves their result that requires removing the 3-hop neighborhood of\ntwo shortest paths. Our proof uses very different ideas, including Delaunay\ntriangulations and a generalization of the celebrated balanced separator\ntheorem of Lipton and Tarjan [J. Appl. Math. '79] to systems of\nnon-intersecting paths.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
