BPM looks at these processes\nwith analysis techniques that assume a clearly defined start and end. However,\nnot all processes adhere to this logic, with the consequence that their\nbehavior cannot be appropriately captured by BPM analysis techniques. This\npaper addresses this research problem at a conceptual level. More specifically,\nwe introduce the notion of vitalizing business processes that target the\nlifecycle process of one or more entities. We show the existence of lifecycle\nprocesses in many industries and that their appropriate conceptualizations pave\nthe way for the definition of suitable modeling and analysis techniques. This\npaper provides a set of requirements for their analysis, and a\nconceptualization of lifecycle and vitalizing processes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
