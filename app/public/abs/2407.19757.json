This approach illuminates various aspects of\ndecorated TQFTs via geometry of the target space $X$ of RW theory. Through the\nformulation of the Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (KZ) equation within this geometric\nframework, we derive the corresponding braiding and associator morphisms. We\ndiscuss applications where the target space of RW theory emerges as the Coulomb\nbranch of a compactified 6d SCFT or Little String Theory, with the latter being\nparticularly intriguing as it results in a compact $X$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
