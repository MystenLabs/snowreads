In modern applications with\ncomplex UI hierarchies, navigating to different UI elements poses a significant\naccessibility challenge. Users must listen to screen reader audio descriptions\nand press relevant keyboard keys one at a time. This paper introduces Wheeler,\na novel three-wheeled, mouse-shaped stationary input device, to address this\nissue. Informed by participatory sessions, Wheeler enables blind users to\nnavigate up to three hierarchical levels in an app independently using three\nwheels instead of navigating just one level at a time using a keyboard. The\nthree wheels also offer versatility, allowing users to repurpose them for other\ntasks, such as 2D cursor manipulation. A study with 12 blind users indicates a\nsignificant reduction (40%) in navigation time compared to using a keyboard.\nFurther, a diary study with our blind co-author highlights Wheeler's additional\nbenefits, such as accessing UI elements with partial metadata and facilitating\nmixed-ability collaboration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
