The charge on the shell is linearly related to the matter content.\nFor the dynamical stability, a concise inequality is obtained, valid for any\nbarotropic equation of state that relates the pressure with the energy density\nat the throat. A thermodynamical description of the system is introduced, which\nleads to the temperature and the electric potentials. Adopting a linear\nequation of state for the pressure and a definite form for the entropy\nfunction, the set of equilibrium configurations that are both dynamically and\nthermodynamically stable is found.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
