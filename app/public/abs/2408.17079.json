Arranging the atoms in an incommensurate\nlattice, with respect to the resonator mode, the scattering can be suppressed\nby destructive interference: resulting in a subradiant atomic array. We show\nhowever, that strong coupling leads to a drastic modification of the excitation\nspectrum, as evidenced by well-resolved vacuum Rabi splitting in the intensity\nof the fluctuations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the strongly coupled\nvacuum mode induces polarization rotation in the linear scattering, which is\nincompatible with a linear polarizability model of isotropic objects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
