In this article, we give a new\nproof that $p(D,\\mathcal{C})$, the smallest norm of a split prime\n$\\mathfrak{p}\\in\\mathcal{C}$, satisfies $p(D,\\mathcal{C})\\ll D^L$ for some\nabsolute constant $L$. Our proof is sieve theoretic. In particular, this allows\nus to avoid the use of log-free zero-density estimates (for class group\n$L$-functions) and the repulsion properties of exceptional zeros, two crucial\ninputs to previous proofs of this result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
