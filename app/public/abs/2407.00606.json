In\nthis way, game comonads provide a new bridge between categorical methods\ndeveloped for semantics, and the combinatorial and algorithmic methods of\nresource-sensitive model theory.\n  We give an overview of this framework and outline some of its applications,\nincluding the study of homomorphism counting results in finite model theory,\nand of equi-resource homomorphism preservation theorems in logic using the\naxiomatic setting of arboreal categories. Finally, we describe some homotopical\nideas that arise naturally in the context of game comonads.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y6HLiagslRswCH_iR0ZFA2WB1R1DmlxkFPJ2agbZCHc","pdfSize":"607360"}
