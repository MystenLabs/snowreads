We constructed a new type of solutions which\nare different from the ones obtained in \\cite{PW}. This new family of solutions\nto system have a more complex concentration structure and are centered at the\npoints lying on the top and the bottom circles of a cylinder with height $h$.\nMoreover, we examine the effect of nonlinear coupling on the solution\nstructure. In the repulsive case, we construct an unbounded sequence of\nnon-radial positive vector solutions of segregated type. In the attractive\ncase, we construct an unbounded sequence of non-radial positive vector\nsolutions of synchronized type. Moreover, we prove that there exist infinitely\nmany sign-changing solutions whose energy can be arbitrarily large.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
