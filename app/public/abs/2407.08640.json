However,\nthe significant domain gap between the source and target modalities poses a\nconsiderable challenge for cross-domain matching. Existing literature primarily\nfocuses on developing HFR approaches for specific pairs of face modalities,\nnecessitating the explicit training of models for each source-target\ncombination. In this work, we introduce a novel framework designed to train a\nmodality-agnostic HFR method capable of handling multiple modalities during\ninference, all without explicit knowledge of the target modality labels. We\nachieve this by implementing a computationally efficient automatic routing\nmechanism called Switch Style Modulation Blocks (SSMB) that trains various\ndomain expert modulators which transform the feature maps adaptively reducing\nthe domain gap. Our proposed SSMB can be trained end-to-end and seamlessly\nintegrated into pre-trained face recognition models, transforming them into\nmodality-agnostic HFR models. We have performed extensive evaluations on HFR\nbenchmark datasets to demonstrate its effectiveness. The source code and\nprotocols will be made publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
