Several generalizations of the\nmodel have long been proposed, emphasizing their dynamic behavior but paying\nless attention to their spectroscopy. Here, we obtain analytical expressions of\nthe time-dependent spectral response of a nonlinear Jaynes-Cummings model based\non deformed field operators. We show that the long-time response of the\nresulting nonlinear cavity field resembles the one experimentally obtained in\nthe strong-dispersive regime of circuit quantum electrodynamics. The spectrum\nis intrinsically asymmetric with the nonlinear coupling, a signature of the\nimpossibility of getting resonant conditions for finite field excitations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
