We\npresent a computational tool coined AtmoSpec, which can predict a quantitative\nphotoabsorption cross-section for volatile organic compounds by using\ncomputational photochemistry. The user enters the molecule of interest as a\nSMILES code and, after selecting a level of theory for the electronic structure\n(and waiting for the calculations to take place), is presented with a\nphotoabsorption cross-section for the low-energy conformers and an estimate of\nthe photolysis rate coefficient for different standardized actinic fluxes. More\nspecifically, AtmoSpec is an automated workflow for the nuclear ensemble\napproach, an efficient technique to approximate the absolute intensities and\nexcitation wavelengths of a photoabsorption cross-section for a molecule in the\ngas phase. This work provides background information on the nuclear ensemble\napproach, a guided example of a typical AtmoSpec calculation, details about the\narchitecture of the code, and the current limitations and future developments\nof this tool.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
