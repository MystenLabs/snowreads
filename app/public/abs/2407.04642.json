For\nexample, for any odd integer $n>1$ with $(\\frac dn)=-1$ we prove that $\\det [\n(\\frac{i^2+cij+dj^2}{n})]_{0\\le i,j\\le n-1}$ is divisible by $\\varphi(n)^2$,\nwhere $(\\frac{\\cdot}{n})$ is the Jacobi symbol and $\\varphi$ is Euler's totient\nfunction. This confirms a previous conjecture of the second author.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
