This work focuses on a\nvariant of AA in which multiple Picard iterations are performed between each AA\nstep, referred to as the Alternating Anderson-Picard (AAP) method. Despite\nintroducing more 'slow' Picard iterations, this method has been shown to be\nefficient and even more robust in both linear and nonlinear cases. However,\nthere is a lack of theoretical analysis for AAP in the nonlinear case, which\nthis paper aims to address. We show the equivalence between AAP and a\nmultisecant-GMRES method that uses GMRES to solve a multisecant linear system\nat each iteration. More interestingly, the incorporation of Picard iterations\nand AA establishes a deep connection between AAP and the Newton-GMRES method.\nThis connection is evident in terms of the multisecant matrix, the approximate\nJacobian inverse, search direction, and optimization gain -- an essential\nfactor in the convergence analysis of AA. We show that these terms converge to\ntheir corresponding terms in the Newton-GMRES method as the residual approaches\nzero. Consequently, we build the convergence analysis of AAP. To validate our\ntheoretical findings, numerical examples are provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
