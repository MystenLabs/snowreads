Toward this end, scanning\ntunneling spectroscopy (STS) has demonstrated atomic-scale sensitivity, but is\nnot easily scalable for applications, whereas device-based approaches rely on\nembedding these systems within a solid-state tunnel junction (TJ) and are not\ngenerally applicable. Here we demonstrate an all-electrical readout mechanism\nfor these quasi-0D states that is modular and general, dramatically expanding\nthe phase space of accessible quantum systems and providing an approach that is\namenable to scaling and integration with other solid-state quantum\ntechnologies. Our approach relies on the creation of high-quality tunnel\njunctions via the mechanical exfoliation and stacking of multi-layer graphene\n(MLG) and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) to encapsulate the target quantum\nsystem (QS) in an MLG/hBN/QS/hBN/MLG heterostructure. This structure allows for\nelectronic spectroscopy and readout of candidate quantum systems through a\ncombination of Coulomb and spin-blockade, providing access to entire classes of\nquantum systems that have previously only been accessible via optical\nspectroscopy or magnetic resonance measurements of large ensembles, if at all.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
