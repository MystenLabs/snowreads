Most\nTCP variants reduce the transmission rate when detecting packet losses,\nassuming network congestion, resulting in lower throughput and affecting\nbandwidth-intensive applications like immersive applications. However, not all\npacket losses are due to congestion; some occur due to wireless link issues,\nwhich we refer to as non-congestive packet losses. In today's hybrid Internet,\npackets of a single flow may traverse wired and wireless segments of a network\nto reach their destination. TCP should not react to non-congestive packet\nlosses the same way as it does to congestive losses. However, TCP currently can\nnot differentiate between these types of packet losses and lowers its\ntransmission rate irrespective of packet loss type, resulting in lower\nthroughput for wireless clients. To address this challenge, we use machine\nlearning techniques to distinguish between these types of packet losses at end\nhosts, utilizing easily available features at the host. Our results demonstrate\nthat Random Forest and K-Nearest Neighbor classifiers perform better in\npredicting the type of packet loss, offering a promising solution to enhance\nnetwork performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
