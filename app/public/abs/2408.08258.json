Current\nmethods mostly rely on extensive self-supervised learning (SSL) for\nsatisfactory performance, requiring long training periods and considerable\ncomputational resources. At the same time, no pre-training affects performance\ndue to domain shifts from natural images to WSIs. We introduce Snuffy\narchitecture, a novel MIL-pooling method based on sparse transformers that\nmitigates performance loss with limited pre-training and enables continual\nfew-shot pre-training as a competitive option. Our sparsity pattern is tailored\nfor pathology and is theoretically proven to be a universal approximator with\nthe tightest probabilistic sharp bound on the number of layers for sparse\ntransformers, to date. We demonstrate Snuffy's effectiveness on CAMELYON16 and\nTCGA Lung cancer datasets, achieving superior WSI and patch-level accuracies.\nThe code is available on https://github.com/jafarinia/snuffy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KHnk8wKhZ7eiLN-pJ5EC-T35zdcje85Wm3u84q-a3Z4","pdfSize":"16019653"}
