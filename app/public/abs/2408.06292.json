This paper presents the first\ncomprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling\nfrontier large language models to perform research independently and\ncommunicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates\nnovel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results,\ndescribes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a\nsimulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be\nrepeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the\nhuman scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to\nthree distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling,\ntransformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is\nimplemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than $15 per\npaper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated\nreviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper\nscores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance\nthreshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated\nreviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific\ndiscovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI\nagents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a\nworld where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on\nthe world's most challenging problems.
