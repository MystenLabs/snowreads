We first\nstate a necessary condition on a code $C$ to be linear complementary equi-dual.\nThen, we conjecture that this necessary condition is also sufficient and\npresent several statements which support this conjecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
