These differentials, in special cases, provide solutions of\n(generalized) Chebotarov problem as well as being instances of Jenkins--Strebel\ndifferentials. The algorithm allows to construct Boutroux differentials with\nprescribed polar part, thus being useful in the theory of weighted capacity and\nRandom Matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
