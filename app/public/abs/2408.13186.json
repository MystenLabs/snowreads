The exact dependence on the Higgs and top-quark masses across\nthe entire $2 \\to 2$ phase space is determined by numerically solving a system\nof differential equations for the relevant master integrals. The calculated\namplitudes are crucial for evaluating the impact of the considered corrections\non exclusive $pp \\to hj$ production at the hadronic event level. As an\napplication, we calculate the non-universal, kinematic-dependent cubic Higgs\nself-coupling corrections to the Higgs-boson transverse momentum distribution\nin gluon-gluon fusion Higgs production for arbitrary values of the transverse\nmomentum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
