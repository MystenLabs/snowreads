It presents current efforts in the synthesis\nscience of epitaxial La:BaSnO$_3$ films for achieving reduced defect densities\nand high electron mobility at room temperature. We discuss the scattering\nmechanisms and the route towards engineering defect-free epitaxial La:BaSnO$_3$\nheterostructures. By combining chemical surface characterization and electronic\ntransport studies, a special emphasis is laid on the proper correlation between\nthe transport properties and the electronic band structure of La:BaSnO$_3$\nfilms and heterostructures. For application purposes, interesting optical\nproperties of La:BaSnO$_3$ films are discussed. Finally, for their potential\napplication in oxide electronics, an overview of current progress in the\nfabrication of La:BaSnO$_3$-based thin-film field-effect transistors is\npresented together with recent progress in the the fundamental realization of\ntwo-dimensional electron gases with high electron mobility in\nLa:BaSnO$_3$-based heterostructures. Future experimental studies to reveal the\npotential deployment of La:BaSnO$_3$ films in optoelectronic and transparent\nelectronics are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
