This size can\nbe measured according to various metrics, including width, depth and gate\ncount, but also variations thereof obtained by considering only some wire types\nor some gate kinds. The key ingredients for achieving this level of flexibility\nare effects and refinement types, both relying on indices, that is, generic\narithmetic expressions whose operators are interpreted differently depending on\nthe target metric. The approach is shown to be correct through logical\npredicates, under reasonable assumptions about the chosen resource metric. This\napproach is empirically evaluated through the QuRA tool, showing that, in many\ncases, inferring tight bounds is possible in a fully automatic way.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
