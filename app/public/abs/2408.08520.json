We provide a specific construction for the sobrification of\nan $L$-convex space, demonstrating that the full subcategory of sober\n$L$-convex spaces is reflective in the category of $L$-convex spaces with\nconvexity-preserving mappings. Additionally, we introduce the concept of Scott\n$L$-convex structures on $L$-ordered sets. As an application of this type of\nsobriety, we obtain a characterization for the $L$-join-semilattice completion\nof an $L$-ordered set: an $L$-ordered set $Q$ is an $L$-join-semilattice\ncompletion of an $L$-ordered set $P$ if and only if the Scott $L$-convex space\n$(Q, \\sigma^{\\ast}(Q))$ is a sobrification of the Scott $L$-convex space $(P,\n\\sigma^{\\ast}(P))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
