Specifically, we calculate the two-loop beta\nfunction of the gauge coupling constant in a non-Abelian gauge theory,\nemploying the one-graviton exchange approximation. Our findings reveal that\ngravitational corrections may lead to a non-trivial UV fixed point in the beta\nfunction of the gauge coupling constant, contingent upon the specific gauge\ngroup and the quantity of fermions involved.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q4li76gxBPDLnBdtN35CXI0EAlLXdSpU4Ly0msYd2bA","pdfSize":"892128","txDigest":"aKDzdCfpJdswYxmqtYQQWBSPjcEjBb2qz7LmuNRcD2v","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
