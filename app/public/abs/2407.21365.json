Note that the resulting sets are not necessarily convex. This type\nof equations describe, among others, half-spaces, balls and ellipsoids. We give\ndetailed convergence and complexity analysis for the case in which the unit\nhypercube is clipped by balls of arbitrary radius but with centers whom\ndistance to the unit hypercube is greater than $1$ (one).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
