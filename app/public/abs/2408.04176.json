Alongside\nthis, an estimation algorithm that represents a natural extension of the usual\niteratively weighted least squares method in generalized linear models is\npresented. It is through the discussion of the asymptotic distribution of the\nproposed estimator and a set of statistics for testing linear hypothesis that\nit is possible to define standardized residuals using the mean-shift outlier\nmodel. In addition, robust versions of deviance function and the Akaike\ninformation criterion are defined with the aim of providing tools for model\nselection. Finally, the performance of the proposed methodology is illustrated\nthrough a simulation study and analysis of a real dataset.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
