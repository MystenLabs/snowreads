This is achieved by\nintroducing an overdamped Stratonovich-Langevin equation that remains fully\ncovariant under non-linear transformations of state variables. The approach\nleads to a covariant extension of the thermodynamic uncertainty relation,\ndescribing a trade-off between the total entropy production rate and\nthermodynamic precision associated with short-time currents in curved spaces\nand arbitrary coordinate systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
