Federated learning (FL)\naddresses the former by enabling different medical clients to collaboratively\ntrain a deep model without sharing privacy-sensitive data. However, class\nimbalance worsens due to variation in inter-client class distribution. We\npropose federated learning with non-parametric regularization (FedNPR and\nFedNPR-Per, a personalized version of FedNPR) to regularize the feature\nextractor and enhance useful and discriminative signal in the feature space.\nOur extensive experiments show that FedNPR outperform the existing state-of-the\nart FL approaches in class imbalance skin lesion classification and\nintracranial hemorrhage identification. Additionally, the non-parametric\nregularization module consistently improves the performance of existing\nstate-of-the-art FL approaches. We believe that NPR is a valuable tool in FL\nunder clinical settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"3nE244DKVE-cdTWL2wIhHklkYs6pOoTZDwcdCJ93ntU","pdfSize":"724883"}
