Unfortunately, in the field of\nenergetic materials data scarcity limits the accuracy and even applicability of\nML tools. To address data limitations, we compiled multi-modal data: both\nexperimental and computational results for several properties. We find that\nmulti-task neural networks can learn from multi-modal data and outperform\nsingle-task models trained for specific properties. As expected, the\nimprovement is more significant for data-scarce properties. These models are\ntrained using descriptors built from simple molecular information and can be\nreadily applied for large-scale materials screening to explore multiple\nproperties simultaneously. This approach is widely applicable to fields outside\nenergetic materials.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
