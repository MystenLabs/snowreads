Employing large-scale high-order series expansions with classical\nMonte Carlo integration (pCUT+MC) about the limit of isolated Heisenberg dimers\nin the rung-singlet phase, we investigate the one-triplon dispersion and the\ncorresponding spectral weight along the parameter axes of the long-range decay\nexponent and the XXZ anisotropy. By tuning the latter, we observe two extended\nregions of 3d XY and Ising universality as well as 3d Heisenberg critical\nexponents at the isotropic point. Along the decay exponent axis, we demonstrate\nmean-field behavior for strong long-range couplings, the aforementioned three\nuniversality classes for sufficiently weak interactions, and continuously\nvarying critical exponents in-between. Using extrapolations we are able to\ndetermine the one-triplon dispersion in a quantitative fashion up to the\nquantum-critical breakdown of the rung-singlet phase. This allows to extract\nthe dynamical critical exponent $z$ as a function of the decay exponent,\ndisplaying a universal behavior. The detected $z<1$ for small decay exponents\nis in agreement with the expected properties of the anomalous Goldstone modes\nin the ordered phases with broken continuous symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
