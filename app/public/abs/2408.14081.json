These strategies reduce the computational complexity and\ninherently support true modularity -- a perquisite for handling and processing\nmeshed range measurements among a time-varying set of devices. In order to\nutilize these measurements in the estimation framework, positions of newly\ndetected stationary devices (anchors) and the pairwise biases between the\nranging devices are required. In this work an autonomous calibration procedure\nfor new anchors is presented, that utilizes range measurements from multiple\ntags as well as already known anchors. To improve the robustness, an outlier\nrejection method is introduced. After the calibration is performed, the sensor\nfusion framework obtains initial beliefs of the anchor positions and\ndictionaries of pairwise biases, in order to fuse range measurements obtained\nfrom new anchors tightly-coupled. The effectiveness of the filter and\ncalibration framework has been validated through evaluations on a recorded\ndataset and real-world experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
