A game based distributed decision\napproach for the the multi-agent OCP is proposed. The equivalence between the\nequilibrium of the game and the extreme value of the global performance\nobjective is strictly proved. Then, a distributed algorithm only using local\ninformation to obtain the global near-optimal coverage is developed, and its\nconvergence is proved. Finally, the proposed method is applied to maximize the\ncovering time of a satellite constellation for a target. The simulation results\nunder different scenarios show our method costs much less computation time\nunder some level index than traditional centralized optimization.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
