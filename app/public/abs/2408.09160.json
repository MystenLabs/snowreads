We analyze the computational\ncomplexity of computing them and analyze their behavior in extensive\nexperiments on synthetic instances. For instance, we examine whether a stable\nmatching is guaranteed to remain stable if a given number of adversarial swaps\nin the agent's preferences are performed and the probability of stability when\napplying swaps uniformly at random. Our results reveal that stable matchings in\nour synthetic data are highly unrobust to adversarial swaps, whereas the\naverage-case view presents a more nuanced and informative picture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
