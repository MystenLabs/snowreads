Three regimes\nexhibiting different scaling laws are identified in the neighbourhood of the\ntricritical point. For these three regimes, sixth-order partial differential\nequations are obtained governing the weakly nonlinear evolution of unstable\nsolutions near the onset of instability. These sixth-order PDES may be regarded\nas the substitute for the classical fourth-order Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation\nwhich is not applicable near the tricritical point.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
