While current applications involve\nadults, one of the challenges in ear recognition for children is the rapid\nstructural changes in the ear as they age. This work introduces a foundational\nlongitudinal dataset collected from children aged 4 to 14 years over a 2.5-year\nperiod and evaluates ear recognition performance in this demographic. We\npresent a deep learning based approach for ear recognition, using an ensemble\nof VGG16 and MobileNet, focusing on both adult and child datasets, with an\nemphasis on longitudinal evaluation for children.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
