Despite its apparent advantages,\nprevious rolling shutter bundle adjustment (RSBA) methods have only supported\nsparse feature points, which lack robustness, particularly in degenerate\nenvironments. In this paper, we introduce the first rolling shutter line-based\nbundle adjustment solution, RSL-BA. Specifically, we initially establish the\nrolling shutter camera line projection theory utilizing Pl\\\"ucker line\nparameterization. Subsequently, we derive a series of reprojection error\nformulations which are stable and efficient. Finally, we theoretically and\nexperimentally demonstrate that our method can prevent three common\ndegeneracies, one of which is first discovered in this paper. Extensive\nsynthetic and real data experiments demonstrate that our method achieves\nefficiency and accuracy comparable to existing point-based rolling shutter\nbundle adjustment solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
