Moreover, we enhance this existence result to encompass all\npossible choices of prescribed mean curvatures under certain Ricci curvature\ncondition on $N$ when $\\dim{N} = 3$. When $\\dim{N} \\geq 4$, we establish a\nMorse index lower bound while $N$ satisfies some isotropic curvature condition.\nAs a consequence, we can leverage latter strengthened result to construct\n2-spheres with parallel mean curvature when $N$ has positive isotropic\ncurvature and $\\dim{N} \\geq 4$. At last, we partially resolve the homotopy\nproblem concerning the existence of a representative surface with prescribed\nmean curvature type vector field in some given homotopy classes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
