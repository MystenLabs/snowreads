However, feature modeling in existing methods is\ndeficient to exploit the abundant global, spectral, and local features\nsimultaneously, leading to sub-optimal classification performance. To solve the\nproblem, we propose a hierarchical attention and parallel filter fusion network\nfor multi-source data classification. Concretely, we design a hierarchical\nattention module for hyperspectral feature extraction. This module integrates\nglobal, spectral, and local features simultaneously to provide more\ncomprehensive feature representation. In addition, we develop parallel filter\nfusion module which enhances cross-modal feature interactions among different\nspatial locations in the frequency domain. Extensive experiments on two\nmulti-source remote sensing data classification datasets verify the superiority\nof our proposed method over current state-of-the-art classification approaches.\nSpecifically, our proposed method achieves 91.44% and 80.51% of overall\naccuracy (OA) on the respective datasets, highlighting its superior\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
