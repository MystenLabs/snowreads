Then, we discuss the unimodularity and\nthe multiplicative unimodularity for these spaces and the existence of an\ninvariant volume form for explicit Hamiltonian systems on such spaces. Several\ninteresting examples illustrating the theoretical results are also presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
