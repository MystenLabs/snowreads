Utilizing the\ndimensional reduction approach, we construct the tree dimensional thermal\neffective field theory at finite density and investigate the phase transition\ndynamics. We evaluate how the results depend on the renormalization scale and\nthe chemical potential. Our results show that, with the tree dimensional\nthermal effective potential at 2-loop level, we can effectively reduce the\ntheoretical uncertainty in the calculations of the phase transition parameters\ndue to the renormalization scale dependence, and the new physics scale is\nrestricted to be $\\Lambda\\lesssim (770-800)$ GeV by the baryon number washout\navoidance condition. Meanwhile, the presence of the chemical potential would\naffect the phase transition parameter and make the constraints from the baryon\nnumber washout avoidance condition more strict, especially for weaker\nfirst-order phase transition scenarios at higher new physics scales.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
