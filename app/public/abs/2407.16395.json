The\nobjective is to design and implement a model using cryptographic algorithms to\nenhance data security in 5G networks. Challenges arise from the limited\ncomputational capabilities of IoT devices, which require the analysis and\nselection of cryptographic algorithms to achieve efficient data transmission.\nThis study proposes a model that includes four levels of security, each\nemploying different levels of encryption to provide better data security.\nFinally, cloud computing optimizes processing efficiency and resource\nutilization to improve data transmission.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
