MCPDepth uses cylindrical panoramas for\ninitial stereo matching and then fuses the resulting depth maps across views. A\ncircular attention module is employed to overcome the distortion along the\nvertical axis. MCPDepth exclusively utilizes standard network components,\nsimplifying deployment to embedded devices and outperforming previous methods\nthat require custom kernels. We theoretically and experimentally compare\nspherical and cylindrical projections for stereo matching, highlighting the\nadvantages of the cylindrical projection. MCPDepth achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance with an 18.8% reduction in mean absolute error (MAE) for depth on\nthe outdoor synthetic dataset Deep360 and a 19.9% reduction on the indoor\nreal-scene dataset 3D60.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
