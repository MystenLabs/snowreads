Existing approaches rely on the assumption\nthat the shape variation of the point clouds and the motion of the objects\nacross neighboring frames are smooth, failing to cope with high temporal\nvariation data. In this paper, we present a novel framework for 3D SOT in point\nclouds with high temporal variation, called HVTrack. HVTrack proposes three\nnovel components to tackle the challenges in the high temporal variation\nscenario: 1) A Relative-Pose-Aware Memory module to handle temporal point cloud\nshape variations; 2) a Base-Expansion Feature Cross-Attention module to deal\nwith similar object distractions in expanded search areas; 3) a Contextual\nPoint Guided Self-Attention module for suppressing heavy background noise. We\nconstruct a dataset with high temporal variation (KITTI-HV) by setting\ndifferent frame intervals for sampling in the KITTI dataset. On the KITTI-HV\nwith 5 frame intervals, our HVTrack surpasses the state-of-the-art tracker\nCXTracker by 11.3%/15.7% in Success/Precision.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"It3AL_L0tFSaPLnt6efrxFU71I1OxcaITx5x9-3TaYw","pdfSize":"1871880"}
