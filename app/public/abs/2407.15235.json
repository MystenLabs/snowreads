However, the increasing variety and\nvolume of instruction datasets demand significant computational resources. To\naddress this, it is essential to extract a small and highly informative subset\n(i.e., Coreset) that achieves comparable performance to the full dataset.\nAchieving this goal poses non-trivial challenges: 1) data selection requires\naccurate data representations that reflect the training samples' quality, 2)\nconsidering the diverse nature of instruction datasets, and 3) ensuring the\nefficiency of the coreset selection algorithm for large models. To address\nthese challenges, we propose Task-Agnostic Gradient Clustered COreset Selection\n(TAGCOS). Specifically, we leverage sample gradients as the data\nrepresentations, perform clustering to group similar data, and apply an\nefficient greedy algorithm for coreset selection. Experimental results show\nthat our algorithm, selecting only 5% of the data, surpasses other unsupervised\nmethods and achieves performance close to that of the full dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"oxmir8kIDhurxUZnYXtGv1HJrbcIQqSYJAczpc3EiZ0","pdfSize":"642596"}
