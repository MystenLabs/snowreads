By full\nself-consistent analysis of the spatial dependent superconducting order\nparameter, we determine the magnetic ground state of the superconducting spin\nvalve. The study is performed by investigating the role of the orientation and\nstrength of the magnetization in the ferromagnets including spin-valve\nasymmetries in the magnetic configurations. Due to the nonvanishing angular\nmomentum of the spin-triplet Cooper pairs we demonstrate that the induced\nmagnetic coupling has an anisotropic character and a structure that can favor\ncollinear or noncollinear magnetic orientations, thus mimicking a magnetic\ninteraction of the Heisenberg or Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya type, respectively. We\ninvestigate the role of the physical parameters controlling the character of\nthe magnetic exchange: the amplitude of the magnetization in the ferromagnets\nand the length of the superconducting spacer in the spin valve. Our study\ndemonstrates that spin-triplet superconductors can be employed to devise\nanisotropic magnetic exchange and to allow for transitions in the spin-valve\nstate from a collinear to noncollinear magnetic configuration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
