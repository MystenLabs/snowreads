We highlight how integrodifferential equations react far better\nunder perturbations than their integral equation counterparts in regards to\nstability of solutions. To illustrate this idea we give a characterisation of\nwhen the Ces\\`aro mean of solutions converge to a limit, which is explicitly\nidentified and given in terms of the problem data. Additionally we note how all\nresults can also be applied to functional differential equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
