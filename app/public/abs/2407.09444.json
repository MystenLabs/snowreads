Given any regular enough initial data which is small in some\ncritical space but possibly large in Lipschitz, we prove that the associated\nCauchy problem has a unique global solution. Our result allows for the slope of\nthe interface between the two fluids to be arbitrarily large.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
