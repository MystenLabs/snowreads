It has been successfully generated in various\nphysical systems. Here we introduce a new mechanism and system to produce\nsqueezed light using an exciton-phonon cavity-QED system. Specifically, we\nadopt a semiconductor microcavity embedded with a quantum well, which supports\nboth linear and nonlinear interactions among excitons, phonons, and cavity\nphotons. We show that the strong exciton-phonon nonlinear interaction can\ninduce a quadrature-squeezed cavity output field, and reveal an important role\nof the exciton-photon coupling in engineering the squeezing spectrum and\nimproving the robustness of the squeezing against thermal noise. Our results\nindicate that room-temperature squeezing of light is possible for materials\nwith high exciton binding energy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
