Vision models have great potential for the real-time detection of\nnumerous traffic signs and obstacles, which is essential to avoid accidents and\nprotect human lives. Despite vast potential, computer vision-based systems have\ncritical safety concerns too if the traffic condition drifts over time. This\npaper represents an analysis of how data drift can affect the performance of\nvision models in terms of traffic sign detection. The novelty in this research\nis provided through a YOLO-based fusion model that is trained with drifted data\nfrom the CARLA simulator and delivers a robust and enhanced performance in\nobject detection. The enhanced model showed an average precision of 97.5\\%\ncompared to the 58.27\\% precision of the original model. A detailed performance\nreview of the original and fusion models is depicted in the paper, which\npromises to have a significant impact on safety-critical automotive systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
