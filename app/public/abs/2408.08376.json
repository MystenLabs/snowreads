Clinical diagnosis requires a comprehensive collation of\nbiophysical data via multiple MRI contrasts, acquired using a series of RF\nsequences that lead to lengthy examinations. Here, we developed a vision\ntransformer-based framework that captures the spatiotemporal magnetic signal\nevolution and decodes the brain tissue response to RF excitation, constituting\nan MRI on a chip. Following a per-subject rapid calibration scan (28.2 s), a\nwide variety of image contrasts including fully quantitative molecular, water\nrelaxation, and magnetic field maps can be generated automatically. The method\nwas validated across healthy subjects and a cancer patient in two different\nimaging sites, and proved to be 94% faster than alternative protocols. The deep\nMRI on a chip (DeepMonC) framework may reveal the molecular composition of the\nhuman brain tissue in a wide range of pathologies, while offering clinically\nattractive scan times.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
