The question also makes sense\nfor partial collision. When a~cluster of bodies tends to a (partial) collision,\nthen its normalized shape curve tends to the set of normalized central\nconfigurations, which in the planar case has $SO(2)$ symmetry. This leaves a\npossibility that the normalized shape curve tends to the circle obtained by\nrotation of some central configuration instead of a particular point on it.\nThis is the \\emph{infinite spin problem}. We show that it is not possible if\nthe limiting circle is isolated from other connected components of the set of\nnormalized central configuration. Our approach extends the method from recent\nwork for total collision by Moeckel and Montgomery, which was based on a\ncombination of the center manifold theorem with {\\L}ojasiewicz inequality. To\nthat we add a shadowing result for pseudo-orbits near normally hyperbolic\nmanifold and careful estimates on the influence of other bodies on the cluster\nof colliding bodies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
