The existing methods to predict the Remaining Useful\nLife(RUL) of Lithium-ion Batteries (LiBs) neglect the relational dependencies\nof the battery parameters to model the nonlinear degradation trajectories. We\npresent the Battery GraphNets framework that jointly learns to incorporate a\ndiscrete dependency graph structure between battery parameters to capture the\ncomplex interactions and the graph-learning algorithm to model the intrinsic\nbattery degradation for RUL prognosis. The proposed method outperforms several\npopular methods by a significant margin on publicly available battery datasets\nand achieves SOTA performance. We report the ablation studies to support the\nefficacy of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rOvsPhxmjlRKRzuGtHDtMta3RRPFzEAn7OprL_n7tGA","pdfSize":"563533"}
