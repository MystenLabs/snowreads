Despite being one of the most accessible simulation methods,\nthe product formula encounters challenges due to the pessimistic gate count\nestimation. In this work, we elucidate how observable knowledge can accelerate\nquantum simulations. By focusing on specific families of observables, we reduce\nproduct-formula simulation errors and gate counts in both short-time and\narbitrary-time scenarios. For short-time simulations, we deliberately design\nand tailor product formulas to achieve size-independent errors for local and\ncertain global observables. In arbitrary-time simulations, we reveal that\nPauli-summation structured observables generally reduce average errors.\nSpecifically, we obtain quadratic error reductions proportional to the number\nof summands for observables with evenly distributed Pauli coefficients. Our\nadvanced error analyses, supported by numerical studies, indicate improved gate\ncount estimation. We anticipate that the explored speed-ups can pave the way\nfor efficiently realizing quantum simulations and demonstrating advantages on\nnear-term quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
