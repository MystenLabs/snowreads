Dysgraphia is not a disorder per se, but is\nsecondary to neurodevelopmental disorders, mainly dyslexia, Developmental\nCoordination Disorder (DCD, also known as dyspraxia) or Attention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Since the mastering of handwriting is central\nfor the further acquisition of other skills such as orthograph or syntax, an\nearly diagnosis and handling of dysgraphia is thus essential for the academic\nsuccess of children. In this paper, we investigated a large handwriting\ndatabase composed of 36 individual symbols (26 isolated letters of the Latin\nalphabet written in cursive and the 10 digits) written by 545 children from 6,5\nto 16 years old, among which 66 displayed dysgraphia (around 12\\%). To better\nunderstand the dynamics of handwriting, mathematical models of nonpathological\nhandwriting have been proposed, assuming oscillatory and fluid generation of\nstrokes (Parsimonious Oscillatory Model of Handwriting [Andr\\'e, 2014]). The\npurpose of this work is to study how such models behave when applied to\nchildren dysgraphic handwriting, and whether a lack of fit may help in the\ndiagnosis, using a two-layer classification procedure with different\ncompositions of classification algorithms.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ho_kOHhI3j5wU3Ld4PGGrn5DbErN4XYwiBVRtQQkBPY","pdfSize":"1102166"}
