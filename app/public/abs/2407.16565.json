Language generation via LLMs models has two\nkey problems: firstly, they are prone to hallucination and therefore, for any\nmedical purpose they require scientific and factual grounding; secondly, LLMs\npose tremendous challenge to computational resources due to their gigantic\nmodel size. In this work, we introduce pRAGe, a pipeline for Retrieval\nAugmented Generation and evaluation of medical paraphrases generation using\nSmall Language Models (SLM). We study the effectiveness of SLMs and the impact\nof external knowledge base for medical paraphrase generation in French.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SR9guH9yS1G2S5MOv4TXdkNvprhSdVXyQyLihvq711Y","pdfSize":"1420142","objectId":"0xed0fc079d051756560482753177a459484117c7c3e2c68702f6bdf00ed0e5075","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
