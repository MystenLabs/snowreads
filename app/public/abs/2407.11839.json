We define a natural subgroup $\\mathrm{Aut}_\\Gamma(A_\\Gamma)$ of\n$\\mathrm{Aut}(A_{\\Gamma})$, and for every $\\gamma \\in\n\\mathrm{Aut}_\\Gamma(A_\\Gamma)$ we find the isomorphism type of\n$\\mathrm{Fix}(\\gamma)$ and a generating set for a finite index subgroup. We\nshow that $\\mathrm{Fix}(\\gamma)$ is a finitely generated Artin group, with a\nuniform bound on the rank in terms of the number of vertices of $\\Gamma$.\nFinally, we provide a natural geometric characterisation of the subgroup\n$\\mathrm{Aut}_\\Gamma(A_\\Gamma)$, which informally is the maximal subgroup of\n$\\mathrm{Aut}(A_\\Gamma)$ leaving the Deligne complex of $A_{\\Gamma}$ invariant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
