In this paper, we introduce a new methodology,\ncoined as Tabular-data Rehearsal-based Incremental Lifelong Learning framework\n(TRIL3), designed to address the phenomenon of catastrophic forgetting in\ntabular data classification problems. TRIL3 uses the prototype-based\nincremental generative model XuILVQ to generate synthetic data to preserve old\nknowledge and the DNDF algorithm, which was modified to run in an incremental\nway, to learn classification tasks for tabular data, without storing old\nsamples. After different tests to obtain the adequate percentage of synthetic\ndata and to compare TRIL3 with other CL available proposals, we can conclude\nthat the performance of TRIL3 outstands other options in the literature using\nonly 50% of synthetic data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
