We present results for inclusive cross-sections\nand differential distributions, finding that these QCD corrections are large,\noften vary across the phase-space and notably differ from those observed in the\nstandard model. We then explore the potential of the recently observed triboson\nproduction processes for improving the sensitivity brought by electroweak\nprecision observables and diboson data. The additional sensitivity we observe\nis dominated by resonant Higgs boson contributions, with decays to photon pairs\nin particular. A global analysis including Higgs boson data is therefore needed\nfor a fair assessment of the future reach of triboson measurements on heavy new\nphysics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
