Recently a novel feedback-based quantum optimization algorithm has\nbeen proposed by Magann \\textit{et al}. The method explicitly determines\nquantum circuit parameters by feeding back measurement results thus avoids\nclassical parameter optimization that is known to cause significant trouble in\nquantum approximate optimization algorithm, the well-studied near-term\nalgorithm. Meanwhile, a significant drawback of the feedback-based quantum\noptimization is that it requires deep circuits, rendering the method unsuitable\nto noisy quantum devices. In this study we propose a new feedback law for\nparameter determination by introducing the second-order approximation with\nrespect to time interval, a hyperparameter in the feedback-based quantum\noptimization. This allows one to take larger time interval, leading to\nacceleration of convergence to solutions. In numerical simulations on the\nmaximum cut problem we demonstrate that our proposal significantly reduces\ncircuit depth, with its linear scaling with the problem size smaller by more\nthan an order of magnitude. We expect that the new feedback law proposed in\nthis work may pave the way for feedback-based quantum optimization with\nnear-term noisy quantum computers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
