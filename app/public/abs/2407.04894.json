Accurately modelling their physical behaviour\nnecessitates an understanding of the complex interactions between the\nstructural deformation and the fields in the surrounding medium. For thin shell\nstructures, this challenge is addressed by developing a shell model that\neffectively incorporates the three-dimensional field it is embedded in by\nappropriately accounting for the relevant boundary conditions. This study\npresents a model for the nonlinear deformation of thin hyperelastic shells,\nincorporating Kirchhoff-Love assumptions and a rigorous variational approach.\nThe shell theory is derived from 3D nonlinear elasticity by dimension reduction\nwhile preserving the boundary conditions at the top and bottom surfaces of the\nshell. Consequently, unlike classical shell theories, this approach can\ndistinguish between pressure loads applied at the top and bottom surfaces, and\ndelivers a platform to include multi-physics coupling. Numerical examples are\npresented to illustrate the theory and provide a physical interpretation of the\nnovel mechanical variables of the model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
