In this paper, we consider the problem of multi-user pilot\npattern optimization for OFDM systems. In particular, the goal is to enhance\nchannel extrapolation performance for 5G NR systems by optimizing multi-user\npilot patterns in frequency-domain. We formulate a novel pilot pattern\noptimization problem with the objective of minimizing the maximum integrated\nside-lobe level (ISL) among all users, subject to a statistical resolution\nlimit (SRL) constraint. Unlike existing literature that only utilizes ISL for\ncontrolling side-lobe levels of the ambiguity function, we also leverage ISL to\nmitigate multi-user interference in code-domain multiplexing. Additionally, the\nintroduced SRL constraint ensures sufficient delay resolution of the system to\nresolve multipath, thereby improving channel extrapolation performance. Then,\nwe employ the estimation of distribution algorithm (EDA) to solve the\nformulated problem in an offline manner. Finally, we extend the formulated\nmulti-user pilot pattern optimization problem to a multiband scenario, in which\nmultiband gains can be exploited to improve system delay resolution. Simulation\nresults demonstrate that the optimized pilot pattern yields significant\nperformance gains in channel extrapolation over the conventional pilot\npatterns.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
