By acting such transmutation operators to gravity\namplitudes in the soft limit, we reproduce universal soft factors of YM\namplitudes at the leading and sub-leading orders, and explain that the\nanalogous universal soft behavior does not exist at the sub-sub-leading order.\nSubsequently, by acting the same operators on YM amplitudes, we obtain the\nuniversal soft factor of BAS amplitudes at the leading order. Furthermore, we\nfind that a \"weaker\" version of universal soft behavior of BAS amplitudes holds\nat the sub-leading order, if we exclude the special $4$-point case.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
