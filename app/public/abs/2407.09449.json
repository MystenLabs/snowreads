In the limit of large constant delay times, anomalous\nbehavior may not be observable due to exponentially large crossover times. A\nperiodic modulation of the delay causes a strong reduction of the effective\ndimension of the chaotic phases, leads to hitherto unknown types of solutions,\nand the occurrence of anomalous diffusion already at short times. The observed\nanomalous behavior is caused by non-hyperbolic fixed points in function space.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
