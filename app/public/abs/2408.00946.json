This\nbecomes even worse with reasonably small data sets or a variation in the data\nsets. This has far-reaching effects on decision-making, forecasting and\nlearning mechanisms. This study seeks to unpack the nature of uncertainty that\nexists within AI by drawing ideas from established works, the latest\ndevelopments and practical applications and provide a novel total uncertainty\ndefinition in AI.\n  From inception theories up to current methodologies, this paper provides an\nintegrated view of dealing with better total uncertainty as well as\ncomplexities of uncertainty in AI that help us understand its meaning and value\nacross different domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7eRR5oXa8LmMxA31QeTpclUgXLB-8kkz4AgMF2S0fZI","pdfSize":"512838","txDigest":"6DthomL43edSYaLZy5Upp9EQFPFMzgebxuagmEiT8gBN","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
