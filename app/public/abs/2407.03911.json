Affine formation control is inherently distributed in nature,\nwhere the local controllers onboard each agent are linearly dependent on the\nrelative position measurements of the neighboring agents. The unavailability of\nthese measurements in practice, due to node failure or missing links, leads to\na change in the underlying graph topology, and subsequently causes instability\nand sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an estimation framework\nto enhance the robustness of distributed affine formation control systems\nagainst these topology changes. Our estimation framework features an adaptive\nfusion of both temporal information from the dynamics of agents and spatial\ninformation which is derived from the geometry of the affine formations. We\npropose a suite of algorithms under this framework to tackle various practical\nscenarios, and numerically verify our proposed estimator on stability,\nconvergence rate, and optimality criterion. Simulations show the performance of\nour proposed algorithms as compared to the state-of-the-art methods, and we\nsummarize them with future research directions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
