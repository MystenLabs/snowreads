We describe the construction of bistable\none-dimensional traveling fronts using singular perturbation techniques in\ndifferent parameter regimes corresponding to tumor interfaces with, or without,\nacellular gap. By extending the front as a planar interface, we perform a\nstability analysis to long wavelength perturbations transverse to the direction\nof front propagation and derive a simple stability criterion for the front in\ntwo spatial dimensions. In particular we find that in general the presence of\nthe acellular gap indicates transversal instability of the associated planar\nfront, which can lead to complex interfacial dynamics such as the development\nof finger-like protrusions and/or different invasion speeds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7nVTlTz4Q-iTZbv4iS-u1e3FzPWxgp5bqB0-OlgUyng","pdfSize":"3393422"}
