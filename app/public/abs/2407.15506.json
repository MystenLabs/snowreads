In this paper we\nconstruct several families of Weyl-invariant commutator blueprints, mostly of\nuniversal type. Together with the main result of \\cite{BiRGD} we obtain new\nexamples of exotic RGD-systems of universal type over $\\mathbb{F}_2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
