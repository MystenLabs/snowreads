Under the\npremise of a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics, a main outcome is that\ncollapse has to occur when the Hamiltonian completes a closed loop in the\nparameter space encoding the interaction with the meter. For two-level systems,\nwe put forward the phenomenon of chiral state conversion as a mechanism\neffectively eliminating superpositions. Our results open a way to simulate\nquantum measurements in classical systems that up to now were restricted to the\nSchr\\\"odinger part of the quantum dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
