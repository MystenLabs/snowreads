This paper introduces a framework to automate this process, implemented\nas the industrial Cyber-Physical Systems Description Language, iCPSDL. This\nframework maps an industrial process as a knowledge graph, which includes\ninformation about physical and cyber-physical components, a state estimation\nmodel, and software component interaction. A novel aspect is the use of\ncommunication semantics to ensure correct interaction among distributed\nentities. Reasoning on the knowledge graph facilitates the configuration of\ncyber-physical elements in an industrial system. A case study in the Water\nDistribution Networks domain demonstrates the framework's application.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
