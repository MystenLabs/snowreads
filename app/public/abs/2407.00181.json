In\nthis article, we address the observed discrepancies in the $W$-boson mass and\nmuon anomalous magnetic moment in the Inert Two Higgs Doublet Model (I2HDM)\nextended by a complex scalar field singlet under the SM gauge group. The model\nis constrained from the existing LEP data and the measurements of partial decay\nwidths to gauge bosons at LHC. It is shown that a large subset of this\nconstrained parameter space of the model can simultaneously accommodate the\n$W$-boson mass and also explain the muon $g-2$ anomaly.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U8EzHqHfPtr0hzdwvhhH0JAnuJO7Eznt_X7FayEJx4s","pdfSize":"2974897"}
