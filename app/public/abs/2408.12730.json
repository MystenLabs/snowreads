We revisit a previous logarithmic bound on the number of\nobservations and propose a general problem for identification of roots with\nthree errors. As a key finding, we establish a novel logarithmic lower bound on\nthe number of observations which outperforms the previous result across certain\nregimes of error and accuracy of the identification test. Furthermore, we\nrecover the previous results for root identification as a special case and draw\na connection to the message identification problem of Ahlswede.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
