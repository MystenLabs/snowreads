In particular, there is no widely-accepted and\nunified understanding for how the relativistic electrons illuminating these\nstructures are generated. One possibility is that there are compact and\nextended sources of Cosmic Rays (CRs), which then diffuse along magnetic flux\ntubes leading to the illumination of the NTFs through synchrotron emission. In\nthis work, we present and discuss the polarimetric distributions associated\nwith a set of faint NTFs in the GC that have only been studied in total\nintensity previously. We compare the derived polarized intensity, rotation\nmeasure, and intrinsic magnetic field distributions for these structures with\nthe results obtained for previously observed GC NTFs. The results are then used\nto enhance our understanding of the large-scale polarimetric properties of the\nGC. We then use the derived polarimetric distributions to constrain models for\nthe mechanisms generating the relativistic electrons that illuminate these\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"d0MgvZcz1T-HGVOg8c27mKxL5iHUDa8yDmPaoNMAQcs","pdfSize":"1883637"}
