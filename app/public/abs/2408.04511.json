This Dirac-algebra approach\nenables us to obtain a fully O(1,3)-covariant and IR-safe expression for the\none-loop effective potential. We illustrate how the formalism can be used to\nevaluate the breaking of global symmetries of the 2HDM potential by loop\neffects, in a field-reparameterisation invariant manner.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
