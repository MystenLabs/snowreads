The need for mobile manipulators in\ndifferent environments is evident due to the unique challenges and risks each\npresents. Many systems deployed in these environments are not fully autonomous,\nrequiring human-robot teaming to ensure safe and reliable operations under\nuncertainties. Through this analysis, we identify gaps and challenges in the\nliterature on Variable Autonomy, including cognitive workload and communication\ndelays, and propose future directions, including whole-body Variable Autonomy\nfor mobile manipulators, virtual reality frameworks, and large language models\nto reduce operators' complexity and cognitive load in some challenging and\nuncertain scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xcBLrTWsca_5QA6greVyIvvNscOEX2WUcZZ08tBFd9w","pdfSize":"119176"}
