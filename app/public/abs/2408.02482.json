We use the likelihood and time to become a principal\ninvestigator (PI) and the length of an author's career to measure career\nprogression. Utilising logistic regression and accelerated failure time models,\nwe examine whether the effect of collaboration behaviour varies by gender. We\nfind that, controlling for the number of publications, the relationship between\ncollaborative behaviour and career progression is almost the same for men and\nwomen. Specifically, we find that those who eventually reach principal\ninvestigator (PI) status, tend to have published with more unique\ncollaborators. In contrast, publishing repeatedly with the same highly\ninterconnected collaborators and/or larger number of coauthors per publication\nis characteristic of shorter career lengths and those that do not attain PI\nstatus. We observe that the tie strength is stronger for women than men, and\nwomen tend to collaborate in more tightly connected and larger groups than men.\nFinally, we observe that women are less likely to attain the status of PI\nthroughout their careers and have a lower survival probability compared to men,\nwhich calls for policies to close this crucial gap.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
