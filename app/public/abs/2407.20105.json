In this paper, we propose model fusion as an effective solution to\nsafeguard against copyright infringement. In particular, we introduce\nCopyright-Protecting Fusion (CP-Fuse), an algorithm that adaptively combines\nlanguage models to minimize the reproduction of protected materials. CP-Fuse is\ninspired by the recently proposed Near-Access Free (NAF) framework and\nadditionally incorporates a desirable balancing property that we demonstrate\nprevents the reproduction of memorized training data. Our results show that\nCP-Fuse significantly reduces the memorization of copyrighted content while\nmaintaining high-quality text and code generation. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nhow CP-Fuse can be integrated with other techniques for enhanced protection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4ewLUn8P8h0s4YF9CL36wyOE-orNairYPy0myuKZRBs","pdfSize":"821406"}
