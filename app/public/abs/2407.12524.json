This\nrestriction no longer applies for more general identically coupled oscillators.\nHence, it is interesting to understand precisely how frequency synchrony is\nlost and how invariant sets such as attracting weak chimeras are generated at\ntorus breakup, where the phase description breaks down. Maistrenko et al (2016)\nfound numerical evidence of an organizing center for weak chimeras in a system\nof $N=3$ coupled identical Kuramoto oscillators with inertia. This paper\nidentifies this organizing center and shows that it corresponds to a particular\ntype of non-transverse heteroclinic bifurcation that is generic in the context\nof symmetry. At this codimension two bifurcation there is a splitting of\nconnecting orbits between the in-phase (fully synchronized) state. This\ngenerates a wide variety of associated bifurcations to weak chimeras. We\nfurther highlight a second organizing center associated with a codimension two\nsymmetry-breaking heteroclinic connection.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
