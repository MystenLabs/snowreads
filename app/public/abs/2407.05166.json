We model the swimmer as a spherical squirmer and quantify\nmixing through a mixing efficiency that is the ratio of rate of change of\npotential energy of fluid to the total work done by the swimmer. Assessing\nmixing in the near field and far field of the swimmer separately, we find that\nthe near-field mixing aligns with past work, but the overall mixing is much\nlarger than that caused by a point-sized swimmer (like force-dipole), although\nstill small in weak stratification. Equivalent results are also obtained for a\nhomogeneous dilute suspension of non-interacting swimmers. Our study highlights\nthe impact of swimmer size on mixing, revealing that small-sized swimmers\ncannot induce substantial mixing. However, we propose few (unexplored) pathways\nthrough which small swimmers could induce significant mixing, ultimately\ncontributing towards oceanic mixing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
