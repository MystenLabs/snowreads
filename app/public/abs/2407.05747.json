The domain $\\Omega$ could represent the cell membrane, the cell\ncytoplasm, the cell nucleus or the extracellular volume, while an individual\ncompartment could represent a synapse, a membrane protein cluster, a biological\ncondensate, or a quorum sensing bacterial cell. In this review we use a\ncombination of matched asymptotic analysis and Green's function methods to\nsolve a general type of singular boundary value problems (BVP) in 2D and 3D, in\nwhich an inhomogeneous Robin condition is imposed on each interior boundary\n$\\partial \\calU_j$. This allows us to incorporate a variety of previous studies\nof singularly perturbed diffusion problems into a single mathematical modeling\nframework. We mainly focus on steady-state solutions and the approach to\nsteady-state, but also highlight some of the current challenges in dealing with\ntime-dependent solutions and randomly switching processes\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
