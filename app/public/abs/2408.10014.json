An $f$-edge fault-tolerant distance sensitivity oracle\n($f$-DSO) additionally receives a set $F$ of up to $f$ edges and estimates the\n$s$-$t$-distance in $G{-}F$. Our first contribution is a new distance oracle\nwith subquadratic space for undirected graphs. Introducing a small additive\nstretch $\\beta > 0$ allows us to make the multiplicative stretch $\\alpha$\narbitrarily small. This sidesteps a known lower bound of $\\alpha \\ge 3$ (for\n$\\beta = 0$ and subquadratic space) [Thorup & Zwick, JACM 2005]. We present a\nDO for graphs with edge weights in $[0,W]$ that, for any positive integer $t$\nand any $c \\in (0, \\ell/2]$, has stretch $(1{+}\\frac{1}{\\ell}, 2W)$, space\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{2-\\frac{c}{t}})$, and query time $O(n^c)$. These are the\nfirst subquadratic-space DOs with $(1+\\epsilon, O(1))$-stretch generalizing\nAgarwal and Godfrey's results for sparse graphs [SODA 2013] to general\nundirected graphs. Our second contribution is a framework that turns a\n$(\\alpha,\\beta)$-stretch DO for unweighted graphs into an $(\\alpha\n(1{+}\\varepsilon),\\beta)$-stretch $f$-DSO with sensitivity $f =\no(\\log(n)/\\log\\log n)$ and retains subquadratic space. This generalizes a\nresult by Bil\\`o, Chechik, Choudhary, Cohen, Friedrich, Krogmann, and Schirneck\n[STOC 2023, TheoretiCS 2024] for the special case of stretch $(3,0)$ and $f =\nO(1)$. By combining the framework with our new distance oracle, we obtain an\n$f$-DSO that, for any $\\gamma \\in (0, (\\ell{+}1)/2]$, has stretch\n$((1{+}\\frac{1}{\\ell}) (1{+}\\varepsilon), 2)$, space $n^{ 2-\n\\frac{\\gamma}{(\\ell+1)(f+1)} + o(1)}/\\varepsilon^{f+2}$, and query time\n$\\widetilde{O}(n^{\\gamma} /{\\varepsilon}^2)$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
