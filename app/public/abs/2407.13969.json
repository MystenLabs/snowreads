Booher and Cais had previously conjectured\nthat for $n$ sufficiently large the higher $a$-numbers of the $n$th curve are\ngiven by formulae of the form $\\alpha(n) p^{2n} + \\beta(n) p^n + \\lambda_r(n) n\n+ \\nu(n) $ for $n$ sufficiently large, where $\\alpha,\\beta,\\nu,\\lambda_r$ are\nperiodic functions of $n$. This is an example of a new kind of Iwasawa theory.\nWe establish this conjecture by carefully studying these lattice points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
