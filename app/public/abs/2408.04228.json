Such a type of\nenergy is obtained as a singular limit of the Kobayashi-Warren-Carter energy\nwith minimization with respect to the order parameter. We consider the\nRudin-Osher-Fatemi type energy by replacing relaxation term by this type of\ntotal variation energy. We show that all minimizers are piecewise constant if\nthe data is continuous in one-dimensional setting. Moreover, the number of\njumps is bounded by an explicit constant involving a constant related to the\nfidelity. This is quite different from conventional Rudin-Osher-Fatemi energy\nwhere a minimizer must have no jump if the data has no jumps. The existence of\na minimizer is guaranteed in multi-dimensional setting when the data is\nbounded.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ImxxrtCgsbzwUi2IM20LokpiJTu4B4O4o2yKcDXjFZM","pdfSize":"506363"}
