This extension introduces the concept of\nQuantum Thermodynamic Integrability (QTI), offering an alternative foundation\nfor statistical mechanics. QTI is characterized by the path-independence of\nwork and heat within the thermodynamic manifold, which is locally described by\nenergy levels and specific thermodynamic parameters. Within this framework,\ntemperature naturally emerges as an integrating factor, allowing for the\nderivation of both canonical and non-canonical states from the Entropy\nIntegrable Equations (EIE) based on QTI. Notably, non-canonical states, which\nbecome particularly significant outside the thermodynamic limit, reveal the\nexistence of informational correlations in finite-size thermodynamic systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ra2lHc6SaHH902ycp3lQR_LWcP_7J8yWbd0exhCY-ew","pdfSize":"446169"}
