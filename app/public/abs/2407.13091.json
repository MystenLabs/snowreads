This issue is\nexacerbated by the evolving nature of user preferences and behaviors, requiring\nthe recommender system to adaptively focus on the most relevant information for\ndecision-making while preserving generaliability. To tackle this problem, we\nintroduce an innovative causal approach for decomposing the state and\nextracting \\textbf{C}ausal-\\textbf{I}n\\textbf{D}ispensable \\textbf{S}tate\nRepresentations (CIDS) in RLRS. Our method concentrates on identifying the\n\\textbf{D}irectly \\textbf{A}ction-\\textbf{I}nfluenced \\textbf{S}tate Variables\n(DAIS) and \\textbf{A}ction-\\textbf{I}nfluence \\textbf{A}ncestors (AIA), which\nare essential for making effective recommendations. By leveraging conditional\nmutual information, we develop a framework that not only discerns the causal\nrelationships within the generative process but also isolates critical state\nvariables from the typically dense and high-dimensional state representations.\nWe provide theoretical evidence for the identifiability of these variables.\nThen, by making use of the identified causal relationship, we construct\ncausal-indispensable state representations, enabling the training of policies\nover a more advantageous subset of the agent's state space. We demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach through extensive experiments, showcasing our method\noutperforms state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
