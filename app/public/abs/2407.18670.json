Employing a near-resonant radio frequency\nfield of wavelength 2.37 cm and a static magnetic field gradient of 19 T/m, the\nspatial location of the ion is determined with an unprecedented\nwavelength-relative resolution of 5 $\\times$ 10$^{-9}$, corresponding to an\nabsolute precision of 0.12 nm. Measurements of an electrostatic force on a\nsingle ion demonstrate a sensitivity of 2.2 $\\times$ 10$^{-23}\n~\\text{N}/\\sqrt{\\text{Hz}}$. The real-time measurement of an atom's position\ncomplements the well-established technique of scanning near-field radio\nfrequency transmission microscopy and opens up a novel route to using this\nmethod with path breaking spatial and force resolution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
