Here, we investigate the thickness\ndependence of longitudinal and transverse responses in film-substrate systems\ni.e., the Seebeck coefficient, Hall coefficient, Nernst coefficient and\nanomalous Nernst coefficient in a unified and general manner based on the\ncircuit model, which describes the system as the parallel setup. By solving the\nparallel circuit model, we show that the transverse responses exhibit a\nsignificant peak, indicating the importance of a cooperative effect between the\nfilm and the substrate, arising from circulating currents that occur in these\nmultilayer systems in the presence of a temperature gradient. Finally, on the\nbasis of realistic material parameters, we predict that the Nernst effect in\nbismuth thin films on doped silicon substrates is boosted to unprecedented\nvalues if the thickness ratio is tuned accordingly, motivating experimental\nvalidation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0_gGmwlbP49ArvoyTtDQAQrNKLVgrRaB3_YqSY7NI6I","pdfSize":"349786"}
