This order may be\nconcealed due to its higher-rank multipole, making it difficult to detect and\nmanipulate it by using conventional methods such as the anomalous Hall effect.\nIn this paper, we propose the nonlinear magnetoelectric effect (NMEE) as a\ntechnique that can detect and manipulate magnetic octupole order because of\nidentical symmetry constraints. To demonstrate this point, we first classify\nthe magnetic point groups in terms of magnetic multipoles to identify magnets,\nwith the lowest-rank multipoles being magnetic octupoles, and reveal many\ncandidate systems. We then derive the NMEE tensor by using quantum kinetic\ntheory and show its relation to quantum geometric properties. Finally, we\ncalculate the NMEE in two antiferromagnets where the lowest-rank nonvanishing\nmultipole is the magnetic octupole. Specifically, we focus on a $d$-wave\naltermagnet and a pyrochlore lattice with all-in/all-out magnetic order,\nrevealing an enhancement of the NMEE by Weyl points. Finally, we discuss\nexperimental realization and show that the NMEE has a sizeable value that can\nbe detected by the magneto-optical Kerr effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
