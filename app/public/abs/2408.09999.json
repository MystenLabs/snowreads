It is well\nknown that Gathering is impossible in the basic model ($OBLOT$) where robots\nhave no lights, even if the system is semi-synchronous (called SSYNCH).\nGathering becomes possible, however, if each robot has a light of some type\nthat can be set to a constant number of colors. In the $FCOM$ model, the robots\ncan only see the lights of other robots. In the $FSTA$ model, each robot can\nonly observe its own light. In the $LUMI$ model, all robots can see all lights.\nThis paper focuses on $FSTA$ robots with 2-colored lights in synchronous\nsettings. We show that 2-color $FSTA$ and $FCOM$ robots cannot solve Gathering\nin SSYNCH without additional conditions, even with rigid movement and agreement\nof chirality and the minimum moving distance. We also improve the condition of\nthe previous gathering algorithm for $FSTA$ robots with 2-color working in\nSSYNCH.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
