A magma is free iff\nit is equidecomposable and graded, hence the notion of equidecomposability is\nvery related to the notion of freeness although it is not sufficient. We study\nmain properties of such magmas. In particular, an alternative characterization\nof freeness, which uses a weaker condition, is proved. We show how\nequidecomposable magmas can be split into two disjoint submagmas, one of which\nis free. Certain tranformations on finite presentations permit to obtain a\nreduced form which allows us identify all the finite presented equidecomposable\nmagmas up to isomorphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jgBROiGNu_wzrXdOiCLdAnp5VDLh4ASPM0s8u41JZuM","pdfSize":"296666"}
