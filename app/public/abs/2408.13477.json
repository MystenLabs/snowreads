We show that for very general families of integer polynomials $f$\n(and, more generally, rational functions over number fields), the set of stable\nprimes, i.e., primes modulo which all iterates of $f$ are irreducible, is a\ndensity zero set. Compared to previous results, our families cover a much wider\nground, and in particular apply to $100\\%$ of polynomials of any given odd\ndegree, thus adding evidence to the conjecture that polynomials with a ``large\"\nset of stable primes are necessarily of a very specific shape, and in\nparticular are necessarily postcritically finite.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
