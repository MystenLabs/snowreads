A major driver\nof this change is virtualisation, which allows computing resources to be\ndeployed on a large scale. However, traditional DCs, with their network\ntopology and proliferation of network endpoints, are struggling to meet the\nflexible, centrally managed requirements of cloud computing applications.\nSoftware-Defined Networks (SDN) promise to offer a solution to these growing\nnetworking requirements by separating control functions from data routing. This\nshift adds more flexibility to networks but also introduces new security\nissues. This article presents a framework for evaluating security of SDN\narchitectures. In addition, through an experimental study, we demonstrate how\nthis framework can identify the threats and vulnerabilities, calculate their\nrisks and severity, and provide the necessary measures to mitigate them. The\nproposed framework helps administrators to evaluate SDN security, address\nidentified threats and meet network security requirements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F1N4VwadvsRQxpiNuQt6fFk45sd4LPEXZGBYRBZ_XW8","pdfSize":"2259843"}
