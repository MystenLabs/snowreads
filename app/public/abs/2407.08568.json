At band filling $\\nu=3/4$ for hardcore bosons, we\ndemonstrate the emergence of three-component fractional quantum Hall (FQH)\neffect characterized by the $\\mathbf{K}$ matrix, through exact diagonalization\nstudy of four-fold quasidegenerate ground states with a robust spectrum gap and\nthe combined density-matrix renormalization group calculation of fractional\ndrag charge pumping. Further we formulate the topological characterization of\nFQH states of three-component Bose-Fermi mixtures at various fillings by the\n$\\mathbf{K}$ matrix. At last we discuss the possible generalization of our\napproach to identify non-Abelian three-component spin-singlet FQH states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
