In this paper we propose a systematic study of basic\nproperties of signature tensors, starting from their rank, symmetries and\nconciseness. We prove a sharp upper bound on the rank of signature tensors of\npiecewise linear paths. We show that there are no skew-symmetric signature\ntensors of order three or more, and we also prove that specific instances of\npartial symmetry can only happen for tensors of order three. Finally, we give a\nsimple geometric characterization of paths whose signature tensors are not\nconcise.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
