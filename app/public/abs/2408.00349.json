With\nthe development of autonomous driving, V2X perception is becoming increasingly\nrelevant, as can be seen by the tremendous attention recently given to\nintegrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technologies. In this context,\nrigid body localization (RBL) also emerges as one important technology which\nenables the estimation of not only target's positions, but also their shape and\norientation. This article discusses the need for RBL, its benefits and\nopportunities, challenges and research directions, as well as its role in the\nstandardization of the sixth-generation (6G) and beyond fifth generation (B5G)\napplications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
