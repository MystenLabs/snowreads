The focus of AMPLFI is to\nperform real-time parameter estimation for candidates detected by\nmachine-learning based compact binary coalescence search, Aframe. We present\ndetails of our algorithm and optimizations done related to data-loading and\npre-processing on accelerated hardware. We train our model using binary\nblack-hole (BBH) simulations on real LIGO-Virgo detector noise. Our model has\n$\\sim 6$ million trainable parameters with training times $\\lesssim 24$ hours.\nBased on online deployment on a mock data stream of LIGO-Virgo data, Aframe +\nAMPLFI is able to pick up BBH candidates and infer parameters for real-time\nalerts from data acquisition with a net latency of $\\sim 6$s.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
