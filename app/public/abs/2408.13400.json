Various scaling\ntechniques, such as row and column equilibration, map the matrix entries to\nhigher-density regions of machine numbers before performing the $O(n^3)$\nfactorization operation. Low-precision LU factorization followed by\nforward/backward substitution provides an initial estimate. The results\ndemonstrate that a 16-bit posit configuration combined with equilibration\nproduces accuracy comparable to IEEE half-precision (fp16), indicating a\npotential for achieving a balance between efficiency and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
