Such convergence is also taking\nplace in the context of individual registrational trials, following the recent\nintroduction of the estimand framework, which is impacting the design, data\ncollection strategy, analysis and interpretation of clinical trials. The\nlanguage of estimands has much to offer to NMA, particularly given the \"narrow\"\nperspective of treatments and target populations taken in health technology\nassessment.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R3bfGiKScpBdJNAGOTxUNCsIhV3zll0PutUbEzcWFvU","pdfSize":"85729"}
