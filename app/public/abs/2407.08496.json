A main problem is whether a prescribed total geodesic\ncurvature data can be realized by a degenerated circle packing or not. We fully\ncharacterize the sufficient and necessary conditions and show the uniqueness.\nFurthermore, we introduce the combinatoral Ricci flow to find the desired\ndegenerated circle packed surface, analougus to the methods of Chow-Luo and\nTakatsu.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
