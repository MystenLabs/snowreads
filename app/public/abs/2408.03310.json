A dispenser-loaded two-dimensional (2D)\nmagneto-optical trap (MOT) using permanent magnets and operating on the broad\n$^1S_0\\to {}^1P_1$ singlet transition delivers over $10^7$ atoms per second\nthrough a differential pumping stage into a three-dimensional (3D) MOT. The\ntwo-color 3D MOT uses the broad singlet transition to accumulate $\\sim\\!2\\times\n10^7$ atoms of $^{174}\\text{Yb}$ within $2.5~\\text{s}$ and subsequently the\nnarrow $^1S_0\\to {}^3P_1$ intercombination line to cool the atomic cloud to\nbelow $10~\\mathrm{\\mu K}$. We report optimized parameters for each stage of the\natom collection sequence, achieving high transfer efficiency. We find that\nshelving into the triplet state during the broad-transition MOT almost doubles\nthe number of trapped atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
