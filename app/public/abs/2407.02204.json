This\nAFSM provides an infinite family of integrable sigma models including the\noriginal $T\\overline{T}$-deformation and the root $T\\overline{T}$-deformation.\nIn this paper, we propose a 4D Chern-Simons (CS) theory with auxiliary fields.\nThen the AFSM is derived from this CS theory with the twist function for the\nprincipal chiral model by imposing appropriate boundary conditions for the\ngauge field and auxiliary fields. We also derive the AFSM with the Wess-Zumino\nterm by deforming the twist function and modifying the boundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
