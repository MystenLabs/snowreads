In this framework, fermions with\ndifferent spin quantum numbers are mapped onto two distinct spin species,\nresulting in two $XY$ spin chains that are coupled through Ising $ZZ$\ninteraction. The spin ladder model is then examined within the semiclassical\nlimit using a spin-coherent state basis, where the dynamics is governed by a\nset of coupled Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equations. The non-Hermitian\ninteractions in this model generate a spin-transfer torque term. We analyze the\nsystem's evolution toward several potential steady states, including a state of\ndecoupled chains that is accessible when each chain has uniform initial\nconditions. Other possible steady states involve dimerized configurations with\ndecoupled rungs, where the rung spins are either ferromagnetically or\nantiferromagnetically coupled, depending on the sign of the imaginary\ninteractions. The spin dynamics is then studied in the infinite-temperature\nlimit, which favors dimerized steady states. Despite the decoupled rungs, we\nobserve the formation of ferromagnetic domains along each chain in the steady\nstate. Additionally, we investigate the spin correlation functions and identify\nsignatures of anomalous spin dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
