We categorize ten methods into neural radiance fields and neural\nimplicit surfaces, uncovering the benefits of leveraging distance functions\n(i.e., SDFs and UDFs) to enhance the accuracy and smoothness of the\nreconstructed surfaces. Our findings highlight the efficiency and quality of\nNeuS2 for reconstructing closed surfaces and identify NeUDF as a promising\ncandidate for reconstructing open surfaces despite some limitations. By sharing\nour benchmark dataset, we invite researchers to test the performance of their\nmethods, contributing to the advancement of surface reconstruction solutions\nfor scientific visualization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
