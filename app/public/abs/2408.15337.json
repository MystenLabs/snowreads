These services can be composed as Service Function\nChains (SFCs) which consist of a sequence of ordered Virtual Network Functions\n(VNFs). To achieve efficient edge resources allocation for SFC requests and\noptimal profit for edge service providers, we formulate the SFC placement\nproblem in an edge environment and propose a multi-agent Reinforcement Learning\n(RL) scheme to address the problem. The proposed scheme employs a set of RL\nagents to collaboratively make SFC placement decisions, such as path selection,\nVNF configuration, and VNF deployment. Simulation results show our model can\nimprove the profit of edge service providers by 12\\% compared with a heuristic\nsolution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
