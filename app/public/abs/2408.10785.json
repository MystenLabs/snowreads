Next, we explain the conditional least square hedging strategy\nand calculate its closed form for the jump-diffusion model, considering the\nBlack-Scholes framework with interpretations related to investor priorities and\ntransaction costs. We investigate the explicit form of this result for the\nparticular case of the European call option under transaction costs and\nformulate recursive hedging strategies. Finally, we present a decision tree,\ntable of values, and figures to support our results.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
