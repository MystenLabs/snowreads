If $\\Phi$ is trivial on $k$-vertex\ngraphs (i.e., if $\\Phi$ contains either all or no $k$-vertex graphs), this\nproblem is trivial. Otherwise we prove, among other results:\n  If $\\Phi$ is edge-monotone (i.e., closed under deleting edges), then\n$\\#\\mathrm{IndSub}(\\Phi,k)$ cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k)}$ assuming ETH.\nThis strengthens a result by D\\\"oring, Marx and Wellnitz [STOC 2024] that only\nruled out an exponent of $o(\\sqrt{\\log k}/ \\log \\log k)$. Our results also hold\nwhen counting modulo fixed primes.\n  If there is some fixed $\\varepsilon > 0$ such that at most\n$(2-\\varepsilon)^{\\binom{k}{2}}$ graphs on $k$ vertices satisfy $\\Phi$, then\n$\\#\\mathrm{IndSub}(\\Phi,k)$ cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k/\\sqrt{\\log k})}$\nassuming ETH. Our results hold even when each of the graphs in $\\Phi$ may come\nwith an arbitrary individual weight. This generalizes previous results for\nhereditary properties by Focke and Roth [SIAM J.\\ Comput.\\ 2024] up to a\n$\\sqrt{\\log k}$ factor in the exponent of the lower bound.\n  If $\\Phi$ only depends on the number of edges, then\n$\\#\\mathrm{IndSub}(\\Phi,k)$ cannot be solved in time $n^{o(k)}$ assuming ETH.\nThis improves on a lower bound by Roth, Schmitt and Wellnitz [FOCS 2020] that\nonly ruled out an exponent of $o(k / \\sqrt{\\log k})$.\n  In all cases, we also obtain $\\mathsf{\\#W[1]}$-hardness if $k$ is part of the\ninput and the problem is parameterized by $k$. We also obtain lower bounds on\nthe Weisfeiler-Leman dimension. Our results follow from relatively\nstraightforward Fourier analysis, and our paper subsumes most of the known\n$\\mathsf{\\#W[1]}$-hardness results known in the area, often with tighter lower\nbounds under ETH.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
