We study the case when the\ndomain is a disc and the spectrum consists of branches of eigenvalues of one\ndimensional operators. Under Neumann boundary condition and strong magnetic\nfield, we derive asymptotics of the eigenvalues with accurate estimates of\nexponentially small remainders. Our approach is purely variational and applies\nto the Dirichlet boundary condition as well, which allows us to recover recent\nresults by Baur and Weidl.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
