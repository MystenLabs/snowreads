However, improving the spatial resolution of\ninstantaneous velocity fields and having access to the velocity field in real\ntime remains a challenge. Optical Flow veolcimetry makes it possible to meet\nthese challenges. In this study, we show that it is possible to access dense\nvelocity fields (1 vector per pixel) in real-time using an appropriate seeding\nconcentration adapted to optical flow algorithms and no longer to\ncross-correlation PIV algorithms. The influence of concentration on the quality\nof velocity fields is demonstrated using synthetic images generated for a\nRankine vortex. We thus demonstrate that it is possible to precisely measure\nsmall vortices using optical flow provided that the seeding is suitable. The\nnotion of \"Active Pixels\" is also introduced in order to define a seeding\noptimization criterion adapted to experimental measurements. This criterion is\nfinally successfully applied to the flow downstream of a cylinder leading to a\nspatial resolution down to one vector per pixel.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
