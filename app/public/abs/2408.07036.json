This article aims to remedy this by\nexpressing relativistic concepts in a visual manner, using the full power of\nhyperbolic trigonometric functions. Minkowski diagrams in energy-momentum space\nare used and then augmented in comparison with previous uses in literature by\ndirect usage of triangles in Minkowski space. As a proof-of-concept for the\nadvantages of this holistic approach, elegant new derivations of the\nrelativistic rocket equation and the relativistic Doppler effect are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
