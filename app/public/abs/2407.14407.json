To\naddress this, we introduce an approach that facilitates the establishment of\npaths capable of delivering end-to-end fidelity above a specified threshold,\nwithout requiring detailed knowledge of the quantum network properties, which\nwe call the 'grey box approach'. In this study, we define algorithms that are\nspecific instances of this approach and evaluate them in comparison to Dijkstra\nshortest path algorithm and a fully knowledge-aware algorithm through\nsimulations. Our results demonstrate that one of the grey box algorithms\nconsistently outperforms the other methods in delivering paths above the\nfidelity threshold, across various network topologies and the number of\nsource-destination pairs involved, while maintaining significant levels of\nfairness among the users and being robust to inaccurate estimations of the\nexpected end-to-end fidelity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
