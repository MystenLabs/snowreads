This\npaper presents the results of a study of the $\\alpha$ Crucis system, located at\n$\\sim$114 pc distance from the Sun, with an observed bow shock around it. We\nused data and images from the Gaia and WISE space telescopes. The coordinates,\ndistance, and proper motion of the $\\alpha$ Crucis system were used to\ndetermine its space velocity. We managed to find a stellar cluster to which the\n$\\alpha$ Crucis system belongs, that is, it has not been ejected from its\nparent cluster, but is moving in space together with other members of the\ncluster. The $\\alpha$ Crucis system has a velocity of $\\sim$1.3 km/s relative\nto the star cluster. The geometric parameters of the bow shock are compatible\nwith other known bow shocks. The bow shock is unaligned, i.e., most likely\ninterstellar medium large-scale motions are responsible for the resulting bow\nshock, which is further evidence that the $\\alpha$ Crucis system is not runaway\nin nature.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
