In the main\nresult, we prove that if the ratio $\\delta \\epsilon^{-1}$ decays fast enough\ncompared to $\\epsilon$, then homogenization effects dominate, and the\n$\\Gamma$-limit of the energy is the same as if the coefficients had been\nreplaced by their homogenized values. As a byproduct of the proof, this implies\nthat homogenization holds in the periodic setting whenever $\\delta\n\\epsilon^{-1}$ vanishes with $\\epsilon$, no matter how slowly. Via explicit\nexamples, we prove this is sharp: if $\\delta \\epsilon^{-1}$ decays too slowly,\nthen improbable or atypical local configurations of the medium begin to play a\nrole, and the $\\Gamma$-limit may be smaller than the one predicted by\nhomogenization theory. We refer to this as the rare events regime, and we prove\nthat it can occur in both random and almost periodic media.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VeaEKA3IvSv0e0YED17Sf-Q5mzTz3_6vkUgCKwkvcLE","pdfSize":"1129312"}
