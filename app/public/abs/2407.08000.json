The temperature dependence of\nelectrical resistivity at H = 0 Oe after zero-field cooling (ZFC) showed a\nsharp superconducting transition at T = 3.7 K. In contrast, that after field\ncooling (FC) resulted in broadening of the transition. The difference between\nZFC and FC data evidences critical affection of trapped fluxes at solders on\nsuperconducting states. We propose that, in electrical measurements where\nmagnetic fields of several hundred Oe are critical, field experience should be\nseriously considered when using solders.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
