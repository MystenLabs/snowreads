Latest WSTAL\nmethods introduce pseudo label learning framework to bridge the gap between\nclassification-based training and inferencing targets at localization, and\nachieve cutting-edge results. In these frameworks, a classification-based model\nis used to generate pseudo labels for a regression-based student model to learn\nfrom. However, the quality of pseudo labels in the framework, which is a key\nfactor to the final result, is not carefully studied. In this paper, we propose\na set of simple yet efficient pseudo label quality enhancement mechanisms to\nbuild our FuSTAL framework. FuSTAL enhances pseudo label quality at three\nstages: cross-video contrastive learning at proposal Generation-Stage,\nprior-based filtering at proposal Selection-Stage and EMA-based distillation at\nTraining-Stage. These designs enhance pseudo label quality at different stages\nin the framework, and help produce more informative, less false and smoother\naction proposals. With the help of these comprehensive designs at all stages,\nFuSTAL achieves an average mAP of 50.8% on THUMOS'14, outperforming the\nprevious best method by 1.2%, and becomes the first method to reach the\nmilestone of 50%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
