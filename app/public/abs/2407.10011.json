Automating deformation\ndetection through computer vision is crucial for efficient monitoring, but it\nfaces significant challenges in creating a comprehensive dataset of both\ndeformed and non-deformed objects, which can be difficult to obtain in many\nscenarios. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework for generating\ncontrolled synthetic data that simulates deformed objects. This approach allows\nfor the realistic modeling of object deformations under various conditions. Our\nframework integrates an intelligent adapter network that facilitates\nsim-to-real domain adaptation, enhancing classification results without\nrequiring real data from deformed objects. We conduct experiments on domain\nadaptation and classification tasks and demonstrate that our framework improves\nsim-to-real classification results compared to simulation baseline.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ceIUhycKZqE4Y8UNbxFVEnZaQHOcBil3qiKW6l5vcdM","pdfSize":"6180359"}
