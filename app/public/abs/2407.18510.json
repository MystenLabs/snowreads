Here, we first experimentally measure such its\nthermal transport behavior from 20~K to 300~K, after synthesizing\nCs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ single crystals. Using path-integral molecular dynamics\nsimulations driven by machine learning potentials, we reveal that\nCs$_3$Bi$_2$I$_6$Cl$_3$ has large lattice distortions at low temperatures,\nwhich may be related to the large atomic size mismatch. Employing the\nregularized Wigner thermal transport theory, we reproduce the experimental\nthermal conductivities based on lattice-distorted structures. This study thus\nprovides a framework for predicting and understanding glassy thermal transport\nin materials with strong lattice disorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
