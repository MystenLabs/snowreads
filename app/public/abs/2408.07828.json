However, centralized registries recording the technical\ncharacteristifs of rooftop PV systems are often missing, making it difficult to\naccurately monitor this growth. The lack of monitoring could threaten the\nintegration of PV energy into the grid. To avoid this situation, the remote\nsensing of rooftop PV systems using deep learning emerged as a promising\nsolution. However, existing techniques are not reliable enough to be used by\npublic authorities or transmission system operators (TSOs) to construct\nup-to-date statistics on the rooftop PV fleet. The lack of reliability comes\nfrom the fact that deep learning models are sensitive to distribution shifts.\nThis work proposes a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of distribution\nshifts on the classification accuracy of deep learning models trained to detect\nrooftop PV panels on overhead imagery. We construct a benchmark to isolate the\nsources of distribution shift and introduce a novel methodology that leverages\nexplainable artificial intelligence (XAI) and decomposition of the input image\nand model's decision in terms of scales to understand how distribution shifts\naffect deep learning models. Finally, based on our analysis, we introduce a\ndata augmentation technique meant to improve the robustness of deep learning\nclassifiers to varying acquisition conditions. We show that our proposed\napproach outperforms competing methods. We discuss some practical\nrecommendations for mapping PV systems using overhead imagery and deep learning\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ubaoan9AK0v83R0tN5k8pmXu9XEl_vwkPY1QC5fvRZI","pdfSize":"8092192"}
