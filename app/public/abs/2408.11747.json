However, these\nmethods still depend on predefined class names during testing, restricting the\nautonomy of agents. To mitigate this constraint, we propose a novel problem\ntermed Open-Ended 3D Instance Segmentation (OE-3DIS), which eliminates the\nnecessity for predefined class names during testing. Moreover, we contribute a\ncomprehensive set of strong baselines, derived from OV-3DIS approaches and\nleveraging 2D Multimodal Large Language Models. To assess the performance of\nour OE-3DIS system, we introduce a novel Open-Ended score, evaluating both the\nsemantic and geometric quality of predicted masks and their associated class\nnames, alongside the standard AP score. Our approach demonstrates significant\nperformance improvements over the baselines on the ScanNet200 and ScanNet++\ndatasets. Remarkably, our method surpasses the performance of Open3DIS, the\ncurrent state-of-the-art method in OV-3DIS, even in the absence of ground-truth\nobject class names.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"XAZzGVcvyLovB-aZx215WHXxiFd7n7EYXxtU1TZM77w","pdfSize":"11009255"}
