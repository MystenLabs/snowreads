They can form\nin several beyond the Standard Model theories with an extended Higgs sector\nsuch as the Next to-Two-Higgs-Doublet model (N2HDM). In this work, we discuss\nthe domain wall solution related to the singlet scalar of the N2HDM and\ndemonstrate the possibility of restoring the electroweak symmetry inside and in\nthe vicinity of the domain wall. Such symmetry restoration can have profound\nimplications on early universe cosmology as the weak sphaleron rate inside the\ndomain wall would, in principle, be unsuppressed compared to the rate outside\nthe wall. We also discuss the possibility of generating CP-violating vacua\nlocalized in the vicinity of the domain wall. Our work is a first step towards\nthe realization of electroweak baryogenesis mediated by domain walls in the\nN2HDM.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
