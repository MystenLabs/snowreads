Compared with previously used\nmelt-growth method, the stable crystallization process in LiCl/KCl flux below\ntheir peritectic temperatures results in better homogeneity and crystalline\nperfection identified by energy dispersive spectrometer and x-ray diffraction.\nThe interstitial Fe value $\\delta$ remains small within 0.5 $\\leq$ $x$ $\\leq$\n0.85 where the superconducting temperature $T_C$ is not sensitive to the Te\ncontent with sharp superconducting transition widths $\\Delta$$T_C$ < 1 K and a\nmaximum of $T_C$ = 14.3 K at $x$ = 0.61. The value $\\delta$ starts to increase\nquickly accompanied by a deviation of linear behavior of crystal lattice\nparameters as well as the broadening of $\\Delta$$T_C$ = 2.1 K at $x$ = 0.91,\nthen suddenly rises up to $\\delta$ > 0.1 followed by the disappearance of\nsuperconductivity and emergence of antiferromagnetic order at x $\\geq$ 0.96. We\nalso observed a metallic to semiconducting transition in the normal state\nresistivity of Fe$_{1+\\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ with increasing Te content which\nis related to a localized electronic state induced by the interstitial Fe. The\ninterstitial Fe value $\\delta$ might be a key physical parameter to understand\nvarious properties of Fe$_{1+\\delta}$Se$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
