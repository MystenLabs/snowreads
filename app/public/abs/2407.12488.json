Oftentimes, their proposal is only accompanied by a loose link to\nideas from moral philosophy -- which makes it difficult to understand when the\nproposed criteria should be used to evaluate the fairness of a decision-making\nsystem. More recently, researchers have thus retroactively tried to tie\nexisting fairness criteria to philosophical concepts. Group fairness criteria\nhave typically been linked to egalitarianism, a theory of distributive justice.\nThis makes it tempting to believe that fairness criteria mathematically\nrepresent ideals of distributive justice and this is indeed how they are\ntypically portrayed. In this paper, we will discuss why the current approach of\nlinking algorithmic fairness and distributive justice is too simplistic and,\nhence, insufficient. We argue that in the context of imperfect decision-making\nsystems -- which is what we deal with in algorithmic fairness -- we should not\nonly care about what the ideal distribution of benefits/harms among individuals\nwould look like but also about how deviations from said ideal are distributed.\nOur claim is that algorithmic fairness is concerned with unfairness in these\ndeviations. This requires us to rethink the way in which we, as algorithmic\nfairness researchers, view distributive justice and use fairness criteria.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
