It works over $\\Bbbk=\\mathbb{R}$ or $\\Bbbk=\\mathbb{C}$,\nand is formulated for an affine symplectic groupoid\n$\\mathcal{G}\\rightrightarrows X$, an affine Hamiltonian $\\mathcal{G}$-scheme\n$\\mu:M\\longrightarrow X$, a coisotropic subvariety $S\\subseteq X$, and a\nstabilizer subgroupoid $\\mathcal{H}\\rightrightarrows S$. Our first main result\nis that the Poisson bracket on $\\Bbbk[M]$ induces a Poisson bracket on the\nsubquotient $\\Bbbk[\\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\\mathcal{H}}$. The Poisson scheme\n$\\mathrm{Spec}(\\Bbbk[\\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\\mathcal{H}})$ is then declared to be a\nHamiltonian reduction of $M$. Other main results include sufficient conditions\nfor $\\mathrm{Spec}(\\Bbbk[\\mu^{-1}(S)]^{\\mathcal{H}})$ to inherit a residual\nHamiltonian scheme structure.\n  Our main results are best viewed as affine scheme-theoretic counterparts to\nan earlier paper, where we simultaneously generalize several Hamiltonian\nreduction processes. In this way, the present work yields scheme-theoretic\nanalogues of Marsden-Ratiu reduction, Mikami-Weinstein reduction,\n\\'{S}niatycki-Weinstein reduction, and symplectic reduction along general\ncoisotropic submanifolds. The initial impetus for this work was its utility in\nformulating and proving generalizations of the Moore-Tachikawa conjecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
