It is both a significant\nchallenge and a key opportunity for operational optimization in industry 4.0.\nIn recent years, Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based methods offer\npromising enhancements for sequential optimization processes and can be used\nfor reducing carbon emissions. However, existing DRL methods need a pre-defined\nreward function to assess the impact of each action on the final sustainable\ndevelopment goals (SDG). In many real applications, such a reward function\ncannot be given in advance. To address the problem, this study proposes a\nPerformance based Adversarial Imitation Learning (PAIL) engine. It is a novel\nmethod to acquire optimal operational policies for carbon neutrality without\nany pre-defined action rewards. Specifically, PAIL employs a Transformer-based\npolicy generator to encode historical information and predict following actions\nwithin a multi-dimensional space. The entire action sequence will be\niteratively updated by an environmental simulator. Then PAIL uses a\ndiscriminator to minimize the discrepancy between generated sequences and\nreal-world samples of high SDG. In parallel, a Q-learning framework based\nperformance estimator is designed to estimate the impact of each action on SDG.\nBased on these estimations, PAIL refines generated policies with the rewards\nfrom both discriminator and performance estimator. PAIL is evaluated on\nmultiple real-world application cases and datasets. The experiment results\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of PAIL comparing to other state-of-the-art\nbaselines. In addition, PAIL offers meaningful interpretability for the\noptimization in carbon neutrality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
