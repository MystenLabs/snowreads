Such a bias is not\nalways desirable, and we have therefore in a series of papers developed a\nweighting procedure which produces solutions with a different and controlled\nbias. This methodology can also conveniently be invoked when sparsity\nregularization is employed.\n  The purpose of the present work is to study the potential use of this\nweighting applied to injective operators. The image under a compact operator of\nthe singular vectors/functions associated with very small singular values will\nbe almost zero. Consequently, one may regard these singular vectors/functions\nto constitute a basis for a fictitious null space that allows us to mimic the\nprevious weighting procedure. It turns out that this regularization by\nweighting can improve the solution of injective inverse problems compared with\nmore traditional approaches.\n  We present some analysis of this methodology and exemplify it numerically,\nusing sparsity regularization, for three PDE-driven inverse problems: the\ninverse heat conduction problem, the Cauchy problem for Laplace's equation, and\nthe (linearized) Electrical Impedance Tomography problem with experimental\ndata.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
