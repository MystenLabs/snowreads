However, current frequency-based methods with\ncomplex operations still fall short of state-of-the-art time domain methods for\ngeneral time series analysis. In this work, we present Omni-Dimensional\nFrequency Learner (ODFL) model based on a in depth analysis among all the three\naspects of the spectrum feature: channel redundancy property among the\nfrequency dimension, the sparse and un-salient frequency energy distribution\namong the frequency dimension, and the semantic diversity among the variable\ndimension. Technically, our method is composed of a semantic-adaptive global\nfilter with attention to the un-salient frequency bands and partial operation\namong the channel dimension. Empirical results show that ODFL achieves\nconsistent state-of-the-art in five mainstream time series analysis tasks,\nincluding short- and long-term forecasting, imputation, classification, and\nanomaly detection, offering a promising foundation for time series analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
