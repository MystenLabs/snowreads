We established that the point group symmetry\nof these objects corresponds to the dihedral group D7v. To gain a deeper\nunderstanding of their structure, we performed calculations of the pair radial\ndistribution function of the atoms. This data, along with the diffraction\npatterns derived from dual quasicrystals, indicates that quasicrystals have a\ndistinct and pronounced diffraction pattern, confirming their crystalline\nnature and atomic-level orderliness. Furthermore, analysis of the spatial\narrangement of atoms from the center to the periphery revealed that the atomic\ndensity within these nanoparticles is inhomogeneous. Specifically, there is a\nnoticeable decrease in atomic density as one moves from the center of the\ncrystal towards its periphery.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
