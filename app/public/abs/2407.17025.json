Here, we discover new many-electron excited states\nin TMD homobilayers. As optical resonances evolve with twist angle and doping\nin MoSe$_2$ bilayers, a unique type of ``charge-transfer\" trions is observed\nwhen gradual changes in atomic alignment between the layers occur. In real\nspace, the optically excited electron-hole pair mostly resides in a different\nsite from the doped hole in a moir\\'e supercell. In momentum space, the\nelectron-hole pair forms in the single-particle-band $K$-valley, while the hole\noccupies the $\\Gamma$-valley. The rich internal structure of this trion\nresonance arises from the ultra-flatness of the first valence band and the\ndistinct influence of moir\\'e potential modulation on holes and excitons. Our\nfindings open new routes to realizing photon-spin transduction or implementing\nmoir\\'e quantum simulators with independently tunable fermion and boson\ndensities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
