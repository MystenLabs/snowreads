Based on an\noptical high-resolution spectrum and complementary ultraviolet and infrared\n(spectro-)photometry, in addition to Gaia data, we carried out a full\ncharacterisation of the star's properties. We used both hydrostatic and unified\n(photosphere+wind) model atmospheres that account for deviations from local\nthermodynamic equilibrium. A highly unusual surface CNO-mixing signature and a\nmarked stellar overluminosity compared to the mass imply a binary channel for\nthe star's past evolution. The kinematics shows that it has reached its current\nposition above the Galactic plane as a runaway star, likely ejected by the\nsupernova explosion of its former companion star. Its current bulk composition,\nwith a notably increased mean molecular weight due to core He- and progressed\nshell H-burning, suggests an advanced evolutionary stage. It is poised to yield\na rare core-collapse supernova of a blue supergiant about ten OB star\npopulation scale heights above the Galactic disk relatively soon, contributing\nto the metal enrichment of the circumgalactic medium.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
