As part of this, we show that the only\nspherical $3$-manifolds that are the boundary of a symplectic rational homology\nball are the lens spaces $L(p^2,pq-1)$ found by Lisca and give evidence for the\nGompf conjecture that Brieskorn spheres do not bound Stein domains in C^2. We\nalso find restrictions on Lagrangian disk fillings of some Legendrian knots in\nsmall Seifert fibered spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
