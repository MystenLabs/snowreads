Several decompositions of the velocity gradient tensor, such as the\ntriple decomposition of motion (TDM) and normal-nilpotent decomposition (NND),\nhave been proposed to analyze the local motions of fluid elements. However, due\nto the existence of different types and non-uniqueness of Schur forms, as well\nas various possible definitions of NNDs, confusion has spread widely and is\nharming the research. This work aims to clean up this confusion. To this end,\nthe complex and real Schur forms are derived constructively from the very\nbasics, with special consideration for their non-uniqueness. Conditions of\nuniqueness are proposed. After a general discussion of normality and\nnilpotency, a complex NND and several real NNDs as well as normal-nonnormal\ndecompositions are constructed, with a brief comparison of complex and real\ndecompositions. Based on that, several confusing points are clarified, such as\nthe distinction between NND and TDM, and the intrinsic gap between complex and\nreal NNDs. Besides, The author proposes to extend the real block Schur form and\nits corresponding NNDs for the complex eigenvalue case to the real eigenvalue\ncase. But their justification is left to further investigations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
