First, in a Landau level setup at $\\nu=1/3+1/3$, we investigate\nwhat features of the interaction destroy an FTI. For both pseudopotential\ninteractions and realistic screened Coulomb interactions, we find that\nsufficient suppression of the short-range repulsion is needed for stabilizing\nan FTI. We then study $\\theta \\approx 3.7 ^{\\circ}$ $t$MoTe$_2$ with realistic\nband-mixing and anisotropic non-local dielectric screening. Our finite-size\ncalculations only find an FTI phase at $\\nu=-4/3$ in the presence of a\nsignificant additional short-range attraction $g$ that acts to counter the\nCoulomb repulsion at short distances. We discuss how further finite-size\ndrifts, dielectric engineering, Landau level character, and band-mixing effects\nmay reduce the required value of $g$ closer towards the experimentally relevant\nconditions of $t$MoTe$_2$. Projective calculations into the $n=1$ Landau level,\nwhich resembles the second valence band of $\\theta\\simeq 2.1^\\circ$\n$t$MoTe$_2$, do not yield FTIs for any $g$, suggesting that FTIs at low-angle\n$t$MoTe$_2$ for $\\nu=-8/3$ and $-10/3$ may be unlikely. While our study\nhighlights the challenges, at least for the fillings considered, to obtaining\nan FTI with transport plateaus, even in large-angle $t$MoTe$_2$ where\nfractional Chern insulators are experimentally established, we also provide\npotential sample-engineering routes to improve the stability of FTI phases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
