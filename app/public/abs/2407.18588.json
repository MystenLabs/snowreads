In the first part\nof the paper, we characterize the operational {\\it control-coding capacity},\n$C_{FB}$ in bits/second, by an information theoretic optimization problem of\nencoding signals or messages into randomized controller-encoder strategies, and\nreproducing the messages at the output of the system using a decoder or\nestimator with arbitrary small asymptotic error probability. Our analysis of\n$C_{FB}$ is based on realizations of randomized strategies\n(controller-encoders), in terms of information states of nonlinear filtering\ntheory, and either uniform or arbitrary distributed random variables (RVs). In\nthe second part of the paper, we analyze the linear-quadratic Gaussian\npartially observable stochastic system (LQG-POSS). We show that simultaneous\nsignalling and control leads to randomized strategies described by\nfinite-dimensional sufficient statistics, that involve two Kalman-filters, and\nconsist of control, estimation and signalling strategies. We apply\ndecentralized optimization techniques to prove a separation principle, and to\nderive the optimal control part of randomized strategies explicitly in terms of\na control matrix difference Riccati equation (DRE).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
