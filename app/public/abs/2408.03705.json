A plausible solution is that the Higgs\nsector is extended to include an additional Higgs boson with a mass of $95.4$\nGeV. We study a complex singlet scalar extension of the two-Higgs-doublet model\nin which the 95.4 GeV Higgs is from the mixing of three CP-even Higgs fields.\nIn addition, the extended Higgs potential can achieve spontaneous CP-violation\nat the finite temperature and restore CP symmetry at the present temperature of\nthe Universe. We find that the model can simultaneously explain the baryon\nasymmetry of the Universe, the diphoton and $b\\bar{b}$ excesses around the 95.4\nGeV while satisfying various relevant constraints including the experiments of\ncollider and electric dipole moment.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bztx_QuZJc2FGICz53DzbJkV_XmClVI06PkO_SaISaw","pdfSize":"2060619"}
