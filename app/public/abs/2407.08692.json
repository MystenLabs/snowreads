FAR\nsolutions analyse and learn from multiple data sources, including time series\npricing data, customer profile information and expectations, as well as past\ninvestments. However, most models have been developed over proprietary\ndatasets, making a comparison over a common benchmark impossible. In this\npaper, we aim to solve this problem by introducing FAR-Trans, the first public\ndataset for FAR, containing pricing information and retail investor\ntransactions acquired from a large European financial institution. We also\nprovide a bench-marking comparison between eleven FAR algorithms over the data\nfor use as future baselines.
