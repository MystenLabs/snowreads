Calibration is the process of\nestimating the values of the parameters in a simulation model in light of\nobserved data from the system that is being simulated. When simulation models\nare expensive, emulators are built with simulation data as a computationally\nefficient approximation of an expensive model. An emulator then can be used to\npredict model outputs, instead of repeatedly running an expensive simulation\nmodel during the calibration process. Sequential design with an intelligent\nselection criterion can guide the process of collecting simulation data to\nbuild an emulator, making the calibration process more efficient and effective.\nThis article proposes two novel criteria for sequentially acquiring new\nsimulation data in an active learning setting by considering uncertainties on\nthe posterior density of parameters. Analysis of several simulation experiments\nand real-data simulation experiments from epidemiology demonstrates that\nproposed approaches result in improved posterior and field predictions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
