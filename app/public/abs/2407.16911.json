Our algorithm is\nbased on the certified curve approximation algorithm of Plantinga and Vegter.\nThe main challenge in this algorithm is to correctly and efficiently identify\nand isolate all intersections between the curves. To overcome this challenge,\nwe introduce a new and simple test that guarantees the global correctness of\nour output. A main step in our algorithm for approximating any number of curves\nis to correctly approximate a pair of curves. In addition to developing the\ndetails of this special case, we provide complexity analyses for both the\nnumber of steps and the bit-complexity of this algorithm using both worst-case\nbounds as well as those based on continuous amortization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
