While various algorithms have been developed for this\npurpose, challenges arise when detectors operate externally, such as on\nsmartphones, when users take a photo of deepfake images and upload on the\nInternet. One significant challenge in such scenarios is the presence of\nMoir\\'e patterns, which degrade image quality and confound conventional\nclassification algorithms, including deep neural networks (DNNs). The impact of\nMoir\\'e patterns remains largely unexplored for deepfake detectors. In this\nstudy, we investigate how camera-captured deepfake videos from digital screens\naffect detector performance. We conducted experiments using two prominent\ndatasets, CelebDF and FF++, comparing the performance of four state-of-the-art\ndetectors on camera-captured deepfake videos with introduced Moir\\'e patterns.\nOur findings reveal a significant decline in detector accuracy, with none\nachieving above 68% on average. This underscores the critical need to address\nMoir\\'e pattern challenges in real-world deepfake detection scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
