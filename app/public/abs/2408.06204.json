Global consensus with single common\nvariable, multiblocks, and augmented Lagrangian are adopted. The consensus is\nused to partition the constraints of equality and inequality into multi\nconsensus blocks, and the subblocks of each consensus block are employed to\npartition the primal variables into $M$ sets of disjoint subvectors. The\nblock-coordinate Gauss-Seidel method, the proximal point method, and ADMM are\nused to update the primal variables, and descent models used to update the\ndual. Convergence of the algorithm is analyzed and the rate of convergence of\nthe augmented Lagrangian without penalty to the original constraints, of\n$O(1/k)$ is obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"m6AsQm4YfCFyeLRUVvIJLfROY1-ywTn5BgGBFpdANzk","pdfSize":"203177"}
