This approach employs a\nsingle-layer neural network wherein Chebyshev spectral methods are used to\nconstruct neurons satisfying boundary conditions. The study uses a feedforward\nneural network model and error backpropagation principles, utilizing automatic\ndifferentiation (AD) to compute the loss function. This method avoids the need\nto solve non-sparse linear systems, making it convenient for algorithm\nimplementation and solving high-dimensional problems. The unique sampling\nmethod and neuron architecture significantly enhance the training efficiency\nand accuracy of the neural network. Furthermore, multiple networks enables the\nChebyshev spectral method to handle equations on more complex domains. The\nnumerical efficiency and accuracy of the CSNN model are investigated through\ntesting on elliptic partial differential equations, and it is compared with the\nwell-known Physics-Informed Neural Network(PINN) method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
