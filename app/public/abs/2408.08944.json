To\nunderstand this phase transition, we utilize higher-order mutual information to\nanalyze the collective behavior (synergy) and shared properties (redundancy)\nbetween neurons during training. We identify distinct phases before grokking\nallowing us to anticipate when it occurs. We attribute grokking to an emergent\nphase transition caused by the synergistic interactions between neurons as a\nwhole. We show that weight decay and weight initialization can enhance the\nemergent phase.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7JkRQzxkSfqJR-NtCQ4mQXMQBU_R5-m4ekyMmJbUHzU","pdfSize":"1342787"}
