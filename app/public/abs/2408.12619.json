Despite the advantages\nof this approach, customizing the learning environment can reduce the costs of\ntutoring systems for similar learners by utilizing the same content and process\nfor co-like learning groups. Various indicators for grouping learners exist,\nbut many of them are conceptual, uncertain, and subject to change over time. In\nthis article, we propose using the Felder-Silverman model, which is based on\nlearning styles, to group similar learners. Additionally, we model the\nbehaviors and actions of e-learners in a network environment using Fuzzy Set\nTheory (FST). After identifying the learning styles of the learners, co-like\nlearning groups are formed, and each group receives adaptive content based on\ntheir preferences, needs, talents, and abilities. By comparing the results of\nthe experimental and control groups, we determine the effectiveness of the\nproposed grouping method. In terms of \"educational success,\" the weighted\naverage score of the experimental group is 17.65 out of 20, while the control\ngroup achieves a score of 12.6 out of 20. Furthermore, the \"educational\nsatisfaction\" of the experimental group is 67%, whereas the control group's\nsatisfaction level is 37%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"opv00rx1buLws7hhAsOj56vDVe9UhTTn7A-zI-7vGaQ","pdfSize":"641375"}
