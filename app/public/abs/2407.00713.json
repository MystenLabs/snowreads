We now\nexplore the possibility of using a principal value prescription (not in the\nstandard Cauchy sense), which amounts, roughly speaking, to replacing\nsingularities $p_0^{-j} \\Rightarrow [ (p_0 + i \\varepsilon )^{-j} + (p_0 - i\n\\varepsilon )^{-j} ] / 2$, which then behave like distributions. We show that\nsuch a propagator follows upon adding to the action a gauge-violating term of a\ngeneral form, which reduces to $ \\sim \\int f_\\lambda \\Lambda^{\\lambda \\mu}\nf_\\mu \\d^4 x $ with a constant operator $\\Lambda^{\\lambda \\mu}$ depending on\n$\\partial$ and a metric functional $f_\\lambda$. The contribution of\nFaddeev-Popov's ghosts to the effective action is analysed. For the required\nintermediate regularization, the discrete structure of the theory at small\ndistances is implied. It is shown that the ghost contribution can be\ndisregarded in the limit $ \\varepsilon \\to 0$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
