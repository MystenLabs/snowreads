On one hand, we show the propagation of regularity phenomena.\nMore precisely, the regularity of initial data on the right-hand side of the\nreal line is propagated to the left-hand side with infinite speed under the\nhigher-order KdV flow. On the other hand, we show that the dispersive blow-up\nphenomenon will occur by constructing a class of smoothing initial data such\nthat global solutions with the given initial data keep smooth at positive\ngeneric irrational times, while global solutions display singularity at each\ntime-space positive rational point. The blow-up phenomenon is exclusively\ncaused by the linear part of solutions due to the focusing of short or long\nwaves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
