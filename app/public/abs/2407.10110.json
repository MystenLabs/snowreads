Collision centrality and rapidity\ndependences of the transverse momentum spectra and particle ratios are\npresented. Particle mass and centrality dependence of the average transverse\nmomenta of $\\Lambda$ and $K^0_S$ are compared with other strange particles,\nproviding evidence of the development of hadronic rescattering in such\ncollisions. The 4$\\pi$ yields of each of these strange hadrons show a\nconsistent centrality dependence. Discussions on radial flow, the strange\nhadron production mechanism, and properties of the medium created in such\ncollisions are presented together with results from hadronic transport and\nthermal model calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2ottNwCmy6LRzU-7IJU6C4k4mBVIXd0wPIZ4w8TPLzU","pdfSize":"861981"}
