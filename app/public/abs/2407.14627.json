We find there exists a dynamical\ntransition from four-body to three-body vortex annihilation processes with the\ntime evolution in a boundary-less uniform quasi-2D BEC. Such dynamical\ntransition depends on the initial vortex pair density, and occurs when the\nsound waves generated in the vortex annihilation process surpass a critical\nenergy. With the confinement along the third direction is relaxed in a quasi-2D\nBEC, the critical sound wave energy decreases due to the 3D vortex line curve\nand reconnection, shifting the dynamical transition to the early time. Our work\nreveals an elementary mechanism for the dissipation of vortex energy that may\nhelp understand exotic matter and dynamics in quantum liquids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
