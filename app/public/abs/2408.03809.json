This paper delves into the computational\nmechanisms underpinning these misunderstandings through the lens of the broken\nLorenz system -- a continuous dynamical model. By manipulating a specific\nparameter regime, we induce bistability within the Lorenz equations, thereby\nconfining trajectories to distinct attractors based on initial conditions. This\nmirrors the persistence of divergent interpretations that often result in\nmisunderstandings. Our simulations reveal that differing prior beliefs between\ninterlocutors result in misaligned generative models, leading to stable yet\ndivergent states of understanding when exposed to the same percept.\nSpecifically, native speakers equipped with precise (i.e., overconfident)\npriors expect inputs to align closely with their internal models, thus\nstruggling with unexpected variations. Conversely, non-native speakers with\nimprecise (i.e., less confident) priors exhibit a greater capacity to adjust\nand accommodate unforeseen inputs. Our results underscore the important role of\ngenerative models in facilitating mutual understanding (i.e., establishing a\nshared narrative) and highlight the necessity of accounting for multistable\ndynamics in dyadic interactions.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DUKgwDJroCRC53BnaDK9bZF-VJM_k1lzIR1Zmrd_Dmc","pdfSize":"3915814"}
