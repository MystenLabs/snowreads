We present first-principles calculations in\nthis $P,T,\\bar{\\rho}$ regime to reveal a plethora of novel liquid-liquid phase\ntransitions (LPTs), making the interpretation of these experiments very\nchallenging. The short-ranged ionic structure of the fluid is preserved under\ncollective adjustments of many distant atoms when subject to compression and\nheating, with surprisingly little change in electrical and thermal\nconductivities $\\sigma$ and $\\kappa$. We match the experimental X-Ray Thompson\nscattering and X-ray diffraction data theoretically, and provide pressure\nisotherms, ionization data and compressibilities that support the above picture\nof liquid silicon as a highly complex LPT-driven ``glassy'' metallic liquid.\nThese novel results are relevant to materials research, studies of planetary\ninteriors, high-energy-density physics, and in laser-fusion studies.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8j9BeuqqiTu9YXCnJFmZ-yYg-mwcO-i-4Lw_5Hrjh4g","pdfSize":"276107"}
