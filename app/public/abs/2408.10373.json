Moreover, disinformation often spreads in direct competition with a\ncorresponding true information. To model these phenomena, we develop a model\nfor two competing beliefs spreading on a social network, where individuals have\nan internal opinion that models their cognitive biases and modulates their\nlikelihood of adopting one of the competing beliefs. By numerical simulations\nof an agent-based model and a mean-field description of the dynamics, we study\nhow the long-term dynamics of the spreading process depends on the initial\nconditions for the number of spreaders and the initial opinion of the\npopulation. We find that the addition of cognitive biases enriches the\ntransient dynamics of the spreading process, facilitating behavior such as the\nrevival of a dying belief and the overturning of an initially widespread\nopinion. Finally, we study how external recruitment of spreaders can lead to\nthe eventual dominance of one of the two beliefs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
