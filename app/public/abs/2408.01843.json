Previous approaches attempt to\nperform bi-domain feature fusion through iterative optimization or end-to-end\ndeep convolutional networks. However, we pose the problem as similar to that of\nimage translation, adopting a two-stage training strategy with a Generative\nAdversarial Network and an object detection model. The translation model learns\na conversion that preserves the structural detail of visible images while\npreserving the texture and other characteristics of infrared images. Images so\ngenerated are used to train standard object detection frameworks including\nYolov5, Mask and Faster RCNN. We also investigate the usefulness of integrating\na super-resolution step into our pipeline to further improve model accuracy,\nand achieve an improvement of as high as 5.3% mAP.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6kpo8wCfthSY_kucr_KWhB1pa7tXLvbRmErIHQIRETM","pdfSize":"896470","txDigest":"FbpWC88fQmdasAzZmxsbYpM4FY4bzQXLZyaxjeUL8GK3","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
