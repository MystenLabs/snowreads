To potentially push for advances in the field, this paper studies\nthe adversarial attack in the black-box setting and proposes an unlabeled\ndata-driven adversarial attack method, called SemiAdv. Specifically, SemiAdv\nachieves the following breakthroughs compared with previous works. First, by\nintroducing the semi-supervised learning technique into the adversarial attack,\nSemiAdv substantially decreases the number of queries required for generating\nadversarial samples. On average, SemiAdv only needs to query a few hundred\ntimes to launch an effective attack with more than 90% success rate. Second,\nmany existing black-box adversarial attacks require massive labeled data to\nmitigate the difference between the local substitute model and the remote\ntarget model for a good attack performance. While SemiAdv relaxes this\nlimitation and is capable of utilizing unlabeled raw data to launch an\neffective attack. Finally, our experiments show that SemiAdv saves up to 12x\nquery accesses for generating adversarial samples while maintaining a\ncompetitive attack success rate compared with state-of-the-art attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
