This gives rise to personalized image generation which involves\ncreating images aligned with an individual's visual preference. Current\ngenerative models are, however, unpersonalized, as they are tuned to produce\noutputs that appeal to a broad audience. Using them to generate images aligned\nwith individual users relies on iterative manual prompt engineering by the user\nwhich is inefficient and undesirable. We propose to personalize the image\ngeneration process by first capturing the generic preferences of the user in a\none-time process by inviting them to comment on a small selection of images,\nexplaining why they like or dislike each. Based on these comments, we infer a\nuser's structured liked and disliked visual attributes, i.e., their visual\npreference, using a large language model. These attributes are used to guide a\ntext-to-image model toward producing images that are tuned towards the\nindividual user's visual preference. Through a series of user studies and large\nlanguage model guided evaluations, we demonstrate that the proposed method\nresults in generations that are well aligned with individual users' visual\npreferences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
