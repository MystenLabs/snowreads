They are related to rich physics processes, including but not\nlimited to magnetic reconnection, flaring, instabilities, and plasma heating.\nAutomated identification of off-limb coronal jets has been difficult due to\ntheir abundant nature, complex appearance, and relatively small size compared\nto other features in the corona. In this paper, we present an automated coronal\njet identification algorithm (AJIA) that utilizes true and fake jets previously\ndetected by a laborious semi-automated jet detection algorithm (SAJIA, Liu et\nal. 2023) as the input of an image segmentation neural network U-NET. It is\nfound that AJIA could achieve a much higher (0.81) detecting precision than\nSAJIA (0.34), meanwhile giving the possibility of whether each pixel in an\ninput image belongs to a jet. We demonstrate that with the aid of artificial\nneural networks, AJIA could enable fast, accurate, and real-time coronal jet\nidentification from SDO/AIA 304 \\AA observations, which are essential in\nstudying the collective and long-term behavior of coronal jets and their\nrelation with the solar activity cycles.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
