We present one of the first\ncomprehensive studies of the variation of galaxy radius with environment beyond\nthe local Universe and demonstrate that large-scale environmental density is\ncorrelated with galaxy radius independent of stellar mass and galaxy\nmorphology. We confirm with $>5\\sigma$ confidence that galaxies in denser\nenvironments are up to $\\sim25\\%$ larger than their equally massive\ncounterparts with similar morphology in less dense regions of the Universe. We\nachieve this result by correlating projected two-dimensional densities over\n$\\sim360$ deg$^2$ with the structural parameters of $\\sim3$ million Hyper\nSuprime-Cam galaxies at $0.3 \\leq z < 0.7$ with $\\log M/M_{\\odot} \\geq 8.9$.\nCompared to most previous studies, this sample is $\\sim100-10,000$ times larger\nand goes $\\sim1$ dex deeper in mass-completeness. We demonstrate that past\nconflicting results have been driven by small sample sizes and a lack of robust\nmeasurement uncertainties. We verify the presence of the above correlation\nseparately for disk-dominated, bulge-dominated, star-forming, and quiescent\nsubpopulations. We find the strength of the correlation to be dependent on\nredshift, stellar mass, and morphology. The correlation is strongest at lower\nredshifts and systematically weakens or disappears beyond $z \\geq 0.5$. At\n$z\\geq0.5$, more massive galaxies still display a statistically significant\ncorrelation. Although some existing theoretical frameworks can be selectively\ninvoked to explain some of the observed correlations, our work demonstrates the\nneed for more comprehensive theoretical investigations of the correlation\nbetween galaxy size and environment.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
