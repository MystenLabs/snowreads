We\nshow that one way to rescue these methods is to assume Roos (Ab.4$^*$)-$k$\naxiom, which we adapt to encompass also resolutions in the framework of\nrelative homological algebra. In the end we discuss the existence of model\nstructures for relative homological algebra for unbounded complex under the\nrelative (Ab.4$^*$)-$k$ condition, and present a variety of examples where our\nresults apply.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tR4AD027DjdMslEgVZ0cBBCTVk3yW0mrDmfPwGCkw5Y","pdfSize":"561404"}
