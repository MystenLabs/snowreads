Current approaches for autonomous\nproximity operations often relies on tracking a reference trajectory previously\ndesigned and optimized on-ground. An innovative concept developed in recent\nyears is proposing a paradigm shift towards autonomous goal-oriented\nstrategies, providing the probe with high-level tasks and enabling replanning\ncapability on-board. A gradient base reachability exploration scheme is\nintroduced in this work to efficiently compute high reward paths with limited\ncomputational resource. The methodology is tested in a case study involving\nproximity operations to asteroid (433) Eros, comparing the proposed approach\nwith other exploration techniques and showing promising results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
