The key idea is to\napproximate the Titchmarsh-Weyl m-function (exact Dirichlet-to-Neumann\noperator) by a rational function with respect to an appropriate spectral\nparameter. By using this method, we overcome the usual high-frequency\nrestriction associated with absorbing boundary conditions in general variable\npotential problems. The resulting fast computational algorithm for absorbing\nboundary conditions ensures accuracy over the entire frequency range.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J4-l2dokUaepArrSMFNb1VAtaBNzZ0i8KktBw6U18nI","pdfSize":"862948","txDigest":"6y7cR9aiiF1v1xXqF3cSBmtj9ZcHXHzWALctt1bnpc7m","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
