In particular, we show that these compactifications inherit their\ncategorical properties from the ultrafilter space monad. We further observe\nthat various constructions such as the prime open filter monad defined by H.\nSimmons, the prime closed filter compactification studied by Bentley and\nHerrlich, as well as the separated completion monad studied by Salbany fall\nwithin the same categorical framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WraED_R5wgxr8wDto0iaKWo0QsoGNlPY9E4z5w2qgBo","pdfSize":"252665"}
