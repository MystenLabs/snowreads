This paper presents a novel\ntheoretical approach that achieves exponential speedups (polynomial runtime)\nover existing simulators for a wide class of quantum circuits. The technique\nleverages advanced group theory and symmetry considerations to map quantum\ncircuits to equivalent forms amenable to efficient classical simulation.\nSeveral fundamental theorems are proven that establish the mathematical\nfoundations of this approach, including a generalized Gottesman-Knill theorem.\nThe potential of this method is demonstrated through theoretical analysis and\npreliminary benchmarks. This work contributes to the understanding of the\nboundary between classical and quantum computation, provides new tools for\nquantum circuit analysis and optimization, and opens up avenues for further\nresearch at the intersection of group theory and quantum computation. The\nfindings may have implications for quantum algorithm design, error correction,\nand the development of more efficient quantum simulators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
