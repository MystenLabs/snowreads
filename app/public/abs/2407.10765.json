Even for the\nsimplest colloidal model -- hard spheres -- there has been much debate\nregarding the potential foreshadowing of nucleation by significant fluctuations\nin either local density or local structure. Considering anisotropic particles\ninstead of spheres adds a third degree of freedom to the self-organization\nprocess of crystal nucleation: orientational ordering. Here, we investigate the\ncrystal nucleation of hard triangular prisms. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we\nfirst carefully determine the crystal-fluid coexistence values and calculate\nthe nucleation barriers for two degrees of supersaturation. Next, we use brute\nforce simulations to obtain a large set of spontaneous nucleation events. By\nstudying the time evolution of the local density, positional ordering, and\norientational ordering in the region in which the nucleus first arises, we\ndemonstrate that all local order parameters increase simultaneously from the\nvery start of the nucleation process. We thus conclude that we observe no\nprecursor for the crystal nucleation of hard triangular prisms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
