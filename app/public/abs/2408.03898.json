This note gives an elementary discussion on some basic\nproperties of a triangle on the Minkowski plane. In particular, we show that\nthe theorem of Feuerbach also holds and a use of the incenter/excenters is\npointed out.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
