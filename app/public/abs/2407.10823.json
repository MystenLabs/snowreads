The aim of this pursuit is to finalize\nthe MG's globular and open cluster system census and to gain a comprehensive\nunderstanding of both the formation and evolution of these systems and our\nGalaxy as a whole. We report the discovery of a new star cluster, named\nGarro~03. We investigated this target using a combination of near-infrared and\noptical databases. We employed VVVX and 2MASS data in the NIR, and Gaia DR3 and\nthe DECaPS2 datasets in the optical passband. We performed a photometrical\nanalysis in order to derive its main physical parameters. Garro~03 is located\nat equatorial coordinates RA=14:01:29.3 and Dec=-65:30:57.0. It is not heavily\naffected by extinction $A_{Ks}=0.25\\pm 0.04$ mag. It is located at heliocentric\ndistance of $14.1\\pm0.5$ kpc, which places Garro~03 at 10.6 kpc from the\nGalactic centre and Z=-0.89 kpc below the Galactic plane. We calculated the\nmean cluster PM of ($\\mu_{\\alpha}^{\\ast},\\mu_{\\delta}) = (-4.57\\pm 0.29,\\\n-1.36\\pm 0.27$) mas yr$^{-1}$. We derived an age=3 Gyr and [Fe/H]~$= -0.5\\pm\n0.2$ by the isochrone-fitting method. The total luminosity was derived in the\n$K_s$ and V-bands, finding $M_{Ks} = -6.32\\pm 1.10$ mag and $M_V =-4.06$ mag.\nThe core and tidal radii were measured constructing the Garro~03 radial density\nprofile and fitting the King model, obtaining $r_c = 3.07\\pm 0.98$ pc and $r_t\n= 19.36\\pm 15.96$ pc. We photometrically confirm the cluster nature for\nGarro~03, located in the Galactic disk. It is a distant, low-luminosity,\nmetal-rich star cluster of intermediate age. We also searched for possible\nsignatures (streams or bridges) between Garro~03 and Garro~01, but we exclude a\npossible companionship. We need spectroscopic data to classify it as an old\nopen cluster or a young globular cluster, and to understand its origin.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J1Jga1wdePFGxp-uxvKMIyOui5NPxy9zGZpJOqVKzJs","pdfSize":"4371709"}
