The computation is\nbased on a non-perturbative solution of the scalar Yukawa model in the\nlight-front Hamiltonian formalism with a Fock sector expansion including up to\none nucleon and two pions. By employing the ``good currents\" $T^{++}_i$,\n$T^{+-}_i$ and $T^{12}_i$, we extract the full set of gravitational form\nfactors $A_i$, $D_i$, $\\bar c_i$ without the contamination of the spurious form\nfactors, and free of uncanceled UV divergences. With these results, we\ndecompose the mass of the system into its constituents and compute the matter\nand mechanical radii, gaining insights into the strongly coupled system.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E1j1iU8subr3ZFYYPGIRGGToSG8_LCpUIv32jEcytHE","pdfSize":"491240"}
