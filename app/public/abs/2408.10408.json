We then focus\non the case of quadric hypersurface rings and use this parallel to construct\nnew analogues of Schur modules. We investigate some of their Lie-theoretic\nproperties (and in more detail in a followup article) and use them to construct\npure free resolutions for quadric hypersurface rings which are completely\nanalogous to the construction given by Eisenbud, Fl{\\o}ystad, and Weyman in the\ncase of polynomial rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
