The main signature\nof this type of ESQPT is a singularity in the level density in the vicinity of\nthe energy of the classical separatrix that divides the phase space into two\ndistinct regions. The quantum states with energies below the separatrix are\nuseful for quantum technologies, because they show a cat-like structure that\nprotects them against local decoherence processes. In this work, we show how\nchaos arising from the interplay between the external drive and the\nnonlinearities of the system destroys the ESQPT and eventually eliminates the\ncat states. Our results demonstrate the importance of the analysis of\ntheoretical models for the design of new parametric oscillators with ever\nlarger nonlinearities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
