The idea is to start with the dispersion relation\nwhich a correlation function obeys, and subtract the known ground-state\ncontribution from the involved spectral density. Solving the resultant\ndispersion relation as an inverse problem with available\noperator-product-expansion inputs, we extract excited-state masses from the\nsubtracted spectral density. This formalism is verified by means of the\napplication to the series of $\\rho$ resonances, which establishes the\n$\\rho(770)$, $\\rho(1450)$ and $\\rho(1700)$ mesons one by one under the\nsequential subtraction procedure. Our previous study has suggested the\nadmixture of the $f_0(1370)$, $f_0(1500)$ and $f_0(1710)$ mesons (the\n$\\eta(1760)$ meson) to be the lightest scalar (pseudoscalar) glueball. The\npresent work predicts that the $f_0(2200)$ ($X(2370)$) meson is the first\nexcited scalar (pseudoscalar) glueball.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
