A DAG-based consensus protocol\ncollaboratively constructs a partial order of blocks of transactions and\nproduces linearly ordered blocks. The ubiquity and strategic importance of\nblockchains call for formal proof of the correctness of key components, namely,\nconsensus protocols. This paper presents a safety-proven formal specification\nof two DAG-based protocols. Our specification highlights several dissemination,\nDAG construction, and ordering variations that can be combined to express the\ntwo protocols. The formalization requires a refinement approach for modeling\nthe consensus. In an abstract model, we first show the safety of DAG-based\nconsensus on leader blocks and then further refine the specification to\nencompass all blocks for all processes. The TLA+ specification for a given\nprotocol consists of 492-732 lines, and the proof system TLAPS verifies\n2025-2294 obligations in 6-8 minutes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FRnhMyhF-Fp20VhWzkJIkhFG0q9rhOxYOCz8ZSPO6dM","pdfSize":"675584","objectId":"0x7504107e3dfcce37783af27f62ccadcb08436ad7f962812b45e732e52646ed83","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
