Taking these viewpoints together yields a rather complex picture of this\nmaterial class which was not anticipated in previous approaches. It opens\npathways to novel applications and reveals the rich ground states beyond the\nfictitious belief in simplicity of perovskites and such structures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"sXf1C8WVGxQrYKPsSIIdWLkwSaTCRj1AygXtEmshi6s","pdfSize":"1020729"}
