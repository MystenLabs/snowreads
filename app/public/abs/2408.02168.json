Under some\ncondition (called BPS condition), the quasi-BPS categories are non-commutative\nanalogues of Hitchin integrable systems.\n  We begin the study of these quasi-BPS categories by focusing on a conjectural\nsymmetry which swaps the Euler characteristic and the weight. Our conjecture is\ninspired by the Dolbeault Geometric Langlands equivalence of Donagi--Pantev, by\nthe Hausel--Thaddeus mirror symmetry, and by the $\\chi$-independence phenomenon\nfor BPS invariants of curves on Calabi-Yau threefolds.\n  We prove our conjecture in the case of rank two and genus zero. In higher\ngenus, we prove a derived equivalence of rank two stable twisted Higgs moduli\nspaces as a special case of our conjecture.\n  In a separate paper, we prove a version of our conjecture for the topological\nK-theory of quasi-BPS categories and we discuss the relation between quasi-BPS\ncategories and BPS invariants of the corresponding local Calabi-Yau threefold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
