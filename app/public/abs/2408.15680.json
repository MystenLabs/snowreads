This paper examines a mathematical model for these\nnetworks, featuring nonlinear elliptic equations for pressure and an auxiliary\nvariable, and a reaction-diffusion parabolic equation for the conductivity\ntensor, introduced in \\cite{portaro2022emergence}. The model, based on an\nenergy functional with diffusive and metabolic terms, allows for various\nentropy generating functions, facilitating its application to different\nbiological scenarios. We proved a local well-posedness result for the problem\nin H\\\"older spaces employing Schauder and semigroup theory. Then, after a\nsuitable parameter reduction through scaling, we computed the numerical\nsolution for the proposed system using a recently developed ghost nodal finite\nelement method \\cite{astuto2024nodal}. An interesting aspect emerges when the\nsolution is very articulated and the branches occupy a wide region of the\ndomain.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xdOIifFT2_3D8J7Oqj_XPeiS62eVtl2oVdsIJb98eHQ","pdfSize":"4850562"}
