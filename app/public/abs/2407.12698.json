For a given\nsymmetry of the order parameter and a generic orientation of the field, we find\nthat the paramagnetic limit for superconductivity diverges at low temperatures.\nFurthermore, we identify a range of temperatures where the transition between\nnormal and superconducting phases becomes of the first order. When two\ntricritical points exist along the transition line, a first order phase\ntransition between two superconducting phases may develop in vicinity of the\ntricritical point with lower temperature. We discuss the implications of our\nfindings for the anisotropy of the upper critical field in UPt$_3$, a candidate\nmaterial for triplet superconductivity, when both the paramagnetic and orbital\neffects are taken into account.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sR7Qhemxk6IrYCEEHdmQFdX71JUdQ7N_XfddmkcfKas","pdfSize":"509786","objectId":"0x92c03b6faa746ee71de20d8d991db15cd285208ede3a69008bfbb2068cce4640","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
