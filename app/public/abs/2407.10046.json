We find that across a broad range of parameters, the energy levels\nconsistently remain real, and coalescing states are always present. The Coulomb\nrepulsion between electrons in a quantum dot affects the order of the\ncoalescing states. This gives rise to two distinct dynamic behaviors: (i) when\nthe initial state is an empty state, the final state supports a nonzero\nelectron-escaping rate; (ii) the electron-escaping rate is zero for a\nsingle-electron initial state. In the former case, our exact solutions reveal\nthat the average electron-escaping rate vanishes along a set of hyperbolic\ncurves in the plane of the chemical potentials of the two quantum dots. The\nstability of the results in the presence of disordered perturbation is also\ninvestigated. Our findings pave the way for investigating Cooper pair splitters\nwithin the framework of non-Hermitian quantum mechanics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
