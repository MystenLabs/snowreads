The latest Particle Data Group (PDG) listing\nsuggests it may be a baryon with $J=5/2$. Therefore, studying the mass spectrum\nand decay properties of $\\Xi(2030)$ has become a current hot topic to\ndefinitively establish its spin-parity. As the three-quark model fails to\nexplain $\\Xi(2030)$, we previously proposed it may be a molecule primarily\ncomposed of $\\bar{K}^{}\\Sigma$ with $J^P=5/2^{+}$, based on its mass spectrum\nstudy. To verify its molecular state interpretation, this work proposes\nstudying the strong decays of $\\Xi(2030)$ assuming it is a $P$-wave\n$J^P=5/2^{+}$ meson-baryon molecule predominantly composed of\n$\\bar{K}^{}\\Sigma$. We calculated all experimentally measured two-body and\nthree-body final state decay widths of $\\Xi(2030)$, including $\\Xi(2030) \\to\n\\bar{K}\\Lambda, \\bar{K}\\Sigma, \\pi\\Xi, \\pi\\Xi^{*}$, and $\\Xi(2030) \\to\n\\pi\\pi\\Xi, \\pi\\bar{K}\\Sigma, \\pi\\bar{K}\\Lambda$. The results indicate that both\nthe total decay width and partial decay widths agree well with experimental\nvalues within the error margins. This supports that $\\Xi(2030)$ is a molecule\nwith spin-parity $J^P = 5/2^{+}$, predominantly composed of\n$\\bar{K}^{*}\\Sigma$. Compared to the experimental central values, our results\nare slightly smaller, which suggests that $\\Xi(2030)$ may contain additional\ncomponents besides meson-baryon molecular components, such as three quark\nstructures.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
