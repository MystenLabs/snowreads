Being a set of zero Hausdorff dimension, the\nanalysis has to be done at the level of functions with a slow decay at infinity\nacting as control for the Fourier transform of (Rajchman) measures supported on\n$\\mathbb{L}$. We give an almost complete characterization of admissible decays\nfor this set in terms of comparison to power-like functions. This work can be\nseen as the ``Fourier side'' of the analysis made by Olsen and Renfro regarding\nthe generalized Hausdorff dimension using gauge functions. We also provide an\napproach to deal with the problem of classifying oscillating candidates for a\nFourier decay for $\\mathbb{L}$ relying on its translation invariance property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"BI30IjWSxOTaWTp7VU6bEes6CC75NTR1pH1qariZXD4","pdfSize":"710280"}
