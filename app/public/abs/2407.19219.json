The discoveries include a white dwarf + L subdwarf binary, VVV\n1256-62AB, a gravitationally bound system located 75.6(+1.9/-1.8) pc away with\na projected separation of 1375(+35/-33) au. The primary is a cool DC white\ndwarf with a hydrogen dominated atmosphere, and has a total age of\n10.5(+3.3/-2.1) Gyr, based on white dwarf model fitting. The secondary is an L\nsubdwarf with a metallicity of [M/H] = -0.72(+0.08/-0.10) (i.e. [Fe/H] =\n-0.81+/-0.10) and Teff = 2298(+45/-43) K based on atmospheric model fitting of\nits optical to near infrared spectrum, and likely has a mass just above the\nstellar/substellar boundary. The sub-solar metallicity of the L subdwarf and\nthe system's total space velocity of 406 km/s indicates membership in the\nGalactic halo, and it has a flat eccentric Galactic orbit passing within 1~kpc\nof the centre of the Milky Way every ~0.4Gyr and extending to 15-31 kpc at\napogal. VVV 1256-62B is the first L subdwarf to have a well-constrained age,\nmaking it an ideal benchmark of metal-poor ultracool dwarf atmospheres and\nevolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
