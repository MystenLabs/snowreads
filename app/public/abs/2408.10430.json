In this paper, we derive general\nidentities for how these operations interact with each other. As an\napplication, we consider a shrinking-wedge $X$ of $(n-1)$-connected finite\nCW-complexes $X_1,X_2,X_3,\\dots$ and compute the infinite-sum closure\n$\\mathcal{W}_{2n-1}(X)$ of the set of Whitehead products $[\\alpha,\\beta]$ in\n$\\pi_{2n-1}\\left(X\\right)$ where $\\alpha,\\beta\\in\\pi_n(X)$ are represented in\nrespective sub-wedges that meet only at the basepoint. In particular, we show\nthat $\\mathcal{W}_{2n-1}(X)$ is canonically isomorphic to\n$\\prod_{j=1}^{\\infty}\\left(\\pi_{n}(X_j)\\otimes \\prod_{k>j}\\pi_n(X_k)\\right)$.\nThe insight provided by this computation motivates a conjecture about the\nisomorphism type of the elusive groups $\\pi_{2n-1}(\\mathbb{E}_n)$, $n\\geq 2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
