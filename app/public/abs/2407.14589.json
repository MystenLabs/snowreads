Motivated by\nthe potential implications for black hole information and the emergence of\nspacetime connectivity, as well as possible applications of spoofing\nentanglement, we investigate the geometrization of two types of entanglement\nspoofers in AdS/CFT: so-called EFI pairs and pseudoentangled state ensembles.\nWe show that (a strengthened version of) EFI pairs with a semiclassical bulk\ndual have a Python's Lunch; the maximally mixed state over the pseudoentangled\nstate ensemble likewise features a Python's Lunch. Since a Python's Lunch must\nlie behind an event horizon, we find that black holes are the exclusive\ngravitational source of entanglement spoofing in the semiclassical limit.\nFinally, we use an extant construction of holographic pseudorandom states to\nyield a candidate example of a pseudoentangled state ensemble with a\nsemiclassical bulk dual.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
