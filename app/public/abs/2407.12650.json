However, these methods face\nlimitations, particularly in terms of the required number of samples and the\nassociated experimental resources. In this work, we present a novel method for\nprecise QPE that diverges from conventional techniques, employs continuous\nmeasurements, and enables accurate QPE with a single quantum trajectory. In an\napplication, we demonstrate the use of the method for the task of parameter\nestimation and force sensing of a levitated nanoparticle.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
