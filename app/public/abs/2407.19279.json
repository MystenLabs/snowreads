The force control and adaptation\nalgorithm is intuitive to design, easy to implement, and improves the grasping\nfunctionality through feedforward adaptation automatically. Specifically, we\nhave extended Youla-parameterization which is traditionally used in feedback\ncontroller design into a feedforward iterative learning control algorithm\n(ILC). The uniqueness of such an extension is that both the feedback and\nfeedforward controllers are parameterized over one unified design parameter\nwhich can be easily customized based on the desired closed-loop performance.\nWhile Youla-parameterization and ILC have been explored in the past on various\napplications, our unique parameterization and computational methods make the\ndesign intuitive and easy to implement. This provides both robust and adaptive\nlearning capabilities, and our application rivals the complexity of many\nrobotic hand control systems. Extensive experimental tests have been conducted\nto validate the effectiveness of our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
