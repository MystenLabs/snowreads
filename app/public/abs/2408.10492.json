The system is designed to support instructors in enhancing student\nlearning through real-time analysis of voice, content, and teaching methods. As\nan initial investigation, we present a case study on lecture voice sentiment\nanalysis, in which we developed a training set comprising over 3,000 one-minute\nlecture voice clips. Each clip was manually labeled as either engaging or\nnon-engaging. Utilizing this dataset, we constructed and evaluated several\nclassification models based on a variety of features extracted from the voice\nclips. The results demonstrate promising performance, achieving an F1-score of\n90% for boring lectures on an independent set of over 800 test voice clips.\nThis case study lays the groundwork for the development of a more sophisticated\nmodel that will integrate content analysis and pedagogical practices. Our\nultimate goal is to aid instructors in teaching more engagingly and effectively\nby leveraging modern artificial intelligence techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
