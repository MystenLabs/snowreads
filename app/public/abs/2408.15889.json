The QS is built from the density-dependent\nquark mass model (DDQM), modified to obtain higher maximum gravitational mass\n($\\rm M_{max}$) of the QS using the data from observed pulsars: XMMU\nJ173203.3-344518, PSR J0030+0451, PSR J0740+6620, and PSR J0952-0607 as\nconstraints in Bayesian inference. We observed that the quark matter (QM) that\ncomposes QSs with $\\rm M_{max} > 2M_\\odot$ violates the conformality criteria\ndetermined through conformal field theory. This behavior is interpreted as a\nconsequence of the increase in quark population with $\\rho_B$ and the\nconcomitant formation of colored quark and gluon condensates, which are\ninfluenced by the pressure build-up in the stellar core as $\\rho_B$ increases.\nThis is reflected in the enhanced DDQM model employed, which introduces an\nadditional term relevant at high densities. On the other hand, for $\\rm M_{max}\n< 2M_\\odot$ we observed the desired behavior of the QM as predicted by quantum\nchromodynamics (QCD) at higher densities, where the interaction decreases with\nincreasing $\\rho_B$ and eventually the quarks become deconfined due to the\ndepletion of the DDQM through an additional attractive contribution in this\ncase.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
