Such fluctuations are strong enough to be measurable\nat low-order statistics such as the energy or enstrophy spectrum. Simple\nheuristics lead to corrections in the spectrum which are proportional to the\nlinear friction coefficient. In this work, we study the spectral correction by\nthe implementation of a GPU-accelerated high-resolution numerical simulation of\nENS covering a large range of Reynolds numbers. Among our findings, we\nhighlight the importance of non-locality when comparing the expected results to\nthe measured ones.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
