One possible reason that this could happen is if $G$\ncontains a clique of size $\\mu^+$. We prove that this is indeed the case when\nthe edge relation is stable. When $G$ is a random graph (which is simple but\nnot stable), this is not true. But still if in general the complete theory of\n$G$ is simple, $G$ must contain finite cliques of unbounded sizes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
