Specifically, the combination of\nQuantum Minimum Finding (obtained from Grover Search) with dynamic programming\nhas proved particularly efficient in improving the complexity of NP-hard\nproblems currently solved by classical dynamic programming. For these problems,\nthe classical dynamic programming complexity in $\\mathcal{O}^*(c^n)$, where\n$\\mathcal{O}^*$ denotes that polynomial factors are ignored, can be reduced by\na hybrid algorithm to $\\mathcal{O}^*(c_{quant}^n)$, with $c_{quant} < c$. In\nthis paper, we provide a bounded-error hybrid algorithm that achieves such an\nimprovement for a broad class of NP-hard single-machine scheduling problems for\nwhich we give a generic description. Moreover, we extend this algorithm to\ntackle the 3-machine flowshop problem. Our algorithm reduces the\nexponential-part complexity compared to the best-known classical algorithm,\nsometimes at the cost of an additional pseudo-polynomial factor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
