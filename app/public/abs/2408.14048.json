R is a regular\nexpression over an alphabet $\\Sigma$, G is directed graph labeled over\n$\\Sigma$, and MM(G,R) contains walks of G. First, consider the set Match(G,R)\ncontaining all walks G labeled by a word (over $\\Sigma$) that conforms to $R$.\nIn general, M(G,R) is infinite, and MM(G,R) is the finite subset of Match(G,R)\nof the walks that are minimal according to a well-quasi-order <. It holds w<w'\nif the multiset of edges appearing in w is strictly included in the multiset of\nedges appearing in w'. Remarkably, the set MM(G,R) contains some walks that may\nbe computed in polynomial time. Hence, it is not the case that the\npreprocessing phase of any algorithm enumerating MM(G,R) must solve an NP-hard\nproblem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
