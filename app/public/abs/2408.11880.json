RAO-SS (Run-time Auto-tuning Optimizer\nfor Sparse Solvers), which is a prototype of auto-tuning software using the\nproposed method, is also evaluated. The RAO-SS is implemented with the\nAutopilot, which is middle-ware to support run-time auto-tuning with fuzzy\nlogic function. The target numerical library is the SuperLU, which is a sparse\ndirect solver for linear equations. The result indicated that: (1) the speedup\nfactors of 1.2 for average and 3.6 for maximum to default executions were\nobtained; (2) the software overhead of the Autopilot can be ignored in RAO-SS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hhD4xzoGLgpeGC4sgh4zc2Tb1uH2GJ5fi30PHoEm8aU","pdfSize":"212491"}
