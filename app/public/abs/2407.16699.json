Among the key\nfeatures of the method is the systematic use of the $L^2$-flattening theorem\nobtained in \\cite{Khalil-Mixing}, coupled with non-concentration estimates for\nthe derivatives of the underlying dynamical system. This method yields\npolylogarithmic Fourier decay for Diophantine self-similar measures, and\npolynomial decay for Patterson-Sullivan measures of convex cocompact hyperbolic\nmanifolds, Gibbs measures associated to non-integrable $C^2$ conformal systems,\nas well as stationary measures for carpet-like non-conformal iterated function\nsystems. Applications include essential spectral gaps on convex cocompact\nhyperbolic manifolds, fractal uncertainty principles, and equidistribution\nproperties of typical vectors in fractal sets.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
