The energy level structures of emission\nprocesses are critical for reaching and controlling high-quality sources. The\nmost commonly applied test uses a Hanbury-Brown and Twiss (HBT) setup to\ndetermine the emitter energy level structure based on fitting temporal\ncorrelations of photon detection events. However, only partial information\nabout the emission process is extracted from such detection, that might be\nfollowed by an inconclusive fitting of the data. This process predetermines our\nlimited ability to quantify and understand the dynamics in the photon emission\nprocess that are of importance for the applications in communication, sensing\nand computing. In this work, we present a complete analysis based on all\nnormalized coincidences between detection and no-detection events recorded in\nthe same HBT setup to certify expected properties of an emitted photonic state.\nAs a proof of concept we apply our methodology to single nitrogen-vacancy\ncenters in diamond, in which case the certification conclusively rejects a\nmodel based on a two-level emitter that radiates a photonic states mixed with\nany classical noise background.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
