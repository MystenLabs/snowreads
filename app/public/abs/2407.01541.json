State information from computer networks is\ntransformed into embedded vectors, enabling the operator to efficiently\nrecognize different pieces of information and accurately output appropriate\noperations for the computer network at each step. The operator has undergone\ncomprehensive testing, achieving a 100% accuracy rate, thus eliminating\noperational risks. Furthermore, a novel algorithm is proposed to emphasize\ncrucial training losses, aiming to enhance the efficiency of operator training.\nAdditionally, a simple computer network simulator is created and encapsulated\ninto training and testing environment components, enabling automation of the\ndata collection, training, and testing processes. This abstract outlines the\ncore contributions of the paper while highlighting the innovative methodology\nemployed in the development and validation of the AI-based network operator.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
