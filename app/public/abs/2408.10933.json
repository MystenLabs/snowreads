However, it is often difficult to recruit sufficient\nparticipants, especially if the target population is small, particularly busy,\nor in some way restricted in their mobility. We bypassed these problems by\nconducting studies on trade fairs that were specifically designed for our\ntarget population (potentially care-receiving individuals in wheelchairs) and\ntherefore provided our users with external incentive to attend our study. This\npaper presents our gathered experiences, including methodological\nspecifications and lessons learned, and is aimed to guide other researchers\nwith conducting similar studies. In addition, we also discuss chances generated\nby this unconventional study environment as well as its limitations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V0D4wT5AmWx3idz6UYOwjLNCBnwTM8cVYB3MWI90J1k","pdfSize":"15990861"}
