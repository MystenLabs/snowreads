We propose a\nstatistically principled approach to these screening experiments, using the\nmachinery of supersaturated designs and the Lasso. To accommodate limitations\non the number of biological entities that can be applied to a single microplate\nwell, we present a new class of row-constrained supersaturated designs. We\ndevelop a computational procedure to construct these designs, provide some\ninitial lower bounds on the average squared off-diagonal values of their\nmain-effects information matrix, and study the impact of the constraint on\ndesign quality. We also show via simulation that the proposed constrained row\nscreening method is statistically superior to existing methods and demonstrate\nthe use of the new methodology on a real drug-discovery system.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z4QzYVFYDSp9TRk9FziMOK38U3qu0d4CxeY8tFeEmXA","pdfSize":"471876"}
