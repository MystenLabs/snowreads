Lego is a widely used platform for\ncombinatorial assembly, in which people use unit primitives (ie Lego bricks) to\nbuild highly customizable 3D objects. This paper studies sequence planning for\nphysical combinatorial assembly using Lego. Given the shape of the desired\nobject, we want to find a sequence of actions for placing Lego bricks to build\nthe target object. In particular, we aim to ensure the planned assembly\nsequence is physically executable. However, assembly sequence planning (ASP)\nfor combinatorial assembly is particularly challenging due to its combinatorial\nnature, ie the vast number of possible combinations and complex constraints. To\naddress the challenges, we employ deep reinforcement learning to learn a\nconstruction policy for placing unit primitives sequentially to build the\ndesired object. Specifically, we design an online physics-aware action mask\nthat efficiently filters out invalid actions and guides policy learning. In the\nend, we demonstrate that the proposed method successfully plans physically\nvalid assembly sequences for constructing different Lego structures. The\ngenerated construction plan can be executed in real.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
