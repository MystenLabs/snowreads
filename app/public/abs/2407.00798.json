Due to the absence\nof rigid boundaries inside the gas, a horizontal pressure gradient in a static\nstate cannot exist in the allocated volume. The pressure inside the allocated\nvolume with a different density is equal to the external pressure and the\nintra-mass buoyancy force, according to its definition, is formally zero. The\nobserved force of intra-mass buoyancy arises due to the difference in vertical\npressure gradients in media with different densities. In this case, the\nbuoyancy force is volumetric, and its value corresponds to generally accepted\nratios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
