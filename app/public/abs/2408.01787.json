I argue that modelling these phenomena via ontologies\nallows for coherent integration of data coming from diverse sources, automated\nreasoning over such data, as well as intelligence extraction and reuse from and\nof them. Existing ontological tools in cybersecurity can be ameliorated by\nconnecting them to neighboring domains such as law, regulations, governmental\ninstitutions, and documents. In this paper, I propose metrics to evaluate\ncurrently existing ontological tools to create formal representations in the\ncybersecurity domain, and I provide a plan to develop and extend them when they\nare lacking.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
