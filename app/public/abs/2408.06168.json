The company aims to\nsimultaneously control its terminal wealth (e.g. at the end of an accounting\nperiod) and the ruin probability in a finite time interval by purchasing\nreinsurance. The target functional is given by the expected utility of terminal\nwealth perturbed by a modified Gerber-Shiu penalty function. We solve the\nproblem of finding the optimal reinsurance strategy and the corresponding\nmaximal target functional via neural networks. The procedure is illustrated by\na numerical example, where the surplus process is given by a Cram\\'er-Lundberg\nmodel perturbed by a mean-reverting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
