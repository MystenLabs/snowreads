However, it is still unclear whether these oscillations are driven\nby the external acoustic waves (p-modes) or generated by the internal\nmagnetoconvection. To obtain clues about the driving source of umbral waves in\nsunspots, we analyzed the spiral wave patterns (SWPs) in two sunspots\nregistered by IRIS MgII 2796 {\\AA} slit-jaw images. By tracking the motion of\nthe SWPs, we find for the first time that two one-armed SWPs coexist in the\numbra, and they can rotate either in the same or opposite directions.\nFurthermore, by analyzing the spatial distribution of the oscillation centers\nof the one-armed SWPs within the umbra (the oscillation center is defined as\nthe location where the SWP first appears), we find that the chromospheric\numbral waves repeatedly originate from the regions with high oscillation power\nand most of the umbral waves occur in the dark nuclei and strong magnetic field\nregions of the umbra. Our study results indicate that the chromospheric umbral\nwaves are likely excited by the p-mode oscillations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
