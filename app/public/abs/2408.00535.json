{"id":"2408.00535","title":"An explicit formula for free multiplicative Brownian motions via\n  spherical functions","authors":"Martin Auer, Michael Voit","authorsParsed":[["Auer","Martin",""],["Voit","Michael",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2024 13:17:40 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-02","timestamp":1722518260000,"abstract":"  After some normalization, the logarithms of the ordered singular values of\nBrownian motions on $GL(N,\\mathbb F)$ with $\\mathbb F=\\mathbb R, \\mathbb C$\nform Weyl-group invariant Heckman-Opdam processes on $\\mathbb R^N$ of type\n$A_{N-1}$. We use classical elementary formulas for the spherical functions of\n$GL(N,\\mathbb C)/SU(N)$ and the associated Euclidean spaces $H(N,\\mathbb C)$ of\nHermitian matrices, and show that in the $GL(N,\\mathbb C)$-case, these\nprocesses can be also interpreted as ordered eigenvalues of Brownian motions on\n$H(N,\\mathbb C)$ with particular drifts. This leads to an explicit description\nfor the free limits for the associated empirical processes for $N\\to\\infty$\nwhere these limits are independent from the parameter $k$ of the Heckman-Opdam\nprocesses. In particular we get new formulas for the distributions of the free\nmultiplicative Browniam motion of Biane. We also show how this approach works\nfor the root systems $B_N, C_N, D_N$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
