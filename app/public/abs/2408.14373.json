For information engines, the principal challenge lies in how to store\nthe generated work for subsequent utilization. Here, we report an experimental\ndemonstration where quantized mechanical motion serves as a quantum battery and\ngets charged in repeated cycles by a single trapped-ion information engine.\nThis is enabled by a key technological advancement in rapid state\ndiscrimination, allowing us to suppress measurement-induced disturbances.\nConsequently, we were able to obtain a charging efficiency over 50\\% of the\ntheoretical limit at the optimal temperature. The experimental results\nsubstantiate that this approach can render trapped ions a promising platform\nfor microscopic information engines with potential applications in the future\nupon scaling up.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
