In the proposed system, a GEO satellite operates\nas a primary network, and a T-RIS-equipped LEO satellite operates as a\nsecondary IoT network. The objective is to maximize the sum rate of\nT-RIS-equipped LEO satellite communication using downlink NOMA while ensuring\nthe service quality of GEO cellular users. Our framework simultaneously\noptimizes the total transmit power of LEO, NOMA power allocation for LEO IoT\n(LIoT) and T-RIS phase shift design subject to the service quality of LIoT and\ninterference temperature to the primary GEO network. To solve the non-convex\nsum rate maximization problem, we first adopt successive convex approximations\nto reduce the complexity of the formulated optimization. Then, we divide the\nproblem into two parts, i.e., power allocation of LEO and phase shift design of\nT-RIS. The power allocation problem is solved using KKT conditions, while the\nphase shift problem is handled by Taylor approximation and semidefinite\nprogramming. Numerical results are provided to validate the proposed\noptimization framework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
