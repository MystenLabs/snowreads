An\nunderstudied phenomenon possibly affecting the pace of permafrost thaw is the\nonset of convective motions within the active layer caused by the density\nanomaly of water. Here, we explore the effects of groundwater convection on\npermafrost thawing using a model that accounts for ice - water phase\ntransitions, coupled with the dynamics of the temperature field transported by\nthe Darcy's flow across a porous matrix. Numerical simulations of this model\nshow that ice thawing in the presence of convection is much faster than in the\ndiffusive case and deepens at a constant velocity proportional to the soil\npermeability. A scaling argument is able to predict correctly the asymptotic\nvelocity. Since in the convective regime the heat transport is mediated by the\ncoherent motion of thermal plumes across the thawed layer, we find that the\ndepth of the thawing interface becomes highly heterogeneous.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
