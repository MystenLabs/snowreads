We first introduce the interacting model of RnG, which\nincludes the noninteracting continuum model and the many-body Coulomb\ninteraction. We then discuss the integer quantum anomalous Hall (IQAH) effect\nin RnG and the role of the Hartree-Fock approach in understanding its\nappearance. Next, we explore the FQAH effect in RnG for $n=3$--$6$ using a\ncombination of constrained Hartree-Fock and exact diagonalization methods. We\ncharacterize the stability of the FQAH phase by the size of the FQAH gap and\nfind that RnG generally has a stable FQAH phase, although the required\ndisplacement field varies significantly among different $n$ values. Our work\nestablishes the theoretical universality of both IQAH and FQAH in RnG.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
