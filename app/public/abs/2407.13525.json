{"id":"2407.13525","title":"Short-period Post-Common Envelope Binaries with Balmer Emission from\n  SDSS and LAMOST Based on ZTF Photometric Data","authors":"Lifang Li, Fenghui Zhang","authorsParsed":[["Li","Lifang",""],["Zhang","Fenghui",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 13:58:59 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-19","timestamp":1721311139000,"abstract":"  We present here 55 short period PCEBs containing a hot WD and a low-mass MS.\nBased on the photometric data from ZTF DR19, the light curves are analyzed for\nabout 200 WDMS binaries with emission line(s) identified from SDSS or LAMOST\nspectra, in which 55 WDMS binaries are found to exhibit variability in their\nluminosities with a short period and are thus short-period binaries (i.e.\nPCEBs). In addition, it is found that the orbital periods of these PCEBs locate\nin a range from 2.2643 to 81.1526 hours. However, only 6 short-period PCEBs are\nnewly discovered and the orbital periods of 19 PCEBs are improved in this work.\nMeanwhile, it is found that three objects are newly discovered eclipsing PCEBs,\nand a object (i.e. SDSS J1541) might be the short-period PCEB with a late\nM-type star or a brown dwarf companion based on the analysis of its spectral\nenergy distribution. At last, the mechanism(s) being responsible for the\nemission features in the spectra of these PCEBs are discussed, the emission\nfeatures arising in their optical spectra might be caused by the stellar\nactivity or an irradiated component owing to a hot white dwarf companion\nbecause most of them contain a white dwarf with an effective temperature higher\nthan $\\sim$10,000 K.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
