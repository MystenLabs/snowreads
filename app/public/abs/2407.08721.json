The S-matrix\nprinciple of unitarity can be used to construct dynamical coupled-channel\napproaches in which three particles scatter off each other, re-arranging\ntwo-body subsystems by particle exchange. This paper reports the development of\na three-body coupled-channel, amplitude including pions and kaons. The\nunequal-mass amplitude contains two-body S- and P-wave subsystems (\"isobars\")\nof all isospins, $I=0,\\,1/2,\\,1,\\, 3/2, \\, 2$, and it also allows for\ntransitions within a given isobar. The $f_0(500)\\,\n(\"\\sigma\"),\\,f_0(980),\\,\\rho(700), K_0^*(700)\\,(\"\\kappa\")$, and $K^*(892)$\nresonances are included, apart from repulsive isobars. Different methods to\nevaluate the amplitude for physical momenta are discussed. Production\namplitudes for $a_1$ quantum numbers are shown as a proof of principle for the\nnumerical implementation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
