The dimer is set to be stationary at its\nequilibrium bond length with the projectile traveling parallel to the dimer\naxis at a speed corresponding to the collision energy of 10 keV/amu. Two\napproaches called multinomial and determinantal are used as an analysis of\nthese collisions. Each of the analyses is broken down into two types of models\nthat do not and do include a change in the projectile charge state due to\nelectron capture from the dimer. All calculations are performed using both a\nfrozen atomic target and a dynamic response model using the coupled-channel\ntwo-center basis generator method for orbital propagation. All one- and two-\nelectron removal processes are calculated, though particular attention is paid\nto those that result in the Ne$^{+}$-Ne$^{+}$ fragmentation channel due to its\nassociation with interatomic Coulombic decay (ICD). We confirm in all analyses\nand models that Ne(2$s$) electron removal is strong so that ICD will contribute\nto dimer fragmentation as has been previously demonstrated. The model that\ntakes into account the change in projectile charge state indicates that there\nis a pure ICD yield when utilizing a He$^{+}$ projectile.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
