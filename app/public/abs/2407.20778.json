We consider a system in which multiple\ntransmitters provide wireless services over a shared frequency band. Our\nobjective is to maximize the average throughput within an area of interest.\nSystem operators can design the system parameters prior to deployment by\niterating through channel simulations and updating parameters. However,\naccurate channel simulations are computationally expensive, thus it is\npreferable to configure the system using a limited number of simulation\niterations. We develop a solver for this problem based on Bayesian optimization\n(BO), a black-box optimization method. Numerical results demonstrate that our\nproposed framework can achieve 18-22% higher throughput performance compared to\nconventional placement and power optimization strategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
