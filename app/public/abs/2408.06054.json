The expression for parallel transport is preserved by\ntaking the quotient under certain scenarios. In particular, for a Stiefel\nmanifold of orthogonal matrices of size $n\\times d$, we give an expression for\nparallel transport along a geodesic from time zero to $t$, that could be\ncomputed with time complexity of $O(nd^2)$ for small $t$, and of $O(td^3)$ for\nlarge t, contributing a step in a long-standing open problem in matrix\nmanifolds. A similar result holds for flag manifolds with the canonical metric.\nWe also show the parallel transport formulas for the generalized linear group,\nand the special orthogonal group under these metrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
