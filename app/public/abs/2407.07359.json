This method complements spectral-index\ninformation and extrapolation from centimeter wavelength maps. We use the\nderived maps to estimate the properties of up to 34 HII regions across the\nALMA-IMF protoclusters. The hydrogen ionizing-photon rate $Q_0$ and spectral\ntypes follow the evolutionary trend proposed by Motte et al. The youngest\nprotoclusters lack detectable ionized gas, followed by protoclusters with\nincreasing numbers of OB stars. The total $Q_0$ increases from $\\sim 10^{45}$\ns$^{-1}$ to $> 10^{49}$ s$^{-1}$. We used the adjacent He$41\\alpha$ line to\nmeasure the relative number abundances of helium, finding values consistent\nwith the Galactic interstellar medium, although a few outliers are discussed. A\nsearch for sites of maser amplification of the H$41\\alpha$ line returned\nnegative results. We looked for possible correlations between the electron\ndensities ($n_e$), emission measures (EM), and $Q_0$ with HII region size $D$.\nThe latter are the better correlated, with $Q_0 \\propto D^{2.49\\pm0.18}$. This\nfavors interpretations where smaller ultracompact HII regions are not\nnecessarily the less dynamically evolved versions of larger ones, but rather\nare ionized by less massive stars. Moderate correlations were found between\ndynamical width $\\Delta V_\\mathrm{dyn}$ with $D$ and $Q_0$. $\\Delta\nV_\\mathrm{dyn}$ increases from about one to two times the ionized-gas sound\nspeed. Finally, an outlier HII region south of W43-MM2 is discussed. We suggest\nthat this source could harbor an embedded stellar or disk wind.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FXTZ3yBhCCr9i2QU4HrwjaZUP0j0lJRKJj3f-G9gVcM","pdfSize":"4743119"}
