This line of questioning follows\nin the footsteps of Abouzaid and Kragh, and more generally of the Arnol'd\nconjecture. Notably, we will see that while exact Lagrangians cannot be spheres\nin this setting, a naive adaptation of the Abouzaid-Kragh theorem does not hold\nin this generalization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
