However, in a\nstaggered magnetic field, used for state preparation in recent Rydberg array\nexperiments, magnons can decay in both dipolar ferromagnets and\nantiferromagnets. Remarkably, such decays do not require a minimum threshold\nfield, and happen over a nearly fixed fraction of the Brillouin Zone in the XY\nlimit, highlighting the significant role played by dipolar interactions. In\naddition, topological transitions in the decay surfaces lead to singularities\nin the magnon spectrum. Regularizing such singular behavior via a\nself-consistent approach, we make predictions for dynamical spin correlations\naccessible to near-term quantum simulators and sensors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
