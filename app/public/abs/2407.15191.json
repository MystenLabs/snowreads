This resonant phenomenon\nnot only allows us to decipher a long-standing mystery concerning the peculiar\nbehaviors of QNMs but also stands as a novel beacon for characterizing black\nhole spacetime geometry. Our findings pave the way for rigorous examinations of\nblack holes and the exploration of new physics in gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
