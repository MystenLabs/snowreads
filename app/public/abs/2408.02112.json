A recursive\nblock data structure is used, with all operations preserving the block\nabstraction. These include constructor functions, ring operations such as\naddition and product, and inversion. The package is demonstrated by calculating\nthe PLU factorization of a block matrix.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
