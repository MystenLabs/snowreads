The nonlinear estimator uses a linear estimator structure based on the\nlinearised Navier-Stokes equations and explicitly calculates the nonlinear\nforcing from the estimated velocities in physical space. The goal is to use the\nvelocities at one wall-normal height to estimate the velocities at other\nwall-normal heights. The estimation performance is compared among the nonlinear\nestimator, the linear estimator and the linear estimator augmented with eddy\nviscosity. At $Re_{\\tau}=180$, the nonlinear estimator and the linear estimator\naugmented with eddy viscosity outperform the linear estimator in terms of\nestimating the velocity magnitudes, structures and energy transfer (production\nand dissipation) across the channel height. The limitations of using\nmeasurement data at one wall-normal height are discussed. At $Re_{\\tau}=590$,\nthe nonlinear estimator does not work well with only one measurement plane,\nwhereas the linear estimator augmented with eddy viscosity performs well. The\nperformance of the nonlinear estimator at $Re_{\\tau}=590$ is significantly\nenhanced by providing multiple measurement planes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
