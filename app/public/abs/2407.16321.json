In contrast to conventional\nsimulation, which experiences an exponential increase in computational\ncomplexity, quantum simulation cost increases only linearly with increasing\nsize of the problem, rendering it a promising tool for applications in quantum\nchemistry. The variational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm is a particularly\npromising application for investigating molecular electronic structures. For\nits experimental implementation, spin-based solid-state qubits have the\nadvantage of long decoherence time and high-fidelity quantum gates, which can\nlead to high accuracy in the ground-state finding. This study uses the\nnitrogen-vacancy-center system in diamond to implement the\nvariational-quantum-eigensolver algorithm and successfully finds the eigenvalue\nof a specific Hamiltonian without the need for error-mitigation techniques.\nWith a fidelity of 98.9% between the converged state and the ideal eigenstate,\nthe demonstration provides an important step toward realizing a scalable\nquantum simulator in solid-state spin systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
