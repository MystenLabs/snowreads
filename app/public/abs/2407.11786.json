However, predicting stock prices accurately\nis difficult because financial markets are complex and constantly changing.\nThis is especially true for the cryptocurrency market, which is known for its\nextreme volatility, making it challenging for traders and investors to make\nwise and profitable decisions. This study introduces a machine learning\napproach to predict cryptocurrency prices. Specifically, we make use of\nimportant technical indicators such as Exponential Moving Average (EMA) and\nMoving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) to train and feed the XGBoost\nregressor model. We demonstrate our approach through an analysis focusing on\nthe closing prices of Bitcoin cryptocurrency. We evaluate the model's\nperformance through various simulations, showing promising results that suggest\nits usefulness in aiding/guiding cryptocurrency traders and investors in\ndynamic market conditions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
