This new approach, termed the Hyndman-Ullah\nwith truncated signatures (HUts) model, aims to enhance the accuracy and\nrobustness of mortality predictions. By utilizing signature regression, the\nHUts model aims to capture complex, nonlinear dependencies in mortality data\nwhich enhances forecasting accuracy across various demographic conditions. The\nmodel is applied to mortality data from 12 countries, comparing its forecasting\nperformance against classical models like the Lee-Carter model and variants of\nthe HU models across multiple forecast horizons. Our findings indicate that\noverall the HUts model not only provides more precise point forecasts but also\nshows robustness against data irregularities, such as those observed in\ncountries with historical outliers. The integration of signature-based methods\nenables the HUts model to capture complex patterns in mortality data, making it\na powerful tool for actuaries and demographers. Prediction intervals are also\nconstructed using bootstrapping methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
