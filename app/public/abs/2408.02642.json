Here we consider\ncoefficients that are tempered distributions with respect to the space variable\nand are continuous in time. We prove that the corresponding Cauchy problem,\nwhich in general cannot even be stated in the standard distributional setting,\nadmits a Schwartz very weak solution which is unique modulo negligible\nperturbations. Consistency with the classical theory is proved in the case of\nregular coefficients and Schwartz Cauchy data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
