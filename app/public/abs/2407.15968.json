This approach highlights the effects of gravitational waves on\nboth the particles and the observer, emphasizing that only relative\nmeasurements can be made. Specifically, within this framework, the\ngravitational field of the waves is described using the gravitoelectromagnetic\nanalogy. The interaction of the system is then determined by the\ngravitomagnetic field of the wave, which induces a time-dependent perturbation.\nWe analyze this perturbation for both generic frequencies and resonance\nconditions, and discuss its implications.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
