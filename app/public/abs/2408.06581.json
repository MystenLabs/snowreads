The local spin density\nfluctuation of quarks due to the axial-vector and tensor interactions between\nquarks can induce the spin alignments of vector meson. It is found that\naxial-vector interaction results in $\\rho_{00}<1/3$ for the spin alignment of\n$\\phi$ meson, while tensor interaction results in $\\rho_{00}>1/3$. We argue\nthat the spin alignment of $K^{*0}$ due to the spin density fluctuation from\nflavor-mixing would be a signature or hint of instanton.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
