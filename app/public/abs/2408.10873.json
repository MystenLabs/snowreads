In this work, we investigated the computational implications\nand circuit mechanisms underlying these neurophysiological observations in an\nearly visual cortical circuit model. We found that such a recurrent neural\ncircuit, shaped by BCM Hebbian learning, can also reproduce these phenomena.\nThe resulting circuit became more robust against noises in encoding the\nfamiliar stimuli. Analysis of the geometry of the neural response manifold\nrevealed that recurrent computation and familiar learning transform the\nresponse manifold and the neural dynamics, resulting in enhanced robustness\nagainst noise and better stimulus discrimination. This prediction is supported\nby preliminary physiological evidence. Familiarity training increases the\nalignment of the slow modes of network dynamics with the invariant features of\nthe learned images. These findings revealed how these rapid plasticity\nmechanisms can improve contextual visual processing in even the early visual\nareas in the hierarchical visual system.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
