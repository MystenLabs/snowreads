In this paper, we investigate equivalence of planar\nknotoids using quandle colorings and cocycle invariants. These quandle\ninvariants are able to detect planarity by considering quandle colorings that\nare restricted at distinguished points in the diagram, namely the endpoints and\nthe point-at-infinity. After defining these invariants we consider their\napplications to symmetry properties of planar knotoids such as invertibility\nand chirality. Furthermore we introduce an invariant called the triangular\nquandle cocycle invariant and show that it is a stronger invariant than the end\nspecified quandle colorings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
