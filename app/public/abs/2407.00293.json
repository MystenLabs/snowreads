However, clear models dictating their\nbehavior in an electroactive electrolyte have not been identified yet. In this\nstudy, we investigate on CPD in an aqueous electrolyte by impedance\nspectroscopy to unify their signal transport with an electrical model, aiming\nto define a circuit simulation block to integrate these objects in systems for\nin materio information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ORrgCOkLtXPAd7yzzENdr7qR7YBG8DDMQY3Ik0AZbko","pdfSize":"2148937"}
