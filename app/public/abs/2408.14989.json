This $f(R,G)$ model framework is composed of the interactions\nbetween dark matter and scalar field through the linear coupling term. The key\nobjective of present study is to describe the cosmological viability of\nmodified gravity theory formulated with the $ f(R, \\mathcal{G}) $ gravity. We\ntransform the cosmological equations into an autonomous system of ordinary\ndifferential equations by suitable transformation of variables. The $\nf(R,\\mathcal{G})$ model governed by $ f(R, \\mathcal{G}) = \\alpha R^m + \\beta\n\\mathcal{G}^n $ has been investigated in detail to characterize the stability\nproperties of the critical points of the autonomous system. The model may\nexplain the late-time accelerating universe expansion corresponding to the\nattractor in model. Depending on the effective equation of state parameter\nvalues corresponding to the critical points, we study the observational\nviability of model using low-redshift observational data such as the\nobservational Hubble data and Pantheon data. Furthermore, we investigate the\neffects of parameters by using the effective equation of state parameter and\nstatefinder diagnostics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YVQtCq3fmXstzy7NGfD6nnkt1nCYBQncZk_cvFYLP7w","pdfSize":"2587510"}
