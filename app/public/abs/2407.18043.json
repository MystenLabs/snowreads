However, methods based on extracting\nand registering corresponding points still face challenges in terms of\nautomation and precision. This paper proposes a novel fully automatic extrinsic\ncalibration method for LiDAR-camera systems that circumvents the need for\ncorresponding point registration. In our approach, a novel algorithm to extract\nrequired LiDAR correspondence point is proposed. This method can effectively\nfilter out irrelevant points by computing the orientation of plane point clouds\nand extracting points by applying distance- and density-based thresholds. We\navoid the need for corresponding point registration by introducing extrinsic\nparameters between the LiDAR and camera into the projection of extracted points\nand constructing co-planar constraints. These parameters are then optimized to\nsolve for the extrinsic. We validated our method across multiple sets of\nLiDAR-camera systems. In synthetic experiments, our method demonstrates\nsuperior performance compared to current calibration techniques. Real-world\ndata experiments further confirm the precision and robustness of the proposed\nalgorithm, with average rotation and translation calibration errors between\nLiDAR and camera of less than 0.05 degree and 0.015m, respectively. This method\nenables automatic and accurate extrinsic calibration in a single one step,\nemphasizing the potential of calibration algorithms beyond using corresponding\npoint registration to enhance the automation and precision of LiDAR-camera\nsystem calibration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
