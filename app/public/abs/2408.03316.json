Recently it has been shown that this type of feedback\ncan lead to persistent motion above a threshold in parameter space [Physical\nReview E 107, 024611 (2023)]. Here we investigate, numerically and by\nanalytical methods, the rate of heat production in the different regimes around\nthe threshold to persistent motion. We find a nonzero average heat production\nrate, $\\langle \\dot{q}\\rangle$, already below the threshold, indicating the\nnonequilibrium character of the system even at small feedback. In this regime,\nwe compare to analytical results for a corresponding linearized delayed system\nand a small-delay approximation which provides a reasonable description of\n$\\langle \\dot{q}\\rangle$ at small repulsion (or delay time). Beyond the\nthreshold, the rate of heat production is much larger and shows a maximum as\nfunction of the delay time. In this regime, $\\langle \\dot{q}\\rangle$ can be\napproximated by that of a system subject to a constant force stemming from the\nlong-time velocity in the deterministic limit. The distribution of dissipated\nheat, however, is non-Gaussian, contrary to the constant-force case.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
