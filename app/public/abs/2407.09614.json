Notably, this can be accomplished\nwithout introducing a flavor-specific portal to dark matter, imposing any new\nflavor symmetry, or involving flavon fields. As a case study, we analyze the\ncorrelation between the flavor-philic nature of dark matter and neutrino\noscillation data in the type-II seesaw and Zee-Babu models, and extend this\ndiscussion to other neutrino mass models. We analyze the indirect signatures of\nsuch leptophilic dark matter, specifically examining the spectrum of the cosmic\nray electron/positron flux resulting from the pair annihilation of dark matter\nin the Galactic halo, and explore correlated lepton-specific signals at\ncollider experiments sensitive to neutrino oscillation data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
