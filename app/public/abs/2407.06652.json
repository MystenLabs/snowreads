To obtain the proper enhanced\npower graph, we consider the induced subgraph on the set G\\D, where D\nrepresents the set of dominating vertices in the enhanced power graph. In this\npaper, we aim to determine the strong domination number of the proper enhanced\npower graphs of finite nilpotent groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
