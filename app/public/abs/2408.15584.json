Answering a question posed by Vershik, we describe the\nstratification of the metric cone induced by the combinatorial type of these\npolytopes through a hyperplane arrangement. Moreover, we study its\nrelationships with the stratification by combinatorial type of the injective\nhull (i.e., the tight span) and, in particular, with certain types of metrics\narising in phylogenetic analysis. We also compute enumerative invariants in the\ncase of metrics on up to six points.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
