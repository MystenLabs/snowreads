We reliably extract the sample temperature in the range 2-7K.\nWe additionally discuss the suitability of our method as a primary standard for\ncryogenic thermometry. By adding an auxiliary heating laser, we are able to\nmeasure the interface conductance between the dielectric crystal and the cold\nplate of the cryostat by exploring different cooling configurations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
