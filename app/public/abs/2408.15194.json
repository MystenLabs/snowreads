Here we use\nthe adaptive mesh refinement code Enzo and the N-body smoothed particle\nhydrodyanmics code SWIFT to compare (semi-)analytic halo mass functions against\nthe results of direct N-body models at high redshift. In particular, our goal\nis to investigate the variance between standard halo mass functions derived\nfrom (semi-)analytic formulations and N-body calculations and to determine what\nrole any discrepancy may play in driving tensions between observations and\ntheory. We find that the difference between direct N-body calculations and halo\nmass function fits is less than a factor of two within the mass range of\ngalaxies currently being observed by JWST and is therefore not a dominant\nsource of error when comparing theory and observation at high redshift.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
