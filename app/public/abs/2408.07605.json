In this paper, we propose Panacea+, a powerful and\nuniversally applicable framework for generating video data in driving scenes.\nBuilt upon the foundation of our previous work, Panacea, Panacea+ adopts a\nmulti-view appearance noise prior mechanism and a super-resolution module for\nenhanced consistency and increased resolution. Extensive experiments show that\nthe generated video samples from Panacea+ greatly benefit a wide range of tasks\non different datasets, including 3D object tracking, 3D object detection, and\nlane detection tasks on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 dataset. These results\nstrongly prove Panacea+ to be a valuable data generation framework for\nautonomous driving.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"13imTbFus8V6ykSioNy9-sgMNrLd5wiA7WgDtniaFUM","pdfSize":"7554235"}
