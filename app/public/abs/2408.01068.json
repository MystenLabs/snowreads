However, we\nfind that the cross section of the higher-order, $\\gamma$- and $Z$-mediated $W$\nboson fusion process is large at high center-of-mass energies $\\sqrt s$,\ngrowing as $(\\log s)^3$. This is in contrast to the $\\log s$ behavior of the\nleading-order $W$ boson fusion. Thus, even though it is a higher-order process,\nthe rate of Higgs boson production for 10 TeV energies at $\\mu^+ \\mu^+$\ncolliders with polarized beams can be as high as about half of the one at\n$\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ colliders, assuming the same integrated luminosity. To calculate\nthe cross section of this process accurately, we carefully treat the collinear\nemission of the photon in the intermediate state. The thereby obtained large\ncross section furthermore shows the significance of Higgs production with an\nextra $W$ boson in the final state also at $\\mu^+ \\mu^-$ and $e^+ e^-$\ncolliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Bwmgfq2VQJpiTJhIf2xhq4odp6ZaNXiixz7V38KmYEI","pdfSize":"933435","txDigest":"Hw9G8u7SUYFfzuGeMXedgvguMjUf12mpwHtJmeaPVE7U","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
