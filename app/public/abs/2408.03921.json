In this paper we survey old and recent generalizations of the\nKKM theorem and their applications in the areas of piercing numbers, mass\npartition, fair division, and matching theory. We also give a few new results\nutilizing KKM-type theorems, and discuss related open problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iPw4tYiINfT7CxLFn-y0j-UvnAGXQ9bp9p0Iks-JsIU","pdfSize":"612634"}
