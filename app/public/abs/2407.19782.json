It is\nestablished that the induced quadrupole mass moment of the clump is controlled\nparametrically by the $M_a/M$ mass ratio of the axion clump and the the binary\ncore.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
