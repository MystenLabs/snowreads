MEV arises when miners or validators\nmanipulate transaction ordering to extract additional value, often at the\nexpense of other network participants. This not only affects user experience by\nintroducing unpredictability and potential financial losses but also threatens\nthe underlying principles of decentralization and trust. Given the growing\ncomplexity of blockchain applications, particularly with the increase of\nDecentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols, addressing MEV is crucial. This paper\npresents a comprehensive survey of MEV mitigation techniques as applied to both\nEthereums L1 and various L2 solutions. We provide a novel categorization of\nmitigation strategies; we also describe the challenges, ranging from\ntransaction sequencing and cryptographic methods to reconfiguring decentralized\napplications (DApps) to reduce front-running opportunities. We investigate\ntheir effectiveness, implementation challenges, and impact on network\nperformance. By synthesizing current research, real-world applications, and\nemerging trends, this paper aims to provide a detailed roadmap for researchers,\ndevelopers, and policymakers to understand and combat MEV in an evolving\nblockchain landscape.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
