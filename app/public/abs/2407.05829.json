In particular, they\nasked to determine the uniform Tur\\'an densities of $K_4^{(3)-}$ and\n$K_4^{(3)}$. After more than 30 years, the former was solved in [Israel J.\nMath. 211 (2016), 349-366] and [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139-1159], while\nthe latter still remains open. Till today, there are known constructions of\n3-uniform hypergraphs with uniform Tur\\'an density equal to 0, 1/27, 4/27 and\n1/4 only. We extend this list by a fifth value: we prove an easy to verify\ncondition for the uniform Tur\\'an density to be equal to 8/27 and identify\nhypergraphs satisfying this condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
