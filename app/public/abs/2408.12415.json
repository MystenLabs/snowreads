The local basis method by\nAmsallem et al. [1] addresses this deficiency by introducing a locally, rather\nthan globally, linear approximation of the solution manifold. However, this\ngenerally successful approach comes with some limitations, especially in the\ndata-poor setting. In this proof-of-concept investigation, we instead propose a\ngraph-based manifold learning approach to nonlinear projection-based MOR which\nuses a global, continuously nonlinear approximation of the solution manifold.\nApproximations of local tangents to the solution manifold, which are necessary\nfor a Galerkin scheme, are computed in the online phase. As an example\napplication for the resulting nonlinear MOR algorithms, we consider simple\nrepresentative volume element computations. On this example, the manifold\nlearning approach Pareto-dominates the POD and local basis method in terms of\nthe error and runtime achieved using a range of model dimensionalities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
