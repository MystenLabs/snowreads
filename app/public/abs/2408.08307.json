For a pre-trained\ngenerative model, the common way to evaluate the quality of the manifold\nrepresentation learned, is by computing global metrics like Fr\\'echet Inception\nDistance using a large number of generated and real samples. However,\ngenerative model performance is not uniform across the learned manifold, e.g.,\nfor \\textit{foundation models} like Stable Diffusion generation performance can\nvary significantly based on the conditioning or initial noise vector being\ndenoised. In this paper we study the relationship between the \\textit{local\ngeometry of the learned manifold} and downstream generation. Based on the\ntheory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we use three geometric\ndescriptors - scaling ($\\psi$), rank ($\\nu$), and complexity ($\\delta$) - to\ncharacterize a pre-trained generative model manifold locally. We provide\nquantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent, the\nlocal descriptors are correlated with generation aesthetics, artifacts,\nuncertainty, and even memorization. Finally we demonstrate that training a\n\\textit{reward model} on the local geometry can allow controlling the\nlikelihood of a generated sample under the learned distribution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"TAALmvqHk1sWuYw4wxZsAKexPKOF5k9Qy474SzPwGzU","pdfSize":"38741648"}
