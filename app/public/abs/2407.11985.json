A system was built for reading the uploaded\nmarksheet using OCR and automatically filling the rows/ columns in the online\nform. Though there are partial solutions to this problem - implemented using\nPyTesseract - the accuracy is low. Hence, the PaddleOCR was used to build the\nmarksheet parser. Several pre-processing and post-processing steps were also\nperformed. The system was tested and evaluated for seven states. Further work\nis being done and the system is being evaluated for more states and boards of\nIndia.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PnnXMit7NKEajt6EFjouVOfpLTrRPSuq2IF0ZeIqvO0","pdfSize":"136862"}
