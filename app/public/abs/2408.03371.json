Analyses tied to Gaia DR3 astrometry,\nphotometry, spectroscopy, radial velocities, and 2MASS-VVV photometry indicate\na common distance of $2.15\\pm0.15$ kpc (\\citealt{lin21} DR3 corrections\napplied). Additional cluster Cepheid candidates requiring follow-up are\nidentified, and it's suggested that a team of international researchers could\nmaintain a cluster Cepheid database to guide the broader community to cases\nwhere consensus exists.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
