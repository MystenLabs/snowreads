The\ngeneral solution to these equations can be written as a power series of the\nevolution parameter. We calculated the sum of these series for the case of a\nfree symmetric body, obtaining its rotation matrix through the elementary\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
