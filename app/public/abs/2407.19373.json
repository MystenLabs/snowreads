Within\nthe machine learning landscape, Data Shapley stands out as a widely embraced\nmethod for data valuation. However, a limitation of Data Shapley is its\nassumption of a fixed dataset, contrasting with the dynamic nature of\nreal-world applications where data constantly evolves and expands. This paper\nestablishes the relationship between Data Shapley and infinite-order\nU-statistics and addresses this limitation by quantifying the uncertainty of\nData Shapley with changes in data distribution from the perspective of\nU-statistics. We make statistical inferences on data valuation to obtain\nconfidence intervals for the estimations. We construct two different algorithms\nto estimate this uncertainty and provide recommendations for their applicable\nsituations. We also conduct a series of experiments on various datasets to\nverify asymptotic normality and propose a practical trading scenario enabled by\nthis method.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
