{"id":"2408.14359","title":"The Climate Cost of Climate Investment: A Two-Period Perspective","authors":"Shaunak Kulkarni, Rohan Ajay Dubey","authorsParsed":[["Kulkarni","Shaunak",""],["Dubey","Rohan Ajay",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 15:33:43 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-27","timestamp":1724686423000,"abstract":"  A one-size-fits-all paradigm that only adapts the scale and immediate outcome\nof climate investment to economic circumstances will provide a short-lived,\neconomically inadequate response to climate issues; given the limited resources\nallocated to green finance, it stands to reason that the shortcomings of this\nwill be exacerbated by the fact that it comes at the cost of long-term,\nself-perpetuating, systemic solutions. Financial commitments that do not\nconsider the capital structure of green finance in an economy will cumulatively\ndis-aggregate the economic cost of climate investment, to erode the competitive\nadvantage of the most innovative economies, while simultaneously imposing the\ngreatest financial burden on economies that are most vulnerable to the impact\nof climate change; such disaggregation will also leave 'middle' economies in a\nstate of flux - honouring similar financial commitments to vulnerable or highly\ndeveloped peers, but unable to generate comparable return, yet sufficiently\ninsulated from the impact of extreme climate phenomena to not organically\ndevelop solutions.\n  In the face of these changing realities, green innovation needs to expand\nbeyond technology and address systemic inefficiencies - lack of clear\nresponsibility, ambiguously defined commitments, and inadequate checks &\nbalances to name a few.\n  Clever application of financial engineering demonstrates promise, and simple\nmeasures like carbon-credit exchanges have been effective in mitigating\nimperfections at the grassroots level. We believe that information- and\nincentive-centric systemic advancements can usher a fresh wave of green\ninnovation that stands on the shoulders of giants to ensure effective\nimplementation of technological breakthroughs; economic development that will\ncreate an international community equipped with a robust framework to deal with\nlong-term crises in a strategic manner.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
