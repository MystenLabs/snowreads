Nevertheless, employing the Physics-Informed Neural Network\n(PINN) method for its solution entails certain limitations. Traditional PINN\napproaches often utilize fully connected network (FCN) architecture, which is\nsusceptible to overfitting, training instability, and gradient vanishing issues\nas the network depth increases. These challenges result in accuracy bottlenecks\nin the solution. In response to these issues, the Residual-based Resample\nPhysics-Informed Neural Network(R2-PINN) is proposed, which proposes an\nimproved PINN architecture that replaces the FCN with a Convolutional Neural\nNetwork with a shortcut(S-CNN), incorporating skip connections to facilitate\ngradient propagation between network layers. Additionally, the incorporation of\nthe Residual Adaptive Resampling (RAR) mechanism dynamically increases sampling\npoints, enhancing the spatial representation capabilities and overall\npredictive accuracy of the model. The experimental results illustrate that our\napproach significantly improves the model's convergence capability, achieving\nhigh-precision predictions of physical fields. In comparison to traditional\nFCN-based PINN methods, R2-PINN effectively overcomes the limitations inherent\nin current methods, providing more accurate and robust solutions for neutron\ndiffusion equations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
