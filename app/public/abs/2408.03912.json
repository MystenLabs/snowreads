To track the optimal\ntrajectories, algorithms that mimic the structure of feedback-feedforward\ncontrol systems are proposed. We begin with their conceptual design in the\nabsence of LFCs, developing a feedback-feedforward algorithm that is fixed-time\nconvergent. For cases with LFCs, existing approaches predominantly rely on\nconstructing a time-dependent barrier function, which may impede the design of\nfixed-time convergent algorithms. Therefore, by exploring the connection\nbetween projection and penalty functions, switched feedforward laws are\ntailored to handle LFCs, with projection used in conjunction. Based on this, we\ndevelop a projection-based feedback-feedforward algorithm, which converges to\nthe exact optimal trajectories, possibly along with a number of switching\ninstants, while exhibiting fixed-time convergence between consecutive switching\ninstants. Numerical experiments verify the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithms.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
