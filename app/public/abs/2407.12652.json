This is done in such a way that multiple\nevolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution\nstep of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces\nthemselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for\nrenormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of\ncellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are\ncomposed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the\nfixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
