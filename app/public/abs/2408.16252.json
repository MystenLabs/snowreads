This particle system is formally derived from a particle\nsystem with random collisions in the grazing regime, and happens to be a\nspecial random batch system with random interaction in the diffusion\ncoefficient. The difference from usual random batch systems with random\ninteraction in the drift is that the batch size has to be $p=2$. We then\nanalyze the convergence rate of the proposed particle system to the Landau-type\nequations using the tool of relative entropy, assuming that the interaction\nkernels are regular enough. A key aspect of our approach is the gradient\nestimates of logarithmic densities, applied to both the Landau-type equations\nand the particle systems. Compared to existing particle systems for the\napproximation of Landau-type equations, our proposed system not only offers a\nmore intrinsic reflection of the underlying physics but also reduces the\ncomputational cost to $O(N)$ per time step when implemented numerically.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
