The quantum model that supports the data is\ninvestigated in detail, as are the roles of nanograting geometry, finite size\neffects, slit width opening angles, and Lennard-Jones potentials. Our findings\nindicate that the atom-surface potential strength parameter is C3 = 6.87 $\\pm$\n1.18 meV.nm3. This value is primarily constrained by the knowledge of the\nnanograting geometry. The high sensitivity of our method paves the way for\nprecise determination of the Casimir-Polder potential and exploration of new\nshort-distance forces.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
