Existing OSSL methods often use the softmax\nconfidence for classifying data as in-distribution (ID) or out-of-distribution\n(OOD). Additionally, many works for OSSL rely on ad-hoc thresholds for ID/OOD\nclassification, without considering the statistics of the problem. We propose a\nnew score for ID/OOD classification based on angles in feature space between\ndata and an ID subspace. Moreover, we propose an approach to estimate the\nconditional distributions of scores given ID or OOD data, enabling\nprobabilistic predictions of data being ID or OOD. These components are put\ntogether in a framework for OSSL, termed \\emph{ProSub}, that is experimentally\nshown to reach SOTA performance on several benchmark problems.
