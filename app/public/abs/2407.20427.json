To measure the MOS, a user experiment is proposed, which has been\nconducted with explanation maps of intentionally distorted images. Three\nmethods from the family of feature attribution methods - Gradient-weighted\nClass Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), Multi-Layered Feature Explanation Method\n(MLFEM), and Feature Explanation Method (FEM) - are compared with this metric.\nAdditionally, the correlation of this new user-centric metric with automatic\nmetrics is studied via Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. MOS of MLFEM\nshows the highest correlation with automatic metrics of Insertion Area Under\nCurve (IAUC) and Deletion Area Under Curve (DAUC). However, the overall\ncorrelations are limited, which highlights the lack of consensus between\nautomatic and user-centric metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
