For\ndistributional data, it has been challenging to develop a clustering method\nthat utilizes the mode of variation of data because the space of probability\ndistributions lacks a vector space structure, preventing the application of\nexisting methods for functional data. In this study, we propose a novel\nclustering method for distributional data on the real line, which takes account\nof difference in both the mean and mode of variation structures of clusters, in\nthe spirit of the $k$-centres clustering approach proposed for functional data.\nSpecifically, we consider the space of distributions equipped with the\nWasserstein metric and define a geodesic mode of variation of distributional\ndata using geodesic principal component analysis. Then, we utilize the geodesic\nmode of each cluster to predict the cluster membership of each distribution. We\ntheoretically show the validity of the proposed clustering criterion by\nstudying the probability of correct membership. Through a simulation study and\nreal data application, we demonstrate that the proposed distributional\nclustering method can improve cluster quality compared to conventional\nclustering algorithms.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
