We derive the SN Ia rate as a function of redshift under a\ntheoretical context for the production of first generation stars and emanate\nthe likelihood of their detection by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).}\n{Assuming the initial stellar mass function (IMF) favors low-mass stars as from\nrecent numerical simulations, we found Pop III stars may give rise to a\nconsiderable amount of SNe Ia at high redshift and Pop III stars may even be\nthe dominant SN Ia producer at z $\\gtrsim 6$.} {In an optimistic scenario, we\nexpect $\\sim 1(2)$ SNe Ia from Pop III stars at $z\\approx 4(5)$ for a survey of\narea $300 \\;\\rm arcmin^2$ during a $3\\;\\rm yr$ period with JWST. The same\nsurvey may record more than $\\sim 400$ SNe Ia at lower redshift ($z\\lesssim\n2.5$) but with only about one of them from Pop III progenitors. There will be\n$\\sim 6$ Pop III SNe Ia in the same field of view at redshifts of $5-10$.}\nObservational constraints on SN Ia rates at the redshift range of $5-10$ can\nplace crucial constraints on the IMF of Pop III stars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
