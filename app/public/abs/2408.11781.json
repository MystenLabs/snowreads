As we vary over progressions\ninstead of fixing a particular one, the nature of our result differs from\nothers in the literature. Furthermore, we generalize our result to dynamical\nsystems. The quality of the result depends crucially on the first return time,\nwhich we illustrate in the case of Diophantine approximation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
