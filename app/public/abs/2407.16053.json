Conversely,\noptomechanics serves as a crucial domain for theoretical exploration into\nconcepts such as chirality, duality, and parity concerning optical forces. In\nthis paper, we elucidate a method to amalgamate chirality through broken axial\nparity into optobots, thereby augmenting their versatility. Specifically, we\nillustrate how this integration allows for out-of-plane rotation which helps in\ntheir utilization as optical drills under unidirectional excitation achieved\nthrough repetitive stimulation of three focal regions: two traps and one chiral\nrotational site. We fabricate the microrobots employing two-photon lithography,\nand note a highly satisfactory correspondence between finite element\ncalculations and experimental observations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
