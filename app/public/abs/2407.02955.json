A group $G$ with the conjugation operation forms a\nquandle, $\\operatorname{Conj}(G)$. In the opposite direction, one can construct\na group $\\operatorname{As}(Q)$ starting from any quandle $Q$. These groups are\nuseful in practice, but hard to compute. We explore the group\n$\\operatorname{As}(\\operatorname{Conj}(G))$ for so-called $\\overline{C}$-groups\n$G$. These are groups admitting a presentation with only conjugation and power\nrelations. Symmetric groups $S_n$ are typical examples. We show that for\n$\\overline{C}$-groups, $\\operatorname{As}(\\operatorname{Conj}(G))$ injects into\n$G \\times \\mathbb{Z}^m$, where $m$ is the number of conjugacy classes of $G$.\nFrom this we deduce information about the torsion, center, and derived group of\n$\\operatorname{As}(\\operatorname{Conj}(G))$. As an application, we compute the\nsecond quandle homology group of $\\operatorname{Conj}(S_n)$ for all $n$, and\nunveil rich torsion therein.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
