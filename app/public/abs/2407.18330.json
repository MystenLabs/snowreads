This allows us to define a \"symmetric\"\ninner model construction. In this vein, we use Fraenkel-Mostowski-Specker type\nstabiliser arguments to deduce the Kunen inconsistency, as well as resolving an\nopen problem of Rogers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"yA0j_xcgCUdS_86Opn7mNe6LPi1nJqAXk2cJPQcb7ks","pdfSize":"418928","objectId":"0x9e0c4f50f8691cb6cfbb6cebd9007e68c305c9a5638be24282138405de834d8a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
