Recent advancements\nin AI have enabled the development of advanced monitoring systems capable of\ndetecting anomalies in road surfaces and road signs, which, if unaddressed, can\nlead to serious road accidents. This paper presents an innovative approach to\nenhance road safety through the detection and classification of traffic signs\nand road surface damage using advanced deep learning techniques. This\nintegrated approach supports proactive maintenance strategies, improving road\nsafety and resource allocation for the Molise region and the city of\nCampobasso. The resulting system, developed as part of the Casa delle\nTecnologie Emergenti (House of Emergent Technologies) Molise (Molise CTE)\nresearch project funded by the Italian Minister of Economic Growth (MIMIT),\nleverages cutting-edge technologies such as Cloud Computing and High\nPerformance Computing with GPU utilization. It serves as a valuable tool for\nmunicipalities, enabling quick detection of anomalies and the prompt\norganization of maintenance operations\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rDmCyS1N4z2PwErHE9m3tMktQCfQ_CId0HJMh5F_kzQ","pdfSize":"1045291"}
