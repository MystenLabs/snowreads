It contains a wide\nclass of evolutionary game models, such as replicator dynamics and its\ngeneralization. We present an inverse control approach to obtain a\nreplicator-type pairwise comparison dynamic from the large discount limit of a\nmean field game (MFG) as a coupled forward-backward system. This methodology\nprovides a new interpretation of replicator-type dynamics as a myopic\nperception limit of the dynamic programming. The cost function in the MFG is\nexplicitly obtained to derive the generalized replicator dynamics. We present a\nfinite difference method to compute these models such that the conservation and\nnonnegativity of the probability density and bounds of the value function can\nbe numerically satisfied. We conduct a computational convergence study of a\nlarge discount limit, focusing on potential games and an energy management\nproblem under several conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
