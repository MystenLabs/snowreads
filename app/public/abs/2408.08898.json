The analysis clarified that the main issue\nwith marine fishing capacity in China is the excess total power of fishing\nships. The study suggested reducing the number of ships by 35.2%, the gross\ntonnage by 29.8%, and the total power by 37.3% to align with the catch levels\nof 1999. It also proposed the idea of supplementing peak years. The PTP\nmethodology was found to be suitable for longitudinal analysis over time, while\nthe DEA approach is better for comparing fishing capacity across different\nregions at the same time. Additionally, the study indicated that practical\nfishing capacity tends to be underestimated, so actual reductions in capacity\nare usually larger than calculated values.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
