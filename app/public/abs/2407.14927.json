Here, an existing design tool for single\nhelices is extended to the case of double helices and used to design antennas\nthat combine large chiroptical interaction strength with highly directional\nlight emission. Full-field numerical modeling underpins the design and provides\nadditional insight into surface charge distributions and resonance widths. The\nexperimentally realized double helical antennas were studied regarding their\npolarization-dependent transmission behavior resulting in a large and broadband\ndissymmetry factor in the visible range. Since the polarization of light is an\nimportant tool for implementing logic functionality in photonic and quantum\nphotonic devices, these helices are potential building blocks for future\nnanophotonic circuits, but also for chiral metamaterials or phase plates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
