{"id":"2408.11115","title":"Removing scalar curvature assumption for Ricci flow smoothing","authors":"Adam Martens","authorsParsed":[["Martens","Adam",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 18:17:37 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-22","timestamp":1724177857000,"abstract":"  In recent work of Chan-Huang-Lee, it is shown that if a manifold enjoys\nuniform bounds on (a) the negative part of the scalar curvature, (b) the local\nentropy, and (c) volume ratios up to a fixed scale, then there exists a Ricci\nflow for some definite time with estimates on the solution assuming that the\nlocal curvature concentration is small enough initially (depending only on\nthese a priori bounds). In this work, we show that the bound on scalar\ncurvature assumption (a) is redundant. We also give some applications of this\nquantitative short-time existence, including a Ricci flow smoothing result for\nmeasure space limits, a Gromov-Hausdorff compactness result, and a topoligical\nand geometric rigidity result in the case that the a priori local bounds are\nstrengthened to be global.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
