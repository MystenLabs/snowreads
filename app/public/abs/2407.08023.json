We propose a\nmodel ensemble strategy to improve the camera pose estimation part of the VQ3D\ntask, which has been proven to be essential in previous work. The core idea is\nnot only to do SfM for egocentric videos but also to do 2D-3D matching between\nexisting 3D scans and 2D video frames. In this way, we have a hybrid SfM and\ncamera relocalization pipeline, which can provide us with more camera poses,\nleading to higher QwP and overall success rate. Our method achieves the best\nperformance regarding the most important metric, the overall success rate. We\nsurpass previous state-of-the-art, the competitive EgoLoc, by $1.5\\%$.
