Therefore, context-aware game-based\nlearning has attracted considerable attention. Location-based games have not\nonly positive effects on learning but also pronounced effects on culture and\nhistory. Accordingly, focusing on railway cultural heritages, we attempted to\nassess interdependent relationships between key factors crucial for the design\nof a location-based mobile game for cultural heritages. We adopted the analytic\nnetwork process (ANP) for our assessment. We initially performed a literature\nreview to generalize relevant criteria and elements and developed a\nquestionnaire based on the fuzzy delphi method (FDM); thus, key factors, namely\n3 criteria and 15 elements, were selected. We also applied an online ANP-based\nquestionnaire; on the basis of the experts opinions, we established a network\nmodel and determined the priority order of the key factors. The results\nrevealed that experts considered culture learning to be of the highest\nimportance, with the most important three elements being prior knowledge,\nchallenge levels, and cultural narrative. In addition, culture learning\nexhibited a strong interaction with content design. In each criterion, one\nelement had a considerable influence on the remaining elements, as determined\nby an analysis of matrices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
