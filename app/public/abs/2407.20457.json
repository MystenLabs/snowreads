I\nargue that the renormalization group flow is reversible except at fixed points,\nwhich makes the relation between large and small distance scales quite\nsymmetric in QFT, opening up at least the technical possibility of a\nnon-reductionist approach to QFT. I suggest that some conceptual problems\nencountered within QFT may potentially be mitigated by moving to an alternative\npicture in which it is no longer the case that the large supervenes on the\nsmall. Finally, I explore some specific models in which a form of\nnon-reductionism might be implemented, and consider the prospects for future\ndevelopment of these models.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X0m0PT7KdgvP_D4FETiqotz9vhHi_t_bWdY7X25Dqcc","pdfSize":"676655"}
