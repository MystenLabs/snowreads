In particular we establish how two variants of a generalised\nLempel homomorphism can be used to recursively construct such sequences,\ngeneralising previous work on the binary case. We also derive an upper bound on\nthe period of an orientable sequence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
