In this channel, a sequence of length $n$ over an alphabet of size\n$q$ is being read by a sliding window of length $\\ell$, where from each window\nwe obtain only its composition. Backtracking errors cause some windows to\nrepeat, hence manifesting as tandem-duplication errors of length $k$ in the\n$\\ell$-read vector of window compositions. While existing constructions for\nduplication-correcting codes can be straightforwardly adapted to this model,\neven resulting in optimal codes, their asymptotic rate is hard to find. In the\nregime of unbounded number of duplication errors, we either give the exact\nasymptotic rate of optimal codes, or bounds on it, depending on the values of\n$k$, $\\ell$ and $q$. In the regime of a constant number of duplication errors,\n$t$, we find the redundancy of optimal codes to be $t\\log_q n+O(1)$ when\n$\\ell|k$, and only upper bounded by this quantity otherwise.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
