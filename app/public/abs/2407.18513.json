In this work, we have outlined the case of\ntensorial neutrino non-standard interactions with scalar fields, which can be\nrelated to the effective CPT-even dimension-4 operators of the Standard Model\nExtension (SME). Moreover, in this paper, we have mostly analyzed the projected\nsensitivities to the CPT-even isotropic $c_{\\alpha \\beta}$ and $Z-$spatial\n$c_{\\alpha \\beta}^{ZZ}$ SME coefficients, in the context of a long-baseline\nexperimental configuration. We study the particular case of DUNE and show its\nsensitivity to this type of new physics. The current IceCube experiment and\nupcoming neutrino experiments such as KM3NeT, IceCube-Gen2, and GRAND proposals\nmay clarify these classes of neutrino non-standard interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
