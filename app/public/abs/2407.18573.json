It was initially devoted to the study of the solar corona.\nFollowing solar eclipses (1970, 1973) observed with the Lallemand electronic\ncamera, the main goal was to detect with this sensitive detector the structures\nof the far and hot corona in forbidden lines, using either narrow bandpass\nfilters or spectroscopy. But everything had to be done prior to observations: a\ntrack, a house for astronomers, a dome and a complex instrument. We summarize\nhere this fantastic adventure, which was partly successful in terms of\nscientific results and had to stop in 1982; however, the activity of the\nstation resumed after 1989 under the auspices of the ``AstroQueyras''\nassociation, which replaced the coronagraph by a 62 cm night telescope from\nHaute Provence observatory; the station extended later with two 50 cm\ntelescopes, was rebuilt in 2015 and received the visit of thousands of\namateurs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
