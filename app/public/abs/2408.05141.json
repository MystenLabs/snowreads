In this paper, we introduce a hybrid RAG\nsystem enhanced through a comprehensive suite of optimizations that\nsignificantly improve retrieval quality, augment reasoning capabilities, and\nrefine numerical computation ability. We refined the text chunks and tables in\nweb pages, added attribute predictors to reduce hallucinations, conducted LLM\nKnowledge Extractor and Knowledge Graph Extractor, and finally built a\nreasoning strategy with all the references. We evaluated our system on the CRAG\ndataset through the Meta CRAG KDD Cup 2024 Competition. Both the local and\nonline evaluations demonstrate that our system significantly enhances complex\nreasoning capabilities. In local evaluations, we have significantly improved\naccuracy and reduced error rates compared to the baseline model, achieving a\nnotable increase in scores. In the meanwhile, we have attained outstanding\nresults in online assessments, demonstrating the performance and generalization\ncapabilities of the proposed system. The source code for our system is released\nin \\url{https://gitlab.aicrowd.com/shizueyy/crag-new}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
