Our motivation is that 3D\nconvolutions with 5D tensors are computationally very expensive and they may\nnot be supported by some of the edge devices used in real-time applications\nsuch as robots. The existing approaches mitigate this by splitting the 3D\nkernels into spatial and temporal domains, but they still use 3D convolutions\nwith 5D tensors in their implementations. We resolve this issue by introducing\nsome appropriate 4D/3D tensor reshaping as well as new combination techniques\nfor spatial and temporal splits. The proposed implementation methods show\nsignificant improvement both in terms of efficiency and accuracy. The\nexperimental results confirm that the proposed spatio-temporal processing\nstructure outperforms the original model in terms of speed and accuracy using\nonly 4D tensors with fewer parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
