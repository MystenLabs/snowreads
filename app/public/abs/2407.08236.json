Despite the success of\ndata-driven neural network-based HRRP recognition, challenges such as\ninsufficient training samples persist in its real-world application. This\nletter introduces HRRPGraphNet, a novel Graph Neural Network (GNN) model\ndesigned specifically for HRRP target recognition that leverages new insights\nto address these challenges. A pivotal innovation is the transformation of HRRP\ndata into a graph structure, utilizing a range cell amplitude-based node vector\nand a range-relative adjacency matrix. This graph-based approach facilitates\nboth local feature extraction via one-dimensional convolution layers and global\nfeature extraction through a graph convolution layer, capitalizing on the\nintrinsic relationships between range cells which is a distinct advantage over\nexisting sequence-based methods. Experiments on the aircraft electromagnetic\nsimulation dataset and the measured dataset have confirmed HRRPGraphNet's\nsuperior accuracy and robustness, particularly in fewer training sample\nenvironments, underscoring the potential of graph-driven innovations in\nHRRP-based RATR.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
