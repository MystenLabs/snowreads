This accumulation contributes to an electric current that flows parallel\nto the edges, causing a slight decrease in resistance. The accumulation of\norbital moment and the resulting change in resistance can be modulated by an\nin-plane magnetic field. In this work, we investigate this effect in\nmultilayered 2D materials where electrons can move between layers providing a\nhandle through which the resistance can be controlled. The orbital moment\ndynamics differs from conventional spin dynamics, being governed by an\nanisotropic effective inverse mass tensor, for which we provide a microscopic\nexpression. We derive phenomenological equations that describe both generation\nand control of orbital moment accumulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
