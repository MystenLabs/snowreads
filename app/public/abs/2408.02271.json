Consistent personality is evident in real human expression and is\nimportant for creating trustworthy systems. To address this problem, we propose\nStyEmp, which aims to stylize the empathetic response generation with a\nconsistent personality. Specifically, it incorporates a multi-grained prefix\nmechanism designed to capture the intricate relationship between a system's\npersonality and its empathetic expressions. Furthermore, we introduce a\npersonality reinforcement module that leverages contrastive learning to\ncalibrate the generation model, ensuring that responses are both empathetic and\nreflective of a distinct personality. Automatic and human evaluations on the\nEMPATHETICDIALOGUES benchmark show that StyEmp outperforms competitive\nbaselines in terms of both empathy and personality expressions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
