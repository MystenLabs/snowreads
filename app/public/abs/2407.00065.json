  "abstract": "  Interleaved practice enhances the memory and problem-solving ability of\nstudents in undergraduate courses. We introduce a personalized learning tool\nbuilt on a Large Language Model (LLM) that can provide immediate and\npersonalized attention to students as they complete homework containing\nproblems interleaved from undergraduate physics courses. Our tool leverages the\ndimensional analysis method, enhancing students' qualitative thinking and\nproblem-solving skills for complex phenomena. Our approach combines LLMs for\nsymbolic regression with dimensional analysis via prompt engineering and offers\nstudents a unique perspective to comprehend relationships between physics\nvariables. This fosters a broader and more versatile understanding of physics\nand mathematical principles and complements a conventional undergraduate\nphysics education that relies on interpreting and applying established\nequations within specific contexts. We test our personalized learning tool on\nthe equations from Feynman's lectures on physics. Our tool can correctly\nidentify relationships between physics variables for most equations,\nunderscoring its value as a complementary personalized learning tool for\nundergraduate physics students.\n",
