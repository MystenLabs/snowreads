Achieving interoperability is one of\nthe chief System of Systems (SoS) engineering objectives in the development of\ncommand and control (C2) capabilities for joint and coalition warfare. In this\npaper, we apply an SoS perspective on the integration of M&S with such systems.\nWe employ recently developed interoperability concepts based on linguistic\ncategories along with the Discrete Event System Specification (DEVS) formalism\nto implement a standard for interoperability. We will show how the developed\nstandard is implemented in DEVS/SOA net-centric modeling and simulation\nframework that uses XML-based Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). We will\ndiscuss the simulator interfaces and the design issues in their implementation\nin DEVS/SOA. We will illustrate the application of DEVS/SOA in a multi-agent\ntest instrumentation system that is deployable as a SOA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
