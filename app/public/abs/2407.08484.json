Our work proposes one such\nsolution to the problem of positioning body and finger animation skeleton\njoints within 3D models of human bodies. Due to scarcity of annotated real\nhuman scans, we resort to generating synthetic samples while varying their\nshape and pose parameters. Similarly to the state-of-the-art approach, our\nmethod computes each joint location as a convex combination of input points.\nGiven only a list of point coordinates and normal vector estimates as input, a\ndynamic graph convolutional neural network is used to predict the coefficients\nof the convex combinations. By comparing our method with the state-of-the-art,\nwe show that it is possible to achieve significantly better results with a\nsimpler architecture, especially for finger joints. Since our solution requires\nfewer precomputed features, it also allows for shorter processing times.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
