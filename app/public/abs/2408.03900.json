Speech-MASSIVE covers 12 languages from different families and inherits\nfrom MASSIVE the annotations for the intent prediction and slot-filling tasks.\nOur extension is prompted by the scarcity of massively multilingual SLU\ndatasets and the growing need for versatile speech datasets to assess\nfoundation models (LLMs, speech encoders) across languages and tasks. We\nprovide a multimodal, multitask, multilingual dataset and report SLU baselines\nusing both cascaded and end-to-end architectures in various training scenarios\n(zero-shot, few-shot, and full fine-tune). Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nsuitability of Speech-MASSIVE for benchmarking other tasks such as speech\ntranscription, language identification, and speech translation.
