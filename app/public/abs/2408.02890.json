In the past ten years, a\nseries of high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy works reported weak\nsuperconducting gap modulations in certain superconductors and explained these\nphenomena as pair density waves. In line with Yu's discovery, Lee DH et al.\npointed out that in many cases, the interference effect of pair-breaking\nscattering can also lead to superconducting gap modulations in space. We will\ndiscuss the distinction and unification of these two kinds of mechanisms, as\nwell as their relevance to recent experimental observations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
