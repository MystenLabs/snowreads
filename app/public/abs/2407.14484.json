These have traditionally proceeded\nfrom time-evolution bounds based on Friedrichs symmetric and Kawashima or\nGoodman type energy estimates. Here, we propose an alternative program based on\nfrequency-dependent pseudodifferential time-space damping estimates in the\nspirit of Kreiss. These are seen to be equivalent in the linear case to\nhigh-frequency spectral stability, and, just as for the constant-coefficient\nanalysis of Kreiss, sharp in a pointwise, fixed-frequency, sense. This point of\nview leads to a number of simplifications and extensions using already-existing\nanalysis. We point to the new issue of turning points, analogous to glancing\npoints in the constant-coefficient case as an important direction for further\ndevelopment.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
