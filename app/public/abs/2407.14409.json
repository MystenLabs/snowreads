The\nmain feature of this solution (that is insulating even at $U=0$) is the\ndominant role of $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bands around the Fermi level, which would\nbecome doped with the introduction of electrons via oxygen vacancies. In spite\nof the similarity with cuprates in terms of the dominant role of\n$d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ bands, some differences are apparent in the magnetic ground\nstate of La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$: the antiferromagnetic out-of-plane coupling\nwithin the bilayer (linked to the $d_{z^2}$ orbitals forming a\nspin-singlet-like configuration) is found to be the dominant one while in-plane\ninteractions are reduced due to the stripe order of the ground state. With\npressure, this striped magnetic ground state remains similar in nature but the\nincrease in bandwidth quickly transitions La$_{3}$Ni$_{2}$O$_{7}$ into a\nmetallic state with all the activity close to the Fermi level involving, to a\nlarge extent, $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. This is reminiscent of the cuprates and\nmay provide key insights into how superconductivity arises in this material\nunder pressure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
