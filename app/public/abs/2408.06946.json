It is shown that for the classes of functions under\nconsideration, the extension problem reduces to a simple geometric obstruction\non the support of these valuations. The results rely on a homogeneous\ndecomposition for the space of polynomial valuations of bounded degree and the\nsupport properties of certain distributions associated to the homogeneous\ncomponents. As an application, an explicit integral representation for\nvaluations of top degree is established.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
