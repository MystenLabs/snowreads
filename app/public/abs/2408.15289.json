Prompt and accurate detection is crucial\nfor the efficient management and mitigation of plant diseases. This study\ninvestigates advanced techniques in plant disease detection, emphasizing the\nintegration of image processing, machine learning, deep learning methods, and\nmobile technologies. High-resolution images of plant leaves were captured and\nanalyzed using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect symptoms of\nvarious diseases, such as blight, mildew, and rust. This study explores 14\nclasses of plants and diagnoses 26 unique plant diseases. We focus on common\ndiseases affecting various crops. The model was trained on a diverse dataset\nencompassing multiple crops and disease types, achieving 98.14% accuracy in\ndisease diagnosis. Finally integrated this model into mobile apps for real-time\ndisease diagnosis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
