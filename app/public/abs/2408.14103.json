However, the large interaction length required for a\nsingle-pass quantum free-electron laser impedes the experimental realization.\nThe quantum free-electron laser oscillator, proposed in the present article, is\na possible scheme to resolve this issue. Here we show that this device features\na photon statistics that is closer to a coherent state in comparison to\nexisting classical free-electron lasers. The device can be even operated in\nsuch a way that a sub-Poissonian statistics is obtained. Beside the benefit of\ndemonstrating this pure quantum effect, the narrowing of the photon\ndistribution implies reduced intensity fluctuations of the emitted radiation,\nwhich in turn lead to decreased noise in imaging experiments or to an enhanced\nsensitivity in interferometric applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pWNBs2QlGOzCMW1KhtRAlr9VH0D3o6rJMI9FLLGvjME","pdfSize":"2262106"}
