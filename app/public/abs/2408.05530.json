This leads to a large and\nsystematic finite-size scaling and an unphysical surface term in the isothermal\ncompressibility. We correct these errors by introducing a modified pair\ndistribution function which takes account of the finite size of the particles.\nFor the hard sphere fluid in one-dimension, we show that the compressibility is\nstrictly size-independent and we reproduce this result from the number\nfluctuations calculated with the new theory. In general, the present method\neliminates the leading finite-size effect, which makes it possible to compute\ndensity fluctuations accurately in very small sampling volumes, comparable to\nthe single particle size. These findings open the way for obtaining local\nresponse functions from fluctuation theory at the nanometer scale.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
