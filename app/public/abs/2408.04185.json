The main objective of this paper is to\nprove that $(\\mathrm{exc}_r, \\mathrm{den}_r)$ and $( \\mathrm{rdes}$,\n$\\mathrm{rmaj})$ are equidistributed over $\\mathfrak{S}_{n}$, thereby\nconfirming a recent conjecture posed by Liu. When $r=1$, the result recovers\nthe equidistribution of $(\\mathrm{des}, \\mathrm{maj})$ and $(\\mathrm{exc},\n\\mathrm{den})$, which was first conjectured by Denert and proved by Foata and\nZeilberger.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
