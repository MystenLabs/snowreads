Combined with\nmachine learning, they can analyze images quickly enough for practical\napplications. Solving the problem of high-dimensional single-pixel\nvisualization can potentially be accelerated using quantum machine learning,\nthereby expanding the range of practical problems. In this work we simulated a\nsingle-pixel imaging experiment using Hadamard basis patterns, where images\nfrom the MNIST handwritten digit dataset were used as objects. There were\nselected 64 measurements with maximum variance (6% of the number of pixels in\nthe image). We created algorithms for classifying and reconstruction images\nbased on these measurements using classical fully connected neural networks and\nparameterized quantum circuits. Classical and quantum classifiers showed\naccuracies of 96% and 95% respectively after 6 training epochs, which is quite\ncompetitive result. Image reconstruction was also demonstrated using classical\nand quantum neural networks after 10 training epochs, the structural similarity\nindex measure values were 0.76 and 0.25, respectively, which indicates that the\nproblem in such a formulation turned out to be too difficult for quantum neural\nnetworks in such a configuration for now.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
