Accurate channel estimation is of paramount\nimportance to guarantee reliable communication for the ODDM, especially when\nthe delays and Dopplers of the propagation paths are off-grid. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel grid refinement and adjustment-based sparse Bayesian\ninference (GRASBI) scheme for DD domain channel estimation. The GRASBI involves\nfirst formulating the channel estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery\nthrough the introduction of a virtual DD grid. Then, an iterative process is\nproposed that involves (i) sparse Bayesian learning to estimate the channel\nparameters and (ii) a novel grid refinement and adjustment process to adjust\nthe virtual grid points. The grid adjustment in GRASBI relies on the maximum\nlikelihood principle to attain the adjustment and utilizes refined grids that\nhave much higher resolution than the virtual grid. Moreover, a low-complexity\ngrid refinement and adjustment-based channel estimation scheme is proposed,\nthat can provides a good tradeoff between the estimation accuracy and the\ncomplexity. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the accuracy\nand efficiency of the proposed channel estimation schemes.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
