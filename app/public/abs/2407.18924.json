Presently the model of neural networks involves distributed neural\ncircuits of nodes, hubs, and connections that are dynamic in different states\nof brain function. Advances in neurophysiology, neuroimaging and the field of\nconnectomics have given impetus to the application of mathematical concepts of\ngraph theory. Current approaches do carry limitations and inconsistency in\nresults achieved. We model the neural network of the brain as a directed graph\nand attach a matrix (called the Markov matrix) of transition probabilities\n(determined by the synaptic strengths) to every pair of distinct nodes giving\nrise to a (continuous) Markov process. We postulate that the network hubs are\nthe nodes with the highest probabilities given by the stationary distribution\nof Markov theory. We also derive a new upper bound for the diameter of a graph\nin terms of the eigenvalues of the Markov matrix.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
