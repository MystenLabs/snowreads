This leads to finding\nformulas for related sequences of certain binary strings and ternary matrices.\nThis proves some long standing conjectures for the recurrence relation for the\nnumber of terms in the boundary of the dragon curve, first stated in\nunpublished work Daykin and Tucker in 1975.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
