The learned KG embeddings are typically used to\nanswer queries by ranking all potential answers, but rankings often lack a\nmeaningful probabilistic interpretation - lower-ranked answers do not\nnecessarily have a lower probability of being true. This limitation makes it\ndifficult to distinguish plausible from implausible answers, posing challenges\nfor the application of KGE methods in high-stakes domains like medicine. We\naddress this issue by applying the theory of conformal prediction that allows\ngenerating answer sets, which contain the correct answer with probabilistic\nguarantees. We explain how conformal prediction can be used to generate such\nanswer sets for link prediction tasks. Our empirical evaluation on four\nbenchmark datasets using six representative KGE methods validates that the\ngenerated answer sets satisfy the probabilistic guarantees given by the theory\nof conformal prediction. We also demonstrate that the generated answer sets\noften have a sensible size and that the size adapts well with respect to the\ndifficulty of the query.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
