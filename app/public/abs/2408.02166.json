Specifically, we consider problems in which one\nmust choose a subset of polymers to test in experiments such that the learning\nof the polymeric design rules is optimal. This subset must be selected from a\nlarger set of polymers permissible under arbitrary experimental design\nconstraints. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithms by solving\nseveral pragmatic nucleic acid therapeutics engineering scenarios, where\nlimitations in synthesis of chemically diverse nucleic acids or feasibility of\nmeasurements in experimental setups appear as constraints. Our approach focuses\non identifying optimal experimental designs from a given set of experiments,\nwhich is in contrast to traditional, generative DoE methods like BIBD. Finally,\nwe discuss how these algorithms are broadly applicable to well-established\noptimal DoE criteria like D-optimality.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
