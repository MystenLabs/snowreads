Although many techniques exist for finding\nshort syntheses, it is difficult to assess how close to optimal these syntheses\nare without an exponential brute-force search. We use a novel method of\ncategorizing CNOT gates in a synthesis to obtain a strict lower bound\ncomputable in $O(n^{\\omega})$ time on the minimum number of gates needed to\nsynthesize a given CNOT circuit, where $\\omega$ denotes the matrix\nmultiplication constant and $n$ is the number of qubits involved. Applying our\nframework, we prove that $3(n-1)$ gate syntheses of the $n$-cycle circuit are\noptimal and provide insight into their structure. We also generalize this\nresult to permutation circuits. For linear reversible circuits with $ n = 3, 4,\n5$ qubits, our lower bound is optimal for 100%, 67.7%, and 23.1% of circuits\nand is accurate to within one CNOT gate in 100%, 99.5%, and 83.0% of circuits\nrespectively. We also introduce an algorithm that efficiently determines\nwhether certain circuits can be synthesized with fewer than $n$ CNOT gates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
