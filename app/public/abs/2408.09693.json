More precisely, we\nassume the drift of the state process to be governed by an unobservable\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck process. The decision maker can additionally acquire\ninformation on the hidden state by conducting costly tests, thereby augmenting\nthe available information.\n  Combining the Kalman--Bucy filter with a dynamic programming approach, we\nshow that the problem can be reduced to a deterministic control problem for the\nconditional variance of the unobservable state. Optimal controls and value\nfunctions are derived in a semi-explicit form, and we present an extensive\nstudy of the qualitative properties of the model.\n  We demonstrate that both the optimal cost and the marginal cost increase with\nmodel uncertainty. We identify a critical threshold: below this level, it is\noptimal not to acquire additional information, whereas above this threshold,\ncontinuous information acquisition is optimal, with the rate increasing as\nuncertainty grows. For quadratic information costs, we derive the precise\nasymptotic behavior of the acquisition rate as uncertainty approaches zero and\ninfinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S7Xc-2r7AqR4zKMOFmuEmZt__lf7P1rDvty2sQ2AjHw","pdfSize":"1018766"}
