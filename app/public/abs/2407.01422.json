There are two traditional ways to simulate gauge\ntheories. One is to directly simulate the full Hamiltonian of gauge theories\nwith local gauge symmetries. And the other is to engineer the projected\nHamiltonian in one gauge subsector. In this work, we provide the third way\ntowards the simulation of gauge theories based on \\emph{gauge fixing}. To\ndemonstrate this concept, we fix the gauge of an Ising lattice gauge field\ncoupled with spinless fermions on a ladder geometry. After the gauge fixing,\nthis gauge theory is reduced to a simpler model, in which fermions hop on a\nladder with a fluctuating dynamical $\\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ flux. Then we shows that\nthis model can be realized via Floquet engineering in ultracold atomic gases.\nBy analytical and numerical studies of this dynamical flux model, we deduce\nthat there is confinement to deconfinement phase transition in the original\nunfixed gauge theory. This work paves the way to quantum simulate lattice gauge\ntheory using the concept of gauge fixing, relevant both for condensed matter\nand high energy physics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
