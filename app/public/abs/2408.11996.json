Our analysis focuses on quantifying the distortion\nparameter, which measures the deviation of the $f(Q)$ gravity model from the\nconcordance $\\Lambda$CDM cosmology at the background level. Specifically, we\ninvestigate two cases of the growth index parameter: a constant $\\gamma$ and a\ntime-varying $\\gamma(z)$. We investigate various parametrizations of the growth\nindex $\\gamma$, expressed as $\\gamma = \\gamma_{0} +\\gamma_{1} y(z)$, where the\nfunction $y(z)$ assumes different forms, including constant ($\\Gamma_{0}$),\nTaylor expansion around $z = 0$ ($\\Gamma_{1}$), Taylor expansion around the\nscale factor ($\\Gamma_{2}$), and an exponential form ($\\Gamma_{3}$). By\nemploying the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion,\nwe find that the combined Pantheon$^{+}$+ CC+ RSD datasets impose stringent\nconstraints on the value of the growth index. For the $\\Gamma_{0}$ model, our\nresults indicate that within the concordance $\\Lambda$CDM model, $\\gamma$ is\nconstrained to $0.545 \\pm 0.096$, showing strong agreement with the theoretical\nexpectation of $\\gamma_{\\Lambda} = \\frac{6}{11}$. However, within the framework\nof $f(Q)$ gravity, we observe $\\gamma = 0.571^{+0.095}_{-0.110}$, slightly\nexceeding the $\\Lambda$CDM value by 4.66 $\\%$. Furthermore, when considering a\ntime-varying growth index, our analysis reveals that the range of $\\gamma_{0}$\nspans from $0.596$ to $0.62$ across the $\\Gamma_{1-3}$ models.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v5Cq-x2D7K3WUKFM87_k-OPZYczljStSs7aFwc012tU","pdfSize":"2016841"}
