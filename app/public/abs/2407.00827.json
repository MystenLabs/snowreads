One example\nis the classic variant of iterative refinement where the matrix and the\nfactorization are stored in a working precision and the residual is evaluated\nin a higher precision. In that case we make the observation that this algorithm\nwill solve a promoted form of the original problem and thereby characterize the\nlimiting behavior in a novel way and obtain a different version of the classic\nconvergence analysis. We also discuss two approaches for interprecision\ntransfer in the triangular solves.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
