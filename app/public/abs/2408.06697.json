Despite the significant progress\nin object-centric learning methods, learning object-centric representations in\nthe 3D physical world remains a crucial challenge. In this work, we propose\nSlotLifter, a novel object-centric radiance model addressing scene\nreconstruction and decomposition jointly via slot-guided feature lifting. Such\na design unites object-centric learning representations and image-based\nrendering methods, offering state-of-the-art performance in scene decomposition\nand novel-view synthesis on four challenging synthetic and four complex\nreal-world datasets, outperforming existing 3D object-centric learning methods\nby a large margin. Through extensive ablative studies, we showcase the efficacy\nof designs in SlotLifter, revealing key insights for potential future\ndirections.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
