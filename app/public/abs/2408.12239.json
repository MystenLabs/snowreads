Existing\nmethods often face performance degradation and/or high computational\ncomplexity. To address these issues and exploit intricate channel sparsity\nstructure, this letter first leverages a novel hybrid burst-sparsity prior to\ncapture the burst/common sparse structure in the angle/delay domain, and then\nutilizes an independent variational Bayesian inference (VBI) factorization\ntechnique to efficiently solve the high-dimensional SR problem. Additionally,\nan angle/Doppler refinement approach is incorporated into the proposed method\nto automatically mitigate off-grid mismatches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
