Specifically, we demonstrate how this\ncorrespondence can be articulated as a derived equivalence between the category\nof vanishing cycles associated with a Kleinian surface singularity and the\ncategory of perfect complexes on the corresponding quotient orbifold. We\nfurther illustrate how this equivalence allows for the interpretation of the\nspectrum of a Kleinian surface singularity solely in terms of the\nrepresentation-theoretic data of the associated binary polyhedral group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
