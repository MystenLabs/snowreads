Although it has been known that the classical noise can be mapped\nto the quantum environments only for pure dephasing and infinite-temperature\ndissipation processes, we describe that this limitation can be circumvented by\nintroducing auxiliary systems and conservation. Taking a two-level system as an\nexample, we construct the so-called central spin model with its couplings\nfluctuating as the classical noise, and then acquire its statistical-average\ndynamics which captures the dissipations beyond the infinite temperature. By\nadjusting the number of the auxiliary systems and their initial states, the\nnoise-based model reproduces both Markovian and non-Markovian evolutions. It is\nalso found that different quantities of the two-level system are governed by\ndifferent model parameters, indicating that the constructed model is an\nefficient simulator for specific observables, rather than an equivalent form of\na realistic open system. In addition, the model is also applicable to\ninvestigate topical mechanisms of the open systems, e.g. negative temperatures\nand asymmetric equidistant quenches.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
