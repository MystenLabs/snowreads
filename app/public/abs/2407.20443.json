We introduce multihop\nquantum networks to improve network reach and resilience by enabling quantum\ncommunications across intermediate nodes, thus broadening network connectivity\nand increasing scalability. We present multihop two-qubit\npolarization-entanglement distribution within a quantum network at the Oak\nRidge National Laboratory campus. Our system uses wavelength-selective switches\nfor adaptive bandwidth management on a software-defined quantum network that\nintegrates a quantum data plane with classical data and control planes,\ncreating a flexible, reconfigurable mesh. Our network distributes entanglement\nacross six nodes within three subnetworks, each located in a separate building,\noptimizing quantum state fidelity and transmission rate through adaptive\nresource management. Additionally, we demonstrate the network's resilience by\nimplementing a link recovery approach that monitors and reroutes quantum\nresources to maintain service continuity despite link failures -- paving the\nway for scalable and reliable quantum networking infrastructures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
