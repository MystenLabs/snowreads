Our algorithm improves upon\nthat of [Duan, He, and Zhang; SODA19], which was the first near-linear time\nalgorithm for this problem. While our results are weaker than the current\nstate-of-the-art, our approach is significantly simpler, both in terms of\nanalysis as well as implementation, and may be of practical interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
