We use matrix concentration inequalities to show convergence of the\nadjacency matrix of networks realized from such SUGMs to the expected adjacency\nmatrix as a function of the network size. We apply this result to study\nconcentration of centrality measures (such as degree, eigenvector, and Katz\ncentrality) in sampled networks to the corresponding centralities in the\nexpected network, thus proving that node importance can be predicted from\nknowledge of the random graph model without the need of exact network data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
