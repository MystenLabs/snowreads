To this end, trajectories of such systems must be\ncollected to be used as training data. The measurements of these trajectories\nare typically noisy, which implies that both the regression inputs and outputs\nare corrupted by noise. However, most of the literature considers only noise in\nthe regression outputs. In this paper, we show how to account for the noise in\nthe regression inputs in an extended Gaussian process framework to approximate\nscalar and multidimensional systems. We demonstrate the potential of our\nframework by comparing it to different state-of-the-art methods in several\nsimulation examples.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oFytiyLyqdxoIk0iTjuUxPUmOkLYt-9mYXfZ8nGldlU","pdfSize":"377502"}
