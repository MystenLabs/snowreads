This condition is subsequently\nused as a constraint in the estimation process of the elemental abundances,\ndemonstrating starkly improved precision and accuracy and reduced sensitivity\nto the number of model parameters. Furthermore, the fine structure is reliably\nextracted from the spectra in an automated way, thus providing critical\ninformation on the sample's electronic properties that is hard or impossible to\nobtain otherwise. Since this approach allows dispensing with the need for\nuser-provided input, a potential source of bias is prevented.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
