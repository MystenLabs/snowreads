In this paper, we present FSboard, an American Sign\nLanguage fingerspelling dataset situated in a mobile text entry use case,\ncollected from 147 paid and consenting Deaf signers using Pixel 4A selfie\ncameras in a variety of environments. Fingerspelling recognition is an\nincomplete solution that is only one small part of sign language translation,\nbut it could provide some immediate benefit to Deaf/Hard of Hearing signers as\nmore broadly capable technology develops. At >3 million characters in length\nand >250 hours in duration, FSboard is the largest fingerspelling recognition\ndataset to date by a factor of >10x. As a simple baseline, we finetune 30 Hz\nMediaPipe Holistic landmark inputs into ByT5-Small and achieve 11.1% Character\nError Rate (CER) on a test set with unique phrases and signers. This quality\ndegrades gracefully when decreasing frame rate and excluding face/body\nlandmarks: plausible optimizations to help models run on device in real time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k4L2Mzg2KX146YVODwlvScoEt56w80_xsVuPXjbWEhs","pdfSize":"8978469"}
