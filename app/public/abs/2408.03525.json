In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical\nlearning control framework by mimicking the hierarchical structure of the\ncentral nervous system along with their coordination and interaction behaviors.\nThe framework combines the active and passive control systems to improve both\nthe flexibility and reliability of the control system as well as to achieve\nmore diverse autonomous behaviors of robots. Specifically, the framework has a\nbackbone of independent neural network controllers at different levels and\ntakes a three-level dual descending pathway structure, inspired from the\nfunctionality of the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and spinal cord. We\ncomprehensively validated the proposed approach through the simulation as well\nas the experiment of a hexapod robot in various complex environments, including\nobstacle crossing and rapid recovery after partial damage. This study reveals\nthe principle that governs the autonomous behavior in the central nervous\nsystem and demonstrates the effectiveness of the hierarchical control approach\nwith the salient features of the hierarchical learning control architecture and\ncombination of active and passive control systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
