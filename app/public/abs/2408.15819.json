Oftentimes spectroscopic methods are employed to decipher\nthe composition of these mixtures. However, the sheer density of spectral\nfeatures present in spectroscopic databases can make unambiguous assignment to\nindividual species challenging. Yet, components of a mixture are commonly\nchemically related due to environmental processes or shared precursor\nmolecules. Therefore, analysis of the chemical relevance of a molecule is\nimportant when determining which species are present in a mixture. In this\npaper, we combine machine-learning molecular embedding methods with a\ngraph-based ranking system to determine the likelihood of a molecule being\npresent in a mixture based on the other known species and/or chemical priors.\nBy incorporating this metric in a rotational spectroscopy mixture analysis\nalgorithm, we demonstrate that the mixture components can be identified with\nextremely high accuracy (>97%) in an efficient manner.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
