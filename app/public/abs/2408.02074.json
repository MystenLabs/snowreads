We address the problem of overfitting, common\nin deep learning models applied to complex imaging datasets, by augmenting data\nthrough rotation and scaling. A hybrid loss function combining L1 and L2\nreconstruction losses, enriched with adversarial training, is introduced to\nrefine segmentation processes in intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) imaging. Our\napproach is unique in its capacity to accurately delineate distinct regions\nwithin medical images, such as tissue boundaries and vascular structures,\nwithout extensive reliance on domain-specific knowledge. The algorithm was\nevaluated using a standard medical image library, showing superior performance\nmetrics compared to existing methods, thereby demonstrating its potential in\nenhancing automated medical diagnostics through deep learning\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
