We first address the challenge of calculating moments for\nthe models by introducing a recursive equation for deriving closed-form\nexpressions for moments of any order. Consequently, we propose our moment\nestimators. We then establish a central limit theorem for our estimators and\nderive the explicit formulas for the asymptotic covariance matrix. Finally, we\nprovide numerical results to validate our method.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kJgtFEp6CVNsyfw7qHJ1twACG5WFYO4KTwo8JH2rzG4","pdfSize":"263207"}
