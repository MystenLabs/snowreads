A key result is to verify a standard mixing condition,\nwhich ensures that large values of the observable dominate the time-series, in\nthe range $1<\\alpha \\le 2$. Stable limit laws for observables on dynamical\nsystems have been established in two settings: ``good observables'' (typically\nH\\\"older) on slowly mixing non-uniformly hyperbolic systems and ``bad''\nobservables (unbounded with fat tails) on fast mixing dynamical systems. As an\napplication we investigate the interplay between these two effects in a class\nof intermittent-type maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
