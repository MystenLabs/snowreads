Recent work has been exploring political\nbiases and political reasoning capabilities in LLMs, mainly scoped in the US\ncontext. In light of the recent 2024 European Parliament elections, we are\ninvestigating if LLMs can be used as Voting Advice Applications (VAAs). We\naudit MISTRAL and MIXTRAL models and evaluate their accuracy in predicting the\nstance of political parties based on the latest \"EU and I\" voting assistance\nquestionnaire. Furthermore, we explore alternatives to improve models'\nperformance by augmenting the input context via Retrieval-Augmented Generation\n(RAG) relying on web search, and Self-Reflection using staged conversations\nthat aim to re-collect relevant content from the model's internal memory. We\nfind that MIXTRAL is highly accurate with an 82% accuracy on average.\nAugmenting the input context with expert-curated information can lead to a\nsignificant boost of approx. 9%, which remains an open challenge for automated\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
