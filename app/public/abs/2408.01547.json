Here, we show that it\nprovides a fruitful framework that opens the door to solving some open problems\nconcerning compactness principles of small cardinals. To exemplify, from\nsuitable assumptions, we construct intersection models satisfying ZFC and any\nof the following:\n  1. There is a weakly compact cardinal $\\kappa$ carrying an indecomposable\nultrafilter, yet $\\kappa$ is not measurable. This answers a question of Ketonen\nfrom the late 1970's.\n  2. For proper class many cardinals $\\lambda$, the least $\\lambda$-strongly\ncompact cardinal is singular. This answers a question of Bagaria and Magidor\nwho asked for merely two such cardinals.\n  3. There is a strongly inaccessible cardinal whose $C$-sequence number is a\nsingular cardinal. This answers a question of Lambie-Hanson and the first\nauthor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
