We derive an equivalent system of delay differential equations, which\nincludes just two discrete delays. The stability of the equivalent system and\nits stationary solutions are investigated. Alternatively, a Gaussian quadrature\ngenerates a discretisation of the integral, which describes the distributed\ndelay in the original delay differential equation. This technique yields an\napproximate differential equation with multiple discrete delays. We present\nresults of numerical computations, where initial value problems of the\ndifferential equations are solved. Therein, the two approaches are compared.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
