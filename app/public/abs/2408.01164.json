Nevertheless, their envisioned bio-applications suffer from\nintrinsic background noise due to unavoidable light scattering and\nautofluorescence in cells and tissues. Herein, we develop a novel all-optical\nmodulated imaging method via physically-enabled classifier, for on-demand and\ndirect access to NV fluorescence at pixel resolution while effectively\nfiltering out background noise. Specifically, NV fluorescence can be modulated\noptically to exhibit sinusoid-like variations, providing basis for\nclassification. We validate our method in various complex biological scenarios\nwith fluorescence interference, ranging from cells to organisms. Notably, our\nclassification-based approach achieves almost 10^6 times enhancement of\nsignal-to-background ratio (SBR) for fluorescent nanodiamonds (FNDs) in neural\nprotein imaging. We also demonstrate 4-fold contrast improvement in\noptically-detected magnetic resonance measurements (ODMR) of FNDs inside\nstained cells. Our technique offers a generic, explainable and robust solution,\napplicable for realistic high-fidelity imaging and sensing in challenging\nnoise-laden scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
