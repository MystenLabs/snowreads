This experience consists of two main modes: the\nworld in miniature for large-scale and first-person for real-world scale\nvisualizations. Additionally, we presented our approach to potential target\ngroups in interviews. The results of these interviews can help developers for\nfuture implementation considering the requirements of each group.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TcXTR_1lT0Y_VTUg6-v4sfXnZkYnVvvdjDWOGox7RMQ","pdfSize":"684466"}
