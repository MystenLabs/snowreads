The advantages and limitations of each model are then compared via\nin-depth investigations on several use cases, culminating in an efficiency and\nscope assessment. It was found that the RSI-based model performs well if a\nlarge number of field points is needed, such as when modelling a full image of\nthe field. Conversely, for a large number of interfaces, such as when modelling\nthe field through a thin-layered material, the most efficient model was the ray\ntracing formulation, since it was unnecessary to propagate the field between\nall the interfaces first. This was especially noticeable for applications\nrequiring only the evaluation of the field at a few points on the other side of\nmultiple interfaces.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
