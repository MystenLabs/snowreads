Leveraging a localized resolution of\nidentity (LRI) technique, LibRPA achieves $O(N^2)$ or better scaling behavior,\nmaking it suitable for large-scale calculation of periodic systems. Implemented\nin C++ and Python with MPI/OpenMP parallelism, LibRPA integrates seamlessly\nwith NAO-based density functional theory (DFT) packages through flexible\nfile-based and API-based interfaces. In this work, we present the theoretical\nframework, algorithm, software architecture, and installation and usage guide\nof LibRPA. Performance benchmarks, including the parallel efficiency with\nrespect to the computational resources and the adsorption energy calculations\nfor H$_2$O molecules on graphene, demonstrate its nearly ideal scalability and\nnumerical reliability. LibRPA offers a useful tool for RPA-based calculations\nfor large-scale extended systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YteENObPS3eltl_GF6qMxN7AOKDh9wdkz1QUqwIxZfs","pdfSize":"1389751"}
