While the well-known Gaussian kernel is broadly used, its lack\nof anisotropy and deformation ability leads to dim and vague edges at object\nsilhouettes, limiting the reconstruction quality of current Gaussian splatting\nmethods. To enhance the representation power, we draw inspiration from quantum\nphysics and propose to use the Gaussian-Hermite kernel as the new primitive in\nGaussian splatting. The new kernel takes a unified mathematical form and\nextends the Gaussian function, which serves as the zero-rank term in the\nupdated formulation. Our experiments demonstrate the extraordinary performance\nof Gaussian-Hermite kernel in both geometry reconstruction and novel-view\nsynthesis tasks. The proposed kernel outperforms traditional Gaussian Splatting\nkernels, showcasing its potential for high-quality 3D reconstruction and\nrendering.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
