Furthermore, we demonstrate that any stable set in an NIP theory\nhas the bounded stabilizing property. This result is subsequently used to\ncorrect Proposition 6.7 from the book on stable domination and independence in\nACVF.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
