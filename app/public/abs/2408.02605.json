The\ncontrol in swarm robotics is mainly distributed whereas centralised control is\nwidely used in other fields of robotics. Centralised and decentralised control\nstrategies both pose a unique set of benefits and drawbacks for the control of\nmulti-robot systems. While decentralised systems are more scalable and\nresilient, they are less efficient compared to the centralised systems and they\nlead to excessive data transmissions to the human operators causing cognitive\noverload. We examine the trade-offs of each of these approaches in a\nhuman-swarm system to perform an environmental monitoring task and propose a\nflexible hybrid approach, which combines elements of hierarchical and\ndecentralised systems. We find that a flexible hybrid system can outperform a\ncentralised system (in our environmental monitoring task by 19.2%) while\nreducing the number of messages sent to a human operator (here by 23.1%). We\nconclude that establishing centralisation for a system is not always optimal\nfor performance and that utilising aspects of centralised and decentralised\nsystems can keep the swarm from hindering its performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FdYuzk_eOTkSaW3vu2MqGNlxDPmx5LNOiHAJayAmSng","pdfSize":"421944"}
