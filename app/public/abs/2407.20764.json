However, such finite driven systems may exhibit\nsufficiently long prethermal regimes; their properties in these regimes are\nqualitatively different from that in their infinite temperature steady states.\nThese, often experimentally relevant, prethermal regimes host a wide range of\nphenomena; they may exhibit dynamical localization and freezing, host Floquet\nscars, display signatures of Hilbert space fragmentation, and exhibit time\ncrystalline phases. Such phenomena are often accompanied by emergent\napproximate dynamical symmetries which have no analogue in equilibrium systems.\nIn this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to the origin and nature\nof these symmetries and discuss their role in shaping the prethermal phases of\na class of periodically driven closed quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JapThHpeOD75FM0XxlRCtk3Q3I7iSFZrBkzmB01Ppc4","pdfSize":"2750689"}
