We use this platform to image the thermally activated\nnanomechanical dynamics of a model system consisting of a $40\\,\\mathrm{nm}$\ndiameter single-defect nanowire, while scanning a localized heat source across\nits surface. We develop a thermal backaction model, which we use to demonstrate\na close connection between the structure of the nanowire, its thermal response,\nits dissipation and its fluctuations. We notably show that the defect behaves\nas a single fluctuation hub, whose e-beam excitation yields a far\noff-equilibrium vibrational state, largely dominated by the quantum\nfluctuations of the heating source. Our platform is of interest for future\nquantitative investigation of fundamental nanoscale dynamical phenomena, and\nappears as a new playground for investigating quantum thermodynamics in the\nstrongly dissipative regime and at room temperature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
