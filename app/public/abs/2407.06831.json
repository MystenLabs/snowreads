For the\npiecewise linear case, the error in the $L^2$-norm of the standard Galerkin\nconforming FEM is bounded by $C_\\lambda h^2$. However, $C_\\lambda \\to \\infty$\nas $\\lambda \\to \\infty$, resulting in poor accuracy for practical values of $h$\nif $\\lambda$ is sufficiently large. In this short paper, we show that for 2D\nproblems the locking phenomenon can be controlled by replacing $\\lambda$ with\n$\\lambda^\\alpha$ in the stiffness matrix, for a certain choice of\n$\\alpha=\\alpha_*(h,\\lambda)$ in the range $0<\\alpha\\le 1$. We prove that for\nthis optimal choice of $\\alpha$, the error in the $L^2$-norm is bounded by $Ch$\nwhere $C$ does not depend on $\\lambda$. Numerical experiments confirm the\nexpected convergence behaviour and show that, for practical meshes, our\nlocking-free method is more accurate than the standard method if the material\nis nearly incompressible. Our analysis also shows that the error in the\n$H^1$-norm is bounded by $Ch^{1/2}$, but our numerical experiments suggest that\nthis bound is not sharp.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
