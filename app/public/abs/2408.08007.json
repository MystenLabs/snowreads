The\nconstruction of $\\alpha^n(t)$ from $C(t)$ requires the first $2n$ temporal\nderivatives of $C(t)$ at times $0$ and $t$. Our focus is on $\\alpha^n(t)$ that\n(almost) monotonously decrease, we call these ``arrows of time functions\"\n(AOTFs). For autocorrelation functions of few body observables we numerically\nobserve the following: An AOTF featuring a low $n$ may always be found unless\nthe the system is in or close to a nonchaotic regime with respect to a\nvariation of some system parameter. All $\\alpha^n(t)$ put upper bounds to the\nrespective autocorrelation functions, i.e. $\\alpha^n(t) \\geq C^2(t)$. Thus the\nimplication of the existence of an AOTF is comparable to that of the H-Theorem,\nas it indicates a directed approach to equilibrium. We furthermore argue that\nour numerical finding may to some extent be traced back to the operator growth\nhypothesis. This argument is laid out in the framework of the so-called\nrecursion method.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
