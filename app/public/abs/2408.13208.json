Building upon existing fairness formulations, we focus on how to\nreason over fairness from a temporal perspective, taking into account the\nfairness of a history of past decisions. After introducing the concept of\ntemporal fairness, we propose three approaches that incorporate temporal\nfairness in decision making problems formulated as optimization problems. We\npresent a qualitative evaluation of our approach in four different domains and\ncompare the solutions against a baseline approach that does not consider the\ntemporal aspect of fairness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
