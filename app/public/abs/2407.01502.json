Our analysis of current agent benchmarks and evaluation\npractices reveals several shortcomings that hinder their usefulness in\nreal-world applications. First, there is a narrow focus on accuracy without\nattention to other metrics. As a result, SOTA agents are needlessly complex and\ncostly, and the community has reached mistaken conclusions about the sources of\naccuracy gains. Our focus on cost in addition to accuracy motivates the new\ngoal of jointly optimizing the two metrics. We design and implement one such\noptimization, showing its potential to greatly reduce cost while maintaining\naccuracy. Second, the benchmarking needs of model and downstream developers\nhave been conflated, making it hard to identify which agent would be best\nsuited for a particular application. Third, many agent benchmarks have\ninadequate holdout sets, and sometimes none at all. This has led to agents that\nare fragile because they take shortcuts and overfit to the benchmark in various\nways. We prescribe a principled framework for avoiding overfitting. Finally,\nthere is a lack of standardization in evaluation practices, leading to a\npervasive lack of reproducibility. We hope that the steps we introduce for\naddressing these shortcomings will spur the development of agents that are\nuseful in the real world and not just accurate on benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
