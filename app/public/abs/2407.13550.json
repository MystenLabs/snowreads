Its details can now be analysed with modern effective field theory\n(EFT) techniques that use the closed-time-path (or Schwinger-Keldysh)\nformalism. We discuss the structure of the diffusive effective action\nappropriate for the analysis of stochastic or thermal loop effects, responsible\nfor the so-called long-time tails, to all orders. We also elucidate and prove a\nnumber of properties of the EFT and use the theory to establish the analytic\nstructure of the $n$-loop contributions to diffusive retarded two-point\nfunctions. Our analysis confirms a previously proposed result by Delacr\\'{e}taz\nthat used microscopic conformal field theory arguments. Then, we analyse a\nnumber of implications of these loop corrections to the dispersion relations of\nthe diffusive mode and new, gapped modes that appear when the EFT is treated as\nexact. Finally, we discuss certain features of an all-loop model of diffusion\nthat only retains a special subset of $n$-loop `banana' diagrams.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
