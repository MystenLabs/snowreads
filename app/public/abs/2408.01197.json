We find an S-wave virtual state with mass\n$2472(18)$ MeV, and a resonance with mass $M=2747(31)$ and width $\\Gamma=7(3)$\nMeV. In the $D^* \\bar K$ invariant mass distribution, the virtual state appears\nas a cusp at the $D^*\\bar K$ threshold, while the resonance potentially\nmanifests as a dip. In particular, we take into account the $D\\bar K \\pi$\nthree-body dynamics due to the on-shell pion exchange and the finite decay\nwidths for $D^*$ and $\\bar K^*$. Additionally, the cutoff dependence and the\nSU(4) breaking effect are investigated in our work. Our results also indicate\nthat the accurate measurement for the decay width of the $D\\bar K^*$ resonance\ncan help us to evaluate the SU(4) breaking effect in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
