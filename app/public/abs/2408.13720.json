A common way to represent a set of vectors is to model them as linear\nsubspaces. In this contribution, we present a prototype-based approach for\nlearning on the manifold formed from such linear subspaces, the Grassmann\nmanifold. Our proposed method learns a set of subspace prototypes capturing the\nrepresentative characteristics of classes and a set of relevance factors\nautomating the selection of the dimensionality of the subspaces. This leads to\na transparent classifier model which presents the computed impact of each input\nvector on its decision. Through experiments on benchmark image and text\ndatasets, we have demonstrated the efficiency of our proposed classifier,\ncompared to the transformer-based models in terms of not only performance and\nexplainability but also computational resource requirements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"fwsPIiavQS9fZVcLEht1JKjIzwFgZQjuIlllB8cpY5w","pdfSize":"923026"}
