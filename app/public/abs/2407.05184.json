This poses a challenge for researchers: how to stay relevant\nand effective in their studies? Empirical Software Engineering (ESE) has\nemerged as a contending force aiming to critically evaluate and provide\nknowledge that informs practice in adopting new technologies. Empirical\nresearch requires a rigorous process of collecting and analyzing data to obtain\nevidence-based findings. Challenges to this process are numerous, and many\nresearchers, novice and experienced, found difficulties due to many\ncomplexities involved in designing their research.\n  The core of this chapter is to teach foundational skills in research design,\nessential for educating software engineers and researchers in ESE. It focuses\non developing a well-structured research design, which includes defining a\nclear area of investigation, formulating relevant research questions, and\nchoosing appropriate methodologies. While the primary focus is on research\ndesign, this chapter also covers aspects of research scoping and selecting\nresearch methods. This approach prepares students to handle the complexities of\nthe ever-changing technological landscape in SE, making it a critical component\nof their educational curriculum.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
