Asymptotic upper bounds for the\nestimation error of such operators for processes in the Hilbert space $L^2[0,\n1]$ have been considered in recent years. This article adds to the theory in\nthis area in several ways. We derive consistent estimates for the operators\ndefining an invertible representation of a stationary process in a general\nseparable Hilbert space under mild conditions that hold for many classes of\nfunctional time series. Moreover, based on these results, we derive consistency\nresults with explicit rates for related operator estimates for Hilbert\nspace-valued causal linear processes, as well as functional MA, AR and ARMA\nprocesses.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kzC1QnlQzxIkU7lr3Jzked8-oMl-nX5YxoOVQg2rWLQ","pdfSize":"408293"}
