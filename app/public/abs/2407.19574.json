We first\nexamine the relation between injective generation and graded injective\ngeneration for graded rings. We then reduce the study of injective generation\nfor graded rings to the study of injective generation for certain Morita\ncontext rings and we provide sufficient conditions for injective generation of\nthe latter. We then provide necessary and sufficient conditions so that\ninjectives generate for tensor rings and for trivial extension rings. We\nprovide two proofs for the class of tensor rings, the one uses covering theory\nand the other uses the framework of cleft extensions of module categories. We\nfinally prove injective generation for twisted tensor products of finite\ndimensional algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
