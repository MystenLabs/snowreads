We provide the sufficient and necessary\nconditions such that multiple collisions of eigenvalue processes of $A^\\beta +\nT_\\beta X^\\beta T_\\beta^*$ occur with positive probability. In addition, for a\nreal or complex rectangular matrix $W^\\beta$ with independent Gaussian random\nfield entries, we obtain the sufficient and necessary conditions under which\nthe probability of multiple collisions of non-trivial singular value processes\nof $B^\\beta + T_\\beta W^\\beta \\tilde T_\\beta$ is positive. In both cases, the\nsize of the set of collision times is characterized via Hausdorff dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nK3qo928JCz2wHRxNoawPoStcT7WsSUDmr_Qv98abiE","pdfSize":"494654"}
