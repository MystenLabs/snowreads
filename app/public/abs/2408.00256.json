This enables FL to handle scenarios with sensitive or\nwidely distributed data. However, in these fields, it is well known that the\nlabeling costs can be a significant expense, and models relying on labels are\nnot suitable for these rapidly evolving fields especially in vehicular\nnetworks, or mobile internet of things (MIoT), where new data emerges\nconstantly. To handle this issue, the self-supervised learning paves the way\nfor training without labels. Additionally, for vehicles with high velocity,\nowing to blurred images, simple aggregation not only impacts the accuracy of\nthe aggregated model but also reduces the convergence speed of FL. This paper\nproposes a FL algorithm based on image blur level to aggregation, called\nFLSimCo, which does not require labels and serves as a pre-training stage for\nself-supervised learning in the vehicular environment. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that the proposed algorithm exhibits fast and stable convergence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
