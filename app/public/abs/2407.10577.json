Since this statistic does not use the\nexpected value of how many streaks of length $k$ are observed, but instead uses\nthe realization of the number of streaks present in the data, it may be a\nbiased estimator of the conditional probability of a fixed random variable\ntaking value $1$ if it is preceded by a streak of length $k$, as was first\nstudied and observed explicitly in [Miller and Sanjurjo, 2018]. In this short\nnote, we suggest an alternative proof for an explicit formula of the\nexpectation of the hot hand statistic for the case of streak length one. This\nformula was obtained through a different argument in [Miller and Sanjurjo,\n2018] and [Rinott and Bar-Hillel, 2015].\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
