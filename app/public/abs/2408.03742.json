Researchers have endeavored to demonstrate the\nalgorithmic difficulty of this problem by attempting to find a reduction from\nthe decoding problem of linear codes, for which several hardness results exist.\nEarlier studies used code smoothing as a technical tool to achieve such\nreductions, showing that they are possible for codes with vanishing rate. This\nhas left open the question of attaining a reduction with positive-rate codes.\nAddressing this case, we characterize the efficiency of the reduction in terms\nof the parameters of the decoding and LPN problems. As a conclusion, we isolate\nthe parameter regimes for which a meaningful reduction is possible and the\nregimes for which its existence is unlikely.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
