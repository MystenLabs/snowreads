Unlike optical quasicrystals shaped by\nelectromagnetic fields,these spin-governed quasicrystals exhibit quasi-periodic\nproperties of kinematic parameters,extending their potential applications to\nother physical systems. These findings hold promise for novel advancements in\noptical trapping,quasicrystal fabrication,and optical encryption systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
