Inclusive work\nenvironments aspire to close these gaps to increase employee satisfaction while\nreducing absenteeism and turnover. But there is always a job to be done, and\nunder time and resource constraints, democratic approaches can result in\nreduced quality and unacceptable delays. Teams need actionable guidance to\nincorporate inclusive practices that will directly impact effectiveness. This\npaper contributes to the literature on quality and performance management by\ndeveloping a conceptual model of inclusion that directly (and positively)\nimpacts performance, and identifies eight factors that workgroups must address\nto create and maintain inclusive, high performing environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
