This well-accepted tenant of\nquantum physics has been explored in quantum systems wherein the number of\nparticles is increased to macroscopic scales. However, theoretical\ninvestigations of nanoscale structures have revealed discrepancies when\nattempting to bridge classical and quantum physics. Here, we report on the\nexperimental observation of anomalous classical-to-quantum transitions in open\nmany-body optical systems. We demonstrate, for the first time, the lack of\nclassical-to-quantum correspondence between a macroscopic optical system and\nits constituent quantum multiphoton subsystems. In contrast to common belief,\nwe demonstrate that the coherence dynamics of many-body quantum subsystems with\nup to forty particles can indeed be opposite to that exhibited by the hosting\nmacroscopic system. By employing complex-Gaussian statistics, we show that\nthese effects are universal for open many-body systems. Consequently, our work\ncan have important implications for other fields of physics ranging from\ncondensed matter to nuclear physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
