However, its\nnonlinear characteristics pose significant challenges for detection in\nfrequency selective fading channels. This paper proposes an iterative receiver\ntailored for the detection of CPM signals over frequency selective fading\nchannels. This design leverages the factor graph framework to integrate\nequalization, demodulation, and decoding functions. The equalizer employs the\nunitary approximate message passing (UAMP) algorithm, while the unitary\ntransformation is implemented using the fast Fourier transform (FFT) with the\naid of a cyclic prefix (CP), thereby achieving low computational complexity\nwhile with high performance. For CPM demodulation and channel decoding, with\nbelief propagation (BP), we design a message passing-based maximum a posteriori\n(MAP) algorithm, and the message exchange between the demodulator, decoder and\nequalizer is elaborated. With proper message passing schedules, the receiver\ncan achieve fast convergence. Simulation results show that compared with\nexisting turbo receivers, the proposed receiver delivers significant\nperformance enhancement with low computational complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
