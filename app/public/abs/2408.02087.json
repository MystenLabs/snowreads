In recent years, the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nintroduced new productivity opportunities to the field of mechanical design.\nYet, it remains unrealistic to rely on LLMs alone to complete mechanical design\ntasks directly. Through a series of explorations, we propose a method for\nconstructing a comprehensive Mechanical Design Agent (MDA) by guiding LLM\nlearning. To verify the validity of our proposed method, we conducted a series\nof experiments and presented relevant cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
