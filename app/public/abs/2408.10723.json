In this work, we generalize the analogy between these two disciplines to\nrelativistic conditions. Using this analogy, we are able to make light follow\nthe orbits of massive or massless particles in gravitational field, by\ndesigning a particular optical medium with a prescribed refractive index\nprofile according to spacetime geometry. Furthermore, we build the dictionary\nthat connects optical refractive index and spacetime metric, thus extending F =\nma optics to the relativistic limit. The results shed light on the equivalence\nbetween the dielectric properties of optical media and the geometric structure\nof spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
