Popular\nmechanisms to generate the observed baryon asymmetry include CP-violating\nout-of-equilibrium decays and scatterings of heavy particles. If these heavy\nnon-relativistic particles feature long-range interactions, the formation of\nbound states can impact the generation of the baryon asymmetry. We outline the\ngeneral conditions for when bound states are important for decay and scattering\ndominated baryogenesis and present the necessary Boltzmann equations for the\nfirst time. We demonstrate that bound states can impact baryogenesis in three\ndifferent ways: They (i) strongly impact abundances of particles sourcing the\nBAU, (ii) act as a source term of the asymmetry, and (iii) mediate additional\nwashout channels.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
