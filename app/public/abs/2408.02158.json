Under an additional assumption that the\nconstant fields $\\mathbb{F}_s$ are perfect procyclic fields, we prove a\ncorrespondence between ramifications of primes $P$ in $\\mathfrak{K}(t)$ and\nramifications of primes $P_s$ in $\\mathbb{F}_s(t)$, where the $P_s$ are primes\nin $\\mathbb{F}_s(t)$ whose nonprincipal ultraproduct coincides with $P$.\n  In the second part of the paper, we are mainly concerned with rational\nfunction fields over a large class of fields, called $n$-th level ultra-finite\nfields that are a generalization of finite fields. At the $0$-th level,\nultra-finite fields are simply finite fields, and for an arbitrary positive\ninteger $n$, an $n$-th level ultra-finite field is inductively defined as a\nnonprincipal ultraproduct of $(n - 1)$-th level ultra-finite fields. We develop\nan analogue of cyclotomic function fields for rational function fields over\n$n$-th level ultra-finite fields that generalize the works of Carlitz and Hayes\nfor rational function fields over finite fields such that these cyclotomic\nfunction fields are in complete analogy with the classical cyclotomic fields\n$\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta)$ of the rationals $\\mathbb{Q}$. The main result in the\nsecond part of the paper is an analogue of the Kronecker--Weber theorem for\nrational function fields over $n$-th level ultra-finite fields that explicitly\ndescribes, from a model-theoretic viewpoint, the maximal abelian extension of\nthe rational function field over a given $n$-th level ultra-finite field for\nall $n \\ge 1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
