Furthermore, in the complex case, we show,\nusing the construction of types provided by Roche, that this result can be\nimproved to obtain a formula for the K-theory spectrum of every principal\nseries Bernstein block if the group is split.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
