These objects are formal sums that\nhave the symmetry properties of the Fourier expansion of a holomorphic Siegel\nmodular form. These authors proved that formal Siegel modular forms necessarily\nconverge absolutely on the Siegel half-space, and thus are the Fourier\nexpansion of an honest Siegel modular form. The purpose of this note is to give\na new proof of the cuspidal case of this ``automatic convergence\" theorem of\nBruinier-Raum. We use the same basic ideas in a separate paper to prove an\nautomatic convergence theorem for cuspidal quaternionic modular forms on\nexceptional groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
