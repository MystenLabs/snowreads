This task comprises three distinct subtasks - emotion recognition in\nconversation for Hindi-English code-mixed dialogues, emotion flip reasoning for\nHindi-English code-mixed dialogues, and emotion flip reasoning for English\ndialogues. Our team, MasonTigers, contributed to each subtask, focusing on\ndeveloping methods for accurate emotion recognition and reasoning. By\nleveraging our approaches, we attained impressive F1-scores of 0.78 for the\nfirst task and 0.79 for both the second and third tasks. This performance not\nonly underscores the effectiveness of our methods across different aspects of\nthe task but also secured us the top rank in the first and third subtasks, and\nthe 2nd rank in the second subtask. Through extensive experimentation and\nanalysis, we provide insights into our system's performance and contributions\nto each subtask.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
