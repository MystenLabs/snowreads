In this paper we investigate the matter of just how far\nfrom being positivity preserving a positive Green's operator can be. We will\nalso identify a broad class of Green's operators that are not necessarily\npositivity preserving but have properties related to positivity preservation\nthat one expects from positivity preserving Green's operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
