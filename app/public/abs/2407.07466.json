It has been found\ntowards TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey in the 31-50 GHz range. We observed\na total of 17 transitions with J = 2 up to 13 and Ka = 0, 1 and 2. The observed\ntransitions allowed us to derive a rotational temperature of 9.5 +- 0.5 K and a\ncolumn density of (5.0 +- 0.5) x 10^12 cm-2. This molecule was the last\nnon-cyclic isomer of the C5H4 family that could be detected via radio\nastronomy. A computational chemistry study was performed to determine the\nenergies of the five most stable isomers. The isomer (c-C3H3CCH) has a\nconsiderably higher energy than the others, and it has not yet been detected.\nTo better understand the chemical reactions involving these species, we\ncompared the ethynyl and cyano derivatives. The observed abundances of these\nspecies are in good agreement with the branching ratios of the formation\nreactions studied with our chemical model of TMC-1.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
