Specifically, we train Koopman\noperators and two neural networks - the state lifting network and the noise\ncharacterization network - using both data and available physical information.\nThe two neural networks account for the nonlinear lifting functions for Koopman\nmodeling and describing system noise distributions, respectively. Accordingly,\na stochastic linear Koopman model is established in the lifted space to\nforecast the dynamic behavior of the nonlinear system. Based on the Koopman\nmodel, a self-tuning linear moving horizon estimation (MHE) scheme is\ndeveloped. The weighting matrices of the MHE design are updated using the\npre-trained noise characterization network at each sampling instant. The\nproposed estimation scheme is computationally efficient because only convex\noptimization is involved during online implementation, and updating the\nweighting matrices of the MHE scheme does not require re-training the neural\nnetworks. We verify the effectiveness and evaluate the performance of the\nproposed method via the application to a simulated chemical process.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
