Under a cooperative condition, we show\nMcKean-Vlasov SDEs admit a comparison principle with respect to the stochastic\norder, and generate monotone dynamical systems on the $2$-Wasserstein space.\nOur main results prove the existence of unstable invariant measures, total\norderedness of invariant measures, and the existence of monotone connecting\norbits between order-related invariant measures for general cooperative\nMcKean-Vlasov SDEs. To achieve our goals, we adopt the theory of monotone\ndynamical systems, extend the connecting orbit theorem, and deduce a dichotomy\nstructure of equilibria. This method is different from existing approaches,\nlike propagation of chaos and Fokker-Planck equations. A wide range of\nclassical examples are covered by our framework, such as granular media\nequations in double-well and multi-well confinement potentials with quadratic\ninteraction, double-well landscapes with perturbation, and higher dimensional\nequations, even driven by multiplicative noises.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
