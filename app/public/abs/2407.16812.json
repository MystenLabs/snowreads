Furthermore,\nwe show that the center of $\\mathscr{S}_{\\bar{q}}(\\frak{S})$ is generated by\nthe peripheral skeins around punctures and the central elements contained in\nthe image of the Frobenius homomorphism for $\\mathscr{S}_{\\bar{q}}(\\frak{S})$,\na surface generalization of Frobenius homomorphisms of quantum groups related\nto ${\\rm SL}_3$. We compute the rank of $\\mathscr{S}_{\\bar{q}}(\\mathfrak{S})$\nover its center, hence the dimension of the generic irreducible representation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
