We perform a quantum field theoretic treatment by\nquantising a linearised fluctuation field around the classical soliton solution\nwhich can be seen as providing a background spacetime for the field. The\nlinearised fluctuation modifies the soliton background, which is often\nneglected, reminiscent of the nondepleted-pump approximation. Going beyond this\napproximation and by using a number-conserving Bogoljubov approach, we find\nunstable modes that grow as the soliton propagates. Eventually, these unstable\nmodes induce a considerable (backreaction) effect in the soliton. We calculate\nthe backreaction in the classical field fully analytically in the leading\nsecond order. The result is a quadratic local decrease of the soliton photon\nnumber in propagation due to the backreaction effect of the unstable mode.\nProvided the initial pulse is close to the classical soliton solution, the\nunstable mode contributions always become dominant. We also consider practical\nscenarios for observing this quantum-induced soliton distortion, in the\nspectral domain. The backreaction, which we expect to be present in bright and\ndark, discrete and continuous solitons and other nonlinear pulses plays an\nimportant role for future optical analogue gravity experiments, for soliton\nlasers, and optical communications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aRm1hX4oXhD0KAHqiwEu8lR66kUGV829Jk2qjf3v2Ks","pdfSize":"725935"}
