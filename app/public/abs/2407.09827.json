Here we establish the occurrence of\ncondensates by analyzing exact recursions, and further show that they have a\nstrong effect on the properties of the system. In the steady state of a large\nbut finite system, there is a single condensate, whose movement through the\nsystem leads to a reorganization of the mass profile on a macroscopic scale. A\nscaling analysis of the mean mass and standard deviation at different distances\nfrom the condensate leads to the surprising conclusion that the mass\ndistribution on sites close to the condensate follow a power-law decay with a\nnew exponent 5/3, while further-away sites show the customary Takayasu exponent\n4/3, with a crossover in between. Finally, the exit of condensates from a\nsystem with open boundaries has a strong effect on the temporal fluctuations of\nthe total mass in the steady state. Their departure is followed by a build-up\nof mass and subsequent departures, leading to strong intermittency, established\nthrough a divergence of the flatness as the scaled time approaches zero.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
