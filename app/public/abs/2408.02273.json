Traditionally, relative value calculation has been done\nusing rule-based or heuristics-driven approaches, which may introduce human\nbiases and often fail to account for complex relationships between the bond\ncharacteristics. We propose a data-driven model to develop a supervised\nsimilarity framework for the muni bond market based on CatBoost algorithm. This\nalgorithm learns from a large-scale dataset to identify bonds that are similar\nto each other based on their risk profiles. This allows us to evaluate the\nprice of a muni bond relative to a cohort of bonds with a similar risk profile.\nWe propose and deploy a back-testing methodology to compare various benchmarks\nand the proposed methods and show that the similarity-based method outperforms\nboth rule-based and heuristic-based methods.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
