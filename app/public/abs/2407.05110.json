In data-driven problems, empirical data may be\n``contaminated''. This raises the question as to whether the approximate\nprecision matrix is reliable from a statistical point of view. In this paper,\nwe concentrate on a much-noticed sparse estimator of the precision matrix and\ninvestigate the issue from the perspective of distributional stability.\nSpecifically, we derive an explicit local Lipschitz bound for the distance\nbetween the distributions of the sparse estimator under two different\ndistributions (regarded as the true data distribution and the distribution of\n``contaminated'' data). The distance is measured by the Kantorovich metric on\nthe set of all probability measures on a matrix space. We also present\nanalogous results for the standard estimators of the covariance matrix and its\neigenvalues. Furthermore, we discuss two applications and conduct some\nnumerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
