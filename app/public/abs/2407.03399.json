We examine 163 objects at 1.06 < z < 6.71\nwith significant (3$\\sigma$) spectroscopic detections of H$\\alpha$ and H$\\beta$\nin order to constrain intrinsic H$\\alpha$ luminosities corrected from nebular\ndust attenuation via Balmer decrements. We constrain dust-corrected UV\nluminosities from best-fit spectral-energy distribution modeling. We find a\nsample median log$_{10}$($\\xi{\\rm ion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) =\n$25.29^{+0.29}_{-0.37}$, assuming f$_{\\rm esc}$=0 for the escape fraction of\nLyman continuum emission. We find significant correlation between $\\xi_{\\rm\nion,0}$ and z, with 17 objects at z > 4.64 having median log$_{10}$($\\xi_{\\rm\nion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) = $25.38^{+0.38}){-0.38}$, with those below having\nlog$_{10}$($\\xi_{\\rm ion,0}$/erg Hz$^{-1}$) = $25.24^{+0.30}_{-0.33}$. We also\nfind significant, positive correlations between $\\xi_{\\rm ion,0}$ and LUV;\nW{\\lambda}([O iii]); [O iii]{\\lambda}5007/[O ii]{\\lambda}{\\lambda}3726, 3729;\nand inverse correlations with metallicity. In contrast with some previous\nresults, we find no trends between $\\xi_{\\rm ion,0}$ and stellar mass, stellar\ndust attenuation, or UV slope. Applying a multivariate fit to $\\xi_{\\rm\nion,0}$, z, and MUV to an empirically-motivated model of reionization, and\nfolding in f$_{\\rm esc}$ estimates from direct observations of the Lyman\ncontinuum at z ~ 3 from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic survey, we find\nthat the number of ionizing photons entering the IGM causes reionization to end\nat z ~ 5 - 7.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
