It states that for any product\n$\\Omega_i^{\\otimes d}$, function $f: \\Omega_i^{\\otimes d} \\to \\mathbb{R}$, and\n$q > 1$:\n  $$||T_{\\frac{1}{2}}f(x)||_q \\leq ||\\tilde{f}(r,x)||_{q} \\leq\n||T_{c_q}f(x)||_q$$ where $T_{\\rho}f = \\sum\\limits \\rho^Sf^{=S}$ is the noise\noperator and $\\widetilde{f}(r,x) = \\sum\\limits r_Sf^{=S}(x)$ `symmetrizes' $f$\nby convolving its Fourier components $\\{f^{=S}\\}_{S \\subseteq [d]}$ with a\nrandom boolean string $r \\in \\{\\pm 1\\}^d$.\n  In this work, we extend the symmetrization theorem to high dimensional\nexpanders (HDX). Adapting work of O'Donnell and Zhao (2021), we give as a\ncorollary a proof of optimal global hypercontractivity for partite HDX,\nresolving one of the main open questions of Gur, Lifshitz, and Liu (STOC 2022).\nAdapting work of Bourgain (JAMS 1999), we also give the first booster theorem\nfor HDX, resolving a main open questions of Bafna, Hopkins, Kaufman, and Lovett\n(STOC 2022).\n  Our proof is based on two elementary new ideas in the theory of high\ndimensional expansion. First we introduce `$q$-norm HDX', generalizing standard\nspectral notions to higher moments, and observe every spectral HDX is a\n$q$-norm HDX. Second, we introduce a simple method of coordinate-wise analysis\non HDX which breaks high dimensional random walks into coordinate-wise\ncomponents, and allows each component to be analyzed as a $1$-dimensional\noperator locally within $X$. This allows for application of standard tricks\nsuch as the replacement method, greatly simplifying prior analytic techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ABZThMxe8ScLWeSu8NxvKhCTkaVewhVqQTb5ZJu2Dso","pdfSize":"388699"}
