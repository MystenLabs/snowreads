The study focuses on the distributed setup where a source\nis compressed and transmitted through a noiseless channel to a receiver\nperforming polynomial regression, aided by side information available at the\ndecoder. The paper provides the asymptotic rate generalization error region,\nand extends the analysis to the non-asymptotic regime.Additionally, it\ninvestigates the asymptotic trade-off between polynomial regression and data\nreconstruction under communication constraints. The proposed achievable scheme\nis shown to achieve the minimum generalization error as well as the optimal\nrate-distortion region.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
