However, in practice, learning hyperbolic embeddings of hierarchical\ndata is difficult due to the different geometry between hyperbolic space and\nthe Euclidean space. To address such difficulties, we first categorize three\nkinds of illness that harm the performance of the embeddings. Then, we develop\na geometry-aware algorithm using a dilation operation and a transitive closure\nregularization to tackle these illnesses. We empirically validate these\ntechniques and present a theoretical analysis of the mechanism behind the\ndilation operation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets reveal\nsuperior performances of our algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2ZRlegKnTbuqAkdVPua9MrOSzwZR1KzovhBo_hEg740","pdfSize":"1149788","objectId":"0xfedbfc89a522c01d0090d0b5214e46938425e8f506c38660eabfc4f8a95772a8","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
