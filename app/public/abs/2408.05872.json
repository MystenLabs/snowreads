Consequently: (i) if $l\n\\leq q$ and none of $a_{1}, a_{2}, \\ldots, a_{l}$ is a perfect $q^{th}$ power,\nthen the polynomial $\\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - a_{j})$ fails to have roots\nmodulo some positive integer; $(ii)$ For every $l\\in\\mathbb{N}$, and every\n$(c_{j})_{j=1}^{l}\\in\\big(\\mathbb{F}_{q}\\setminus\\{0\\}\\big)^{l}$, the\npolynomial $\\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} - a_{j})$ has roots modulo every positive\ninteger if and only if $\\prod_{j=1}^{l} (x^{q} -\n\\text{rad}_{q}\\big(a_{j}^{c_{j}}\\big)))$ has roots modulo every positive\ninteger. Here $\\text{rad}_{q}(a_{j})$ denotes the $q$-free part of the integer\n$a_{j}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
