The model implements the\narrival, cancellation and diffusion of orders coupled by a pairs trader\nprofiting from the mean-reversion between the two order books in the fluid\nlimit for a Lit order book with vanishing boundary conditions and order volume\nconservation. We are able to demonstrate the recovery of an Epps effect from\nthis. We discuss how various stylised facts depend on the model parameters and\nthe numerical scheme and discuss the various strengths and weaknesses of the\napproach. We demonstrate how the Epps effect depends on different choices of\ntime and price discretisation. This shows how an Epps effect can emerge without\nrecourse to market microstructure noise relative to a latent model but can\nrather be viewed as an emergent property arising from trader interactions in a\nworld of asynchronous events.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
