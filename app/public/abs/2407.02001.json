In the limit of weak\nparticle inertia, we show asymptotically that, in the reference frame of the\ncrystal, inertial particles have $N$ asymptotically stable equilibrium\npositions located outside the crystal, in agreement with numerical observations\nby Ravichandran et al. (Sadhana 42, 2017). In addition to these \"satellite\"\nattracting points, we observe that for $N \\ge 3$ the center of the ring, though\ndegenerate, is a stable equilibrium position for inertial particles. This\ncreates a kind of cage effect, where inclusions slowly drift towards the center\nunder the effect of the surrounding vortices. This cage effect is observed to\npersist even at larger Stokes numbers, in contrast with the satellite\nattracting points that vanish when the Stokes number is above some critical\nvalue.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
