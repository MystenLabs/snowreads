BaCoSiO$_4$, a recently proposed multiferroic combines\nmultiple unit cell-tripling modes, structural chirality and ferroelectric\npolarization, whose interactions result in a peculiar ground state. We derive\nthe Landau free energy for interacting trimerization, electric polarization and\nstructural chiral modes and find the corresponding coefficients from\nfirst-principles calculations. This results in a quantitative model for the\ndescription of domain walls and vortices, observed in recent experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
