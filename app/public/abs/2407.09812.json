MPPI allows the use of\nthe full nonlinear model of UAV dynamics and a more general cost function at\nthe cost of a high computational demand. To run the controller in real-time,\nthe sampling-based optimization is performed in parallel on a graphics\nprocessing unit onboard the UAV. We propose an approach to the simulation of\nthe nonlinear system which respects low-level constraints, while also able to\ndynamically handle obstacle avoidance, and prove that our methods are able to\nrun in real-time without the need for external computers. The MPPI controller\nis compared to MPC and SE(3) controllers on the reference tracking task,\nshowing a comparable performance. We demonstrate the viability of the proposed\nmethod in multiple simulation and real-world experiments, tracking a reference\nat up to 44 km/h and acceleration close to 20 m/s^2, while still being able to\navoid obstacles. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first method to\ndemonstrate an MPPI-based approach in real flight.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
