To fundamentally address the limitation of the weighted average\nmechanism, a weighted-median opinion dynamics has been recently proposed;\nhowever, its theoretical analysis is challenging due to its nonlinear nature.\nThis paper studies the weighted-median opinion dynamics with prejudice, and\nobtains the convergence and convergence rate when all agents have prejudice,\nand a necessary and sufficient condition for asymptotic consensus when a\nportion of agents have prejudice. These results are the first time to analyze\nthe discrete-time and synchronous opinion dynamics with the weighted median\nmechanism, and address the phenomenon of the FJ model that connectivity leads\nto consensus when a few agents with the same prejudice join in an unprejudiced\ngroup.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
