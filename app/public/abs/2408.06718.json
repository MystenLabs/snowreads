First, we\nintroduce two performance indices, namely the nominal performance index and the\nestimation error covariance. By leveraging the nominal performance index and\nthe Frobenius norm of the modeling deviations, we derive the bounds of the\nestimation error covariance and the lower bound of the nominal performance\nindex. Specifically, we reveal the effect of the consensus parameter on both\nbounds. We demonstrate that, under specific conditions, an incorrect process\nnoise covariance can lead to the divergence of the estimation error covariance.\nMoreover, we investigate the properties of the eigenvalues of the error\ndynamical matrix. In the context of switching topological configurations, we\nprovide a sufficient condition that ensures the stability of the error\ndynamical matrix. Furthermore, we explore the magnitude relations between the\nnominal performance index and the estimation error covariance. Finally, we\npresent some numerical simulations to validate the effectiveness of the\ntheoretical results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
