Additionally, the effect of\ndeviating room acoustics for a single sound presentation embedded in a sequence\nof presentations using a baseline room acoustics for familiarization is\nanalyzed. For this purpose, two experiments were conducted using audiovisual\nvirtual reality technology with dynamic head-tracking and real-time\nauralization over headphones combined with visual rendering of the room using a\nhead-mounted display. Results show an improved distance perception accuracy\nwhen participants moved laterally during signal presentation instead of staying\nat a fixed position, with only head movements allowed. Adaptation to the room\nacoustics also improves distance perception accuracy. Azimuth perception seems\nto be independent of lateral movements during signal presentation and could\neven be negatively influenced by the familiarity of the used room acoustics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"evqRJl_pI5OHvfxnlwZqoShCxuK3RBEgpSh19SYw2xI","pdfSize":"1143701"}
