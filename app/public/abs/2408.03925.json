If launched, STARI will be the first mission to control a 3-D\nCubeSat formation to the few mm-level, reflect starlight over 10s to 100s of\nmeters from one spacecraft to another, control tip-tilt with sub-arcsecond\nstability, and validate end-to-end performance by injecting light into a\nsingle-mode fiber. While STARI is not an interferometer, the mission will\nadvance the Technology Readiness Levels of the essential subsystems needed for\na space interferometer in the near future.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
