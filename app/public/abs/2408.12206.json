Denote by $\\operatorname{mod} R$\nthe category of finitely generated $R$-modules and by $\\operatorname{D^b}(R)$\nthe bounded derived category of $\\operatorname{mod} R$. In this paper, we first\ninvestigate localizations and annihilators of Verdier quotients of\n$\\operatorname{D^b}(R)$. After that, we explore upper bounds for the dimension\nof the singularity category of $R$ and its (strong) generators. We extend a\ntheorem of Liu to the case where $R$ is neither an isolated singularity nor\neven a local ring.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
