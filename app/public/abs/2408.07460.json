This\nis rooted in the enormous speeds at which satellites in LEO must travel\nrelative to the Earth's surface. While changes in end-to-end routes are rare\nevents in stationary and terrestrial applications, they are a dominating factor\nfor connection-oriented services running over LEO constellations and\nmega-constellations. This paper discusses how TCP-over-constellations is\naffected by the need for rerouting and how orbital route selection algorithms\nimpact the end-to-end performance of communication. In contrast to the state of\nthe art that primarily optimizes for instantaneous shortest routes (i.e. lowest\ndelay), we propose several algorithms that have route stability and longevity\nin their focus. We show that this shift in focus comes with vastly improved\nend-to-end communication performance, and we discuss peculiar effects of the\ntypical TCP-like implementations, taking inspiration from the Starlink\nconstellation in our empirical investigations. The spectrum of algorithms\nproposed provides a basis for co-designing suitable orbital route selection\nalgorithms and tailored transport control algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
