Here, parallel\nplate capacitors composed of aluminum-contacted, crystalline silicon fins are\nshown to be a promising technology for use in superconducting circuits by\nevaluating the performance of lumped element resonators and transmon qubits.\nHigh aspect ratio Si-fin capacitors having widths below $300nm$ with an\napproximate total height of 3$\\mu$m are fabricated using anisotropic wet\netching of Si(110) substrates followed by aluminum metallization. The\nsingle-crystal Si capacitors are incorporated in lumped element resonators and\ntransmons by shunting them with lithographically patterned aluminum inductors\nand conventional $Al/AlO_x/Al$ Josephson junctions respectively. Microwave\ncharacterization of these devices suggests state-of-the-art performance for\nsuperconducting parallel plate capacitors with low power internal quality\nfactor of lumped element resonators greater than 500k and qubit $T_1$ times\ngreater than 25$\\mu$s. These results suggest that Si-Fins are a promising\ntechnology for applications that require low loss, compact,\nsuperconductor-based capacitors with minimal stray capacitance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F8Gcf2gI83Bu2_cMY9Woa5S1q7NfhVjZgcXmayH2I9I","pdfSize":"1180102"}
