After spelling out the expressions for such decay rates in\na low energy effective theory which includes generic contributions arising from\nphysics beyond the Standard Model (BSM), we show that the experimental bounds\non meson decays can be used to bound the corresponding modes involving baryons.\nWe find, for example, $\\mathcal{B}(\\Lambda_b\\to \\Lambda\\mu\\tau)\\lesssim 4\\times\n10^{-5}$. We also consider two specific models and constrain the relevant LFV\ncouplings by using the low energy observables. In the first model we assume the\nHiggs mediated LFV and find the resulting decay rates to be too small to be\nexperimentally detectable. We also emphasize that the regions favored by the\nbounds $\\mathcal{B}(h\\to\\mu\\tau)^\\mathrm{Atlas}$ and $\\mathcal{B}(h\\to\ne\\tau)^\\mathrm{Atlas}$ are not compatible with $\\mathcal{B}(\\mu\\to\ne\\gamma)^\\mathrm{MEG}$ to $1\\sigma$. In the second model we assume LFV mediated\nby a heavy $Z'$ boson and find that the corresponding $b$-hadron branching\nfractions can be $\\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$, thus possibly within experimental\nreach at LHCb and Belle~II.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
