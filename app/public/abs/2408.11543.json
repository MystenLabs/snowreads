This extends the notion of a Cayley graph (as a metric space). Our\nmotivation comes from trying to detect the existence of virtual homomorphisms\ninto Z, the additive group of integers. We show that detection of such\nhomomorphisms through metric functional boundaries of Cayley graphs isn't\nalways possible. However, we prove that it is always possible to do so through\na metric functional boundary of some Banach metric on the group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
