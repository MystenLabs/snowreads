As a main example, we consider a theory\nwith two fields having large and small vacuum expectation values (vev). We show\nthat no fine-tuning between the {\\it physical quantities} is needed to keep the\nhierarchy between the vevs of different fields.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LrIEY2yYGjmz6BU-qKafydAqI3cgAeeZBjt7vFcz_48","pdfSize":"785107","txDigest":"GeEWnxaooN2zsrnegi93CkrmThCeJHRBcCR5EeiqBLGw","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
