A BH with such a cloud\nin a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from\nthe BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the\nevolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase,\nincluding axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is\nsignificant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through\nmode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects\nof dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal\ninteraction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and\nabsorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and\noff-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results\ndemonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the\nmodification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a\ndynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
