By removing pixel information and providing only de-identified human\nannotations, PHEVA safeguards personally identifiable information. The dataset\nincludes seven indoor/outdoor scenes, featuring one novel, context-specific\ncamera, and offers over 5x the pose-annotated frames compared to the largest\nprevious dataset. This study benchmarks state-of-the-art methods on PHEVA using\na comprehensive set of metrics, including the 10% Error Rate (10ER), a metric\nused for anomaly detection for the first time providing insights relevant to\nreal-world deployment. As the first of its kind, PHEVA bridges the gap between\nconventional training and real-world deployment by introducing continual\nlearning benchmarks, with models outperforming traditional methods in 82.14% of\ncases.
