The radius measurement of PSR J0030+0451 has rejected\nseveral relatively softer equations of state. In this work, an ensemble of\nagnostically constructed EoS was studied for the mass and radius measurement.\nThe range of radius of neutron stars obtained from the ensemble was confined\nwithin a radius bound from 10.5 - 14.5 km. It is seen that higher masses prefer\nstiffer EoS. However, the slope of the speed of sound (the stiffness of the\nEoS) is very sensitive to the radius measurement. Assuming the radius\nmeasurement to be precise up to 2 km, then a higher radius indicates sharp\nstiffening of the equation of state at low density; however, it also indicates\na sharp fall after the peak, indicating a relatively softer core for massive\nneutron stars. On the other hand, for the same precision, a lower radius\nmeasurement indicates a relatively softer equation of state.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
