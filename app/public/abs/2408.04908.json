In this article, we provide a\ncomprehensive energy consumption analytical model of LR-FHSS, focusing on three\ncritical metrics: average current consumption, battery lifetime, and energy\nefficiency of data transmission. The model is based on measurements performed\non real hardware in a fully operational LR-FHSS network. While in our\nevaluation, LR-FHSS can show worse consumption figures than LoRa, we find that\nwith optimal configuration, the battery lifetime of LR-FHSS end devices can\nreach 2.5 years for a 50 min notification period. For the most energy-efficient\npayload size, this lifespan can be extended to a theoretical maximum of up to\n16 years with a one-day notification interval using a cell-coin battery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
