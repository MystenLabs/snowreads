Firstly,\nit examines the shape of the learned hidden representation as well as its\nability to categorize phonetic categories. Secondly, it explores the impact of\ntraining models on context-free acoustic information, without involving\ncontextual cues, on phonetic acquisition, closely mimicking the early language\nlearning stage. Using a cross-linguistic modeling approach, autoencoder models\nare trained on English and Mandarin and evaluated in both native and non-native\nconditions, following experimental conditions used in infant language\nperception studies. The results demonstrate that unsupervised bottom-up\ntraining on context-free acoustic information leads to comparable learned\nrepresentations of perceptual space between native and non-native conditions\nfor both English and Mandarin, resembling the early stage of universal\nlistening in infants. These findings provide insights into the organization of\nperceptual space during early phonetic acquisition and contribute to our\nunderstanding of the formation and representation of phonetic categories.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"w9aisE1BL7jli-S34zjTGl6Psdw5jjs0WHoK4lTXYKI","pdfSize":"1820761"}
