The use case does not matter. It could\nrange from publishing the results of a small research project to a large\nknowledge graph at a big corporation. The FAIR principles apply equally and\nthis is why it is important to put extra thought into the URI selection\nprocess. The title aims to extend the tradition of \"Cool URIs don't change\" and\n\"Cool URIs for the Semantic Web\". Much has changed since the publication of\nthese works and we would like to revisit some of the principles. Many still\nhold today, some had to be reworked, and we could also identify new ones\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
