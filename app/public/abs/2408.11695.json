This is the\ngeneralization of the work presented in [10]. We derive analytical results for\nthe expectation of the conditional intensity and the expected number of events\nin the counting process. Additionally, we investigate the limiting behavior of\nthe expectation of the conditional intensity. Finally, we present an empirical\ncomparison of the studied process with its limiting special cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"k0e0EcS8htItGLjev29gsB32Kv3ht5hNfHKM9X-EKdU","pdfSize":"367923"}
