For such a\nsubstitution, the substitution matrix may have non-integer entries. We give the\nmeaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius\neigenvector gives the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. We also show\nthat the expansion constant is an algebraic integer under mild conditions. In\ngeneral, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with contradictory\noverlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We give a sufficient\ncondition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, that is, no such\ncontradiction will emerge. We also give many one-dimensional examples of\noverlapping substitution. We finish by mentioning a construction of overlapping\nsubstitutions from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
