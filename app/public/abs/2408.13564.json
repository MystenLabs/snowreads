(2018). Rotational feedbacks are now\nincorporated, and the application of the second-order adjoint method is\ndescribed for the first time. The first-order adjoint method provides an\nefficient means for computing sensitivity kernels for a chosen objective\nfunctional, while the second-order adjoint method provides second-derivative\ninformation in the form of Hessian kernels. These latter kernels are required\nby efficient Newton-type optimisation schemes and within methods for\nquantifying uncertainty for non-linear inverse problems. Most importantly, the\nentire theory has been reformulated so as to simplify its implementation by\nothers within the GIA community. In particular, the rate-formulation for the\nGIA forward problem introduced by Crawford et al. (2018) has been replaced with\nthe conventional equations for modelling GIA in laterally heterogeneous earth\nmodels. The implementation of the first- and second-order adjoint problems\nshould be relatively easy within both existing and new GIA codes, with only the\ninclusions of more general force terms being required.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"j_7kqYQpmyvlwx9bMjHV2v9i6BsKn1sv1eYGakkW9_g","pdfSize":"372586"}
