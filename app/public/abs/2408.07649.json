We exhibit that such quantum links of arbitrary spin quantum\nnumber can be formed when the system is prepared at a very low temperature. We\nfind that the Heisenberg and the bilinear-biquadratic (BBQ) spin-s models are\nthe potential candidates to achieve the maximal entanglement in equilibrium. By\neliminating the equilibrium requirement, we show that a completely polarized\nstate in the bulk and a suitable qudit state in the link can evolve over time\nto produce a highly entangled state, as per the BBQ Hamiltonian with nearest-\nand next-nearest neighbor interactions. When the number of sites in the bulk\ngrows, so does the maximum entanglement produced in dynamics. Further, both the\nstatic and the dynamical protocols presented here remain efficient even if the\nspin quantum numbers of the bulk and the connection are unequal.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
