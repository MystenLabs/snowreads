The\nElectron Spin Resonance (ESR) spectroscopy plays an important role in the\nexploration of the rich magnetic behavior of van der Waals compounds due to its\nhigh sensitivity to magnetic anisotropies and unprecedentedly high energy\nresolution that altogether enable one to obtain thorough insights into the\ndetails of the spin structure in the magnetically ordered state and the\nlow-energy spin dynamics in the ordered and paramagnetic phases. This article\nprovides an overview of the recent achievements in this field made by the ESR\nspectroscopic techniques encompassing representatives of antiferro- and\nferromagnetic van der Waals compounds of different crystal structures and\nchemical composition as well as of a special category of these materials termed\nmagnetic topological insulators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
