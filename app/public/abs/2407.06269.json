In metal-enriched\nenvironments, $\\rm{H_2}$ primarily forms on interstellar dust grain surfaces.\nHowever, due to the complexities of modelling this process, SF in cosmological\nsimulations often relies on empirical or theoretical frameworks validated only\nin the Local Universe to estimate the abundance of $\\rm{H_2}$.\n  Aims: This study aims to model the connection between star, dust, and\n$\\rm{H_2}$ formation processes in cosmological simulations.\n  Methods: We include $\\rm{H_2}$ formation on dust grain surfaces and account\nfor molecule destruction and radiation shielding into the SF and feedback model\nMUPPI.\n  Results: The model reproduces key properties of observed galaxies for\nstellar, dust, and $\\rm{H_2}$ components. The cosmic density of $\\rm{H_2}$\n($\\rho_{\\rm{H2}}$) peaks around $z=1.5$, then decreases by half towards $z=0$,\nshowing milder evolution than observed. The $\\rm{H_2}$ mass function since\n$z=2$ also shows gentler evolution. Our model successfully recovers the\nintegrated molecular Kennicutt-Schmidt (mKS) law between surface star formation\nrate ($\\Sigma_{\\rm SFR}$) and surface $\\rm{H_2}$ density ($\\Sigma_{\\rm H2}$) at\n$z=0$, already evident at $z=2$ with a higher normalization. We find hints of a\nbroken power law with a steeper slope at higher $\\Sigma_{\\rm H2}$, aligning\nwith some observational findings. Additionally, the $\\rm{H_2}$-to-dust mass\nratio in galaxies shows a decreasing trend with gas metallicity and stellar\nmass. The $\\rm{H_2}$-to-dust mass fraction for the global galaxy population is\nhigher at higher redshifts. The analysis of the atomic-to-molecular transition\non a particle-by-particle basis suggests that gas metallicity cannot reliably\nsubstitute the dust-to-gas ratio in models simulating dust-promoted $\\rm{H_2}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
