The problem is set in a\nbounded domain of $\\mathbb{R}^d$ (with $d=2$ or $3$) and homogeneous Neumann\nboundary conditions are considered. The employed strategy consists in building\na numerical scheme on a regularized version \\`a la Moreau-Yosida of the\nconstrained problem, and passing to the limit simultaneously with respect to\nthe regularization parameter and the time and space steps, denoted respectively\nby $\\epsilon$, $\\Delta t$ and $h$. Combining a semi-implicit Euler-Maruyama\ntime discretization with a Two-Point Flux Approximation (TPFA) scheme for the\nspatial variable, one is able to prove, under the assumption $\\Delta\nt=\\mathcal{O}(\\epsilon^{2+\\theta})$ for a positive $\\theta$, the convergence of\nsuch a $(\\epsilon, \\Delta t, h)$ scheme towards the unique weak solution of the\ninitial problem, \\textit{ a priori} strongly in\n$L^2(\\Omega;L^2(0,T;L^2(\\Lambda)))$ and \\textit{a posteriori} also strongly in\n$L^{p}(0,T; L^2(\\Omega\\times \\Lambda))$ for any finite $p\\geq 1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
