Here we apply the Schwinger\nboson approach to the bilayer $t$-$V$-$J$ model and obtain a global phase\ndiagram with both metallic and superconducting ground states separated by a\nquantum phase transition. We predict a minimal interlayer superexchange $J$ and\na minimal $d_{z^2}$-hole concentration necessary for the superconductivity, a\nright-triangle-like shape for the $T_c$ curve, and a maximum $T_c$ comparable\nwith experiments. The normal state is featured with a pseudogap in the\n$d_{x^2-y^2}$ spectra associated with preformed Cooper pairs and non-Fermi\nliquid strange metal behavior due to hybridization-induced\nspinon-holon-electron scattering. Our work clarifies the key difference of the\ntwo-component scenario from other pairing mechanisms, and provides a consistent\nunderstanding of the high-temperature superconductivity and strange metallic\nproperties of La$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under high pressure.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l2gOQbAg-pnFnlA3GiXTRy6Ban5nE7ZjcuKFXf3p0gU","pdfSize":"619097"}
