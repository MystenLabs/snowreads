Immersed boundary methods involve embedding complex geometries\nwithin a background grid, which allows for great flexibility in modeling\nintricate shapes and features despite the simplicity of the approach. The IBCM\nmethod introduces additional layers conformal to the boundaries, allowing for\nthe strong imposition of Dirichlet boundary conditions and facilitating local\nrefinement. In this study, the construction of boundary layers is combined with\nhigh-degree spline-based approximation spaces to further increase efficiency.\nThe Nitsche method, employing non-symmetric average operators, is used to\ncouple the boundary layers with the inner patch, while stabilizing the\nformulation with minimal penalty parameters. High-order quadrature rules are\napplied for integration over cut elements and patch interfaces. Numerical\nexperiments demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed\nformulation, highlighting its potential for complex shell structures modeled\nthrough Kirchhoff-Love and Reissner-Mindlin theories. These tests include the\ngeneration of conformal interfaces, the coupling of Kirchhoff-Love and\nReissner-Mindlin theories, and the simulation of a damaged shell.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
