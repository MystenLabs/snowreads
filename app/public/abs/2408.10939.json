While conformal\nprediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with valid coverage\nguarantees, it traditionally focuses on single predictions. This paper\nintroduces novel conformal prediction methods for estimating the sum or average\nof unknown labels over specific index sets. We develop conformal prediction\nintervals for single target to the prediction interval for sum of multiple\ntargets. Under permutation invariant assumptions, we prove the validity of our\nproposed method. We also apply our algorithms on class average estimation and\npath cost prediction tasks, and we show that our method outperforms existing\nconformalized approaches as well as non-conformal approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
