IMBH mergers are expected to take place within dwarf galaxies,\nhowever, the dynamics, timescales, and effect on their hosts are largely\nunexplored. In a previous study, we examined how IMBHs would pair and merge\nwithin nucleated dwarf galaxies. IMBHs in nucleated hosts evolve very\nefficiently, forming a binary system and coalescing within a few hundred\nmillion years. Although the fraction of dwarf galaxies ($10^7$ M$_{\\odot} \\leq$\n$M_{\\star} \\leq 10^{10}$ M$_{\\odot}$) hosting nuclear star clusters is between\n60-100\\%, this fraction drops to 20-70\\% for lower-mass dwarfs\n($M_{\\star}\\approx 10^7$ M$_{\\odot}$), with the largest drop in low-density\nenvironments. Here, we extend our previous study by performing direct $N-$body\nsimulations to explore the dynamics and evolution of IMBHs within non-nucleated\ndwarf galaxies, under the assumption that IMBHs exist within these dwarfs. To\nour surprise, none of IMBHs in our simulation suite merge within a Hubble time,\ndespite many attaining high eccentricities $e \\sim 0.7-0.95$. We conclude that\nextremely low stellar density environments in the centers of non-nucleated\ndwarfs do not provide an ample supply of stars to interact with IMBHs binary\nresulting in its stalling, in spite of triaxiality and high eccentricity,\ncommon means to drive a binary to coalescence. Our findings underline the\nimportance of considering all detailed host properties to predict IMBH merger\nrates for LISA.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
