We show that the\ncombinatorics, and moreover, the normal fan of such a symmetrization can be\nrecovered from its refined fundamental fan, a decorated poset describing how\nthe normal fan of $P$ subdivides the fundamental chamber associated to the\nreflection group $\\mathfrak{G}$.\n  One important application of our results is providing a way to approach the\nrealization problem of a $\\mathfrak{G}$-symmetric poset F, that is, the problem\nof constructing a polytope whose face poset is F. Instead of working with the\noriginal poset F, we look at its dual poset T (which is\n$\\mathfrak{G}$-symmetric as well) and focus on a generating subposet Z of T,\nand reduce the problem to realizing Z as a refined fundamental fan.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W1pGwH9kQ4vPRUAtjvFIe5sd2lOM01rjaP1bbLbPZek","pdfSize":"460190"}
