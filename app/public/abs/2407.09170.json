We show that all sufficiently regular\nfinite-energy solutions to the linear equation possess a particular\nfinite-order asymptotic expansion near the future boundary. Specifically, we\nprove that several terms in this asymptotic expansion are identically zero.\nThis is accomplished with new weighted higher-order energy estimates that\ncapture the global expansion of the cosmological region. Furthermore we prove\nexistence and uniqueness of scattering solutions to the linear wave equation on\nthe expanding region. Given two pieces of scattering data at infinity, we\nconstruct solutions that have the same asymptotics as forward solutions. The\nproof involves constructing asymptotic solutions to the wave equation, as well\nas a new weighted energy estimate that is suitable for the backward problem.\nThis scattering result extends to a large class of expanding spacetimes,\nincluding the Kerr de Sitter family.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
