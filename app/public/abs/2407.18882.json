Their specific\nchemophysical properties are intimately connected to their molecular structure,\nfeaturing repeating patterns broken by substitutions. Molecular dynamics\nsimulations can provide insight into the mechanisms leading to the emergent\nproperties of these layered materials, however up to now idealised clay\nstructures have been simulated to make the modelling process tractable. We\npresent ClayCode, software facilitating the modelling of clay systems closely\nresembling experimentally determined structures. By comparing a realistic model\nto a commonly used montmorillonite clay model, we demonstrate that idealised\nmodels feature noticeably different ionic adsorption patterns. We then present\nan application of ClayCode to the study the competitive barium and sodium\nadsorption on Wyoming montmorillonite, Georgia kaolinite, and Montana illite,\nof interest in the context of nuclear waste disposal.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
