We propose an inexact Newton\nlinearization of the optimality conditions. Upon discretization by a finite\nelement scheme, we obtain a sequence of large symmetric linear systems of\nsaddle-point type. We use an augmented Lagrangian-based block triangular\npreconditioner in combination with the flexible GMRES method at each Newton\nstep. The preconditioner is applied inexactly via a suitable multigrid solver.\nNumerical experiments indicate that the resulting method appears to be fairly\nrobust with respect to viscosity, mesh size, and the choice of regularization\nparameter when applied to 2D problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
