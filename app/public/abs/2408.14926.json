Upon a Sequential Quadratic Programming\nlinearization of the optimization problem, we devise appropriate time-stepping\nschemes and discrete approximations of the cost functionals such that the\ndiscretization and optimization operations are commutative, a highly desirable\nproperty of a discretization of such problems. We formulate the large-scale,\ncoupled linear systems in such a way that efficient preconditioned iterative\nmethods can be applied within a Krylov subspace solver. Numerical experiments\ndemonstrate the viability and efficiency of our approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
