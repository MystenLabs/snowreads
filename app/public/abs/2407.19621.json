For large hypergraphs, it is often difficult to visually detect\nstructures within the data. Recently, a scalable polygon-based visualization\napproach was developed allowing hypergraphs with thousands of hyperedges to be\nsimplified and examined at different levels of detail. However, this approach\nis not guaranteed to eliminate all of the visual clutter caused by unavoidable\noverlaps. Furthermore, meaningful structures can be lost at simplified scales,\nmaking their interpretation unreliable. In this paper, we define hypergraph\nstructures using the bipartite graph representation, allowing us to decompose\nthe hypergraph into a union of structures including topological blocks,\nbridges, and branches, and to identify exactly where unavoidable overlaps must\noccur. We also introduce a set of topology preserving and topology altering\natomic operations, enabling the preservation of important structures while\nreducing unavoidable overlaps to improve visual clarity and interpretability in\nsimplified scales. We demonstrate our approach in several real-world\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
