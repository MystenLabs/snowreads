We consider two\nparity-time ($\\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric linear optical systems consisting of\neither two directly coupled resonators or two finite-length waveguides\nevanescently coupled in parallel. One resonator or waveguide is filled with an\nactive gain medium and the other with a passive loss medium. The light\npropagation is reciprocal in such $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric linear systems\nwithout quantum noise. We show here that light transmission becomes\nnonreciprocal when we include quantum noises in our modeling, which is\nessential for a proper physical description. The quantum nonreciprocity is\nespecially pronounced in the $\\mathcal{PT}$ broken phase. Transmitted light\nintensity in the waveguide of incidence is asymmetric for two waveguides even\nwithout noise. Quantum noise significantly enhances such asymmetry in the\nbroken phase.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
