Beyond its more\n``historical'' interest in the study of atomic physics and quantum optics,\npresently the modeling and studying dissipative phenomena in open quantum\nsystems is pivotal to understanding quantum hardware platforms. While the lack\nof a thermodynamic potential for these out-of-equilibrium open systems makes it\ntheoretically challenging to investigate their physics, at the same time it\nallows going beyond the thermodynamic paradigms and investigating new and\nexotic phenomena. We will focus on one of the simplest, yet most effective,\ndescriptions of open quantum systems, namely the\n(Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-) Lindblad master equation. This phenomenological\napproach describes quantum systems that weakly interact with their surrounding\nenvironment. Although many of the results derived below will apply to any\nquantum system, we will focus in particular on bosonic/spin systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
