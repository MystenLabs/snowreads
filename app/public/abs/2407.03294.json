We conduct\nrigorous convergence analysis for the proposed algorithm and demonstrate its\nessential roles in solving some important classes of constrained convex\noptimization. To get a feasible initial point to execute the algorithm, we also\npresent and analyze a highly efficient semismooth Newton method for computing\nthe projection onto the generalized simplex. The excellent practical\nperformance of the proposed algorithms is demonstrated by a set of extensive\nnumerical experiments. Our theoretical and numerical results further motivate\nthe potential applications of the considered model and the proposed algorithms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
