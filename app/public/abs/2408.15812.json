Math. Sci., 15 (2017), 1265--1323] through micro-macro-analysis\nof the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fokker-Planck system.Due to lack of stress\ndiffusion, the problems considered here are very difficult. Exploiting tools\nfrom harmonic analysis,notably the Littlewood Paley theory,we first establish\nthe global well-posedness and time-decay rates for solutions of the model with\nsmall initial data in Besov spaces with critical regularity.Then, through\ndeeply exploring and fully utilizing the structure of the perturbation\nsystem,we obtain the global well-posedness and exponential decay rates for\nsolutions of the model with small initial data in the Soboles spaces\n$H^3(\\mathbb{T}^d)$.Our obtained results improve considerably the recent\nresults by Lu, Pokorn\\'{y} [Anal. Theory Appl., 36 (2020), 348--372],Wang, Wen\n[Math. Models Methods Appl. Sci., 30 (2020), 139--179],and Liu, Lu, Wen [SIAM\nJ. Math.
