We\npropose an alternative approach which allows us to settle the conjecture for\nthis class in all dimensions in a uniform way. We also demonstrate that an\nalternative approach was indeed needed for the low dimensions. Finally, with\nthis alternative method it is possible to solely use illuminating sets which\nconsist of pairs of opposite directions; we thus also answer a question by\nLassak, who has suggested this may be possible for any origin-symmetric convex\nbody. As a consequence of this, we can also confirm the X-ray conjecture by\nBezdek and Zamfirescu for all 1-symmetric convex bodies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
