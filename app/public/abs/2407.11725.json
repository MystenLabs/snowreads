It aims to estimate an unknown sensitivity\ndistribution based on the outcomes of binary trials. Officially recognized by\nthe U.S. Department of Defense, the procedure is widely used both in civil and\nmilitary industry. It first provides an experimental design for how the binary\ntrials should be conducted, and then estimates the sensitivity distribution via\nmaximum likelihood under a simple parametric model like logistic or probit\nregression. Despite its popularity and longevity, little is known about the\nstatistical properties of the Langlie procedure, but it is well-established\nthat the sequence of inputs tend to narrow in on the median of the sensitivity\ndistribution. For this reason, the U.S. Department of Defense's protocol\ndictates that the procedure is only appropriate for estimating the median of\nthe distribution, and no other quantiles. This begs the question of whether the\nparametric model assumption can be disposed of altogether, potentially making\nthe Langlie procedure entirely nonparametric, much like the Robbins-Monro\nprocedure. In this paper we answer this question in the negative by proving\nthat when the Langlie procedure is employed, the sequence of inputs converges\nwith probability zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CmoTalszLBEBcGHFZNoA-ALQkT7a8eYWhXsbfboiI_s","pdfSize":"382227"}
