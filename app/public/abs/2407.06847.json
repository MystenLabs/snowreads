Certain such\nmodeling operations, or applications of those models, involve multiplications\nof those directional quantities, which can also be expressed conveniently in\nthe SHD through coupling coefficients known as Gaunt coefficients. Since the\ndefinition and notation of Gaunt coefficients varies across acoustical\npublications, this work defines them based on established conventions of\ncomplex and real spherical harmonics (SHs) along with a convenient matrix form\nfor spherical multiplication of directionally band-limited spherical functions.\nAdditionally, the report provides a derivation of the Gaunt coefficients for\nreal SHs, which has been missing from the literature and can be used directly\nin spatial audio frameworks such as Ambisonics. Matlab code is provided that\ncan compute all coefficients up to user specified SH orders. Finally, a number\nof relevant acoustical processing examples from the literature are presented,\nfollowing the matrix formalism of coefficients introduced in the report.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
