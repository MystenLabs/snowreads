Only a specific subset of the users, called covert users, needs their\ncommunication to remain undetected to the warden, while the remaining\nnon-covert users have no such constraint. The fundamental limits show a\ntradeoff between the different rates that are simultaneously achievable at the\nvarious users in function of the secret-key rates that the different users\nshare with the legitimate receiver. Interestingly, the presence of the\nnon-covert users can enhance the capacities of the covert users, especially\nunder stringent secret-key budgets. Our findings underscore the essential\nrequirement of employing a multiplexing (coded time-sharing) strategy to\nexhaust the fundamental region of all rates that are simultaneously achievable\nat the covert and the non-covert users. As a side-product of our results, we\nalso establish the covert-capacity secret-key tradeoff for standard single-user\nand multi-access covert communication systems (without non-covert users), i.e.,\nthe largest covert rates that are achievable under given secret-key rate\nbudgets. Previous works had only established the minimum secret-key rates\nrequired at largest covert rates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
