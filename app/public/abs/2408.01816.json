Imposing structural constraints on the separating subsets is often\nnecessary for practical purposes and leads to a number of fascinating (and, in\nsome cases, already classical) graph-theoretic problems.\n  In this work, we are interested in separating the vertices of a random graph\nby path-connected vertex sets $V_1,\\ldots,V_k$, jointly forming a separating\nsystem. First, we determine the size of the smallest separating system of\n$G(n,p)$ when $np\\to \\infty$ up to lower order terms, and exhibit a threshold\nphenomenon around the sharp threshold for connectivity. Second, we show that\nrandom regular graphs of sufficiently high degree can typically be optimally\nseparated by $\\lceil \\log_2 n\\rceil$ sets. Moreover, we provide bounds for the\nminimum degree threshold for optimal separation of general graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
