After collecting the public posts of around 5000 profiles from\nDisqus and Twitter, we analyze their posts to match their profiles across the\ntwo platforms. We pursue both temporal and non-temporal methods in our\nanalysis. While neither approach proves definitively superior, the temporal\napproach generally performs better. We found that the temporal window size\ninfluences results more than the shifting amount. On the other hand, our\nsentiment analysis shows that the inclusion of sentiment makes little\ndifference, probably due to flawed data extraction methods. We also\nexperimented with a distance-based reward-and-punishment-focused scoring model,\nwhich achieved an accuracy of 24.198% and an average rank of 158.217 out of\n2525 in our collected corpus. Future work includes refining sentiment analysis\nby evaluating sentiments per topic, extending temporal analysis with additional\nphases, and improving the scoring model through weight adjustments and modified\nrewards.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
