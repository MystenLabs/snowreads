We estimate the number of points $\\underline{x}$\nin $\\mathbb{F}_q^n$ such that each value $f_i(\\underline{x})$ is a nonzero\nsquare in $\\mathbb{F}_q$. The error term is especially small when the $f_i$\ndefine smooth projective quadrics with nonsingular intersections. We improve\nthe error term in a recent work by Asgarli--Yip on mutual position of smooth\nquadrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
