Modern\napproaches to testing in cross-sectionally correlated panels are discussed,\npreceding the analysis with an analysis of independent panels. In addition,\nmethods for testing in the case of non-linearity in the data (for example, in\nthe case of structural breaks) are presented, as well as methods for testing in\nshort panels, when the time dimension is small and finite. In conclusion, links\nto existing packages that allow implementing some of the described methods are\nprovided.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
