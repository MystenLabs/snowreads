We show how this matching enables a calculation of the local\nWilson coefficients of the effective action. We provide several examples in\nstring theory. Moreover, we discuss the matching conditions within the context\nof the swampland program.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
