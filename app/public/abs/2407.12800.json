Traditionally, a driving\ngoal of digital storytelling is the generation of dramatic stories with human\nsignificance, but for learning purposes, the need for drama is complemented by\nthe requirement of achieving particular learning outcomes. This paper presents\na narrative engine that supports emergent storytelling to support the\ndevelopment of complex competences in the learning domains of project\nmanagement and innovation. The approach is based on the adaptation on the\nFabula model combined with cases representing situated contexts associated to\nparticular competences. These cases are then triggered to influence the\nunfolding of the story such that a learner encounters dramatic points in the\nnarrative where the associated competences need to be used. In addition to the\ndescription of the approach and corresponding narrative engine, an illustration\nis presented of how the competence 'conflict management' influences a story.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ikFjUy3OXPLaX9WdJbwCWPecUEnLwzZV82nVohF2guQ","pdfSize":"390948"}
