This variability can induce\ndistribution shifts in the data $X$ and in the biomedical variables of interest\n$y$, thus limiting the application of supervised machine learning (ML)\nalgorithms. While domain adaptation (DA) methods have been developed to\nmitigate the impact of these shifts, such methods struggle when distribution\nshifts occur simultaneously in $X$ and $y$. As state-of-the-art ML models for\nEEG represent the data by spatial covariance matrices, which lie on the\nRiemannian manifold of Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrices, it is\nappealing to study DA techniques operating on the SPD manifold. This paper\nproposes a novel method termed Geodesic Optimization for Predictive Shift\nAdaptation (GOPSA) to address test-time multi-source DA for situations in which\nsource domains have distinct $y$ distributions. GOPSA exploits the geodesic\nstructure of the Riemannian manifold to jointly learn a domain-specific\nre-centering operator representing site-specific intercepts and the regression\nmodel. We performed empirical benchmarks on the cross-site generalization of\nage-prediction models with resting-state EEG data from a large multi-national\ndataset (HarMNqEEG), which included $14$ recording sites and more than $1500$\nhuman participants. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, our results showed\nthat GOPSA achieved significantly higher performance on three regression\nmetrics ($R^2$, MAE, and Spearman's $\\rho$) for several source-target site\ncombinations, highlighting its effectiveness in tackling multi-source DA with\npredictive shifts in EEG data analysis. Our method has the potential to combine\nthe advantages of mixed-effects modeling with machine learning for biomedical\napplications of EEG, such as multicenter clinical trials.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
