Using the\nNobeyama Radio Observatory 45-m telescope, we conducted large-scale,\nhigh-sensitivity imaging observations in molecular lines including SiO\n$J$=2$-$1 and CS $J$=2$-$1. By identifying SiO-emitting clouds and examining\ntheir intensity ratios relative to the other molecular lines, we unveiled a\nparabolic-like trend showing lower ratios near the Galactic nucleus, Sgr A$^*$,\nwith gradual increases toward the edges of the CMZ. This pattern suggests a\npossible outburst of the nucleus within the last $\\sim 10^5$ yr, which may have\npropagated through the entire CMZ with strong shocks. Alternatively, the\nobserved trend may also be attributed to the destruction of small dust grains\nby high-energy photons. Our results can potentially lead to a new perspective\non the history of nuclear activity and its impact on the surrounding molecular\nenvironment.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
