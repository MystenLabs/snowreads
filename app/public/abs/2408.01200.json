However, previous\nwork has shown that these models are susceptible to attacks that manipulate\ninput data or exploit noise in quantum circuits. Following this, various\nstudies have explored the robustness of these models. These works focus on the\nrobustness certification of manipulations of the quantum states. We extend this\nline of research by investigating the robustness against perturbations in the\nclassical data for a general class of data encoding schemes. We show that for\nsuch schemes, the addition of suitable noise channels is equivalent to\nevaluating the mean value of the noiseless classifier at the smoothed data,\nakin to Randomized Smoothing from classical machine learning. Using our general\nframework, we show that suitable additions of phase-damping noise channels\nimprove empirical and provable robustness for the considered class of encoding\nschemes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A7YL5fnEAJstQL_hj-lMwaUSwjeCNHghsP92muDhOQg","pdfSize":"749973","txDigest":"Py28cYCgx2KKmcy852RTZ7ZRDtBVin3itpLc2aEENQa","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
