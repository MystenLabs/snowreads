Despite emerging regulations addressing fairness of automated\nsystems, unfairness issues in graph collaborative filtering remain\nunderexplored, especially from the consumer's perspective. Despite numerous\ncontributions on consumer unfairness, only a few of these works have delved\ninto GNNs. A notable gap exists in the formalization of the latest mitigation\nalgorithms, as well as in their effectiveness and reliability on cutting-edge\nmodels. This paper serves as a solid response to recent research highlighting\nunfairness issues in graph collaborative filtering by reproducing one of the\nlatest mitigation methods. The reproduced technique adjusts the system fairness\nlevel by learning a fair graph augmentation. Under an experimental setup based\non 11 GNNs, 5 non-GNN models, and 5 real-world networks across diverse domains,\nour investigation reveals that fair graph augmentation is consistently\neffective on high-utility models and large datasets. Experiments on the\ntransferability of the fair augmented graph open new issues for future\nrecommendation studies.
