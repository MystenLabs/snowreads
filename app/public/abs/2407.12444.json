It used functional data\nobtained from continuously sampled cyclic long-memory stochastic processes to\nsimultaneously estimate their parameters. However, the majority of applications\ndeal with discretely sampled processes or time series. This paper extends the\napproach to accommodate discrete-time scenarios. It proves that the new\ndiscrete estimates exhibit analogous properties to the continuous case and are\nstrongly consistent with the same rates of convergence. The numerical study\nresults are presented to illustrate the theoretical findings and to indicate\nthe sampling rates and resolution levels required for accurate estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
