Earlier work of Herr-Ionescu-Kenig-Koch established\nwell-posedness with data in $L^2$, by using a discretized gauge transform in\nthe setting of Bourgain spaces. In this article, we remain in the simpler\nfunctional setting of Sobolev spaces, and instead combine a pseudodifferential\ngauge transform, a paradifferential normal form, and a variable coefficient\nStrichartz analysis to establish well-posedness in negative-exponent Sobolev\nspaces. Our result coincides with the classical well-posedness results obtained\nat the Benjamin-Ono and KdV endpoints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
