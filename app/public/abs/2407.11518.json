The\ntransport map is constructed through an optimization problem described by the\nMaximum Mean Discrepancy loss function, which matches the expectation\ninformation of the approximated posterior and reference posterior. The proposed\nmethod inherits the accurate estimation of the posterior distribution from\nparticle filtering. To improve the robustness of Maximum Mean Discrepancy, a\nvariance penalty term is used to guide the optimization. It prioritizes\nminimizing the discrepancy between the expectations of highly informative\nstatistics for the approximated and reference posteriors. The penalty term\nsignificantly enhances the robustness of the proposed method and leads to a\nbetter approximation of the posterior. A few numerical examples are presented\nto illustrate the advantage of the proposed method over the ensemble Kalman\nfilter.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
