Implementing network probes in software using general-purpose\noperating systems has been made possible by advances in packet-capture\ntechnologies, such as kernel-bypass frameworks, and by multi-queue adapters\ndesigned to distribute the network workload in multi-core processors. Modern\nSmartNICs, in addition, have introduced stateful mechanisms to associate\nactions to network flows such as forwarding packets or updating traffic\nstatistics for an individual flow. In this paper, we describe our experience in\nexploiting those functionalities in a modern network probe and we perform a\ndetailed study of the performance characteristics under different scenarios.\nCompared to pure CPU-based solutions, SmartNICs with flow-offload technologies\nprovide substantial benefits when implementing forwarding applications.\nHowever, the main limitation of having to keep large flow tables in the host\nmemory remains largely unsolved for realistic monitoring and security\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
