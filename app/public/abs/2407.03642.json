Under similar assumptions as in the finite horizon\ngame, we prove existence and uniqueness of solutions for the extended infinite\nhorizon game. The key idea is to construct local versions of the previously\nconsidered stable topologies. Further, we analyze how sequences of finite\nhorizon games approximate the infinite horizon one. Under a weakened\nLasry-Lions monotonicity condition, we can quantify the convergence rate of\nsolutions for the finite horizon games to the one for the infinite horizon game\nusing a novel stability result for mean field games. Lastly, applying our\nresults allows to solve the invariant mean field game as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
