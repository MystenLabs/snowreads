This study leverages the concept of the Stixel-World to\nrecognize a medium level representation of its surroundings. Our network\ndirectly predicts a 2D multi-layer Stixel-World and is capable of recognizing\nand locating multiple, superimposed objects within an image. Due to the\nscarcity of comparable works, we have divided the capabilities into modules and\npresent a free space detection in our experiments section. Furthermore, we\nintroduce an improved method for generating Stixels from LiDAR data, which we\nuse as ground truth for our network.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zZXQpp0cn1xt7nJsdC7H9P_Sgd5bf9AmJVu-8blJYPI","pdfSize":"18138164","objectId":"0xd90acbaa3aafdfe460ccbe2e46e8f8d2bc24799d24804962ef74110194ade3dc","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
