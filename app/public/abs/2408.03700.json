Here we study the dynamics of the entanglement entropy under quantum\njumps that induce local particle losses in a model of free fermions with\nhopping and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ pairing. We explore the different steady-state\nentanglement regimes by interpolating between monitored free fermions with U(1)\nsymmetry and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ fermions. In the absence of pairing, the U(1)\nsymmetric model approaches the vacuum at long times, with the entanglement\nentropy showing non-monotonic behavior over time that we capture with a\nphenomenological quasiparticle ansatz. In this regime, quantum jumps play a key\nrole, and we highlight this by exactly computing their waiting-time\ndistribution. On the other hand, the interplay between losses and pairing in\nthe $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ case gives rise to quantum trajectories with entangled\nsteady-states. We show that by tuning the several system parameters, a\nmeasurement-induced entanglement transition occurs where the entanglement\nentropy scaling changes from logarithmic to area-law. We compare this\ntransition with the one derived in the no-click limit and observe qualitative\nagreement in most of the phase diagram. Furthermore, the statistics of\nentanglement gain and loss are analyzed to better understand the impact of the\nlinear jump operators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a2J8TNiXpTfEPKOk61oHonEC6zDDo1TMTw0_VVkpd3A","pdfSize":"2025791"}
