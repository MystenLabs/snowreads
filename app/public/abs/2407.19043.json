However, developing a quantitative and comprehensive\ntheory for strain-induced amorphization remains challenging due to the complex\nnature of microstructural evolutions and deformation mechanisms. We propose a\nphase field model coupled with elastic-plastic theory to study the\nstrain-induced amorphization in nanocrystalline materials. The plastic\nbehaviors of crystalline phases and amorphous phases are coupled with phase\nevolutions by finite strain theory through the strain energy. This coupled\nmodel enables to quantitatively explore the effects of various defects on\nformation of amorphous phases such as shear bands. Simulations using our model\npredict that amorphous nucleation follows the martensitic transformation, and\noccurs primarily within localized regions of high stress, including shear\nbands. Our results also indicate an increase in the critical plastic strain for\namorphization as the grain size increases. These findings align well with\nexperimental results, validating the proposed model in capturing key features\nof deformation-induced amorphization. Our work provides valuable insights into\ndeformation-induced amorphization and serves as a basis for developing more\nquantitative models with complex microscopic mechanisms.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
