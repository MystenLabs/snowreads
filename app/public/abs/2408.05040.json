Previous BO implementations, for example as they\nexist in the literature or software, require substantial adaptation for\neffective real-world deployment in chemical industry. BoFire provides a rich\nfeature-set with extensive configurability and realizes our vision of\nfast-tracking research contributions into industrial use via maintainable\nopen-source software. Owing to quality-of-life features like\nJSON-serializability of problem formulations, BoFire enables seamless\nintegration of BO into RESTful APIs, a common architecture component for both\nself-driving laboratories and human-in-the-loop setups. This paper discusses\nthe differences between BoFire and other BO implementations and outlines ways\nthat BO research needs to be adapted for real-world use in a chemistry setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BZKNuzxwOc755HH2OkR3Ef3bavaIH-6TmMZivFmQEGM","pdfSize":"117088"}
