The\nsolution is exemplified with a running scenario with household kitchen robots.\nThe robot uses planning to find sequences of actions that must be performed in\norder to gracefully cancel a previously received command. The Planning Domain\nDefinition Language (PDDL) is used to write a domain to model kitchen\nactivities and behaviours, and this domain is enriched with knowledge from\nonline ontologies and knowledge graphs, like DBPedia. We discuss the results\nobtained in different scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vtQrVBVj8szfy-pm1QyDCbW5ZAzaf01XgcTllvFdpeM","pdfSize":"329093"}
