The RIAs are easier to\nidentify and widely used in practice. Applied researchers often interpret RIA\nestimates as if they were the natural effects, even though the RIAs could be\npoor proxies for the natural effects. This calls for practical and theoretical\nguidance on when the RIAs differ from or coincide with the natural effects,\nwhich this paper aims to address. We develop a novel empirical test for the\ndivergence between the RIAs and the natural effects under the weak assumptions\nsufficient for identifying the RIAs and illustrate the test using the Moving to\nOpportunity Study. We also provide new theoretical insights on the relationship\nbetween the RIAs and the natural effects from a covariance perspective and a\nstructural equation perspective. Additionally, we discuss previously\nundocumented connections between the natural effects, the RIAs, and estimands\nin instrumental variable analysis and Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney tests.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kcIiDmZIha8G10mT2mKz5nIL4m2CY9-CEXpO5wURyt8","pdfSize":"551263"}
