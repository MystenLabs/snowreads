The population is modeled by a graph $H$ where vertices\nrepresent individuals and edges exist between individuals with close\nconnections. Our objective is to clear the population of infection while\nminimizing the maximum number of immunizations that occur at each time-step. We\nprove that this minimum is bounded above by a natural function of the pathwidth\nof $H$. In addition to our general results, we also focus on the case where the\nlatency and protective periods last for one time-step. In this case, we\ncharacterize graphs that require only one immunization per time-step, provide a\nuseful tool for proving lower bounds, and show that, for any tree $T$, there is\na subdivision of $T$ that requires at most two immunizations per time-step.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
