Let $G$ be\na planar $st$-graph and let $S \\subset \\mathbb{R}^2$ be a pointset with $|S|=\n|V(G)|$. An UPSE of $G$ on $S$ is an upward planar straight-line drawing of $G$\nthat maps the vertices of $G$ to the points of $S$. We consider both the\nproblem of testing the existence of an UPSE of $G$ on $S$ (UPSE Testing) and\nthe problem of enumerating all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$. We prove that UPSE Testing\nis NP-complete even for $st$-graphs that consist of a set of directed\n$st$-paths sharing only $s$ and $t$. On the other hand, for $n$-vertex planar\n$st$-graphs whose maximum $st$-cutset has size $k$, we prove that it is\npossible to solve UPSE Testing in $O(n^{4k})$ time with $O(n^{3k})$ space, and\nto enumerate all UPSEs of $G$ on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(k\nn^{4k} \\log n)$ space, after $O(k n^{4k} \\log n)$ set-up time. Moreover, for an\n$n$-vertex $st$-graph whose underlying graph is a cycle, we provide a necessary\nand sufficient condition for the existence of an UPSE on a given poinset, which\ncan be tested in $O(n \\log n)$ time. Related to this result, we give an\nalgorithm that, for a set $S$ of $n$ points, enumerates all the non-crossing\nmonotone Hamiltonian cycles on $S$ with $O(n)$ worst-case delay, using $O(n^2)$\nspace, after $O(n^2)$ set-up time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
