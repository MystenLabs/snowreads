Here, locally noetherian means that any object is the\ndirected union of its noetherian subobjects. For a quiver to be left noetherian\nmeans that the left ideals of paths starting at any fixed vertex satisfy the\nascending chain condition. The proof generalises to representations of any\nsmall category that admits a Gr\\\"obner enrichment.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v0P4cMqtZUYY2zDiOfkI7R9Nd0--sKRm2oB16g6mIhM","pdfSize":"173679"}
