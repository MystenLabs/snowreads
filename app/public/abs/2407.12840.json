It replaces the concept of a topological space by that of a\ncondensed set, which can be defined as a sheaf for the coherent topology on a\ncertain category of compact Hausdorff spaces. In this case, the sheaf condition\nhas a fairly simple explicit description, which arises from studying the\nrelationship between the coherent, regular and extensive topologies. In this\npaper, we establish this relationship under minimal assumptions on the\ncategory, going beyond the case of compact Hausdorff spaces. Along the way, we\nalso provide a characterizations of sheaves and covering sieves for these\ncategories. All results in this paper have been fully formalized in the Lean\nproof assistant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
