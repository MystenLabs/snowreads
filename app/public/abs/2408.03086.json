One useful tool to describe them is the so-called Choi\nisomorphism, which maps completely positive transformations to positive\nsemi-definite matrices. Accordingly, there are numerous proposals to generalize\nthe Choi isomorphism. In the present paper, we show that the 1976 paper of\nGorini, Kossakowski and Sudarshan (GKS) already holds the key for a further\ngeneralization and study the resulting GKS isomorphism. As an application, we\ncompute the GKS matrix of the time evolution of a general open quantum system\nup to second order in time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r4l7PGfGkxndVt1SyRocKgIuFZIXlVegN0V3e1rlazM","pdfSize":"307635"}
