Tree-level\nand one-loop contributions of the mediator's decay into a top-antitop quark\npair in two-, three-, and four-top quarks production processes are calculated.\nA significant contribution from diagrams involving the dark matter mediator is\ndemonstrated in the total cross section for three- and four-top quark\nproduction processes, taking into account current experimental limits on model\nparameters. The perspective of searching for dark matter mediators in the\nprocesses under consideration is determined by the ability to reconstruct the\nfinal state with modern collider detectors and the experimental sensitivity\nthat has already been achieved for such rare events.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
