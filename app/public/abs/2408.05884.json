Unlike\ncentralized approaches, which rely on a single entity for decision-making,\nMADRL empowers individual network nodes to autonomously learn and optimize\ntheir MAC based on local observations. Leveraging ns3-ai and RLlib, as far as\nwe are aware of, our framework is the first of a kind that enables distributed\nmulti-agent learning within the ns-3 environment, facilitating the design and\nsynthesis of adaptive MAC protocols tailored to specific environmental\nconditions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the MADRL MAC framework through\nextensive simulations, showcasing superior performance compared to legacy\nprotocols across diverse scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of\nMADRL-based MAC protocols to significantly enhance Quality of Service (QoS)\nrequirements for future wireless applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
