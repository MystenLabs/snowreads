As an application, we deduce--via a variant of\nFurstenberg's correspondence principle--that for fields of characteristic zero,\nany \"large\" set $E\\subset K$ contains \"many\" patterns of the form\n$\\{p(x)+y,xy\\}$, for every non-constant polynomial $p(x)\\in K[x]$.\n  Our methods are flexible enough that they allow us to recover analogous\ndensity results in the setting of finite fields and, with the aid of a new\nfinitistic variant of Bergelson's \"colouring trick\", show that for $r\\in\n\\mathbb{N}$ fixed, any $r-$colouring of a large enough finite field will\ncontain monochromatic patterns of the form $\\{x,p(x)+y,xy\\}$.\n  In a different direction, we obtain a double ergodic theorem for actions of\nthe affine group of a countable field. An adaptation of the argument for affine\nactions of finite fields leads to a generalisation of a theorem of Shkredov.\nFinally, to highlight the utility of the aforementioned finitistic \"colouring\ntrick\", we provide a conditional, elementary generalisation of Green and\nSanders' $\\{x,y,x+y,xy\\}$ theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
