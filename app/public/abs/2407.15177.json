Another\ntrend in this area is the increased use of wireless communication, offering a\nhigh flexibility, modularity, and reduced installation and maintenance efforts.\nThis work presents a testbed implementation that integrates a wireless\nframework, employing IO-Link Wireless (IOLW) and a private 5G cellular network,\nto orchestrate a complete example process from sensors and actuators up into\nthe edge, represented by a programmable logic controller (PLC). Latency\nassessments identify the systems cycle time as well as opportunities for\nimprovement. A worst-case estimation shows the attainable safety function\nresponse time for practical applications in the context of functional safety.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
