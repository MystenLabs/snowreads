To determine the oxygen abundance, we apply\nthe direct Te method for objects where the [OIII]4363 line is detected. We\nidentified 21 extremely metal-poor galaxies in the early data release of the\nDark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI EDR), for some of which we also\nderived N/O, Ne/O, Ar/O, and S/O ratios. We find that many DESI galaxies with\nextremely low oxygen abundance exhibit a higher N/O ratio in comparison to the\nreference low-metallicity sample collected from the literature. We suggest that\nthe elevation in N/O ratio may be explained by a contamination with metal-rich\ngas caused by gas inflow or a merger event. Moreover, contrary to some recent\nstudies, we find that Ar/O and S/O ratios are enhanced as well, while the Ne/O\nratio does not show such elevation. One of the galaxies, J0713+5608, has a\nremarkably low oxygen abundance of 6.978$\\pm$0.095 dex. This measurement aligns\nwith the lowest known oxygen abundances in galaxies to date. Given the\nrelatively high uncertainty, this galaxy may have the lowest oxygen abundance\never found. Additionally, J0713+5608 exhibited an enhanced N/O ratio compared\nto the typical N/O ratio observed in metal-poor galaxies within the local\nUniverse.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
