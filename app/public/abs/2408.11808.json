Distance correlation, a recently popular dependence measure, is\nuniversally consistent for testing independence against all distributions with\nfinite moments. However, when data are subject to selection bias or collected\nfrom multiple sources or schemes, spurious dependence may arise. This creates a\nneed for methods that can effectively utilize data from different sources and\ncorrect these biases. In this paper, we study the estimation of distance\ncovariance and distance correlation under multiple biased sampling models,\nwhich provide a natural framework for addressing these issues. Theoretical\nproperties, including the strong consistency and asymptotic null distributions\nof the distance covariance and correlation estimators, and the rate at which\nthe test statistic diverges under sequences of alternatives approaching the\nnull, are established. A weighted permutation procedure is proposed to\ndetermine the critical value of the independence test. Simulation studies\ndemonstrate that our approach improves both the estimation of distance\ncorrelation and the power of the test.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wvqx440rvO4KBnmtOoYCShjIYHiy8h9LWWKkhCtTFbQ","pdfSize":"501675"}
