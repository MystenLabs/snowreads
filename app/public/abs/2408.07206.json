The primary\ncontribution of this article is to show the equivalence of these two\napproaches, which in turn shows that the results known for the moving\nframe-based description transfer to the model utilizing spherical coordinates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
