We identify and analyze\ntwo types of uncertainty -- temporal and spatial -- and discuss their system\nimplications. To address the temporal dynamics in quantifying uncertainty for\ncarbon intensity forecasting, we introduce a conformal prediction-based\nframework. Evaluation results show that our technique robustly achieves target\ncoverages in uncertainty quantification across various significance levels. We\nconduct two case studies using production power traces, focusing on temporal\nand spatial load shifting respectively. The results show that incorporating\nuncertainty into scheduling decisions can prevent a 5% and 14% increase in\ncarbon emissions, respectively. These percentages translate to an absolute\nreduction of 2.1 and 10.4 tons of carbon emissions in a 20 MW datacenter\ncluster.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
