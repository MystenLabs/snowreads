The\nantiferromagnetic order and the Fermi-liquid behavior are simultaneously\nsuppressed at a critical pressure, $P_c =10$ GPa, signature of a quantum\ncritical point, which supports a Kondo lattice scenario and raises the question\nwhether, in the paramagnetic phase at higher pressures, the heavy\nquasiparticles survive or form a non-Fermi liquid phase governed by the Kondo\ninteraction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
