These are hidden quantum processes where the hidden processes\nthemselves exhibit entangled Markov process, and the observable processes also\nexhibit entanglement. We present a specific formula for the joint expectation\nof these processes. Furthermore, we discuss the recurrence of the underlying\nquantum Markov processes associated to the Bi-entangled hidden Markov processes\nand we establish that, by restricting them within suitable commutative\nsubalgebras (diagonal subalgebras) leads to the recovery of Markov processes\ndefined by the hidden stochastic matrix. In this paper we only deal with\nprocesses with an at most countable state space.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
