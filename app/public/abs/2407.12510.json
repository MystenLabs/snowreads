If $M$ is\nconnected and $\\dim(M)\\geq 2$, the group of diffeomorphisms of $M$, that are\nisotopic to the identity through a compactly supported isotopy, acts\n$n$-transitively on $M$, for any $n$. In this paper, we prove a version of the\n$n$-transitivity result for the group of equivariant diffeomorphisms of $M$. As\na corollary we obtain a result concerning diffeomorphisms of the orbit space\n$M/G$. A special case of the result for orbit spaces gives an $n$-transitivity\nresult for orbifold diffeomorphisms that was earlier proved by F. Pasquotto and\nT. O.
