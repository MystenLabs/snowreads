Since our approach is based on an\neffective ensemble in a bosonic configuration space, it does not increase the\ncomputational complexity beyond the usual fermion sign problem. Its application\nto inhomogeneous cases such as an electronic system in a fixed external ion\npotential is straightforward and opens up the enticing possibility to benchmark\ndensity functional theory and other existing methods. Finally, it is not\nlimited to warm dense matter, and can be applied to a gamut of other systems\nsuch ultracold atoms and electrons in quantum dots.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
