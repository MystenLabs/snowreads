In the targeted energy or electron\ntransfer dimer model this is accomplished through the implementation of\nnonlinear oscillators with opposing types of nonlinearities, one attractive\nwhile the second repulsive. In the present work we show that this resonant\nbehavior survives if we take into account the vibrational degrees of freedom as\nwell. After giving a summary on the basic formalism of chemical reactions we\nshow that resonant electron transfer can be assisted by vibrations. We find the\ncondition for this efficient transfer and show that in the case of additional\ninteraction with noise a distinct non-Arrhenius behavior develops that is\nmarkedly different from the usual Kramers-like activated transfer.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LzwJTiY2uwH9bZnKCWeHtUasTNl2lsiOhPkB9NpvIIQ","pdfSize":"6479978","objectId":"0x115992cdec6c53f630e5c764ce19caa16516ba259f19268251a33be758a6d7e6","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
