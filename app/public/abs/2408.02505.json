It was recently suggested that magnetic reconnection may\nbe responsible for driving the sub-ion scale cascade, and that this process\nwould be characterized by a direct energy transfer towards even smaller scales\n(until dissipation), and a simultaneous inverse transfer of energy towards\nlarger scales, until the ion break. Here we employ the space-filter technique\non high-resolution 2D3V hybrid-Vlasov simulations of continuously driven\nturbulence providing for the first time quantitative evidence that magnetic\nreconnection is indeed able to trigger a dual energy transfer originating at\nsub-ion scales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UFaxJDpu_EeJwGIXZH2lfwdqBC-EfmgxEtOAPXvL6XQ","pdfSize":"14498335"}
