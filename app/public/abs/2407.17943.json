Symmetry reduction in\ncertain gauge theories is a common tool for obtaining explicit soliton\nsolutions. Although pure Chern-Simons theories do not admit solitonic\nsolutions, symmetry reduction still leads to interesting results. We establish\nrelations at the semiclassical regime between pure Chern-Simons theories on\n$S^3$ and the reduced Quantum Field Theories, based on actions obtained by the\nsymmetry reduction of the Chern-Simons action, spherical symmetry being the\nprominent one. We also discuss symmetry reductions of Chern-Simons theories on\nthe disk, yielding $BF$-theory in two dimensions, which signals a curious\nrelationship between symmetry reductions and the boundary conformal field\ntheories. Finally, we study the Chern-Simons-Higgs instantons and show that\nunder certain circumstances, the reduced action can formally be viewed as the\naction of a supersymmetric quantum mechanical model. We discuss the extent to\nwhich the reduced actions have a fermionic nature at the level of the partition\nfunction.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
