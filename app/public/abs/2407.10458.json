Building upon this research, investigators have explored doping\nadditional elements into NCM cathode materials to further enhance their\nelectrochemical performance and structural integrity. However, the multitude of\ndoping strategies available for NCM battery systems presents a challenge in\ndetermining the most effective approach. In this study, we elucidate the\npotential of ternary NCM systems as cathode materials for lithium-ion\nbatteries. We compile a comprehensive database of lithium-ion batteries\nemploying NCM systems from various sources of prior research and develop a\ncorresponding data-driven model utilizing graph neural networks to predict\noptimal doping strategies. Our aim is to provide insights into the NCM-based\nbattery systems for both fundamental understanding and practical applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
