We\ncompare this technique to the standard method of fluorescence imaging and find\nthat it outperforms fluorescence imaging for compact interferometers using\ncondensed atomic sources or where the photon collection efficiency is limited.\nHowever, we find that fluorescence imaging is likely to be the preferred method\nwhen using squeezed atomic sources due to limited atom number.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
