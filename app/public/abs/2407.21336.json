This work\ndemonstrates that introducing suitable random noise can restore the local\nwell-posedness and prevent finite-time blowups. Specifically, random diffusion\naddresses the ill-posedness in certain Gevrey classes, allowing us to establish\nthe local well-posedness almost surely and the global existence of solutions\nwith high probability. In the case of random damping (linear multiplicative\nnoise), the noise prevents analytic solutions from forming singularities in\nfinite time, resulting in globally existing solutions with high probability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
