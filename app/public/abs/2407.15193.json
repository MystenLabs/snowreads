The core of graph Ramsey theory is arrowing: For fixed\ngraphs $F$ and $H$, the $(F, H)$-Arrowing problem asks whether a given graph,\n$G$, has a red/blue coloring of the edges of $G$ such that there are no red\ncopies of $F$ and no blue copies of $H$. For some cases, the problem has been\nshown to be coNP-complete, or solvable in polynomial time. However, a more\nsystematic approach is needed to categorize the complexity of all cases.\n  We focus on $(P_3, H)$-Arrowing as $F = P_3$ is the simplest meaningful case\nfor which the complexity question remains open, and the hardness for this case\nlikely extends to general $(F, H)$-Arrowing for nontrivial $F$. In this\npursuit, we also gain insight into the complexity of a class of matching\nremoval problems, since $(P_3, H)$-Arrowing is equivalent to $H$-free Matching\nRemoval. We show that $(P_3, H)$-Arrowing is coNP-complete for all\n$2$-connected $H$ except when $H = K_3$, in which case the problem is in P. We\nintroduce a new graph invariant to help us carefully combine graphs when\nconstructing the gadgets for our reductions. Moreover, we show how\n$(P_3,H)$-Arrowing hardness results can be extended to other $(F,H)$-Arrowing\nproblems. This allows for more intuitive and palatable hardness proofs instead\nof ad-hoc constructions of SAT gadgets, bringing us closer to categorizing the\ncomplexity of all $(F, H)$-Arrowing problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QR1nfmxNaDGwpZ4GYQGEvbSr17AlxS44RkcVqCL6skI","pdfSize":"1525861"}
