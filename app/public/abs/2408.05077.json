Our focus is on the half-space case with\nhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. This problem is more technically\nchallenging, if compared to the Cauchy or periodic cases, and has not been\npreviously addressed. At present are known a few sub-optimal results obtained\nthrough Morrey embedding results based on conditions for the gradient of the\nvelocity in Sobolev spaces. Moreover, the results in this paper are obtained\nwithout any additional assumption neither on the pressure nor the flux of the\nvelocity, near to the boundary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
