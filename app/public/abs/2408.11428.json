One approach employs large language models (LLMs) to assist developers in\ngenerating Kubernetes manifests; however it is currently impossible to\ndetermine whether the output satisfies given specifications and is\ncomprehensible. In this study, we proposed a benchmarking method for evaluating\nthe effectiveness of LLMs in synthesizing manifests, using the Compose\nspecification -- a standard widely adopted by application developers -- as\ninput. The proposed benchmarking method revealed that LLMs generally produce\naccurate results that compensate for simple specification gaps. However, we\nalso observed that inline comments for readability were often omitted, and\ncompletion accuracy was low for atypical inputs with unclear intentions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bOqMr02IKZfJUqtYS5MFU6t8-q--3rYIBWSkfj7_MHk","pdfSize":"954402"}
