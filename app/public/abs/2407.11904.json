These schemes are\noften built on powerful geometric ideas for broad classes of problems, such as\nHamiltonian or reversible systems. However, there remain difficulties in\ndevising timestepping schemes that conserve non-quadratic invariants or\ndissipation laws. In this work, we propose an approach for the construction of\ntimestepping schemes that preserve dissipation laws and conserve multiple\ngeneral invariants, via finite elements in time and the systematic introduction\nof auxiliary variables. The approach generalises several existing ideas in the\nliterature, including Gauss methods, the framework of Cohen & Hairer, and the\nenergy- and helicity-conserving scheme of Rebholz. We demonstrate the ideas by\ndevising novel arbitrary-order schemes that conserve to machine precision all\nknown invariants of Hamiltonian ODEs, including the Kepler and Kovalevskaya\nproblems, and arbitrary-order schemes for the compressible Navier-Stokes\nequations that conserve mass, momentum, and energy, and provably possess\nnon-decreasing entropy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
