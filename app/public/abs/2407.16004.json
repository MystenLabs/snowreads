We first\nshow that an applied temperature gradient in a 2D collinear honeycomb AFM gives\nrise to accumulations of magnons having both orbital moment and spin moment at\nthe edges of the 2D AFM as the manifestation of the magnon Nernst effects. We\nthen use our formalism to show that such magnon Nernst effects, in the presence\nof the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya Interaction (DMI), induce electric polarization\nthat can be measured experimentally. Finally, we demonstrate the value of this\nformalism by using it to predict the properties of two 2D honeycomb AFMs, one\neach with N\\'eel and zigzag order. These results integrate advances in\nmagnonics, spinorbitronics, and orbitronics to create a unified framework that\ncan be used to understand and control the manipulation of magnetic states in 2D\nAFMs through the magnon spin and orbital degrees of freedom.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
