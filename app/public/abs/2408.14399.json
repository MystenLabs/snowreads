We analyze the system size scaling of conductance at zero temperature for\ndifferent values of the chemical potential of the boundary reservoirs. We\nconsider a variety of loss channel configurations: (i) single loss at the\nmiddle site of the lattice, (ii) multiple but nonextensive lossy channels, and\n(iii) extensive lossy channels. For the cases (i) and (ii), the conductance\nscaling with system size remains robust (i.e., same as the case with no loss)\nfor chemical potential within and outside the lattice band, while at the\nband-edge rich anomalous conductance scaling emerges. For case (iii), the\nconductance scaling becomes ballistic in the thermodynamic limit for any value\nof chemical potential. We explain the emergence of these different system size\nscalings of conductance by analyzing the spectral properties of the associated\nnon-hermitian transfer matrices of the underlying lattice. We demonstrate that\nthe emergence of anomalous scaling is deeply connected to the existence of\nexceptional points of transfer matrices. Our study unravels that by carefully\noptimizing the loss mechanism configurations, one can in principle realize\nsystems with rich transport properties in low-dimensional open quantum systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
