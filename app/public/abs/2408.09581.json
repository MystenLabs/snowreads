In the current paper we study a larger class of\nalgebras with binary operators of possibility and sufficiency, the weak mixed\nalgebras. Furthermore, we develop a system of logic with two binary modalities,\nsound and complete with respect to the class of frames closely related to the\naforementioned algebras, and we prove an embedding theorem which solves an open\nproblem from \"Betweenness algebras\".\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gPliS8fNN4qVi1ZHM1vhBFOMttfE-DWm0ecJOI8ahEs","pdfSize":"384162"}
