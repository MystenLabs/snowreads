JWST enables the search for this beacon\nin the early universe with unprecedented sensitivity. In this work, we extend\nthe study of faint [OIII]$_{5008}$ selected galaxies by an order of magnitude\nin line luminosity. We use publicly available UNCOVER DR1 JWST/NIRCam and HST\nimaging data of the cluster lensing field, Abell 2744, to identify strong\n(rest-frame EW$>500$\\AA) [OIII]$_{5008}$ emitters at $z\\sim7$ based on excess\nF410M flux. We find $N=68$ $z\\sim7$ [OIII] candidates, with a subset of $N=33$\nthat have deep HST coverage required to rule-out lower redshift interlopers\n(13.68 arcmin$^2$ with F814W $5\\sigma$ depth $>28$ AB). Such strong emission\nlines can lead to very red colors that could be misinterpreted as evidence for\nold, massive stellar populations, but are shown to be due to emission lines\nwhere we have spectra. Using this deep HST sample and completeness simulations,\nwhich calculate the effective survey volume of the UNCOVER lensing field as a\nfunction of [OIII] luminosity, we derive a new [OIII] luminosity function (LF)\nextending to $41.09<\\rm{log}_{10}(L/\\rm{erg\\,s}^{-1})<42.35$ which is an order\nof magnitude deeper than previous $z\\sim6$ [OIII] LFs based on JWST slitless\nspectroscopy. This LF is well fit by a power law with a faint-end slope of\n$\\alpha=-2.07^{+0.22}_{-0.23}$. There is little or no evolution between this LF\nand published [OIII] LFs at redshifts $3\\lesssim z\\lesssim7$, and no evidence\nof a turnover at faint luminosities. The sizes of these extreme [OIII] emitters\nare broadly similar to their low redshift counterparts, the green peas. The\nluminosity function of [OIII] emitters matches that of Lyman-$\\alpha$ at the\nbright end, suggesting that many of them should be Lyman-$\\alpha$ emitters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5DJR6lT6El-NJBkEZrwScu5ahpu5qs82QcUbq26xeCg","pdfSize":"2462768","objectId":"0x06f11b4d9851f6ac9a46069250f15b9ae82c1cfc326eca3c934f60e0720473bb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
