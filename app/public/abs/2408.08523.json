This generalizes a\nresult of Lo and Markstr\\\"om on the vertex degree threshold for the existence\nof perfect matchings in 3-partite 3-graphs. In this proof, we use a fractional\nrainbow matching theory obtained by Aharoni et al. to find edge-disjoint\nfractional perfect matching.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
