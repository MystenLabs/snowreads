We show that the first two\nleading terms in this Cardy-like expansion are dictated by the Bethe Ansatz\nformulation of the topologically twisted index of the same theory. We apply\nthis relation to 3d $\\mathcal{N}=2$ holographic superconformal field theories\ndescribing the low-energy dynamics of $N$ M2-branes and derive closed form\nexpressions, valid to all orders in the $1/N$ expansion, for the two leading\nterms in the Cardy-like expansion of the superconformal index. We also discuss\nthe implications of our results for the entropy of supersymmetric Kerr-Newman\nblack holes in AdS$_4$ and the four-derivative corrections to 4d gauged\nsupergravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
