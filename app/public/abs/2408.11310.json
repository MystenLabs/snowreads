Let\n$\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_k$ be positive integers. A sum\n$\\Delta_{\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_k}(x_1,\\dots,x_k)=\\alpha_1\nT(x_1)+\\cdots+\\alpha_k T(x_k)$ of triangular numbers is said to be even\nuniversal if the Diophantine equation\n$\\Delta_{\\alpha_1,\\dots,\\alpha_k}(x_1,\\dots,x_k)=2n$ has an integer solution\n$(x_1,\\dots,x_k)\\in\\mathbb{Z}^k$ for any nonnegative integer $n$. In this\narticle, we classify all even universal sums of triangular numbers.\nFurthermore, we provide an effective criterion on even universality of an\narbitrary sum of triangular numbers, which is a generalization of the\ntriangular theorem of eight of Bosma and Kane.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
