Let $\\ell$ and $p$ be primes which are\ncoprime to $6N_{K/\\mathbb{Q}}({\\mathrm cond}(\\lambda))$. We determine the\n$\\ell$-adic valuation of Hecke $L$-values $L(1,\\lambda\\chi)/\\Omega_K$ as $\\chi$\nvaries over $p$-power order anticyclotomic characters over $K$. As an\napplication, for $p$ inert in $K$, we prove the vanishing of the\n$\\mu$-invariant of Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function, leading to the first results\non the $\\mu$-invariant of imaginary quadratic fields at non-split primes.\n  Our approach and results complement the work of Hida and Finis. The approach\nis rooted in the arithmetic of a CM form on a definite Shimura set.The\napplication to Rubin's $p$-adic $L$-function also relies on the proof of his\nconjecture. Along the way, we present an automorphic view on Rubin's theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
