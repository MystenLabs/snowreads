Current\nresearch includes the use of machine learning to achieve this task. In this\nwork, a comprehensive statistical analysis of nanopore current signals is\nperformed and demonstrated to be sufficient for classifying up to 42 peptides\nwith 70 % accuracy. Two sets of features, the statistical moments and the\ncatch22 set, are compared both in their representations and after training\nsmall classifier neural networks. We demonstrate that complex features of the\nevents, captured in both the catch22 set and the central moments, are key in\nclassifying peptides with otherwise similar mean currents. These results\nhighlight the efficacy of purely statistical analysis of nanopore data and\nsuggest a path forward for more sophisticated classification techniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RkLMR7ADKq-jAv2pHiUIkLWTQjeBdpJJl2Q4T9O-MRc","pdfSize":"3126795"}
