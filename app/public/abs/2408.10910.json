A number of codes exist to\ncalculate neutron yields and energy spectra due to these processes. In this\npaper we present new calculations of neutron production using the modified\nSOURCES4A code with recently updated cross-sections for ($\\alpha,n$) reactions\nand the comparison of the results with available experimental data. The\ncross-sections for ($\\alpha,n$) reactions in SOURCES4 have been taken from\nreliable experimental data where possible, complemented by the calculations\nwith EMPIRE 2.19/3.2.3, TALYS 1.96 or evaluated data library JENDL-5 where the\ndata were scarce or unavailable.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
