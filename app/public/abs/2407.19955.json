Combining mechanical and phenomenological arguments, we\npostulate that the mechanochemical feedback between the local phase, which\ndescribes how cells deform due to autonomous driving, and the local density can\nbe described in terms of a free energy. We argue that such a feedback is\nconsistent with the coarse-graining of a broad class of microscopic models. Our\nhydrodynamics captures the three main states emerging in its particle-based\ncounterparts: a globally cycling state, a homogeneous arrested state with\nconstant phase, and a state with propagating radial waves. Remarkably, we show\nthat the competition between these states can be rationalized intuitively in\nterms of an effective landscape, and argue that waves can be regarded as\nsecondary instabilities. Linear stability analysis of the arrested and cycling\nstates, including the role of fluctuations, leads to predictions for the phase\nboundaries. Overall, our results demonstrate that our minimal, yet non-trivial\nmodel provides a relevant platform to study the rich phenomenology of pulsating\nliquids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
