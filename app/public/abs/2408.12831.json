State-of-the-art\nsampling-based motion planners struggle to scale to high-dimensional\nconfiguration spaces and are inefficient in complex environments. This\ninefficiency arises because these planners utilize either uniform or\nhand-crafted sampling heuristics within the configuration space. To address\nthese challenges, we present the Spatial-informed Motion Planning Network\n(SIMPNet). SIMPNet consists of a stochastic graph neural network (GNN)-based\nsampling heuristic for informed sampling within the configuration space. The\nsampling heuristic of SIMPNet encodes the workspace embedding into the\nconfiguration space through a cross-attention mechanism. It encodes the\nmanipulator's kinematic structure into a graph, which is used to generate\ninformed samples within the framework of sampling-based motion planning\nalgorithms. We have evaluated the performance of SIMPNet using a UR5e robotic\nmanipulator operating within simple and complex workspaces, comparing it\nagainst baseline state-of-the-art motion planners. The evaluation results show\nthe effectiveness and advantages of the proposed planner compared to the\nbaseline planners.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
