Radiation\ndamage in the form of bulk or substrate damage is dependent on the incident\nparticle species and energy. The fluence is therefore often quoted as the 1 MeV\nneutron equivalent fluence, with hardness factors being the scaling quantity.\nThe hardness factor can be determined by analysing the change in the leakage\ncurrent of silicon pad diodes post-irradiation. Using the MC40 cyclotron\nfacility at the University of Birmingham, n-in-p FZ silicon pad diodes were\nirradiated to several fluence points at three different proton beam energies.\nThe hardness factors acquired were 3.07 $\\pm$ 0.37 for 10.5 MeV protons, 2.73\n$\\pm$ 0.27 for 16.4 MeV protons and 2.19 $\\pm$ 0.22 for 24.3 MeV protons. The\nvalue for 16.4 MeV protons agrees with the theoretical predictions, whereas the\nvalues for 10.5 MeV and 24.3 MeV are lower than predicted by the same\ncalculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
