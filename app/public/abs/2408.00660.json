It aspires to\nfabricate intricate microelectronic devices, metamaterials, plasmonic\nstructures and functionalized surfaces. Yet, a major handicap of\ndroplet-confined electrodeposition is the current lack of control over the\nprocess, which is owed to its dynamic nature and the nanoscopic size of the\ninvolved droplets. The deposition current offers itself as an obvious and\nreal-time window into the deposition. Therefore, the current during\ndroplet-confined deposition is analysed. Nucleation and growth dynamics are\nevaluated systematically. Our results indicate different deposition regimes and\nlink current to both volume and morphology of deposited copper. This allows for\noptimized electroplating strategies and to calibrate the slicing algorithms\nnecessary for a controlled deposition of 3D structures. The potential of\nselecting appropriate solvents further readies this novel technique for the\nreliable deposition of functional structures with submicron resolution.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6Ops-dBSY6AzEP8GCZcHVicV67mlLEHCMcyeKyZJ0FI","pdfSize":"47126989","txDigest":"Ar6XjZVaXjxiNw9Ef2bR3VPLojFCGjxgnDaXzWLWNJyw","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
