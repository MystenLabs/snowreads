Reductions in maximum torque (MT)\nproduction and maximum rate of torque development (MRTD) occur at the ankle\nwith age, diminishing stability. Ankle exoskeletons are powered orthotic\ndevices that may assist older adults by compensating for reduced muscle force\nand power production capabilities. They may also be able to assist with ankle\nstrategies used for balance. However, no studies have investigated the effect\nof such devices on balance in older adults. Here, we model the effect ankle\nexoskeletons have on stability in physics-based models of healthy young and old\nadults, focusing on the mitigation of age-related deficits such as reduced MT\nand MRTD. We show that an ankle exoskeleton moderately reduces feasible\nstability boundaries in users who have full ankle strength. For individuals\nwith age-related deficits, there is a trade-off. While exoskeletons augment\nstability in low velocity conditions, they reduce stability in some high\nvelocity conditions. Our results suggest that well-established control\nstrategies must still be experimentally validated in older adults.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rpZ8MsuZTt6fLAfgVnxV5HhNOERRSv-e81yA0i1jA5k","pdfSize":"1714445"}
