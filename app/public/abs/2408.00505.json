The set $\\mathcal{U}_X$ of all $\\mathcal{A}$-ultrafilters on\n$X$ with the Stone topology $\\tau$ is seen to be homeomorphic to an appropriate\nquotient space of the set $\\mathcal{M}_X$ of all maximal ideals in\n$S(X,\\mathcal{A})$ equipped with the hull-kernel topology $\\tau_S$. It is\nrealized that $(\\mathcal{U}_X,\\tau)$ is homeomorphic to\n$(\\mathcal{M}_S,\\tau_S)$ if and only if $S(X,\\mathcal{A})$ is a Gelfand ring.\nIt is further observed that $S(X,\\mathcal{A})$ is a Von-Neumann regular ring if\nand only if each ideal in this ring is a $\\mathcal{Z}_S$-ideal and\n$S(X,\\mathcal{A})$ is Gelfand when and only when every maximal ideal in it is a\n$\\mathcal{Z}_S$-ideal. A pair of topologies $u_\\mu$-topology and\n$m_\\mu$-topology, are introduced on the set $S(X,\\mathcal{A})$ and a few\nproperties are studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"x5ei6Xa24oTV8U4bblkIWUydxUjorht-ut2tfix8I70","pdfSize":"216805","txDigest":"7iVg2NVu66Nr2FQosLLT1TvB7xaSf1yo6e1WssNeueY1","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
