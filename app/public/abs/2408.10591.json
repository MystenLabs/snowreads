This induces a\nnatural Riemannian metric g_{h,{\\theta}} on M compatible with the structure.\nThe synthetic object (M,{\\theta},J,h) will be called a pseudo-Hermitian\nmanifold, which generalizes the usual notion of pseudo-Hermitian manifold\n(M,{\\theta},J,L_{{\\theta}}) in the literature. Our purpose is to investigate\nthe differential-geometric aspect of pseudo-Hermitian manifolds. By imitating\nHermitian geometry, we find a canonical connection on (M,{\\theta},J,h), which\ngeneralizes the Tanaka-Webster connection on (M,{\\theta},J,L_{{\\theta}}). We\ndefine the pseudo-K\\\"ahler 2-form by g_{h,{\\theta}} and J; and introduce the\nnotion of a pseudo-K\\\"ahler manifold, which is an analogue of a K\\\"ahler\nmanifold. It turns out that (M,{\\theta},J,L_{{\\theta}}) is pseudo-K\\\"ahlerian.\nUsing the structure equations of the canonical connection, we derive some\ncurvature and torsion properties of a pseudo-Hermitian manifold, in particular\nof a pseudo-K\\\"ahler manifold. Then some known results in Riemannian geometry\nare generalized to the pseudo-Hermitian case. These results include some Cartan\ntype results. As an application, we give a new proof for the classification of\nSasakian space forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b9BFp_fit0RUhpQOKZ7VBwDOVpxj86cR21FNQE2mYXM","pdfSize":"400146"}
