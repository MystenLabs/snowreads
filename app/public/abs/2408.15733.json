In the cases $\\mu=0$ or $Q=\\pm \\pi/2$ correlations are proven to\nexhibit an even/odd effect as a function of the distance $l$ between two\nlattice sites, as they are non-vanishing or strictly vanishing depending on the\nparity of $l$. We identify a clear difference between the two types of\ntransitions through the $Q$-dependence of the short distance correlation\nfunctions. In particular, they exhibit pronounced cusps with discontinuous\nderivatives across the Lifshitz transition. We also determine the long distance\nbehavior of correlations, finding various types of exponential decays in the\ngapped phase, and an algebraic decay characterized by two different spatial\nperiods in the gapless phase. Furthermore, we establish a connection between\nthe gapless superconducting phase of the Kitaev model and the chiral phase of\nspin models with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
