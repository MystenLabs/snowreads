Detecting malaria infection accurately is crucial for\neffective treatment and control. However, existing automated detection\ntechniques have shown limitations in terms of accuracy and generalizability.\nMany studies have focused on specific features without exploring more\ncomprehensive approaches. In our case, we formulate a deep learning technique\nfor malaria-infected cell classification using traditional CNNs and transfer\nlearning models notably VGG19, InceptionV3, and Xception. The models were\ntrained using NIH datasets and tested using different performance metrics such\nas accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The test results showed that deep\nCNNs achieved the highest accuracy -- 97%, followed by Xception with an\naccuracy of 95%. A machine learning model SVM achieved an accuracy of 83%,\nwhile an Inception-V3 achieved an accuracy of 94%. Furthermore, the system can\nbe accessed through a web interface, where users can upload blood smear images\nfor malaria detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
