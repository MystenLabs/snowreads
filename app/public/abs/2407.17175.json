After showing how to associate to a given family of\nFeynman integrals a period matrix whose entries are cuts, we investigate the\nTRBRs satisfied by this period matrix, its dual and the intersection matrices\nfor twisted cycles and co-cycles. For maximal cuts, the non-relative framework\nis applicable, and the period matrix and its dual are related in a simple\nmanner. We then find that the TRBRs give rise to quadratic relations that\ngeneralise quadratic relations that have previously appeared in the literature.\nHowever, we find that the TRBRs do not allow us to obtain quadratic relations\nfor non-maximal cuts or completely uncut Feynman integrals. This can be traced\nback to the fact that the TRBRs are not quadratic in the period matrix, but\nseparately linear in the period matrix and its dual, and the two are not simply\nrelated in the case of a relative cohomology theory, which is required for\nnon-maximal cuts.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
