However,\nexisting ISC systems based on joint source-channel coding face challenges in\ninterpretability, operability, and compatibility. To address these limitations,\nwe propose a novel trustworthy ISC framework. This approach leverages text\nextraction and segmentation mapping techniques to convert images into\nexplainable semantics, while employing Generative Artificial Intelligence\n(GenAI) for multiple downstream inference tasks. We also introduce a multi-rate\nISC transmission protocol that dynamically adapts to both the received\nexplainable semantic content and specific task requirements at the receiver.\nSimulation results demonstrate that our framework achieves explainable\nlearning, decoupled training, and compatible transmission in various\napplication scenarios. Finally, some intriguing research directions and\napplication scenarios are identified.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UTEfghpempIr1mPsDsSmGUrBeFdeTY-LGCk0z9bgUMk","pdfSize":"2260826"}
