To address this challenge, interpretable ML methods have been\ndeveloped to explain how features influence model predictions. However, these\nmethods often focus on univariate feature importance, overlooking the complex\ninteractions between features that ML models are capable of capturing.\nRecognizing this limitation, recent efforts have aimed to extend these methods\nto discover feature interactions, but existing approaches struggle with\nrobustness and error control, especially under data perturbations. In this\nstudy, we introduce Diamond, a novel method for trustworthy feature interaction\ndiscovery. Diamond uniquely integrates the model-X knockoffs framework to\ncontrol the false discovery rate (FDR), ensuring that the proportion of falsely\ndiscovered interactions remains low. We further address the challenges of using\noff-the-shelf interaction importance measures by proposing a calibration\nprocedure that refines these measures to maintain the desired FDR. Diamond's\napplicability spans a wide range of ML models, including deep neural networks,\ntree-based models, and factorization-based models. Our empirical evaluations on\nboth simulated and real datasets across various biomedical studies demonstrate\nDiamond's utility in enabling more reliable data-driven scientific discoveries.\nThis method represents a significant step forward in the deployment of ML\nmodels for scientific innovation and hypothesis generation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pqJriQRlWNE5cPA9KTLF3xQfecKCUMwdQ9MgSfeQtdw","pdfSize":"20756924"}
