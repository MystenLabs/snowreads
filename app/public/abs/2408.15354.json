It Depends, and Why That Matters for\n  AI Developers and Users","authors":"Jana Schaich Borg and Hannah Read","authorsParsed":[["Borg","Jana Schaich",""],["Read","Hannah",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 27 Aug 2024 18:27:22 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-29","timestamp":1724783242000,"abstract":"  Interest is growing in artificial empathy, but so is confusion about what\nartificial empathy is or needs to be. This confusion makes it challenging to\nnavigate the technical and ethical issues that accompany empathic AI\ndevelopment. Here, we outline a framework for thinking about empathic AI based\non the premise that different constellations of capabilities associated with\nempathy are important for different empathic AI applications. We describe\ndistinctions of capabilities that we argue belong under the empathy umbrella,\nand show how three medical empathic AI use cases require different sets of\nthese capabilities. We conclude by discussing why appreciation of the diverse\ncapabilities under the empathy umbrella is important for both AI creators and\nusers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
