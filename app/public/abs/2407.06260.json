The constraints we consider are sparseness\nconditions on the Fourier coefficients of these forms, which are necessary to\ninterpret them as gravitational path integrals. Using crossing kernels, we\nextract the leading and subleading behavior of these coefficients and show that\nthe leading Cardy-like growth is robust in a wide regime of validity. On the\nother hand, we find that subleading corrections are sensitive to the\nconstraints placed on the light states, and we quantify their imprint on the\nasymptotic growth of states. Our approach is tested against the generating\nfunction of symmetric product orbifolds, where we provide new insights into the\nfactors contributing to the asymptotic growth of their Fourier coefficients.\nFinally, we use our methods to revisit the UV/IR connection that relates black\nhole microstate counting to modular forms. We provide a microscopic\ninterpretation of the logarithmic corrections to the entropy of BPS black holes\nin N = 2, 4 ungauged supergravity in four and five dimensions, and tie it to\nconsistency conditions in AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
