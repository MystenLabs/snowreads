Anticipating that short to medium-length codes\nwill soon be realizable, it is important to construct stabilizer codes that,\nfor a given code distance, admit fault-tolerant implementations of logical\ngates with the fewest number of physical qubits. We extract high-distance\ndoubly even codes from the quantum quadratic-residue code family that admit a\ntransversal implementation of the single-qubit Clifford group. Applying a\ndoubling procedure [arXiv:1509.03239] to such codes yields a family of\nhigh-distance triply even codes which admit a transversal implementation of the\nlogical $\\texttt{T}$-gate. To our knowledge, both code families require a lower\nqubit overhead than any other qubit stabilizer code of the same distance which\ncan realize their respective gates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l8oVChRu8nGEype4t8TeIwCaxj7DBQqQPBk3OTgF0xg","pdfSize":"757202"}
