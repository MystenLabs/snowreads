If $E$ has an $\\ell$-torsion point, then\nthere has been significant work done on characterizing the $\\ell$-divisibility\nof the global Tamagawa number of $E$. In this paper, we consider elliptic\ncurves that are $\\ell$-isogenous to elliptic curves with an $\\ell$-torsion\npoint and study the $\\ell$-divisibility of their global Tamagawa numbers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qz6zlilqYl0x7yY-4BIMSp4N5N3CoF6R0m9s202ZpsE","pdfSize":"369344"}
