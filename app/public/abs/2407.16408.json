The associated topology on the collection $CL(X)$ of all\nnonempty closed subsets of $(X,d)$ is denoted by $\\tau_{\\mathcal{S},d}$. As\nspecial cases, this unified approach includes classical Wijsman, Attouch-Wets,\nand Hausdorff distance topologies. In this article, we investigate various\ntopological characteristics of the hyperspace $(CL(X), \\tau_{\\mathcal{S},d})$\nwhen $\\mathcal{S}$ is a bornology on $(X,d)$. In order to do this, a new class\nof bornologies and a new metric topology on $CL(X)$ have been introduced and\nstudied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
