The algorithm is based on two lemmas that follow from the\napplication of weak duality theorem and complementary slackness theorem to the\nlinear optimization problem with linear objective function that is associated\nwith any solution of a linear optimization problem with (differentiable)\nconcave objective function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
