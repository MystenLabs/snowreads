Unitarity and directedness of the resulting time evolution are\ndemonstrated for a minisuperspace model of cosmology.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
