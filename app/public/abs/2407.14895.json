Maintaining numerous providers' stable and\nactive presence on the platform is highly important to enhance the\nmarketplace's scale and diversity. The strongest motivation for providers to\ncontinue using the platform is to realize actual profits through sales. Then,\nwe propose a personalized promotion to increase the number of successful\nproviders with sales experiences on the platform. The main contributions of our\nresearch are twofold. First, we introduce a new perspective in provider\nmanagement with the distribution of successful sales experiences. Second, we\npropose a personalized promotion optimization method to maximize the number of\nproviders' sales experiences. By utilizing this approach, we ensure equal\nopportunities for providers to experience sales without being monopolized by a\nfew providers. Through experiments using actual data on coupon distribution, we\nconfirm that our method enables the implementation of coupon allocation\nstrategies that significantly increase the total number of providers having\nsales experiences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
