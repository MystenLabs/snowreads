The first technique decomposes the map as a series of basic\nequivalences, while the second refines this approach using the 3-for-2 property\nof equivalences. The techniques are illustrated by proving a basic result in\nsynthetic homotopy theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
