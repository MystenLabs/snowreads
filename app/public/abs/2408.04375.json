We show that the central derivative of the Rankin-Selberg\n$L$-function $L(f,\\chi,s)$ is, up to an explicit positive constant, equal to\nthe Beilinson-Bloch height of a generalized Heegner cycle. This generalizes the\nGross-Zagier formula (the case $k = 1$) and Zhang's higher weight formula (the\ncase $t=0$).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iJ-Cm4wDf5qEeNZa1W7cvoRIUEzi3kN8r3_Y952F_60","pdfSize":"774633"}
