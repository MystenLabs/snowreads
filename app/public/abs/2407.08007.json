We first\nestablish the formula for exactly computing the regular coderivative and the\nMordukhovich coderivative of the metric projection operator onto the positive\ncone in Euclidean spaces. Then, these results are also established for the\nprojection operator onto the positive cone in the real Hilbert space $l_2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
