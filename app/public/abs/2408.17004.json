Using\nthe extended atomistic Green's function (AGF) method, we describe how the\nnumerically exact mode-resolved scattering cross section $\\sigma $ can be\ncomputed for a phonon scattered by a single lattice defect. We illustrate the\ngenerality and utility of the AGF-based treatment with two examples. In the\nfirst example, we treat the isotopic scattering of phonons in a harmonic chain\nof atoms . In the second example, we treat the more complex problem of phonon\nscattering in a carbon nanotube (CNT) containing an encapsulated C60 molecule\nwhich acts as a scatterer of the CNT phonons. The application of this method\ncan enable a more precise characterization of lattice-defect scattering and\nresult in a more controlled use of nanostructuring and lattice defects in\nphonon engineering for thermoelectric applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
