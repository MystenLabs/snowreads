When storing or re-using these\ndata, e.g., to subsequently train some sort of data-based surrogate or compute\nconsistent adjoint flow solutions, a brute-force storage approach is\npractically impossible. Therefore, -- mandatory incremental -- Reduced Order\nModeling (ROM) approaches are an attractive alternative since only a specific\ntime horizon is effectively stored. This bunched flow solution is then used to\nenhance the already computed ROM so that the allocated memory can be released\nand the procedure repeats.\n  This paper utilizes an incremental truncated Singular Value Decomposition\n(itSVD) procedure to compress flow data resulting from scale-resolving flow\nsimulations. To this end, two scenarios are considered, referring to an\nacademic Large Eddy Simulation (LES) around a circular cylinder at Re=1.4E+05\nas well as an industrial case that employs a hybrid filtered/averaged Detached\nEddy Simulation (DES) on the flow around the superstructure of a full-scale\nfeeder ship at Re=5E+08.\n  The paper's central focus is on an aspect of practical relevance: how much\ninformation of the computed scale-resolving solution should be used by the ROM,\ni.e., how much redundancy occurs in the resolved turbulent fluctuations that\nfavors ROM. In the course of the tSVD employed, this goes hand in hand with the\nquestion of \"how many singular values of the snapshot-matrix should be\nneglected (or considered)\" -- without (a) re-running the simulation several\ntimes in a try-and-error procedure and (b) still obtain compressed results\nbelow the model and discretization error. An adaptive strategy is utilized to\nobtain a fully adaptive data reduction of O(95) percent via a computational\noverhead of O(10) percent with a mean accuracy of reconstructed local and\nglobal flow data of O(0.1) percent.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
