To realize the electrostatic force, the soap film\nbridge is placed inside an outer metal cylinder and a voltage difference\nbetween this cylinder and the soap film is applied. Our model consists of a\nquasilinear parabolic equation for the evolution of the film coupled with an\nelliptic equation for the electrostatic potential in the unknown domain between\nouter cylinder and soap film bridge. For the rotationally symmetric case, we\nprove local well-posedness of this free boundary problem by recasting it as a\nsingle quasilinear parabolic equation with a non-local source term. Moreover,\nfor large applied voltages, we show that solutions do not exist globally for a\nwide class of initial values.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U1jyZAHwt6QNCFXl_p7NKgjz5POmPhD2aJHVfI5iKHg","pdfSize":"430061"}
