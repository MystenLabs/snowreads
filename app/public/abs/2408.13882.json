However, a detection of their coherence by light is problematic. Here\nwe propose a method for detecting a dark excitonic condensate. It relies on the\ninteraction between excitons and phonons responsible for the interconversion\nbetween bright and dark excitons. As long as the dark condensate forms, the\nRabi oscillations between photons and bright excitons can become strongly\nmodified. The analysis is conducted in the limit of weak interaction, and the\nperspective for the case of the strong interaction leading to the polaronic\neffect is discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
