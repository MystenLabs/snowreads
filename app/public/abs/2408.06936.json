In this work, we show the feasibility of the different\nsteps necessary to perform controlled quantum state transfer in a $S=1/2$\ntitanium atoms chain employing the electric field produced by a Scanning\nTunneling Microscope (STM). Our results show that the initialization and\ntransmission of a single excitation state is achievable in short times, and\nwith high fidelity. Our study uses spin Hamiltonians to model the magnetic\natoms chain, the tip of the STM, the interaction between it and the atoms chain\nand the electronic response to the fields applied by the tip, employing sets of\nparameters compatible with the latest experiments and ab initio calculations.\nThe time dynamical evolution is considered in the full Hilbert space and the\ncontrol pulses frequencies exerted by the tip of the microscope are within the\nreach of present day technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
