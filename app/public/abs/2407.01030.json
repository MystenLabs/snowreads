We review some definitions and\nresults on the theory of key polynomials and Mac Lane-Vaqui\\'e chains which\nenable us to prove that a valued field $(K,v)$ is tame if and only if the\nFrobenius endomorphism on the associated graded ring is surjective and every\nsimple algebraic extension of $K$ admits a finite complete sequence of key\npolynomials. We present a criterion for $(K,v)$ to be henselian and defectless\nin terms of finite complete sequences of key polynomials. We also make some\nconsiderations on purely inertial and purely ramified extensions and their\nrelations to properties of the associated graded ring and the module of\nK\\\"ahler differentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
