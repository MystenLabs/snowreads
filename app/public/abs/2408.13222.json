For many\ndecades, various types of methods for this purpose have been developed and\nextensively studied. One class of methods which has received a lot of attention\nin recent years are machine learning-based methods, which typically involve the\ntraining of artificial neural networks (ANNs) by means of stochastic gradient\ndescent type optimization methods. While approximation methods for PDEs using\nANNs have first been proposed in the 1990s they have only gained wide\npopularity in the last decade with the rise of deep learning. This article aims\nto provide an introduction to some of these methods and the mathematical theory\non which they are based. We discuss methods such as physics-informed neural\nnetworks (PINNs) and deep BSDE methods and consider several operator learning\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
