We present Breaking-Good, a tool that\nautomatically generates explanations for breaking updates. Breaking-Good\nprovides a detailed categorization of compilation errors, identifying several\nfactors related to changes in direct and indirect dependencies,\nincompatibilities between Java versions, and client-specific configuration.\nWith a blended analysis of log and dependency trees, Breaking-Good generates\ndetailed explanations for each breaking update. These explanations help\ndevelopers understand the causes of the breaking update, and suggest possible\nactions to fix the breakage. We evaluate Breaking-Good on 243 real-world\nbreaking dependency updates. Our results indicate that Breaking-Good accurately\nidentifies root causes and generates automatic explanations for 70% of these\nbreaking updates. Our user study demonstrates that the generated explanations\nhelp developers. Breaking-Good is the first technique that automatically\nidentifies causes of a breaking dependency update and explains the breakage\naccordingly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
