This non-Hermitian\ntrimer exhibits stable stationary and oscillatory regimes in a wide range of\nvalues of the coupling-loss parameters. Moreover, chaotic dynamics through\nperiod-doubling is confirmed via Lyapunov exponent measurements and the\nunderlying bifurcation structure is found by semi-analytical continuation of\nsolutions. The interplay of chaos, due to Kerr nonlinearity, and\nnon-Hermiticity, due to the combined dissipation and complex coupling, provides\na different perspective in the area of nonlinear and non-Hermitian optics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
