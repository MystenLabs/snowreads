A relaxation of this concept\nis based on the condition that two vertices \\(x, y \\in V(G)\\) are\n\\(M\\)-visible, meaning there exists a shortest \\(x, y\\)-path in \\(G\\) that does\nnot pass through any vertex of \\(M \\setminus \\{x, y\\}\\).\n  If every pair of vertices in \\(M\\) is \\(M\\)-visible, then \\(M\\) is called a\nmutual-visibility set of \\(G\\). The size of the largest mutual-visibility set\nof \\(G\\) is called the mutual-visibility number of \\(G\\). Some well-known\nvariations of this concept consider the total, outer, and dual\nmutual-visibility sets of a graph.\n  We present results on the general position problem and the various\nmutual-visibility problems in Sierpi\\'nski triangle graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"C6DC1Icytf9g4rzWjXji0vOZKT8e3KCWF7wP7mJjO24","pdfSize":"408834"}
