The interference between the two mass\neigenstates can induce heavy neutrino-antineutrino oscillations (NNOs) leading\nto observable lepton number violation (LNV), even though the LN symmetry is\napproximately conserved. These NNOs could be resolved in long-lived HNL\nsearches at collider experiments, such as the proposed Future Circular $e^+e^-$\nCollider (FCC-$ee$) or Circular Electron Positron Collider (CEPC). However,\nduring their $Z$-pole runs, the LN carried away by the light (anti)neutrinos\nproduced alongside the HNLs prevents LNV from being observed directly.\nNevertheless, NNOs materialise as oscillating signatures in final state\ndistributions. We discuss and compare a selection of such oscillating\nobservables, and perform a Monte Carlo simulation to assess the parameter space\nin which NNOs could be resolved.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dELas9pASevja0Oxg3xqba1bcfiZwiKzQeRsdH5leps","pdfSize":"1471265","txDigest":"CY3D21FMFNtA4RUu5TjMUmoNUngyZsZ4PY73gVCyYHew","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
