While\nToSC offers an efficient mode of communication, it concurrently raises concerns\nregarding privacy, as sophisticated adversaries might possess the capability to\nreconstruct the original data from the transmitted features. This article\nprovides an in-depth analysis of privacy-preserving strategies specifically\ndesigned for ToSC relying on deep neural network-based joint source and channel\ncoding (DeepJSCC). The study encompasses a detailed comparative assessment of\ntrustworthy feature perturbation methods such as differential privacy and\nencryption, alongside intrinsic security incorporation approaches like\nadversarial learning to train the JSCC and learning-based vector quantization\n(LBVQ). This comparative analysis underscores the integration of advanced\nexplainable learning algorithms into communication systems, positing a new\nbenchmark for privacy standards in the forthcoming 6G era.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
