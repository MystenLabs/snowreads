The proof\nmethod for both theorems is based on the significant use of a particular type\nof models of $T^{R}$, namely simple models, and certain indiscernible arrays.\nUsing simple models of $T^R$ gives the advantage of re-proving these theorems\nin a simpler and quantitative manner. We finally turn our attention to $NSOP$\nin randomization. We show that based on the definition of $NSOP$ given [11],\n$T^R$ is stable if and only if it is $NIP$ and $NSOP$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CMhMRo0iC9Jvcj31sgUe2OZSFaLOi2ba4blq4-lCJUg","pdfSize":"233777"}
