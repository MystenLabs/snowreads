Data reveals various magnetic\nground states including (i) a nonmagnetic ground state for the Pr sample; (ii)\nlong range magnetic ordering for the Nd, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, and Er samples.\nBesides the Gd sample, they exhibit field-induced spin state transitions. More\ninterestingly, the series spin state transitions in the Nd and Dy samples could\nbe attributed to the field-induced up-up-down (UUD) spin structure. Neutron\npowder diffraction (NPD) measurements of the Er sample suggest a spiral spin\nstructure below its TN; and (iii) a short-range ordering for the Yb sample. The\ndisrupted inter-layer interaction due to the shift of Yb3+ ions within the\nbilayer prevents long range magnetic ordering down to 30 mK and makes it\nanother Yb-related triangular lattice antiferromagnet that has the potential to\nrealize a quantum spin liquid state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oSL-vMazzkzSQQo3Kz6szkChU0OSiUzCDbc6x0EiqTI","pdfSize":"12536837"}
