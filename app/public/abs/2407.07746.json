The master equation governing the noise-average\ndynamics describes a new form of dephasing. We characterize the resulting state\nevolution and analyze its purity. The novel properties of such dynamics are\nillustrated in a stochastic dissipative qubit. Our analytical results show that\nadding noise allows for a rich control of the dynamics, with a greater\ndiversity of steady states and the possibility of state purification.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
