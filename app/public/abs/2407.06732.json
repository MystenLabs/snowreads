In this work, the theory of operator spaces\nis exploited to enable a broadening of the scope to flows on $C^*$ algebras.\nAlthough the hypotheses that need to be verified in the general setting may\nseem numerous, we provide auxiliary results that enable this to be simplified\nin many of the cases which arise in practice. A wide variety of examples is\nprovided by way of illustration.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
