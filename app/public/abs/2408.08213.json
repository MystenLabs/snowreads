Here we show cascaded operation\nof two of such modulators driven by custom-built electronics delivering\non-demand picosecond pulses and application to a quantum dot cavity-QED single\nphoton source. We implement an EOM-based correlation technique and demonstrate\nlight pulses as short as 24$\\pm$2 ps with a single EOM. The EOMs can be\nsynchronized and operated in series, we then produce optical pulses down to 17\nps. To optimize the pulse contrast, we analyze for two different EOM devices\nthe transmission as a function of EOM bias, wavelength and temperature, and we\nshow that by temperature tuning and stabilization, a pulse contrast above 25 dB\ncan be obtained at the targeted wavelength. With this high contrast we\ndemonstrate resonant excitation of an InGaAs quantum dot - microcavity based\nsingle photon source, demonstrating a crucial technology for scalability and\nsynchronization of large scale photonic quantum applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
