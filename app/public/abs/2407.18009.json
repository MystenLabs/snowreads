However, they still struggle to grasp\nsocial dynamics, especially in public spaces, sometimes resulting in violations\nof social norms, such as interrupting human conversations. This behavior,\noriginating from a limited processing of social norms, might be perceived as\nrobot-centered. Understanding social dynamics, particularly in\ngroup-robot-interactions (GRI), underscores the need for further research and\ndevelopment in human-robot-interaction (HRI). Enhancing the interaction\nabilities of social robots, especially in GRIs, can improve their effectiveness\nin real-world applications on a micro-level, as group interactions lead to\nincreased motivation and comfort. In this study, we assessed the influence of\nthe interaction condition (dyadic vs. triadic) on the perceived extraversion\n(ext.) of social robots in public spaces. The research involved 40 HRIs,\nincluding 24 dyadic (i.e., one human and one robot) interactions and 16 triadic\ninteractions, which involve at least three entities, including the robot.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
