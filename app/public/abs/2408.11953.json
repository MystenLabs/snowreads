Utilizing a quantum optics operator approach, our study specifically\nexamines the effects of parameter variations within the Gaussian modulation on\ntwo entire functions: the Bessel function and the Airy function. Through this\ninvestigation, we aim to elucidate how these parameter variations influence the\nbeam's propagation dynamics and the role played by the asymmetry of the\nGaussian modulation in the propagation of such paraxial beams. Additionally, we\nprovide a comprehensive method for computing the propagated field under these\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
