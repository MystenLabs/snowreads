We\nconsider squashed $S^3$ and $S^1 \\times S^2$ boundaries and find that in both\nmodels, the KSW criterion excludes a significant range of homogeneous but\nanisotropic configurations. For squashed $S^3$ boundaries, the excluded range\nincludes all surface geometries with negative scalar curvature, in line with\ndS/CFT reasoning. For $S^1 \\times S^2$ boundaries, we find that KSW selects the\nlow-temperature regime of configuration space where the $S^1$ is sufficiently\nlarge compared to the $S^2$. In both models, the KSW criterion renders the\nsemiclassical wave function normalizable, up to one-loop effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
