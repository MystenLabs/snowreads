We introduced a new topological invariant: the winding number of\nfar-field polarization around the Brillouin zone boundary and confirmed a\nrobust correspondence between it and the Chern number of energy bands from the\nperspective of symmetry, which can be used to analyze the process of\ntopological phase transition. It is found that changes in the winding number\nand Chern number, associated with the exchange of far-field polarization\nsingularities, especially for bound states in the continuum(BIC), will emerge\nduring phase transition. These findings offer new insights for further\nunderstanding the intriguing properties of topological materials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
