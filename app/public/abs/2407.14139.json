To this end, we develop an\nenergy-time analysis of the photoelectron's reduced density matrix based on\nfirst principles. We test and assess our approach with numerical simulations on\na low dimensional model molecule in interaction with broadband composite pulses\nocculting the vibrational resolution. Our method is directly applicable to\nrecent experimental schemes measuring the photoelectron reduced density\nmatrices in atomic and molecular photoemission. Therefore, it opens a new\nwindow on the dynamics of decoherence and entanglement at the attosecond\ntimescale.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W0TV556aMjN6h-6sB7_rTvYbS8VvrU6SrUWGgU0Z29E","pdfSize":"846688"}
