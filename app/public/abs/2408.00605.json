Anderson","authorsParsed":[["Reyes","Mauricio Cruz",""],["Anderson","Richard I.",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 1 Aug 2024 14:42:39 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-02","timestamp":1722523359000,"abstract":"  We homogeneously measured the elliptical shapes of 163 globular clusters\n(GCs) using the on-sky distribution of their cluster members and the third data\nrelease of the ESA mission Gaia (DR3). The astrometry enables the\ndifferentiation of stars within clusters from those in the field. This feature\nis particularly valuable for clusters located in densely populated areas of the\nsky, where conventional methods for measuring the geometry of the GCs are not\napplicable. The median axial ratio of our full sample is $\\langle b/a \\rangle =\n0.935^{+0.033}_{-0.090}$ and $0.986^{+0.009}_{-0.004}$ for the subset of 11 GCs\npreviously studied based on Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We investigated\nwhether the minor axis of the ellipses can be interpreted as a pseudo-rotation\naxis by comparing it to measurements of cluster rotation. Using the radial\nvelocities from Gaia, we detected rotation for three clusters, NGC 5139, NGC\n104, and NGC 6341, and observed an alignment between the pseudo-rotation axis\nand the 2D projection of the real rotation axis. To expand the set of clusters\nfor which rotation has been detected, we analyzed multiple literature\nreferences. Depending on the reference used for comparison, we observed an\nalignment in between 76% to 100% of the clusters. The lack of an alignment\nobserved in some clusters may be linked to different scales analyzed in various\nstudies. Several studies have demonstrated that the orientation of rotation\nvaries with the distance from the center. We estimate that the next Gaia\nrelease will increase the number of stars with radial velocities in GCs from\n$\\sim 10,000$ in Gaia DR3 to $\\sim 55,000$ in Gaia DR4. This will enable the\nmeasurement of rotation and ellipticities at identical angular scales for\nadditional clusters, which will help us to clarify whether the previously\nmentioned alignment occurs in all clusters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
