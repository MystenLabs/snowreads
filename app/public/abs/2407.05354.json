In the case of the L\\'{e}vy\nindex $\\alpha=1.9$, this equation can be considered as a model equation to\ndescribe strong Langmuir plasma turbulence. The modulation instability of a\nplane wave is studied, the regions of instability depending on the L\\'{e}vy\nindex, and the corresponding instability growth rates are determined. Numerical\nsolutions in the form of 3D fundamental soliton (ground state) are obtained for\ndifferent values of the L\\'{e}vy index. It was shown that in a certain range of\nsoliton parameters it is stable even in the presence of a sufficiently strong\ninitial random disturbance, and the self-cleaning of the soliton from such\ninitial noise was demonstrated.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
