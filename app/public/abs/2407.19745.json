The $(n,k,r)$-arrangement graph $A(n,k,r)$ with $1\\leq\nr\\leq k\\leq n$, is the graph with vertex set $[n]^{(k)}$ and with two\n$k$-tuples are adjacent if they differ in exactly $r$ coordinates. In this\nmanuscript, we characterize the full automorphism groups of $A(n,k,r)$ in the\ncases that $1\\leq r=k\\leq n$ and $r=2<k=n$. Thus, we resolve two special cases\nof an open problem proposed by Fu-Gang Yin, Yan-Quan Feng, Jin-Xin Zhou and\nYu-Hong Guo. In addition, we conclude with a bold conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O37tdnhWJciehCA0X-lmmIOKgM17u5grfU3yuoL5Hc8","pdfSize":"132156","objectId":"0xf7d87b064db5c71bc504c9d10a46a98bbd8411822cc68746ea2f82f4e1bfc2a0","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
