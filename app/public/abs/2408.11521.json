In particular, we show that\nthe marginal distribution of this solution is the Dickman distribution.\nAdditionally, we investigate superpositions of Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes\nwhich may have short- or long-range dependencies and marginal distribution of\nthe form of the Dickman distribution. The numerical algorithm for simulation of\nthese processes is presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lCMYFqLB4HCqdJ_Sz78KXcFCJz-ZE-2OJO_WxlBzDzQ","pdfSize":"626185"}
