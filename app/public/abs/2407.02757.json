Our aim is to investigate\ncorrelations between model parameters and the ages of the corresponding PWNe,\nthereby revealing the evolution of high-energy electron distributions within\nPWNe. Our findings are as follows: (1) The electron distributions in PWNe can\nbe characterized by a double power-law with a superexponential cutoff; (2) As\nPWNe evolve, the high-energy end of the electron distribution spectrum becomes\nharder with the index decreasing from approximately 3.5 to 2.5, while the\nlow-energy end spectrum index remains constant near 1.5; (3) There is no\napparent correlation between the break energy or cutoff energy and the age of\nPWNe. (4) The average magnetic field within PWNe decreases with age, leading to\na positive correlation between the energy loss timescale of electrons at the\nbreak energy or the high-energy cutoff, and the age of the PWN. (5) The total\nelectron energy within PWNe remains constant near $2 \\times 10^{48}$ erg, while\nthe total magnetic energy decreases with age.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
