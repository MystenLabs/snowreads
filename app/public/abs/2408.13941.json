In 2011, Biaogioli and Zeng\nsuccessfully derived four and six variate distributions on the set of wreath\nproduct. In this paper, we will generalize the four variate identities from BZ\nto any positive dominant ordering. And we will simplify the six variate\ndistribution function under the ordering originally defined by Adin and\nRoichman in 2001.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
