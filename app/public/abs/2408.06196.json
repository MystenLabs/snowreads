In this paper, we propose (for the first time) a notion of\nstructural morphism among nested conditions, consistent with the entailment of\nthe corresponding formulas. This reveals a structural weakness of the existing\ndefinition of nested conditions, which we overcome by proposing a new notion of\nspan-based nested conditions, embedding the original ones. We also introduce\nmorphisms for the latter, showing that those form a richer structure by\norganising the various models in a number of categories suitably related by\nfunctors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
