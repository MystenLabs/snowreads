As an application, we explicitly compute the\ngeneric degree of three period maps underlying families of Calabi-Yau 3-folds\ncoming from toric hypersurfaces. As a consequence, we show that the generic\nTorelli theorem holds for these cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
