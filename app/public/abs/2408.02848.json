We also\ncompute all distance ideals of some strong digraphs in the family $\\Lambda$.\n  Then, we explore circuits, which turn out to be an infinite family of minimal\nforbidden digraphs, as induced subdigraphs, for the strong digraphs in\n$\\Gamma_1$.\n  This suggests that a characterization of $\\Gamma_1$ in terms of forbidden\ninduced subdigraphs is harder than using patterns.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
