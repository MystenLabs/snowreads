This issue can lead to\nunreliable deployments and increased debugging efforts, yet it remains\nunderexplored in current research. We conduct a systematic analysis of\nDockerfile flakiness, presenting a comprehensive taxonomy of common flakiness\ncategories, including dependency-related errors and server connectivity issues.\nFurthermore, we introduce FlakiDock, a tool leveraging large language models\nand retrieval-augmented generation techniques with dynamic analysis and an\niterative feedback loop to automatically repair flaky Dockerfiles. Our\nevaluation shows that FlakiDock achieves a 73.55% repair accuracy,\noutperforming existing tools such as PARFUM by 12,581% and GPT-4-based\nprompting by 94.63%. These results underscore the effectiveness of FlakiDock in\naddressing Dockerfile flakiness and improving build reliability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uzRpLx3fs3mdSE13B-21ex9voPBneiAQZcwDJvEMc4s","pdfSize":"2267657"}
