The quantum phase transition has the same origin as the one in a\nresistively shunted Josephson junction, but the intrinsic momentum coupling\nbetween the Josephson mode and the bath modes enables us to observe the\ndissipative phase transition without any synthetic dissipation. We show that\nthe inter-atomic interaction strength plays the role of the damping parameter.\nConsequently, in contrast to a resistively shunted Josephson circuit, the Bose\nJosephson junction can exhibit an insulating phase in a wider parameter region\nby increasing the repulsive interaction strength, which is robust against\nnonperturbative effects. We argue that tight transverse confinement of the\nquasi-one-dimensional atomic gas allows us to reach the insulating phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
