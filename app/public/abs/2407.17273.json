This problem is that\nof linking business architecture to IT architecture in general and application\narchitecture specifically. In our earlier work we proposed Category theory as\nthe formal language to unify the business and IT worlds with the ability to\nrepresent the concepts and relations between the two in a unified way. We used\nrCOS as the underlying model for the specification of interfaces, contracts,\nand components. The concept of pseudo-category was then utilized to represent\nthe business and application architecture specifications and the relationships\ncontained within. Contracts are used for the specification of both IT and\nBusiness architecture components. The linkages between them is now established\nusing the matching of the business component contracts with the application\ncomponent contracts. Typically, the matching was based on manual process, in\nthis paper we extend the work by considering automated component matching\nprocess. In this paper we provide implementation of the matching process using\ngraph matching.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
