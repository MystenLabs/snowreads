A\ncomprehensive dynamic system analysis code NuHeXSys (Nuclear Helium-Xenon\nBrayton Cycle Power System) was created, integrating non-ideal gas properties,\na multi-channel thermal-hydraulic reactor core, and detailed turbo-machinery\ncomponents. The innovation lies in parametrization of startup control sequence\nand application of an evolutionary algorithm (NSGA-II) to improve control\nperformance, significantly reducing startup time and energy consumption. Model\nverification shows parameter deviations within 10%, confirming its accuracy.\nThe optimized control strategy reduced startup time by 1260 seconds and lowered\nexternal energy demand by 17%, demonstrating improved efficiency and\noperational stability for deep space missions. This work provides a foundation\nfor future advancements in optimizing space nuclear power systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CaXf7l_yE1UizS2eVoQixhJQ1L6qFHBF6E_JvEFafCI","pdfSize":"3803261"}
