In the content of material parameter\nidentification the posterior parameter density function is obtained from its\nprior and the likelihood function of the measurements. By using Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo methods, such as the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm\n\\cite{Hastings1970}, the global density function including local peaks can be\ncomputed. Thus this procedure enables an accurate evaluation of the global\nparameter quality. However, the computational effort is remarkable larger\ncompared to the minimization approach. Thus several methodologies for an\nefficient approximation of the likelihood function are discussed in the present\nstudy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
