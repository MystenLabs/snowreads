We establish the well-posedness of the\ntime evolution and its linear response close to a non-degenerate ground state,\nand prove the appearance of resonances at relevant frequencies. The main\nmathematical difficulty is due to the structure of the linearized equations,\nwhich are not complex-linear. We bypass this difficulty by reformulating the\nlinearized problem as a real Hamiltonian system, whose stability is ensured by\nthe second-order optimality conditions on the energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
