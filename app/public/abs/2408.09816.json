Such a potential notably has a discontinuity in the second\nderivative. We derive an asymptotic expansion, valid either in the high energy\nregime or the semiclassical regime, with a leading order term given by the\nBohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition, and an asymptotic expansion consisting\nof negative powers of the leading order term, with coefficients that are\noscillatory in the leading order term. We apply this expansion to study the\nresults of the Gutzwiller Trace formula and the heat kernel asymptotic for this\nclass of potentials, giving an idea into what results to expect for such trace\nformulas for non-smooth potentials.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
