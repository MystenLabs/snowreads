In the case of asymptotically AdS black\nholes, the spectra of QNMs are related to the near-equilibrium behavior of\nspecific strongly interacting quantum field theories via the holographic\ngauge-gravity duality. In the present work, we numerically obtain the spectra\nof homogeneous non-hydrodynamic QNMs of a top-down holographic construction\ndescribing a hot and dense strongly-coupled plasma. The main result is the\ndiscovery of a new structure of pairs of purely imaginary QNMs. Those new\npurely damped QNMs dominate the late time equilibration of the strongly-coupled\nplasma at large values of the chemical potential, while at lower values the\nfundamental QNMs are instead ordinary poles with imaginary and real parts\ndescribing oscillatory decaying perturbations. We also observe a new phenomenon\nof asymptotic pole fusion for different pairs of purely imaginary QNMs at\nasymptotically large values of the chemical potential. This phenomenon\ncorresponds to the asymptotic merging of the two poles within each pair of\npurely imaginary QNMs, indicating that characteristic equilibration times for\nthe plasma develop upper bounds that cannot be surpassed by further doping the\nmedium with increasing values of the chemical potential.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
