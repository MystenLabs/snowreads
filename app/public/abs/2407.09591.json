Numerical\nresults show that this solution violates the Null Energy Condition (NEC), and\nas the parameters change, the ADM mass of the entire spacetime changes from\npositive to negative. In addition, we analyze the light ring (LR) of the\nsolution and demonstrate the astronomical observation properties. Especially\nwhen negative mass appears, the general LR will not appear, only a ``special\nunstable LR\" exists at the throat, which is caused by the repulsive effect of\nthe negative mass on both sides of the wormhole. Finally, we draw the embedding\ndiagram to reflect the geometric characteristics of the wormhole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
