We\nconstrain the new parameters by using consistency with the existing bounds on\nDark matter relic density, direct detection, collider and BR($B\\rightarrow\nK^*\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$) measured at the Belle II experiment. We investigate couplings\nbetween the mediator and the SM fermions as well as the dark matter particle.\nWe then estimate the branching ratios of $b \\to s \\nu \\bar \\nu$ decay processes\nsuch as $B\\rightarrow (K^+,K^*)\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$, $B_s\\rightarrow\n(\\eta,\\eta')\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$, $ B_s\\rightarrow \\phi\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ and\n$B_c\\rightarrow (D_s, D_s^*)\\nu\\bar{\\nu}$ in a common parameter space, meeting\nthe current experimental bounds of both sectors simultaneously.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
