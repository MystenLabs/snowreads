These\nsolitons can be stabilized in a cubic-quintic nonlinear medium. In this paper,\nwe analyze the Crank-Nicolson finite difference scheme for the (2+1)D\ncubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with cubic damping. We show that\nboth the discrete solution, in the discrete $L^2$-norm, and discrete energy are\nbounded. By using appropriate settings and estimations, the existence and the\nuniqueness of the numerical solution are proved. In addition, the error\nestimations are established in terms of second order for both space and time in\ndiscrete $L^2$-norm and $H^1$-norm. Numerical simulations for the (2+1)D\ncubic-quintic nonlinear Schr\\\"odinger equation with cubic damping are conducted\nto validate the convergence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
