In this paper, we propose two quantum algorithms for simulating\nthe dynamics of open quantum systems governed by Lindbladians. We introduce a\nnew approximation channel for short-time evolution, inspired by the quantum\ntrajectory method, which underpins the efficiency of our algorithms. The first\nalgorithm achieves a gate complexity independent of the number of jump\noperators, $m$, marking a significant improvement in efficiency. The second\nalgorithm achieves near-optimal dependence on the evolution time $t$ and\nprecision $\\epsilon$ and introduces only an additional $\\tilde{O}(m)$ factor,\nwhich strictly improves upon state-of-the-art gate-based quantum algorithm that\nhas an $\\tilde O(m^2)$ factor. In both our algorithms, the reduction of\ndependence on $m$ significantly enhances the efficiency of simulating practical\ndissipative processes characterized by a large number of jump operators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
