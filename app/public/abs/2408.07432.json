Through the\nuse of filtering techniques we convert the original optimization problem\ninvolving different filtrations, into an equivalent stochastic control problem\nunder the observation filtration only, the so-called separated problem. The\nMarkovian structure of the separated problem allows us to apply a classical\napproach to stochastic optimization based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman\nequation, and to provide explicit formulas for the value function and the\noptimal investment-reinsurance strategy. We finally discuss some comparisons\nbetween the optimal strategies pursued by a partially informed insurer and that\nfollowed by a fully informed insurer, and we evaluate the value of information\nusing the idea of indifference pricing. These results are also supported by\nnumerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
