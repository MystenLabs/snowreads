Any non-trivial\n$S$-character takes a zero value on some group element. By a deep result\ndepending on the classification of finite simple groups a non-trivial\ntransitive permutation character even vanishes on some element of prime power\norder. We present an example that this does not generalise to $S$-characters,\nthereby answering a question posed by J.-P.
