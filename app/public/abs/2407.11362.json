It is shown that these\nalgebras have only trivial automorphism and if the basic field is algebraically\nclosed then it is an open dense subset of the variety of $n$- dimensional\nalgebras. Properties of these sets, depending on $n$, with respect to the\ndirect sum and tensor product are considered. Moreover one more way of\nconstruction of such subsets with similar properties is considered as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"UEVRS-Q-4FhQP0CrSTHXjE92tzWHc0So3n4c5h_MbPw","pdfSize":"134975","objectId":"0xcce2d3319a102550f746d32c3508ea0766f5fdcef545286d42ecd64373297605","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
