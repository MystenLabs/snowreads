In the model,\nIsing spins are placed at network nodes/articles and the steady-state opinion\npolarization of spins is determined from the Monte Carlo iterations in which a\ngiven spin orientation is determined by in-going links from other spins. The\nmain consideration is done for opinion confrontation between {\\it capitalism,\nimperialism} (blue opinion) and {\\it socialism, communism} (red opinion). These\nnodes have fixed spin/opinion orientation while other nodes achieve their\nsteady-state opinions in the process of Monte Carlo iterations. We find that\nthe global network opinion favors {\\it socialism, communism} for all 6\neditions. The model also determines the opinion preferences for world countries\nand political leaders, showing good agreement with heuristic expectations. We\nalso present results for opinion competition between {\\it Christianity} and\n{\\it Islam}, and USA Democratic and Republican parties. We argue that the INOF\napproach can find numerous applications for directed complex networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
