The XXZ model with disorder is\na prototypical example. Without assuming the existence of exponentially\nlocalized integrals of motion (LIOMs), but assuming instead a logarithmic\nlightcone we rigorously evaluate the dynamical generation of $ \\alpha$-R\\'enyi\nentropies, $ 0< \\alpha<1 $ close to one, obtaining a $\\log \\, t$-law. Assuming\nthe existence of LIOMs we prove that the Lieb-Robinson (L-R) bound of the\nsystem's dynamics has a logarithmic lightcone and show that the dynamical\ngeneration of the von Neumann entropy, from a generic initial product state,\nhas for large times a $ \\log \\, t$-shape. L-R bounds, that quantify the\ndynamical spreading of local operators, may be easier to measure in experiments\nin comparison to global quantities such as entanglement.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
