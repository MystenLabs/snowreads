We\nderive the double-row monodromy and find the appropriate formulation of the\nso-called {\\it dual} equation of Sklyanin's. We perform the algebraic Bethe\nansatz based on Sklyanin's recipe, and obtain the RTT (more properly RTRT)\nrelations, from which the spectrum is obtained by repeated action of the $B$\noperator on the pseudovacuum. We obtain the Bethe equations by cancelling the\nunwanted terms, and provide conjectures for the exact formulas for any number\nof quantum particles and magnonic excitations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cH7g666hxJsvcrir9oFzU1h6QMGaa7iJwtv3uCDuLck","pdfSize":"327555"}
