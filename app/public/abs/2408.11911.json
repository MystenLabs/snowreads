We provide bounds on the quantum chromatic number of these\nproducts in terms of the quantum chromatic number of the factors. To adequately\ndescribe bounds on the lexicographic product of quantum graphs, we provide a\nnotion of a quantum $b$-fold chromatic number for quantum graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
