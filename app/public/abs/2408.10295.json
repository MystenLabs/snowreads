Such high quality can be clearly understood in terms of the\ngeneralized global symmetries of the higher-dimensional theory. We emphasize\nthat an electric one-form symmetry is entirely responsible for protecting the\npotential of axions arising from 5D gauge theories and use this to\nsystematically characterize the extra-dimensional axion quality problem. We\nidentify three ways of breaking this one-form symmetry to generate an axion\npotential: adding electrically charged matter, gauging a magnetic higher-form\nsymmetry, and turning on an ABJ anomaly. In the latter case, we identify new\nways of generating an axion potential via extra-dimensional magnetic monopoles.\nWe also discuss how the axion is modified if the protective electric one-form\nsymmetry is itself gauged. Finally, we relate these effects to gravitational\nexpectations for the quality problem via generalized weak gravity conjectures.\nThe clarity that generalized symmetries bring to the extra-dimensional axion\nquality problem highlights their relevance to particle phenomenology.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
