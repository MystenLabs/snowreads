Owing to their specially engineered distribution, these beams\nhave shown remarkable performance in atmospheric turbulence. Specifically,\ninverted pin beams were found to have reduced scintillation index as compared\nto collimated or focused Gaussian beams as well as other types of pin beams\nespecially in moderate to strong turbulence. In this work, we demonstrate that\ninverted pin beams carrying orbital angular momentum can further suppress\nintensity scintillations in moderate to strong irradiance fluctuation\nconditions. Our results can be useful in improving the performance and link\navailability of free-space optical communication systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
