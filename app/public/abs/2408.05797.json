The study site for this paper is the Tampa Bay area in Florida.\nUsing high-resolution atmospheric data from the reanalysis models and\nhistorical water level data from NOAA tide stations, we trained and tested\nthese models to evaluate their performance. Our findings indicate that the\nCNN-LSTM model outperforms the other architectures, achieving a test loss of\n0.010 and an R-squared (R2) score of 0.84. The LSTM model, although it achieved\nthe lowest training loss of 0.007 and the highest training R2 of 0.88,\nexhibited poorer generalization with a test loss of 0.014 and an R2 of 0.77.\nThe 3D-CNN model showed reasonable performance with a test loss of 0.011 and an\nR2 of 0.82 but displayed instability under extreme conditions. A case study on\nHurricane Ian, which caused a significant negative surge of -1.5 meters in\nTampa Bay indicates the CNN-LSTM model's robustness and accuracy in extreme\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v0XV7A8w7dFrPypQQ5XAGx-s1mpUeMPtNh9KZQKHTTs","pdfSize":"1341435"}
