Traditionally, Bayesian\nmodeling coupled with the standard coalescent, is used to infer the sample's\nbifurcating genealogy and demographic and evolutionary parameters such as\neffective population size, and mutation rates. However, there are many\nsituations where binary coalescent models do not accurately reflect the true\nunderlying ancestral processes. Here, we propose a Bayesian nonparametric\nmethod for inferring effective population size trajectories from a\nmultifurcating genealogy under the $\\Lambda-$coalescent. In particular, we\njointly estimate the effective population size and model parameters for the\nBeta-coalescent model, a special type of $\\Lambda-$coalescent. Finally, we test\nour methods on simulations and apply them to study various viral dynamics as\nwell as Japanese sardine population size changes over time. The code and\nvignettes can be found in the phylodyn package.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
