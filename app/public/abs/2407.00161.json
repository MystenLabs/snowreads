This is the essence of the Page and Wootters mechanism.\nMoreover, if the clock is subject to a gravitational-like interaction, relative\ntime evolution is then described by a Time-Dilated Schr\\\"odinger equation, in\nwhich the so-called Redshift Operator describes a purely quantum effect,\nanalogue to gravitational time-dilation. Here we adopt a non-perturbative\napproach and present a finite-dimensional generalisation of this mechanism,\nexpressing the quantum time-dilation effect as an effective interaction\ninvolving previously non-interacting system components. We name this a\nTime-Dilation induced Interaction Transfer (TiDIT) mechanism and discuss an\nexample using two coupled spins as a quantum clock model. Our approach is\nsuitable for implementations in current quantum technology and provides a new\ntool for exploring gravity at the intersection with quantum physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
