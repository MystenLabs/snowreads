Based upon regularizing effects of parabolic\nequations, it is proven that the solution map generates a semiflow in a\ncritical intermediate space. The applicability of the abstract results is\ndemonstrated by several examples including a model for atmospheric flows and\nsemilinear and quasilinear evolution equations with scaling invariance for\nwhich well-posedness in the critical scaling invariant intermediate spaces is\nshown.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tl_WsItXxI0fLPjl29Sl27e2Qar2l32AXEKtu22A9jE","pdfSize":"395585"}
