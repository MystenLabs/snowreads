Our analysis accounts\nfor theory correlations between the relevant hadronic matrix elements through\napplication of dispersive bounds. We find that, within a global analysis, the\ndispersive bounds are generally well respected and only mildly affect the\nextraction of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element $|V_{cs}|$.\nAssuming Standard Model dynamics, we obtain $$\n  |V_{cs}| = 0.957 \\pm 0.003\\,, $$ which is compatible with the HFLAV/PDG\nreference value $|V_{cs}| = 0.975 \\pm 0.006$ at the $2.7\\,\\sigma$ level. Our\nfindings lead to significant deficits in the second-row and second-column\nunitarity relations of the CKM matrix. Allowing for beyond the SM contributions\nin the Weak Effective Theory, we find very strong constraints on potential\n(pseudo)scalar and tensor effects. However, the data still permits sizeable\nCP-violating right-handed currents.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
