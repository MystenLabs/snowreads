The prediction of\ndeep neural networks must contain errors, it is required to update the trained\nmodel to correspond to the real environment to generate robot motion\nadaptively. This study proposes an integration method that connects the\nrobot-motion learning model and LLM using shared latent variables. When\ngenerating robot motion, the proposed method updates shared parameters based on\nprediction errors from both sensorimotor attention points and task language\ninstructions given to the robot. This allows the model to search for latent\nparameters appropriate for the robot task efficiently. Through simulator\nexperiments on multiple robot tasks, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our\nproposed method from two perspectives: position generalization and language\ninstruction generalization abilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
