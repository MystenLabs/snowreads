These observations reveal characteristic sequences of\nnarrow-band, high-frequency bursts exceeding 100 Hz embedded into a slower\nevolution around 1 Hz, persisting for several hours. To explore the potential\nrole of the ion-acoustic instability (IAI) in these phenomena, we begin by\nreviewing classical findings on the IAI within the framework of linear kinetic\ntheory. Focusing on proton distributions comprising both a core and a beam\ncomponent, we analyze the IAI instability range and growth rates within the\nparameter regime relevant to PSP observations. Our findings indicate that the\nIAI can indeed occur in this regime, albeit requiring electron-to-core and\nbeam-to-core temperature ratios slightly different from reported values during\nelectrostatic burst detection. Furthermore, employing 1D kinetic plasma\nsimulations, we validate the growth rates predicted by linear theory and\nobserve the saturation behavior of the instability. The resultant nonlinear\nstructures exhibit trapped proton beam populations and oscillatory signatures\ncomparable to those observed, both in terms of time scales and amplitude.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
