Although the conventional tight-binding\napproximation is not applicable in this setting, the description can still be\nreduced to a discrete model that accounts for the modes below the mobility\nedge. In the respective discrete lattice, where no linear hopping exists,\nsolutions and their dynamics are governed solely by nonlinear interactions.\nFamilies of nonlinear modes, including those with no linear limit, are\ndescribed with a special focus on dimers, which correspond to breather\nsolutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation with a quasi-periodic potential. The\nbreathers are found to be stable for negative scattering lengths. Localization\nand stable propagation of breathers are also observed for positive scattering\nlengths at relatively weak and moderate nonlinearities.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"4xui9So_4Zv3qA0c_Ndi0AWjl31ffgBNILKTJD_-i8k","pdfSize":"559253","objectId":"0xcc64e99a33aa5f53e84772aa3627ba27cf1bdf9c66b9be355c6d631f08fa0c3c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
