For strongly-interacting\ntheories, their non-perturbative determinations from lattice simulations are\ntherefore of primary importance. They entail the inverse Laplace transform of\ncorrelation functions calculated in Euclidean time. By making use of the Mellin\ntransform, we derive explicit analytic formulae to define spectral densities\nfrom the time dependence of correlation functions, both in the continuum and on\nthe lattice. The generalization to smeared spectral densities turns out to be\nstraightforward. The formulae obtained here within the context of lattice field\ntheory can be easily applied or extended to other areas of research.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
