With the\nrecent advancement of observational instruments, it has become possible to\nprobe the strong field regime to test GR. We present the constraints obtained\nfrom the binary black hole inspiral data of the LIGO-Virgo-Kagra (LVK)\ngravitational wave (GW) observations on the deformations of some popular\nparametrized non-Kerr metrics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
