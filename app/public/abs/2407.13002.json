We work on the real\nline, with barycentric cost functions, and as our first result give the\nfollowing characterization of the set of optimal couplings for two probability\nmeasures $\\mu$ and $\\nu$: every optimizer couples the left tails of $\\mu$ and\n$\\nu$ using a submartingale, the right tails using a supermartingale, while the\ncentral region is coupled using a martingale.\n  We then consider a constrained optimal transport problem, where admissible\ntransport plans are only those that are optimal for the WOT problem with $L^1$\ncosts. The constrained problem generalizes the (sub/super-) martingale optimal\ntransport problems, studied by Beiglb\\\"ock and Juillet (2016), and Nutz and\nStebegg (2018) among others.\n  Finally, we introduce a generalized \\textit{shadow measure} and establish its\nconnection to the WOT. This extends and generalizes the results obtained in\n(sub/super-) martingale settings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
