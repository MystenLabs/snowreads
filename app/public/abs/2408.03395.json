In this setting, many requirements acquisition activities, such as\ninterviews, are challenging or lower priority than development and release\nactivities. Moreover, in this early period, requirements are frequently\nchanging as mobile apps evolve to compete in the marketplace. As app\ndevelopment companies move to standardize their development processes, however,\nthey will shift to documenting and analyzing requirements. One low-cost source\nof requirements post-deployment are user-authored scenarios describing how they\ninteract with an app. We propose a method for extracting use case components\nfrom user-authored scenarios using large language models (LLMs). The method\nconsists of a series of prompts that were developed to improve precision and\nrecall on a ground truth dataset of 50 scenarios independently labeled with UC\ncomponents. Our results reveal that LLMs require additional domain knowledge to\nextract UC components, and that refining prompts to include this knowledge\nimproves the quality of the extracted UC components.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wGfPA3YB1zddqD2S3SjIi6jakZH7MQRizljzVj9meQs","pdfSize":"1649553"}
