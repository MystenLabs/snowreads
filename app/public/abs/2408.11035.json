No significant excess above the\nbackground, which is estimated using a data-driven technique, is observed.\nUsing a nonperturbative semiclassical model, upper limits at 95% confidence\nlevel are set on the cross-section for pair production of monopoles with a\nsingle Dirac magnetic charge in the mass range of 20-150 GeV. The search\nsignificantly improves on the previous cross-section limits for production of\nlow-mass monopoles in ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
