Despite\nthe advancements in Deep Learning (DL) and Transformer architectures for HSI\nClassification (HSIC), challenges such as computational efficiency and the need\nfor extensive labeled data persist. This paper introduces WaveMamba, a novel\napproach that integrates wavelet transformation with the Spatial-Spectral Mamba\narchitecture to enhance HSIC. WaveMamba captures both local texture patterns\nand global contextual relationships in an end-to-end trainable model. The\nWavelet-based enhanced features are then processed through the state-space\narchitecture to model spatial-spectral relationships and temporal dependencies.\nThe experimental results indicate that WaveMamba surpasses existing models,\nachieving an accuracy improvement of 4.5\\% on the University of Houston dataset\nand a 2.0\\% increase on the Pavia University dataset. These findings validate\nits effectiveness in addressing the complex data interactions inherent in HSIs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v5i54bAisEobZv-X0w8FqEh5XBwuCC3XlybhfXWEyMA","pdfSize":"3810576"}
