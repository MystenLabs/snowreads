The\ninput-output (I/O) relation can then be reconstructed for a sampled system that\noperates under finite duration and bandwidth constraints. We introduce a\nframework for pilot design in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain which makes it\npossible to support users with very different delay-Doppler characteristics\nwhen it is not possible to choose a single delay and Doppler period to support\nall users. The method is to interleave single pilots in the DD domain, and to\nchoose the pilot spacing so that the I/O relation can be reconstructed by\nsolving a small linear system of equations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
