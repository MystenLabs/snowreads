It is essential to estimate the quality of test\nutterances in order to account for varying acoustic conditions. In addition to\nthe net-speech duration of an utterance, it is observed in this paper that\nphonetic richness is also a key indicator of utterance quality, playing a\nsignificant role in accurate speaker verification. Several phonetic histogram\nbased formulations of phonetic richness are explored using transcripts obtained\nfrom an automatic speaker recognition system. The proposed phonetic richness\nmeasure is found to be positively correlated with voice authentication scores\nacross evaluation benchmarks. Additionally, the proposed measure in combination\nwith net speech helps in calibrating the speaker verification scores, obtaining\na relative EER improvement of 5.8% on the Voxceleb1 evaluation protocol. The\nproposed phonetic richness based calibration provides higher benefit for short\nutterances with repeated words.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2E2jsTT-02HVuUK9k-HcL61u_x1x4oISYNwwlqtt0-I","pdfSize":"489230"}
