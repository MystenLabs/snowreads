We show using superconducting\nLa$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ that there are unconventional interlayer and interorbital\nintrinsic doping effects that render the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital occupation\nsimilar to the cuprates. The results enable a consistent framework for\nnickelate superconductivity, while maintaining the connection between cuprate\nand nickelate superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
