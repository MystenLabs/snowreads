We show that in each step of ISRK, we do not necessarily\nrequire access to the original system matrices, but only to input/output data\nin the form of the system's transfer function, evaluated at particular values\n(frequencies). Numerical examples illustrate the efficiency of the new\ndata-driven formulation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
