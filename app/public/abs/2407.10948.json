The interpretation of this excess as the\nmanifestation of an additional scalar particle at this mass is often claimed to\nbe supported by a previously observed, even smaller, excess in the $\\mathrm{b\n\\bar b}$ invariant mass distribution in LEP data. This short note aims at\nconfronting this claim to factual experimental observations, through a careful\nscrutiny of the detailed LEP public notes written at the time on the topic.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BnyjRtNR0Cx-i_kpdqjykCnUqaPBRXuPdT2_WDh8P9I","pdfSize":"1061868"}
