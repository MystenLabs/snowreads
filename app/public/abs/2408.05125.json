Still\nsome critical properties of the transition, in particular for heterogeneous\nsubstrates, have not been fully elucidated and contradictory results appear in\nthe literature. In this paper we present, by means of a generating functions\napproach, a thorough and complete investigation of percolation critical\nproperties in random networks. We determine all critical exponents, the\nassociated critical amplitude ratios and the form of the cluster size\ndistribution for networks of any level of heterogeneity. We uncover, in\nparticular for highly heterogeneous networks, subtle crossover phenomena,\nnontrivial scaling forms and violations of hyperscaling. In this way we clarify\nthe origin of inconsistencies in the previous literature.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
