Our calculations suggest that with\n$\\delta=0$, the double spin stripe phase is favored as the magnetic ground\nstate. Oxygen vacancies may effectively turn nearest Ni spins into charge\nsites. Consequently, with moderate $\\delta$ values, our theoretical magnetic\nground state exhibits characteristics of both double spin stripe and\nspin-charge stripe configurations, providing a natural explanation to reconcile\nthe seemingly contradictory experimental findings that suggest both the\nconfigurations as candidates for the spin-density-wave phase. With higher\n$\\delta$ values, we anticipate the ground state to become a spin-glass-like\nnoncollinear magnetic phase with only short-range order. The oxygen vacancies\nare expected to significantly impact the magnetic excitations and the\ntransition temperatures $T_{SDW}$. We further offer a plausible explanation for\nthe experimental observations that the measured $T_{SDW}$ appears insensitive\nto the variation of samples and the lack of direct evidence for long-range\nmagnetic ordering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
