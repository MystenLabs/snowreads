Monkeypox can be difficult\nto distinguish from chickenpox and measles in the early stages because the\nsymptoms of all three diseases are similar. Modern deep learning algorithms can\nbe used to identify diseases, including COVID-19, by analyzing images of the\naffected areas. In this study, we introduce a lightweight model that merges two\npre-trained architectures, EfficientNetV2B3 and ResNet151V2, to classify human\nmonkeypox disease. We have also incorporated the squeeze-and-excitation\nattention network module to focus on the important parts of the feature maps\nfor classifying the monkeypox images. This attention module provides channels\nand spatial attention to highlight significant areas within feature maps. We\nevaluated the effectiveness of our model by extensively testing it on a\npublicly available Monkeypox Skin Lesions Dataset using a four-fold\ncross-validation approach. The evaluation metrics of our model were compared\nwith the existing others. Our model achieves a mean validation accuracy of\n96.52%, with precision, recall, and F1-score values of 96.58%, 96.52%, and\n96.51%, respectively.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E2_ocOHYnazd4AuOFLx8fkM7-KqT_8UYhetqY08Jp2c","pdfSize":"3798373"}
