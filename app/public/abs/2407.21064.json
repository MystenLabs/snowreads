In this article, we show that the\nlatter bound, in the specific case of a central binomial coefficient, is larger\nthan the one proposed by Sasvari and obtained using the Binet formula for the\nGamma function. In addition, we provide the expression of the next-order bound\nand apply it to Catalan numbers $C_n$. The bounds are very close to the exact\nvalue, the difference decreasing with $n$ and with the order of the upper\nbound.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
