The effectiveness of the proposed\nstrategy is assessed considering measured data from an actual centrifugal\ncompressor. The statistics obtained for both forward and backward modal\nparameters are finally compared against modal parameters identified during\nstandard stability verification testing (SVT) of centrifugal compressors prior\nto shipment, using classical Experimental Modal Analysis (EMA) algorithms. The\ncurrent work demonstrates that combination of OMA algorithms can provide quite\naccurate estimates for both the modal parameters and the associated\nuncertainties with low computational costs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
