In such a framework, we describe Nash equilibria\nfor mean-field portfolio games of both optimal investment and hedging under\nrelative performance concerns with respect to exponential (CARA) utility\npreferences. Agents have independent individual risk aversions, competition\nweights and initial capital endowments, whereas their liabilities are described\nby contingent claims which can depend on both common and idiosyncratic risk\nfactors. Liabilities may incorporate, e.g., compound Poisson-like jump risks\nand can only be hedged partially by trading in a common but incomplete\nfinancial market, in which prices of risky assets evolve as It\\^{o}-processes.\nMean-field equilibria are fully characterized by solutions to suitable\nMcKean-Vlasov forward-backward SDEs with jumps, for whose we prove existence\nand uniqueness of solutions, without restricting competition weights to be\nsmall.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hEa19WZW21iAODShJn6siRjQdOOxxlSiCYuJ7cWQNIA","pdfSize":"396615"}
