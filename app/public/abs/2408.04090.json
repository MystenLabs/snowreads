We use them to demonstrate\nthe Law of the Iterated Logarithm for these processes when the intensity of the\nPoisson process tends to infinity, with normalization depending on the degree\nof the multiple stochastic integral or degeneracy of the kernel defining the\n$U$-statistic.\n  We apply our results to several classical functionals of Poisson point\nprocesses, obtaining improvements or complements of known concentration of\nmeasure results as well as new laws of the iterated logarithm. Examples include\nsubgraph counts and power length functionals of geometric random graphs,\nintersections of Poisson $k$-flats, quadratic functionals of the\nOrnstein--Uhlenbeck L\\'evy process and $U$-statistics of marked processes.\n  Keywords: Poisson point process, $U$-statistics, multiple stochastic\nintegrals, concentration of measure, The Law of the Iterated Logarithm\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
