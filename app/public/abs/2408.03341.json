It provides classes for rapid\nprototyping of applications and visualization and manipulation of system\nproperties using interactive GUI elements like sliders, images, textboxes,\noption lists, checkboxes and buttons based on Tkinter and Matplotlib.\nParameters and simulation configurations can be stored and managed based on\nSQLite database functions. This technical report describes the main\narchitecture and functions of IVISIT, and provides easy examples how to rapidly\nimplement interactive applications and manage parameter settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
