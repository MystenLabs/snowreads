There has been recent interest in\nother, coarser, expansions of Schubert polynomials. We extend the methods used\nin [KM04] to prove that the subword complex is a ball or a sphere to a more\ngeneral method, and use it to prove that the expansion of a Schubert polynomial\ninto forest polynomials also corresponds to a sum over sub-balls in the subword\ncomplex.\n  When expanding the product $\\mathfrak{S}_\\pi\\mathfrak{S}_\\rho$ of two\nSchubert polynomials into Schubert polynomials $\\mathfrak{S}_\\sigma$, there is\na bijection between shuffles of reduced words for $\\pi$ and $\\rho$ and reduced\nwords for $\\sigma$ (counted with multiplicity). We give such a bijection for\nMonk's rule and Sottile's Pieri rule.\n  We give tableau-based definitions of slide polynomials, glide polynomials,\nand fundamental quasisymmetric polynomials and show that the expansion of a\nSchur polynomial into fundamental quasisymmetric polynomials corresponds to a\nsum over sub-balls in the tableau complex.\n  The Schubert polynomials are the cohomology classes of matrix Schubert\nvarieties, but there is no geometric explanation of the slide polynomials. We\nshow that the slide polynomials are not (antidiagonal) Gr\\\"obner degenerations\nof matrix Schubert varieties, answering in the negative a question of [ST21,\nSection 1.4].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
