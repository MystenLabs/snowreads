This galaxy is originally selected from the MaNGA survey with\ndistinctive bipolar H$\\alpha$ blobs at the minor axis. The bipolar feature can\nbe associated with AGN activity, while the two blobs are classified as the H II\nregions on the BPT diagram, making the origins confusing. The Swift UV\ncontinuum shows that the two blobs do not have UV counterparts, suggesting that\nthe source of ionization is out of the blobs. Consistent with this, the\ndetailed photoionization models prefer to AGN rather than star-forming origin\nwith a significance of 5.8$\\sigma$. The estimated BH mass is $M_{\\rm\nBH}\\sim$7.2$\\times 10^5 M_\\odot$ from the $M_{\\rm BH}-\\sigma_*$ relationship.\nThis work introduces a novel method for detecting the light echo of BHs,\npotentially extending to intermediate mass, in low metallicity environments\nwhere the traditional BPT diagram fails.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
