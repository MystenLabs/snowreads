To address dialect-induced performance discrepancies,\nwe introduce AAVENUE ({AAVE} {N}atural Language {U}nderstanding {E}valuation),\na benchmark for evaluating large language model (LLM) performance on NLU tasks\nin AAVE and Standard American English (SAE). AAVENUE builds upon and extends\nexisting benchmarks like VALUE, replacing deterministic syntactic and\nmorphological transformations with a more flexible methodology leveraging\nLLM-based translation with few-shot prompting, improving performance across our\nevaluation metrics when translating key tasks from the GLUE and SuperGLUE\nbenchmarks. We compare AAVENUE and VALUE translations using five popular LLMs\nand a comprehensive set of metrics including fluency, BARTScore, quality,\ncoherence, and understandability. Additionally, we recruit fluent AAVE speakers\nto validate our translations for authenticity. Our evaluations reveal that LLMs\nconsistently perform better on SAE tasks than AAVE-translated versions,\nunderscoring inherent biases and highlighting the need for more inclusive NLP\nmodels.
