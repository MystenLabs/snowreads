Existing studies on these two categories have relied on the WKB method,\nwhich applies to the low-frequency regime. In our analysis, we have numerically\nevaluated the absorption cross section for the electromagnetic field across all\nfrequency ranges. To compute the absorption cross section, we followed a\ngauge-invariant approach, which avoids the need for gauge fixing for the\nelectromagnetic field, thereby simplifying the methodology further. To\nemphasize the usefulness of this gauge invariant approach we have performed the\nsame analysis for Simpson-Visser class black holes, which is more general in\nterms of the structure of the metric. For both types of regular black holes,\nthe influence of regularity parameters on the absorption cross section reveals\nfundamental properties of their spacetime and their interactions with the\nsurrounding astrophysical environment. Moreover, certain similarities observed\nbetween the Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om black hole and regular black holes of the\nFan-Wang generic class indicate potential scenarios of correspondence between\nlinear and nonlinear electrodynamics when coupled with gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
