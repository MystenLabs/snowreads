(IEEE Trans. IT, May 2015) conjectured that\nfor odd $m$, the minimum distance of the binary BCH code of length $2^m-1$ and\ndesigned distance $2^{m-2}+1$ is equal to the Bose distance calculated in the\nsame paper.\n  In this paper, we prove the conjecture. In fact, we prove a stronger result:\nthe weight of the generating idempotent is equal to the Bose distance for both\nodd and even $m$. Our main tools are some new properties of the so-called\nfibbinary integers, in particular, the splitting field of related polynomials,\nand the relation of these polynomials to the idempotent of the BCH code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
