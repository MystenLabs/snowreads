Precise modeling\nof this phenomena usually requires utilization of the large systems of\nnonlinear ordinary differential equations and intensive computations. We\nconcentrate on performance of three explicit Runge-Kutta time-integration\nmethods and provide simulations for two types of problems: finding of\nequilibrium solutions and simulations for kinetics with periodic solutions. The\nfirst class of problems may be analyzed through the relaxation of the solution\nto the stationary state after large time. In this case, the adaptive\ntime-stepping may help to reach it using big steps reducing cost of the\ncalculations without loss of accuracy. In the second case, the problem becomes\nnumerically unstable at certain points of the phase space and may require tiny\nsteps making the simulations very time-consuming. Adaptive criteria allows to\nincrease the steps for most of points and speedup simulations significantly.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
