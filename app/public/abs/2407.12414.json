We\nrefer to fixed points that saturate this bound as extremal fixed points. The\ntheories which contain such fixed points are those which undergo a saddle-node\nbifurcation, entailing the presence of a marginal operator. Among bifundamental\ntheories, a few examples of infinite families of such theories are known. A\nnecessary condition for extremality is that the sizes of the factors of the\nsymmetry group of a given theory satisfy a specific Diophantine equation, given\nin terms of what we call the extremality polynomial. In this work we study such\nDiophantine equations and employ a combination of rigorous and probabilistic\nestimates to argue that these infinite families constitute rare exceptions. The\nPell equation, Falting's theorem, Siegel's theorem, and elliptic curves figure\nprominently in our analysis. In the cases we study here, more generic classes\nof multi-fundamental theories saturate the Rychkov-Stergiou bound only in\nsporadic cases or in limits where they degenerate into simpler known examples.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dH0Q5BfBFq3UhXJDtTPPKcVhFSmWM___K_qZkzA-IFI","pdfSize":"2691091","objectId":"0x1d912acf25ec2080055a0d19f0d14877e0825d9f0872bbe4eca942d7f7785a87","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
