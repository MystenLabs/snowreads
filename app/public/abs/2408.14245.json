We argue that such a composite ALP emerges as a bound state -- the dark\nglueball -- due to confinement in a pure Yang-Mills dark sector. In a minimal\nultraviolet complete QCD-like model, cosmological production of dark gluons as\nwell as photons occurs via heavy fermion annihilation which effectively reheats\nboth the dark and visible sectors setting up their temperature scales.\nFurthermore, effective interactions between glueballs and photons, resembling\nthose of standard ALPs, are radiatively generated by heavy fermion loops.\nConsequently, DM glueballs interacting with photons are dubbed `Glueball ALPs'\n(GALPs). We uncover novel phenomenology of GALPs focusing on their unique\nastrophysical and cosmological signatures.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
