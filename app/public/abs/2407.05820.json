In this paper, we propose a unique sensor configuration for\nprecise and robust odometry by integrating chip radar and a legged robot.\nSpecifically, we introduce a tightly coupled radar-leg odometry algorithm for\ncomplementary drift correction. Adopting the 4-DoF optimization and decoupled\nRANSAC to mmWave chip radar significantly enhances radar odometry beyond the\nexisting method, especially z-directional even when using a single radar. For\nthe leg odometry, we employ rolling contact modeling-aided forward kinematics,\naccommodating scenarios with the potential possibility of contact drift and\nradar failure. We evaluate our method by comparing it with other chip radar\nodometry algorithms using real-world datasets with diverse environments while\nthe datasets will be released for the robotics community.\nhttps://github.com/SangwooJung98/Co-RaL-Dataset\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
