The\ninnate non-perturbative nature of the QCD medium renders it imperative to\nestimate the transport coefficients in that domain. The present work evaluates\nthe drag and diffusion coefficients of the moving HQ interacting with the\nmedium particles via two-body collisional and three-body radiative processes to\nthe first order in opacity by employing Gribov mechanism for the\nnon-perturbative regime. We proffer the latest results of the HQ transport\ncoefficients computed for the non-perturbative and non-eikonal gluon radiation\noff the HQ. The calculations show significant increment of the transport\ncoefficients with the increasing non-eikonality by juxtaposing the results with\nthose of the pertubative and eikonal regions. We hope to shed fresh light\ntowards explaining the experimental data on the nuclear modification facor,\n$R_{AA}$, the elliptic flow, $v_2$ of the HQ by advocating the importance of\nthe non-eikonality of the gluon radiation off the HQ.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
