Such intriguing potentials serve as\ncrucial test cases for semiclassical approximations. Recent research has\ndemonstrated a deep connection between supersymmetric quantum mechanics and the\nexactness of semiclassical methods. Specifically, the mathematical form of\nconventional shape-invariant potentials guarantees exactness in several related\nsituations. In this manuscript, we review these recent results and discuss\ntheir significance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_I3S6J3nOn51J6BRi1o4lFJwzE5Lfxtd7B1hDd1Htko","pdfSize":"944939"}
