The standard device-agnostic approach\ntreats the QIPs as black boxes that are only constrained by the laws of\nphysics, attaining full generality at a considerable resource cost: numerous\ncircuits built from the gate set must be run in order to amplify each of the\ngate set parameters. In this work, we show that a microscopic parametrization\nof quantum gates under time-correlated noise on the driving phase, motivated by\nrecent experiments with trapped-ion gates, reduces the required resources\nenabling a more efficient version of GST. By making use of the formalism of\nfilter functions over the noise spectral densities, we discuss the minimal\nparametrizations of the gate set that include the effect of finite correlation\ntimes and non-Markovian quantum evolutions during the individual gates. We\ncompare the estimated gate sets obtained by our method and the standard\nlong-sequence GST, discussing their accuracies in terms of established metrics,\nas well as showcasing the advantages of the parametrized approach in terms of\nthe sampling complexity for specific examples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iJCzIOtsPC7QLsPtNCGr2rtyrwJsYQ7Uh8L9VLIrIUc","pdfSize":"2532696"}
