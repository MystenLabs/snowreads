As\nlarge language models (LLMs) are empowered to handle semantic inference and\nnatural language understanding, it remains under-explored how such capabilities\ncan facilitate end-users to configure complex automation more naturally and\neasily. We propose AwareAuto, an EUP system that standardizes user expression\nand finishes two-step inference with the LLMs to achieve automation generation.\nAwareAuto allows contextual, multi-modality, and flexible user expression to\nconfigure complex automation tasks (e.g., dynamic parameters, multiple\nconditional branches, and temporal constraints), which are non-manageable in\ntraditional EUP solutions. By studying realistic, complex rules data, AwareAuto\ngains 91.7% accuracy in matching user intentions and feasibility. We introduced\nuser interaction to ensure system controllability and usability. We discuss the\nopportunities and challenges of incorporating LLMs in end-user programming\ntechniques and grounding complex smart home contexts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
