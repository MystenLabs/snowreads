In this paper, we address the ill-posedness problem for the\nBGK model, in which the solution instantly escapes the initial solution space.\nFor this, we propose two ill-posedness scenarios, namely, the homogeneous and\nthe inhomogeneous ill-posedness mechanisms. In the former case, we find a class\nof spatially homogeneous solutions to the BGK model, where removing the small\nvelocity part of the initial data triggers ill-posedness by increasing\ntemperature. For the latter, we construct a spatially inhomogeneous solution to\nthe BGK model such that the local temperature constructed from the solution has\na polynomial growth in spatial variable. These ill-posedness properties for the\nBGK model pose a stark contrast with the Boltzmann equation for which the\nsolution map is, at least for a finite time, stable in the corresponding\nsolution spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
