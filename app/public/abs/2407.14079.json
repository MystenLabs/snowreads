We prove linear and non linear stability of a\nkinetic sheath equilibrium for a Vlasov-Poisson type system in a bounded\ninterval. Notably, in the linear setting, we obtain exponential decay of the\nfluctuation provided the rate of injection of particles at equilibrium is\nsmaller that the rate of absorption at the wall. In the non linear setting, we\nprove a similar result for small enough equilibrium and small localized\nperturbation of the equilibrium.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
