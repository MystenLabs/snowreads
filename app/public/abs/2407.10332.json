Unassisted,\neducators often do not have time or resources to personally support every\nstudent in a given classroom. Motivated by this issue, and by recent\nadvancements in artificial intelligence, this paper presents a general-purpose\nframework for personalized student support, applicable to any virtual\neducational system such as a serious game or an intelligent tutoring system. To\nfit any educational situation, we apply ontologies for their semantic\norganization, combining them with data collection considerations and\nmulti-agent reinforcement learning. The result is a modular system that can be\nadapted to any virtual educational software to provide useful personalized\nassistance to students.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
