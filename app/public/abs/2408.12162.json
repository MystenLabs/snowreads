In this paper, we\nintroduce reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) technology to enable\nefficient personalized AirFL, mitigating the data heterogeneity issue. First,\nwe achieve statistical interference elimination across different clusters in\nthe personalized AirFL framework via RIS phase shift configuration. Then, we\npropose two personalized aggregation schemes involving power control and\ndenoising factor design from the perspectives of first- and second-order\nmoments, respectively, to enhance the FL convergence. Numerical results\nvalidate the superior performance of our proposed schemes over existing\nbaselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
