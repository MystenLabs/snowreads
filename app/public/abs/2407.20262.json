First, thestructure of the proposed\nhybrid model is introduced, where theembedded neural networks are targeted to\nfit the residuals of theclassical ECM,Second, an iterative offline training\nstrategy isdesigned to train the hybrid model by merging the battery statespace\nequation into the neural network loss function. Last, thebattery online state\nof charge (SOC)estimation is achieved basedon the proposed hybrid model to\ndemonstrate its applicationvalue,Simulation results based on a real-world\nbattery datasetshow that the proposed hybrid model can achieve 29%-64%error\nreduction for $OC estimation under different operatingconditions at varying\nenvironment temperatures.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
