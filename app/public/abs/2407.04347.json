The\nwell-posedness, regularity, and other properties of the model are investigated,\naddressing the lack of theoretical analysis in those existing similar types of\nmodels. Numerical experiments conducted on texture and satellite images\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in denoising and deblurring\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
