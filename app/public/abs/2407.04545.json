Specifically, we propose a\nuniversal method to distill the appearance of a mesh-controlled UNet Gaussian\navatar using an ensemble of linear eigenbasis. We replace heavy CNN-based\narchitectures with a single linear layer improving speed and enabling a range\nof real-time downstream applications. To create a particular facial expression,\none simply needs to perform a dot product between the eigen coefficients and\nthe distilled basis. This efficient method removes the requirement for an input\nmesh during testing, enhancing simplicity and speed in expression generation.\nThis process is highly efficient and supports real-time rendering on everyday\ndevices, leveraging the effectiveness of standard Gaussian Splatting. In\naddition, we demonstrate how the GEM can be controlled using a ResNet-based\nregression architecture. We show and compare self-reenactment and cross-person\nreenactment to state-of-the-art 3D avatar methods, demonstrating higher quality\nand better control. A real-time demo showcases the applicability of the GEM\nrepresentation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
