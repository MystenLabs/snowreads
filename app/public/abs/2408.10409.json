This\nhas caused state-of-the-art DT applications to be validated using offline data.\nHowever, this approach falls short of integrating real-time data, which is one\nof the most important characteristics of DTs. This can limit the validating\neffectiveness of DT applications in cases such as aeronautical ad-hoc networks\n(AANETs). Considering this, we develop a Real-Time Digital Twin Platform and\nimplement core network selection in AANETs as a case study. In this, we\nimplement microservice-based architecture and design a robust data pipeline.\nAdditionally, we develop an interactive user interface using open-source tools.\nUsing this, the platform supports real-time decision-making in the presence of\ndata retrieval failures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
