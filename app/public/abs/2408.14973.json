We have defined\nstatistical Cauchyness and statistical boundedness of sequences and then some\nresults related these ideas have been studied. We have defined the set of rough\nstatistical limit points of a sequence in an $S$-metric space and have proved\nsome relevant results associated with such type of convergence\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
