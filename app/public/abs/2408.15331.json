In particular, we discuss recursions in the loop order and\nspacetime dimension. This results e.g. in new expressions for conformal ladder\nintegrals with generic propagator powers in all even dimensions and allows us\nto lift results on 2d Feynman integrals with underlying Calabi-Yau geometry to\nhigher dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate that the Basso-Dixon\ngeneralizations of these integrals obey different variants of the Toda\nequations of motion, thus establishing a connection to classical integrability\nand the family of so-called tau-functions. We then show that all of these\nintegrals can be written in a double copy form that combines holomorphic and\nanti-holomorphic building blocks. Here integrals in higher dimensions are\nconstructed from an intersection pairing of two-dimensional \"periods\" together\nwith their derivatives. Finally, we comment on extensions to higher-point\nintegrals which provide a richer kinematical setup.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
