Although certain methods\nemploy patch deformation to expand the receptive field, their patches\nmistakenly skip depth edges to calculate areas with depth discontinuity,\nthereby causing ambiguity. Consequently, we introduce Multi-granularity\nSegmentation Prior Multi-View Stereo (MSP-MVS). Specifically, we first propose\nmulti-granularity segmentation prior by integrating multi-granularity depth\nedges to restrict patch deformation within homogeneous areas. Moreover, we\npresent anchor equidistribution that bring deformed patches with more uniformly\ndistributed anchors to ensure an adequate coverage of their own homogeneous\nareas. Furthermore, we introduce iterative local search optimization to\nrepresent larger patch with sparse representative candidates, significantly\nboosting the expressive capacity for each patch. The state-of-the-art results\non ETH3D and Tanks & Temples benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and\nrobust generalization ability of our proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
