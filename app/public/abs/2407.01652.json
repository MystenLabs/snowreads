We consider the effect of finite,\ndigitally sampled velocity records on the triad interactions and find that\nFourier components may interact within a broadened frequency window (finite\noverlap widths), as compared to the usual integrals over infinite ranges where\nFourier components interact by overlapping Dirac delta functions. We also see\nhow the finite domain (temporal and/or spatial) of velocity records has a\nsignificant effect on the efficiency of the triad interactions and thereby on\nthe shape and development of measured velocity power spectra. These finite\nspatial/temporal domains thus influence the measured spatial and temporal\ndevelopment of turbulence, the possibility for non-local interactions and hence\nalso non-equilibrium turbulence, e.g. fractal grid generated turbulence.\nFinally, we quote results from other companion papers that report results from\nlaboratory and numerical experiments of the time development of velocity power\nspectra in a turbulent jet flow into which a single or a couple of Fourier\nmodes are injected.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
