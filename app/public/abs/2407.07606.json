It brings together prior\nwork on the computational learning of form-meaning pairings, which has so far\nbeen studied in several distinct areas of research. The goal of this paper is\nthreefold. First of all, it aims to synthesise the variety of methodologies\nthat have been proposed to date and the results that have been obtained.\nSecond, it aims to identify those parts of the challenge that have been\nsuccessfully tackled and reveal those that require further research. Finally,\nit aims to provide a roadmap which can help to boost and streamline future\nresearch efforts on the computational learning of large-scale, usage-based\nconstruction grammars.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pKhpHTFHKjKbQ4FMb7IMkKngijXhfF361V4K2obl5q8","pdfSize":"362929"}
