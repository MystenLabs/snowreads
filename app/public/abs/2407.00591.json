As drones increasingly play a pivotal role\nacross diverse sectors, integrating crowdsourced drone services within the IoDT\nhas emerged as a vital avenue for democratizing access to these services. A\ncritical challenge, however, lies in ensuring the authenticity and reliability\nof drone service reviews. Leveraging the Ethereum blockchain, DDRM addresses\nthis challenge by instituting a verifiable and transparent review mechanism.\nThe framework innovates with a dual-token system, comprising the Service Review\nAuthorization Token (SRAT) for facilitating review authorization and the Drone\nReputation Enhancement Token (DRET) for rewarding and recognizing drones\ndemonstrating consistent reliability. Comprehensive analysis within this paper\nshowcases DDRM's resilience against various reputation frauds and underscores\nits operational effectiveness, particularly in enhancing the efficiency and\nreliability of drone services.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
