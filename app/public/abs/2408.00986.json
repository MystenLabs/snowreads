However, in safety-critical\ndomains, the deployment of machine learning models is riddled with challenges\ndue to their complexity, lack of interpretability, and absence of formal\nguarantees regarding their behavior. In this paper, we introduce a verification\nframework tailored for Bayesian networks, designed to address these drawbacks.\nOur framework comprises two key components: (1) a two-step compilation and\nencoding scheme that translates Bayesian networks into Boolean logic literals,\nand (2) formal verification queries that leverage these literals to verify\nvarious properties encoded as constraints. Specifically, we introduce two\nverification queries: if-then rules (ITR) and feature monotonicity (FMO). We\nbenchmark the efficiency of our verification scheme and demonstrate its\npractical utility in real-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"AKLNpMaoEgN9GbBn30EwZNNzVycjecrlqskFo7TypCA","pdfSize":"841778","txDigest":"jKcejnkrQk3BqLjgoTvCvx5f2fYXnM1TAQB3eHrWv4H","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
