Let\n$N^0(m,k,n)$ denote the number of odd Durfee symbols of $n$ with odd rank\ncongruent to $m$ modulo $k$. Motivated by Andrews' work, many authors obtained\ngenerating functions of $N^0(m,k,n)$ from which relations between odd ranks are\nproved. In this paper, we establish a family of congruences for odd ranks\nmodulo powers of $5$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
