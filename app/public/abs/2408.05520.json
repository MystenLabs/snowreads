It\nis commonly referred to as a non-perturbative method. Yet, there are certain\ninstances, where the necessary truncation of the hierarchy of auxiliary density\noperators seems to introduce errors which are not fully controllable. We\ninvestigate the nature and causes of this type of critical error both in the\ncase of pure decoherence, where exact results are available for comparison, and\nin the spin-boson system, a full system-reservoir model. We find that\ntruncating the hierarchy to any finite size can be problematic for strong\ncoupling to a dissipative reservoir, in particular when combined with an\nappreciable reservoir memory time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
