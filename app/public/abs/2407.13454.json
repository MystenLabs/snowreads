While hydrocarbon dust is thought to be processed in interstellar\nradiation fields or shocks, detailed processing mechanisms are not completely\nunderstood yet. We investigate the processing of hydrocarbon dust by analyzing\nthe relation between the luminosities emitted by hydrocarbon dust and the total\ninfrared luminosities $(L_{\\mathrm{IR}})$ for 138 star-forming galaxies at\nredshift $z\\ <\\ 0.3$. Using near-infrared 2.5-5 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ spectra\nobtained with AKARI, we derived the luminosities of the aromatic hydrocarbon\nfeature at 3.3 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ ($L_\\mathrm{aromatic}$) and the aliphatic\nhydrocarbon feature at 3.4-3.6 $\\mathrm{\\mu m}$ ($L_\\mathrm{aliphatic}$). We\nalso derived $L_\\mathrm{IR}$ and the radiation field strength by modeling the\nspectral energy distributions of the 138 galaxies with AKARI, WISE and IRAS\nphotometry data. We find that galaxies with higher $L_\\mathrm{IR}$ tend to\nexhibit lower $L_\\mathrm{aliphatic}/L_\\mathrm{aromatic}$ ratios. Furthermore,\nwe find that there is an anti-correlation between\n$L_\\mathrm{aliphatic}/L_\\mathrm{aromatic}$ ratios and the radiation field\nstrength, and also that the galaxies with low\n$L_\\mathrm{aliphatic}/L_\\mathrm{aromatic}$ ratios are dominated by merger\ngalaxies. These results support that hydrocarbon dust is processed through\nphotodissociation in strong radiation fields and/or shocks during merging\nprocesses of galaxies; the $L_\\mathrm{aliphatic}/L_\\mathrm{aromatic}$ ratio is\nlikely to decrease in such harsh interstellar conditions since the aliphatic\nbonds are known to be chemically weaker than the aromatic bonds.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
