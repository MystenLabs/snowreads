Nevertheless, with the increasing granularity\nand complexity of vehicle-generated data, the lack of data quality audits\nraises concerns about multi-party mistrust in trajectory prediction tasks. In\nresponse, this paper proposes an asynchronous federated learning data sharing\nmethod based on an interpretable reputation quantization mechanism utilizing\ngraph neural network tools. Data providers share data structures under\ndifferential privacy constraints to ensure security while reducing redundant\ndata. We implement deep reinforcement learning to categorize vehicles by\nreputation level, which optimizes the aggregation efficiency of federated\nlearning. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data sharing\nscheme not only reinforces the security of the trajectory prediction task but\nalso enhances prediction accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
