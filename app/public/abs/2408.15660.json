An example is the generation of panorama images, which has been\ntackled in recent works by combining independent diffusion paths over\noverlapping latent features, which is referred to as joint diffusion, obtaining\nperceptually aligned panoramas. However, these methods often yield semantically\nincoherent outputs and trade-off diversity for uniformity. To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose the Merge-Attend-Diffuse operator, which can be plugged\ninto different types of pretrained diffusion models used in a joint diffusion\nsetting to improve the perceptual and semantical coherence of the generated\npanorama images. Specifically, we merge the diffusion paths, reprogramming\nself- and cross-attention to operate on the aggregated latent space. Extensive\nquantitative and qualitative experimental analysis, together with a user study,\ndemonstrate that our method maintains compatibility with the input prompt and\nvisual quality of the generated images while increasing their semantic\ncoherence.
