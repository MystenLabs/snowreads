In this context, variational quantum\nalgorithms (VQA) are a promising family of hybrid quantum-classical methods\ntailored to cope with the limited capability of near-term quantum hardware.\nHowever, their effectiveness is hampered by the complexity of the classical\nparameter optimization which is prone to getting stuck either in local minima\nor in flat regions of the cost-function landscape. The clever design of\nefficient optimization methods is therefore of fundamental importance for fully\nleveraging the potential of VQAs. In this work, we approach parameter\noptimization as a sequential decision-making problem and tackle it with an\nadaptation of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), a common artificial intelligence\ntechnique designed for efficiently exploring complex decision graphs. We show\nthat leveraging regular parameter patterns deeply affects the decision-tree\nstructure and allows for a flexible and noise-resilient optimization strategy\nsuitable for near-term quantum devices. Our results shed further light on the\ninterplay between artificial intelligence and quantum information and provide a\nvaluable addition to the toolkit of variational quantum circuits.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
