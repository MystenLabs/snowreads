However, a key challenge remains in the evaluation of\ndata-driven algorithms within DTs, particularly the transfer of learning from\nsimulations to real-world environments. In this work, we investigate the\nsim-to-real gap in developing a digital twin for the NSF PAWR Platform, POWDER.\nWe first develop a 3D model of the University of Utah campus, incorporating\ngeographical measurements and all rooftop POWDER nodes. We then assess the\naccuracy of various path loss models used in training modeling and control\npolicies, examining the impact of each model on sim-to-real link performance\npredictions. Finally, we discuss the lessons learned from model selection and\nsimulation design, offering guidance for the implementation of DT-enabled\nwireless networks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
