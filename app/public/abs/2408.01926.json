We first address scalar-on-tensor problem\nby proposing scalar-output regression tree models whose input variable are\ntensors (i.e., multi-way arrays). We devised and implemented fast randomized\nand deterministic algorithms for efficient fitting of scalar-on-tensor trees,\nmaking TT competitive against tensor-input GP models. Based on scalar-on-tensor\ntree models, we extend our method to tensor-on-tensor problems using additive\ntree ensemble approaches. Theoretical justification and extensive experiments\non real and synthetic datasets are provided to illustrate the performance of\nTT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
