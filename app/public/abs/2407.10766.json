Following an earlier work [Comm.\nMath. Phys. {\\bf 302}, 815-841 (2011)], establishing a theorem for the\nexistence of such structures, we bring to bear a combination of\nanalysis-inspired numerical tools that permit the construction of such wave\nforms to a desired numerical accuracy. In addition, this enables us to explore\ntheir numerical stability. Our computations show that for the spatially\nheterogeneous form of the $\\phi^4$ model considered herein, the breather\nsolutions are generically found to be unstable. Their instability seems to\ngenerically favor the motion of the relevant structures. We expect that these\nresults may inspire further studies towards the identification of stable\ncontinuous breathers in spatially-heterogeneous, continuum nonlinear wave\nequation models.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
