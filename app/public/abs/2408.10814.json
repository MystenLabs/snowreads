Substantial advancements have been made in CSP\nof inorganic and molecular crystals, while hybrid materials, including\nmetal-organic frameworks (MOFs), have been unfairly overlooked. The ab initio\ntechniques adopted for the CSP of MOFs cannot be scaled to a high-throughput\nregime, which is required for efficient exploration of the immense chemical\nspace. Here, we propose a data-driven method to tackle current needs of\ncomputational MOF discovery. By examining CSP through the lens of reticular\nchemistry, coarse-grained neural networks were implemented to predict\nunderlying net topology of crystal graphs. The models showed satisfactory\nperformance, which was next enhanced by limiting the applicability domain. Flue\ngas separation was used as an illustrative example to validate the proposed CSP\napproach. Several hundred in silico-generated systems revealed a notable\ndiscrepancy in adsorption capacity among competing polymorphs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
