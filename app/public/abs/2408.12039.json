We say that percolation on\n$G_n$ has a sharp phase transition (as $n \\to \\infty$) if, as the percolation\nparameter crosses some critical point, the number of vertices contained in the\nlargest percolation cluster jumps from logarithmic to linear order with high\nprobability. We prove that percolation on $G_n$ has a sharp phase transition\nunless, after passing to a subsequence, the rescaled graph-metric on $G_n$\n(rapidly) converges to the unit circle with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff\nmetric. We deduce that under the same hypothesis, the critical point for the\nemergence of a giant (i.e. linear-sized) cluster in $G_n$ coincides with the\ncritical point for the emergence of an infinite cluster in the\nBenjamini-Schramm limit of $(G_n)$, when this limit exists.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
