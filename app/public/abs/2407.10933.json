Both\nspecies form extended powerlaw distributions that extend nearly three decades\nin energy. The primary drive mechanism for the production of these nonthermal\nparticles is Fermi reflection within evolving and coalescing magnetic flux\nropes. While the powerlaw indices of the two species are comparable, the\nprotons overall gain more energy than electrons and their power law extends to\nhigher energy. The power laws roll into a hot thermal distribution at low\nenergy with the transition energy occurring at lower energy for electrons\ncompared with protons. A strong guide field diminishes the production of\nnon-thermal particles by reducing the Fermi drive mechanism. In solar flares,\nproton power laws should extend down to 10's of keV, far below the energies\nthat can be directly probed via gamma-ray emission. Thus, protons should carry\nmuch more of the released magnetic energy than expected from direct\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lOrmJoY3EcPSPYZgu_An2e3ianIKkvsjwXQIJFtSdUQ","pdfSize":"7502614","objectId":"0xd71e658a7d2cf36ab52d419bc3f8b912270454d4671960d3528122b4341409db","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
