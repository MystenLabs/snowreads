This makes accurate identification of deviations in\nthese fields particularly challenging. Especially for 3D brain MRI data, all\nthe state-of-the-art models are reconstruction-based with 3D convolutional\nneural networks which are memory-intensive, time-consuming and producing noisy\noutputs that require further post-processing. We propose a framework called\nSimple Slice-based Network (SimpleSliceNet), which utilizes a model pre-trained\non ImageNet and fine-tuned on a separate MRI dataset as a 2D slice feature\nextractor to reduce computational cost. We aggregate the extracted features to\nperform anomaly detection tasks on 3D brain MRI volumes. Our model integrates a\nconditional normalizing flow to calculate log likelihood of features and\nemploys the Semi-Push-Pull Mechanism to enhance anomaly detection accuracy. The\nresults indicate improved performance, showcasing our model's remarkable\nadaptability and effectiveness when addressing the challenges exists in brain\nMRI data. In addition, for the large-scale 3D brain volumes, our model\nSimpleSliceNet outperforms the state-of-the-art 2D and 3D models in terms of\naccuracy, memory usage and time consumption.
