However, multiple KG embeddings can perform\nalmost equally well for link prediction yet suggest conflicting predictions for\ncertain queries, termed \\textit{predictive multiplicity} in literature. This\nbehavior poses substantial risks for KGE-based applications in high-stake\ndomains but has been overlooked in KGE research. In this paper, we define\npredictive multiplicity in link prediction. We introduce evaluation metrics and\nmeasure predictive multiplicity for representative KGE methods on commonly used\nbenchmark datasets. Our empirical study reveals significant predictive\nmultiplicity in link prediction, with $8\\%$ to $39\\%$ testing queries\nexhibiting conflicting predictions. To address this issue, we propose\nleveraging voting methods from social choice theory, significantly mitigating\nconflicts by $66\\%$ to $78\\%$ according to our experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
