This poses two main challenges: effectively\nleveraging multi-view information and mitigating the impact of missing views.\nPrevailing solutions employ cross-view contrastive learning and missing view\nrecovery techniques. However, they either neglect valuable complementary\ninformation by focusing only on consensus between views or provide unreliable\nrecovered views due to the absence of supervision. To address these\nlimitations, we propose a novel Unified and Robust Representation Learning for\nIncomplete Multi-View Clustering (URRL-IMVC). URRL-IMVC directly learns a\nunified embedding that is robust to view missing conditions by integrating\ninformation from multiple views and neighboring samples. Firstly, to overcome\nthe limitations of cross-view contrastive learning, URRL-IMVC incorporates an\nattention-based auto-encoder framework to fuse multi-view information and\ngenerate unified embeddings. Secondly, URRL-IMVC directly enhances the\nrobustness of the unified embedding against view-missing conditions through KNN\nimputation and data augmentation techniques, eliminating the need for explicit\nmissing view recovery. Finally, incremental improvements are introduced to\nfurther enhance the overall performance, such as the Clustering Module and the\ncustomization of the Encoder. We extensively evaluate the proposed URRL-IMVC\nframework on various benchmark datasets, demonstrating its state-of-the-art\nperformance. Furthermore, comprehensive ablation studies are performed to\nvalidate the effectiveness of our design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
