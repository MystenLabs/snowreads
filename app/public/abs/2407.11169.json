We show that the rethermalization of the axion fluid\nduring the initial collapse of large scale overdensities near cosmic dawn\ntransports angular momentum outward sufficientlly fast that black holes form\nwith masses ranging from approximately $10^5$ to a few times $10^{10}~M_\\odot$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
