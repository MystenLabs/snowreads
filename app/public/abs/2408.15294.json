We previously introduced a\nperson-centric ontology to organize information about individual patients, and\na representation learning framework to extract person-centric knowledge graphs\n(PKGs) and to train Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). In this paper, we propose a\nsystematic approach to examine the results of GNN models trained with both\nstructured and unstructured information from the MIMIC-III dataset. Through\nablation studies on different clinical, demographic, and social data, we show\nthe robustness of this approach in identifying predictive features in PKGs for\nthe task of readmission prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
