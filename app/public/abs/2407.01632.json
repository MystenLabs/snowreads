We construct the\nspaces of generalized functions, where such problems have solutions. In\nparticular, the solvability space of a periodic analogue of the Mizohata\nequation is constructed. We build also a periodic analogue and a generalization\nof the construction of the nonstandard analysis, where infinitely smalls are\nnot only functions, but also functional spaces.\n  To show that not all constructions on the torus lead to a simplification in\ncompare with the plane, we consider a periodic analogue of the hypoelliptic\ndifferential operator and show that its number-theoretic properties are\nsignificant. In particular, it turns out that if a polynomial with integer\ncoefficients is irreducible in the rational field, then the corresponding\ndifferential operator is hypoelliptic on the torus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-MXFPMYrx3hjFSfktvEybEUOTnhrsVmLxI7QcVcnz_U","pdfSize":"148275","objectId":"0x377a2f6f0e00fe548580606789a11b3b74f50cc82932b259699a2d5889015e47","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
