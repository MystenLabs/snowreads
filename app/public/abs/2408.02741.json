Enabled by strong\ninteractions associated with Rydberg blockade, they allow for simulation of\ncomplex spin models and quantum dynamics. We introduce a new Floquet\nengineering technique for systems in the blockade regime that provides control\nover novel forms of interactions and entanglement dynamics in such systems. Our\napproach is based on time-dependent control of Rydberg laser detuning and\nleverages perturbations around periodic many-body trajectories as resources for\noperator spreading. These time-evolved operators are utilized as a basis for\nengineering interactions in the effective Hamiltonian describing the\nstroboscopic evolution. As an example, we show how our method can be used to\nengineer strong spin exchange, consistent with the blockade, in a\none-dimensional chain, enabling the exploration of gapless Luttinger liquid\nphases. In addition, we demonstrate that combining gapless excitations with\nRydberg blockade can lead to dynamic generation of large-scale multi-partite\nentanglement. Experimental feasibility and possible generalizations are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
