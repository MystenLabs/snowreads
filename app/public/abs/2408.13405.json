Sideband optical interferometry has\nalso been used for the detection of the in-plane mechanical vibrations, for\nwhich conventional optical interferometry is not effective. These experiments\ndemonstrate a GHz fundamental compression mode with a Q-factor >10^7 at\ntemperatures near 7 K, providing a promising platform for reaching the quantum\nregime of spin mechanics, especially phononic cavity QED of electron spins.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OfBldf_yFQeVw93F7LUPoUx7LVOT8ec09tvYUkUUE5Q","pdfSize":"990410"}
