The change that most affects future\nanalyses is the ND280 upgrade, which will constrain interaction models in new\nways. At the same time the analysis continues to be developed, both by\ncombining with the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric measurements and with\nrefinements to the T2K-only analysis. This proceedings describes the highlights\nof these analyses, and the status of the various T2K upgrades.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H0l4u7AIdI22i6CLgVsEtuO-r4OfDutPRV5I8Sz7EcQ","pdfSize":"1342528"}
