However,\nsimply reducing the number of Gaussians to accommodate devices with less memory\ncapacity leads to inferior quality compared to the quality that can be achieved\non high-end hardware. To address this lack of scalability, we propose\nintegrating a Flexible Level of Detail (FLoD) to 3DGS, to allow a scene to be\nrendered at varying levels of detail according to hardware capabilities. While\nexisting 3DGSs with LoD focus on detailed reconstruction, our method provides\nreconstructions using a small number of Gaussians for reduced memory\nrequirements, and a larger number of Gaussians for greater detail. Experiments\ndemonstrate our various rendering options with tradeoffs between rendering\nquality and memory usage, thereby allowing real-time rendering across different\nmemory constraints. Furthermore, we show that our method generalizes to\ndifferent 3DGS frameworks, indicating its potential for integration into future\nstate-of-the-art developments.
