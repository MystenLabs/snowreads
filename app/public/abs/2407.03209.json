We classify the systems having this property by studying, when\nit is possible, some obstructions described by Malmquist, and by reducing them\nto second-order equations of the first degree in one variable, for which the\nanalysis of Painlev\\'e and Gambier can be applied. We find that, in many cases,\novercoming Malmquist's obstructions guarantees the absence of movable critical\npoints.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
