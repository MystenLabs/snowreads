The difference of RQST with conventional tomography methods is in\nthe implementation of rotation operators and construction of density matrix\nfrom the measured data sets. We demonstrate efficient quantum state control of\nthe electron spin at room temperature with an average fidelity of 0.995 over\nmore than 40 measurements on different states on the Bloch sphere with a\nmaximum fidelity of 0.99992. Also, we apply the methodology to the dark NV\nnuclear spin state. The state is read via the electron spin using the C-NOT\ntwo-qubit entanglement gate and demonstrate fidelities of the same order.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
