Using various equivalence groups, we\nclassify such equations in two-component and three-component cases. In a\nfour-component case, we add further evidence to the conjecture that there\nexists only one integrable system of the above type. Finally, we give an\nexample of the six-component system with required bi-Hamiltonian structure. To\nstreamline the symbolic computation we develop an algorithm to find the\naforementioned Hamiltonian operators, which includes putting forward a\nconjecture on the structure of the metric parameterising the first-order\nHamiltonian operator.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"jBsHnV2C8XRlwcchTQHqr1xaqXHQ0g6m2Zo_hkFSszU","pdfSize":"321252"}
