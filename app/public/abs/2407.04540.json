Specifically, we\nimprove over the work of Bakshi, Liu, Moitra, and Tang [BLMT24], by reducing\nthe sample complexity and runtime dependence to singly exponential in the\ninverse-temperature parameter, as opposed to doubly exponential. Our main\ntechnical contribution is a new flat polynomial approximation to the\nexponential function, with significantly lower degree than the flat polynomial\napproximation used in [BLMT24].\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
