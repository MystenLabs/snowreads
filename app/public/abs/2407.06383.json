For systems with\nmultiple stable equilibria, so-called metastable transitions between these\nequilibria are required for mixing since the unique invariant distribution is\nconcentrated on these equilibria. Consequently, these systems exhibit slower\nmixing compared to those with a unique stable equilibrium, as analyzed in\nBarrera and Jara (Ann. Appl. Probab. 30:1164-1208, 2020). . Our proof is based\non the theory of metastability, which is a primary tool for studying systems\nwith multiple stable equilibria. Within this framework, we compute the total\nvariation distance between the distribution of the diffusion process and its\ninvariant distribution for any time scale larger than $\\epsilon^{-1}$. Finally,\nwe derive precise asymptotics for the mixing time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
