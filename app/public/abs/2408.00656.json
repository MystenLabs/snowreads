ML potentials based on the\nAtomic Cluster Expansion (ACE) framework have recently shown promising\nperformance for this purpose. Here, we describe a largely automated\ncomputational approach to optimizing hyperparameters for ACE potential models.\nWe extend our openly available Python package, XPOT, to include an interface\nfor ACE fitting, and discuss the optimization of the functional form and\ncomplexity of these models based on systematic sweeps across relevant\nhyperparameters. We showcase the usefulness of the approach for two example\nsystems: the covalent network of silicon and the phase-change material\nSb$_{2}$Te$_{3}$. More generally, our work emphasizes the importance of\nhyperparameter selection in the development of advanced ML potential models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
