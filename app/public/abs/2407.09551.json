By employing a\npretrained stable diffusion model and a highly accurate gender classification\nTransformer, the research introduces two reward functions: Rshift for shifting\ngender imbalances, and Rbalance for achieving and maintaining gender balance.\nExperiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in mitigating bias\nwithout compromising image quality or requiring additional data or prompt\nmodifications. While focusing on gender bias, this work establishes a\nfoundation for addressing various forms of bias in AI systems, emphasizing the\nneed for responsible AI development. Future research directions include\nextending the methodology to other bias types, enhancing the RLAIF pipeline's\nrobustness, and exploring multi-prompt fine-tuning to further advance fairness\nand inclusivity in AI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nptON5mgAk8KNUVl8vSeCF6UzVsYWe3e7KRIGJoHf2k","pdfSize":"11288145"}
