We call this a\ndiagonal transformation of a multivariate normal. In this paper we compute\nexactly the mean vector and covariance matrix of the random vector $\\boldsymbol\nY.$ This is done two different ways: One approach uses a series expansion for\nthe function $f_i$ and the other a transform method. We compute several\nexamples, show how the covariance entries can be estimated, and compare the\ntheoretical results with numerical ones.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8ufIb-crAJBeDw3i1KngmsxWt89YDNh6tzjZwpJcbJ0","pdfSize":"241206","objectId":"0x72d645cf25e1456a1dacdcacfaff4f16e58f58d4a2a998ce1cac312942cd91cc","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
