We recovered the memory of\nthe poorly known Italian astronomer Giovanni Battista Hodierna, who published\nthe first catalogue of stellar binaries over a century before Mayer and\nHerschel. We analysed the fourth section of 1654 G. B. Hodierna's book \"De\nsystemate orbis cometici deque admirandis coeli characteribus\". There, Hodierna\nlisted a dozen pairs of stars whose identification with modern star names had\nbeen lost for centuries. To identify the pairs, we used Hodierna's Latin\ndescriptions of location in constellations for all primary stars, ecliptic\ncoordinates and angular separations to companions for some, and the Washington\nDouble Star, Hipparcos, and Gaia catalogues. We were able to identify the\ntwelve primaries and eleven multiple systems with companions, of which nine\nwere double and two were triple. Besides, with up-to-date data, we confirmed\nthat four systems are physically bound: Atlas and Pleione, alpha1,2 Lib, nu1,2\nDra, and theta1 Ori A, C, and D. The other seven pairs are alignments of very\nbright stars at different distances.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
