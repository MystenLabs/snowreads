Its zero-shot learning capabilities accelerate AI deployment and\nenhance the generalizability of clinical applications. However, segmenting\npathological images presents a special focus on the flexibility of segmentation\ntargets. For instance, a single click on a Whole Slide Image (WSI) could\nsignify a cell, a functional unit, or layers, adding layers of complexity to\nthe segmentation tasks. Current models primarily predict potential outcomes but\nlack the flexibility needed for physician input. In this paper, we explore the\npotential of enhancing segmentation model flexibility by introducing various\ntask prompts through a Large Language Model (LLM) alongside traditional task\ntokens. Our contribution is in four-fold: (1) we construct a\ncomputational-efficient pipeline that uses finetuned language prompts to guide\nflexible multi-class segmentation; (2) We compare segmentation performance with\nfixed prompts against free-text; (3) We design a multi-task kidney pathology\nsegmentation dataset and the corresponding various free-text prompts; and (4)\nWe evaluate our approach on the kidney pathology dataset, assessing its\ncapacity to new cases during inference.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
