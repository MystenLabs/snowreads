To achieve this, we\nintroduce a new parameter known as the subsurface assignment variable, which\ndetermines the number of STAR-RIS elements allocated to each user. We then\nformulate a novel optimization problem by concurrently optimizing the phase\nshifts of the STAR-RIS and subsurface assignment variable. We leverage the deep\nreinforcement learning (DRL) technique to address this optimization problem.\nThe DRL model predicts the phase shifts of the STAR-RIS and efficiently\nallocates elements of STAR-RIS to the users. Additionally, we incorporate a\npenalty term in the DRL model to facilitate intelligent deactivation of\nSTAR-RIS elements when not in use to enhance energy efficiency. Through\nextensive experiments, we show that the proposed method can achieve fairly high\nand nearly equal data rates for all users in both the transmission and\nreflection spaces in an energy-efficient manner.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
