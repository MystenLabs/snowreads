Given the advent of Non-Terrestrial\nNetworks (NTN), reaching these goals will be much closer to realization than\never before. Owing to the benefits of NTN, the integration NTN and Terrestrial\nNetworks (TN) is still infancy, where the past, the current and the future\nreleases in the 3$^{\\text{rd}}$ Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) provide\nguidelines to adopt a successfully co-existence/integration of TN and NTN.\nTherefore, in this article, we have illustrated through 3GPP guidelines, on how\nNTN and TN can effectively be integrated. Moreover, the role of beamforming and\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) algorithms is highlighted to achieve this\nintegration. Finally the usefulness of integrating NTN and TN is validated\nthrough experimental analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
