The generating\nfunctions have a representation-theoretic origin and are the analogs of the\n1/4-BPS dyon counting formula in $\\mathcal{N}=4$ theories involving the Weyl\ndenominator formula of a Borcherds-Kac-Moody Lie algebra. A general form of the\ngenerating function is suggested based on the Lie algebra associated to the\nadjacency matrix of the BPS quiver whenever the BPS spectrum of the\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ theory admits such a description. This proposal is tested for\nthe BPS spectrum of Seiberg-Witten SU(2) theory as well as for the\n$D6$-$D2$-$D0$ BPS structure of the resolved conifold which are both captured\nby an affine $A_1$ Lie algebra and are obtained from limits of the\n$\\mathcal{N}=4$ generating function. The general proposal also reproduces the\ncorrect BPS spectra and wall-crossing structures for the Argyres-Douglas $A_2$\ntheory. We further discuss connections to scattering diagrams studied in the\ncontext of stability structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
