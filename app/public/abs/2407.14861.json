Yet,\nnon-randomized studies frequently face selection biases, requiring mitigation\nstrategies. Propensity score matching (PSM) addresses these biases by selecting\ncomparable populations, allowing for analysis without further methodological\nconstraints. However, PSM has several drawbacks. Different matching methods can\nproduce significantly different Average Treatment Effects (ATE) for the same\ntask, even when meeting all validation criteria. To prevent cherry-picking the\nbest method, public authorities must involve field experts and engage in\nextensive discussions with researchers.\n  To address this issue, we introduce a novel metric, A2A, to reduce the number\nof valid matches. A2A constructs artificial matching tasks that mirror the\noriginal ones but with known outcomes, assessing each matching method's\nperformance comprehensively from propensity estimation to ATE estimation. When\ncombined with Standardized Mean Difference, A2A enhances the precision of model\nselection, resulting in a reduction of up to 50% in ATE estimation errors\nacross synthetic tasks and up to 90% in predicted ATE variability across both\nsynthetic and real-world datasets. To our knowledge, A2A is the first metric\ncapable of evaluating outcome correction accuracy using covariates not involved\nin selection.\n  Computing A2A requires solving hundreds of PSMs, we therefore automate all\nmanual steps of the PSM pipeline. We integrate PSM methods from Python and R,\nour automated pipeline, a new metric, and reproducible experiments into\npopmatch, our new Python package, to enhance reproducibility and accessibility\nto bias correction methods.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
