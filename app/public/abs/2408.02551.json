To this respect, this work introduces a\nnovel approach called process-constrained batch Bayesian optimization via\nThompson sampling (pc-BO-TS) and its generalized hierarchical extension\n(hpc-BO-TS). This method, tailored for the efficiency demands in multi-reactor\nsystems, integrates experimental constraints and balances between exploration\nand exploitation in a sequential batch optimization strategy. It offers an\nimprovement over other Bayesian optimization methods. The performance of\npc-BO-TS and hpc-BO-TS is validated in synthetic cases as well as in a\nrealistic scenario based on data obtained from high-throughput experiments done\non a multi-reactor system available in the REALCAT platform. The proposed\nmethods often outperform other sequential Bayesian optimizations and existing\nprocess-constrained batch Bayesian optimization methods. This work proposes a\nnovel approach to optimize the yield of a reaction in a multi-reactor system,\nmarking a significant step forward in digital catalysis and generally in\noptimization methods for chemical engineering.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jhOIutwMuzop60vHApEGa2YK9E8q7HSFMfzOTUrfYKk","pdfSize":"1272198"}
