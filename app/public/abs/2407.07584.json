We introduce approximate versions of weak and\nbranching bisimulation, as well as a notion of $\\varepsilon$-perturbed\nbisimulation that relates LMCs that can be made (exactly) probabilistically\nbisimilar by small perturbations of their transition probabilities. We explore\nhow the notions interrelate and establish their connections to other well-known\nnotions like $\\varepsilon$-bisimulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
