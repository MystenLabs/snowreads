It focuses on qubit channels corresponding to two-qubit circulant\nstates that satisfy Bell's nonlocality condition. The main part is devoted to a\ncharacterization of nonlocality generating maps on the examples of both unital\nand non-unital maps. The advantage of this approach is that nonlocality of\nbipartite states can be controlled with a single parameter. The study reveals\ninteresting geometric properties of quantum channels, contributing to the field\nof quantum nonlocality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
