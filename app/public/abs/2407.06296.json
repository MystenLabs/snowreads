In modern applications, a multi-robot team must collaboratively\nexplore unknown spatial fields in GPS-denied and extreme environments where\nglobal localization is unavailable. Coverage algorithms typically assume that\nthe robot positions and the coverage environment are defined in a global\nreference frame. However, coordinating robot motion and ensuring coverage of\nthe shared convex workspace without global localization is challenging. This\npaper proposes a novel anchor-oriented coverage (AOC) approach to generate\ndynamic localized Voronoi partitions based around a common anchor position. We\nfurther propose a consensus-based coordination algorithm that achieves\nagreement on the coverage workspace around the anchor in the robots' relative\nframes of reference. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments,\nwe demonstrate that the proposed anchor-oriented approach using localized\nVoronoi partitioning performs as well as the state-of-the-art coverage\ncontroller using GPS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
