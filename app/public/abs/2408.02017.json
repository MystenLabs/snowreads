It is proved that the FPUT lattice problem has a generalized\nsolitary-wave solution with the amplitude of those ripples algebraically small\nusing dynamical system approach. The problem is first formulated as a dynamical\nsystem problem and then the center manifold reduction theorem with Laurent\nseries expansion is applied to show that this system can be reduced to a system\nof ordinary differential equations with dimension five. Its dominant system has\na homoclinic solution. By applying a perturbation method and adjusting some\nappropriate constants, it is shown that this homoclinic solution persists for\nthe original dynamical system, which connects to a periodic solution of\nalgebraically small amplitude at infinity (called generalized homoclinic\nsolution), which yields the existence of a generalized solitary wave for the\nFPUT lattice. The result presented here with the algebraic smallness of those\nripples will be needed to show the existence of generalized multi-hump waves\nfor the FPUT lattice later.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
