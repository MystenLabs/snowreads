Here we\nintroduce a photonic crystal fiber with a germanium-doped core featuring group\nvelocity matching at 1550 nm, the telecoms C-band, and 920 nm, within the\nemission range of efficient single photon sources based on InAs quantum dots.\nWith low chromatic walk-off and good optical guidance even at long wavelengths,\nlarge lengths of this fiber are used to achieve nanometer-scale frequency\nshifts between wavelengths around 920 nm with up to 79.4\\% internal conversion\nefficiency, allowing dissimilar InAs dots to be interfaced. We also show how\ncascading this frequency conversion can be used to generate a frequency comb\naway from telecoms wavelengths. Finally, we use the fiber to demonstrate\ntunable frequency conversion of weak classical signals around 918 nm to the\ntelecoms C-band.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
