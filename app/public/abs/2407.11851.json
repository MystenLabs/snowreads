It has been shown that quantum simulations of spin\nmodels with this system can naturally be used to solve number partition\nproblems. Here, we present encoding schemes for numerous NP-complete problems,\nencompassing the majority of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. We find a number\nof such computation problems can be encoded by the atom-cavity system at a\nlinear cost of atom number. There are still certain problems that cannot be\nencoded by the atom-cavity as efficiently, such as quadratic unconstrained\nbinary optimization (QUBO), and the Hamiltonian cycle. For these problems, we\nprovide encoding schemes with a quadratic or quartic cost in the atom number.\nWe expect this work to provide important guidance to search for the practical\nquantum advantage of the atom-cavity system in solving NP-complete problems.\nMoreover, the encoding schemes we develop here may also be adopted in other\noptical systems for solving NP-complete problems, where a similar form of\nMattis-type spin glass Hamiltonian as in the atom-cavity system can be\nimplemented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
