In particular, we define\nrough stochastic integration and establish solutions to rough stochastic\ndifferential equations with jump discontinuities in both sources of noise,\nalong with an It\\^o formula for stochastic controlled paths with jumps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
