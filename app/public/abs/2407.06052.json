Yet, broadly\napplicable methods are missing to determine, in the biological system of\nchoice, antibody specificity and its quantitative contribution to e.g.\nimmunofluorescence stainings. Thereby, antibody-based data often needs to be\nseen with caution. Here, we present a simple-to-use approach to characterize\nand quantify antibody binding properties directly in the system of choice. We\ndetermine an epitope accessibility distribution in the system of interest based\non a computational analysis of antibody-dilution immunofluorescence stainings.\nThis allows the selection of specific antibodies, the choice of a dilution to\nmaximize signal-specificity, and an improvement of signal quantification. It\nfurther expands the scope of antibody-based imaging to detect changes of the\nsubcellular nano-environment and allows for antibody multiplexing.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
