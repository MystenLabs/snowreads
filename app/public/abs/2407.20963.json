Such muons are dominantly\nproduced in charged current (CC) muon neutrino - hadron interactions. However,\nmuons are also produced through the $W$ - boson production and in the decay of\ntau leptons and heavy mesons created in neutral and charged current\ninteractions induced by all neutrino flavors. In this paper, we investigate the\ncontribution of these subleading channels to events characterized as tracks at\nthe IceCube. Our results indicate that these channels correspond to a non -\nnegligible fraction of the HESE track events. In addition, we show that its\ncontributions are concentrated in muons that are less energetic than those\narising from muonic neutrino CC interactions for the same visible energies of\nthe process. Finally, we investigate the impact of these additional channels on\nthe description of the astrophysical neutrino flux, and we find that the\ninclusion of these subleading processes are important in determining the\nparameters of the astrophysical neutrino flux.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
