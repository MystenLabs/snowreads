Unidirectional domain transfer would omit information\nabout the target samples and result in suboptimal adaptation when there are\nlarge domain shifts. Therefore, we propose a pairwise attentive adversarial\nnetwork with a Domain Mixup (DomMix) module to mitigate the aforementioned\nchallenges. Specifically, a deep-level mixup is employed to construct an\nintermediate domain that allows features from both domains to share their\ndifferences. Then a pairwise attentive adversarial network is applied with\nattentive encoding on both image-level and instance-level features at different\nscales and optimizes domain alignment by adversarial learning. This allows the\nnetwork to focus on regions with disparate contextual information and learn\ntheir similarities between different domains. Extensive experiments are\nconducted on several benchmark datasets, demonstrating the superiority of our\nproposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
