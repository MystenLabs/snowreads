We derive the classification of such ultra-localized\ninsulators in all symmetry classes and dimensions. We clarify their\nbulk-boundary correspondence and show that ultra-localized systems are in many\ninstances phases of matter not described by the known classification of\ntopological insulators and superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
