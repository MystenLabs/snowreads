Our approach is applicable to\nsystems where observations are scarce (or even lacking), these being typical\nsituations associated with subsurface water bodies. Our novel physics-informed\nneural network under uncertainty (PINN-UU) integrates the space-time domain\nacross which processes take place and uncertain parameter spaces within a\nunique computational domain. PINN-UU is then trained to satisfy the relevant\nphysical principles (e.g., mass conservation) in the defined input domain. We\nemploy a stage training approach via transfer learning to accommodate\nhigh-dimensional solution spaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PINN-UU\nin a scenario associated with reactive transport in porous media, showcasing\nits reliability, efficiency, and applicability to sensitivity analysis. PINN-UU\nemerges as a promising tool for robust uncertainty quantification, with broad\napplicability to groundwater systems. As such, it can be considered as a\nvaluable alternative to traditional methods such as multi-realization Monte\nCarlo simulations based on direct solvers or black-box surrogate models.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
