Visual\nnavigation and local mapping have shown a relatively good performance in\nopen-field environments. However, globally consistent mapping and long-term\nlocalization still depend on the robustness of loop detection and closure, for\nwhich the literature is scarce. In this work we propose a novel method to pave\nthe way towards robust loop detection in open fields, particularly in\nagricultural settings, based on local feature search and stereo geometric\nrefinement, with a final stage of relative pose estimation. Our method\nconsistently achieves good loop detections, with a median error of 15cm. We aim\nto characterize open fields as a novel environment for loop detection,\nunderstanding the limitations and problems that arise when dealing with them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
