Most visual sensors are either too slow or their data\nare too complex to provide meaningful information and low latency input to a\nrobotic system. Data output of an event camera is high-frequency and extremely\nlightweight, with only 8 bytes per event. To evaluate the hypothesis of using\nevent cameras as data source for a real-time robotic system, the position of a\nwaving hand is acquired from the event data and transmitted to a collaborative\nrobot as a movement command. A total time delay of 110 ms was measured between\nthe original movement and the robot movement, where much of the delay is caused\nby the robot dynamics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i9R4LRcInacxRP_-3ndfVeJDVt1u5o4fP46rKgojOSM","pdfSize":"480093"}
