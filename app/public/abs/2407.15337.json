However, reconstructing thermal scenes in 3D presents several\nchallenges due to the comparatively lower resolution and limited features\npresent in long-wave infrared (LWIR) images. To overcome these challenges, we\npropose a unified framework for scene reconstruction from a set of LWIR and RGB\nimages, using a multispectral radiance field to represent a scene viewed by\nboth visible and infrared cameras, thus leveraging information across both\nspectra. We calibrate the RGB and infrared cameras with respect to each other,\nas a preprocessing step using a simple calibration target. We demonstrate our\nmethod on real-world sets of RGB and LWIR photographs captured from a handheld\nthermal camera, showing the effectiveness of our method at scene representation\nacross the visible and infrared spectra. We show that our method is capable of\nthermal super-resolution, as well as visually removing obstacles to reveal\nobjects that are occluded in either the RGB or thermal channels.
