The ridge regression is the\nmost commonly used alternative; however, its generalized version has hardly\nbeen analyzed. The present work addresses the estimation of this generalized\nversion, as well as the calculation of its mean squared error, goodness of fit\nand bootstrap inference.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MMH2z8FD853l7EBMcTudfuQgBfHP5kiOeGcOs0n-BnY","pdfSize":"445575"}
