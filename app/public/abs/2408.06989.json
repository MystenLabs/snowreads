We show how the validity of\nthe Moser-Trudinger inequality can be extended from a local to a global scale\nunder additional assumptions: either by assuming the validity of the Poincar\\'e\ninequality, or by imposing a stronger norm condition. We apply these results to\nHadamard manifolds. The technique is general enough to be applicable also in\nsub-Riemannian settings, such as the Heisenberg group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
