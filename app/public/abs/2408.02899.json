There is a\ngrowing demand for vector representations of stock, i.e., stock embedding, in\nwealth management sectors, and the method has been applied to various tasks\nsuch as stock price prediction, portfolio optimization, and similar fund\nidentifications. Stock embeddings have the advantage of enabling the\nquantification of relative relationships between stocks, and they can extract\nuseful information from unstructured data such as text and network data. In\nthis study, we propose stock embedding enhanced with textual and network\ninformation (SETN) using a domain-adaptive pre-trained transformer-based model\nto embed textual information and a graph neural network model to grasp network\ninformation. We evaluate the performance of our proposed model on related\ncompany information extraction tasks. We also demonstrate that stock embeddings\nobtained from the proposed model perform better in creating thematic funds than\nthose obtained from baseline methods, providing a promising pathway for various\napplications in the wealth management industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
