A neural network,\ncombined with a pseudo-arclength continuation, is proposed to construct\nbifurcation diagrams from parameterized nonlinear PDEs. Additionally, a neural\nnetwork approach is also presented for solving eigenvalue problems to analyze\nsolution linear stability, focusing on identifying the largest eigenvalue. The\neffectiveness of the proposed neural network is examined through experiments on\nthe Bratu equation and the Burgers equation. Results from a finite difference\nmethod are also presented as comparison. Varying numbers of grid points are\nemployed in each case to assess the behavior and accuracy of both the neural\nnetwork and the finite difference method. The experimental results demonstrate\nthat the proposed neural network produces better solutions, generates more\naccurate bifurcation diagrams, has reasonable computational times, and proves\neffective for linear stability analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"5jDsyhMP3iAiv9ffwNvEQ77a6omHr_YQyK4QUrPw96A","pdfSize":"1322547"}
