We validate the implementation in the SHERPA event generator\nwith data from the H1 and ZEUS experiments for diffractive DIS and diffractive\nphotoproduction. For the latter, we review different models aiming to explain\nthe observed factorisation breaking and we argue that at NLO the direct\ncomponent must also be suppressed. We provide predictions for diffractive jet\nproduction both in DIS and in photoproduction events for the upcoming EIC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
