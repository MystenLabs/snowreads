Our\nstudy focuses on introducing hardware architectures for both UPA and CPA.\nThrough thorough analysis and experimentation, we observe that the hardware\nimplementation of UPA exhibits superior resource usage and reduced energy\nconsumption compared to CPA for the vanilla IPA decoder. This finding\nunderscores a critical insight: software optimizations, in isolation, may not\nnecessarily translate into hardware cost-effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
