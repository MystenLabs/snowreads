This feature is\nachieved by applying the Faddeev-Kulish formalism, which implies a redefinition\nof both the asymptotic electronic states and of the $S$ matrix. Additionally,\nwe have also derived the infrared-finite one-loop partial-wave amplitudes for\nthis process by applying a recent method in the literature. Next, these\npartial-wave amplitudes are unitarized based on analyticity and unitarity by\nemploying three different methods of unitarization: the algebraic $N/D$ method,\nthe Inverse Amplitude Method and the first iterated $N/D$ method. Then, we have\nstudied several partial waves both for physical momentum and for complex ones\nto look for bound-state poles. The binding momentum for the fundamental bound\nstate in $S$ wave is discussed with special detail. This is a wide-ranging\nmethod for calculating nonperturbative partial-wave amplitudes for\ninfinite-range interactions that could be applied to many other systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
