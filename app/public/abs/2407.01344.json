Our framework facilitates\nsafe decision-making in scenarios with incomplete information about the\nunderlying decision-dependent distributions, relying instead on accessible\nreference distributions. To tackle the challenge of decision-dependent\nuncertainty, we introduce an algorithm named repeated robust risk minimization.\nThis algorithm decouples the decision variables associated with the ambiguity\nset from the expected loss, optimizing the latter at each iteration while\nkeeping the former fixed to the previous decision. By leveraging the strong\nconnection between distributionally robust optimization and regularization, we\nestablish a linear convergence rate to a performatively stable point and\nprovide a suboptimality performance guarantee for the proposed algorithm.\nFinally, we examine the performance of our proposed model through an\nexperimental study in strategic classification.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ladm0Ja31Fimk9LAE4UgNLb2YoWY6CZlHZ-aGZcWUeY","pdfSize":"582073"}
