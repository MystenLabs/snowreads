In a Euclidean space, convex sets and smooth\nmanifolds both have straightforward local geometry. However, in the most basic\nhybrid case of feasible regions consisting of pre-images of convex sets under\nmaps that are once (but not necessarily twice) continuously differentiable, the\ngeometry is less transparent. We define a new approximate convexity property,\nthat holds both for such feasible regions and also for all prox-regular sets.\nThis new property requires that nearby points can always be joined by smooth\nfeasible paths that are almost straight. In particular, in the terminology of\nreal algebraic geometry, such feasible regions are locally normally embedded in\nthe Euclidean space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
