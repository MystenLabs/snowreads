The proposed method is free from any kind of priori\nchosen parameter or ordering information of objective functions. Using this\nmethod, global Pareto front can be generated for non-convex problems with more\nthan one local front. An algorithm is developed using some ideas of single\nobjective tunneling method. Convergence of this algorithm is justified under\nsome mild assumptions. In addition to this, some numerical examples are\nincluded to justify the theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
