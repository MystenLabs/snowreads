As usual, we prove that any element\nin the completion can be developed as a unique continued fractions, whose\ncoefficients are polynomials in roots of the variable, and that this\napproximation is the best ''rational'' Diophantine approximation of such\nelement. Then, we interpret the preceding result in terms of the action of a\nsuitable arithmetic subgroup of the special linear group on the Berkovich space\ndefined over the said completion. We also explore the connections between\npoints of type IV of the Berkovich space in terms of some ''non-convergent'' or\n''undefined'' continued fractions, in a sense that we make precise in the text.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
