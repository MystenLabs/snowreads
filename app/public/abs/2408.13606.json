By\nappropriately reparameterizing the model, we establish a formal metric for\nquantifying each individual's influencing capacity and estimating their latent\nposition embedded in a social space. This modeling approach introduces a novel\nmechanism for fully characterizing the diffusion of an idea based on the\nestimated latent characteristics. It assumes that each individual takes the\nfollowing states: Unknown, undecided, supporting, or rejecting an idea. This\napproach is demonstrated using a influence network from Twitter (now\n$\\mathbb{X}$) related to the 2022 Tax Reform in Colombia. An exhaustive\nsimulation exercise is also performed to evaluate the proposed diffusion\nprocess.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H0MsVXf1GThBfvNTM1ZzERewPTNLKce9yQU8kMFPM28","pdfSize":"2799051"}
