The\nwindow comprises the spectral region of 18.99 to 19.01GHz (that falls within\nthe Ku microwave band), with a center frequency of 19.00GHz (+0.1GHz), with\nequivalence to a corresponding axion mass range of 78.6 to 79.6 micro-eV, with\nthe center mass at the value of 78.582 (+5.0) micro-eV, our suggested most\nlikely value for an axionic/ALP field mass, if these fields exist in nature.\nOur search strategy, as summarized herewith, is based upon the assumption that\nthe dark matter that exists in the current epoch of our physical universe is\ndominated by axions and thus the local observable axion density is the density\nof the invisible light cold dark matter, permeating our local neighborhood\n(mainly in the Milky Way galactic halo). Some ideas and the design of an\nexperiment, built around a Josephson Parametric Amplifier and Resonant\nTunneling Diode in a resonant RF cavity, are also introduced in this report.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yXU3tUVCrFCMO6Udl0Wflk5jy2gC_hVDQ4rwm0uRGxc","pdfSize":"966932"}
