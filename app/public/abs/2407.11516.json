In this paper we present a systematic overview\nand analysis of the second edition held in 2022. We describe the voice\nanonymisation task and datasets used for system development and evaluation,\npresent the different attack models used for evaluation, and the associated\nobjective and subjective metrics. We describe three anonymisation baselines,\nprovide a summary description of the anonymisation systems developed by\nchallenge participants, and report objective and subjective evaluation results\nfor all. In addition, we describe post-evaluation analyses and a summary of\nrelated work reported in the open literature. Results show that solutions based\non voice conversion better preserve utility, that an alternative which combines\nautomatic speech recognition with synthesis achieves greater privacy, and that\na privacy-utility trade-off remains inherent to current anonymisation\nsolutions. Finally, we present our ideas and priorities for future VoicePrivacy\nChallenge editions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
