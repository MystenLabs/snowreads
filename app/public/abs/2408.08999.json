Using density functional theory,\nwe demonstrate that 2D-CRO maintains structural stability down to the monolayer\nlimit, exhibiting a tight interplay between structural and electronic\nproperties. Notably, 2D-CRO displays altermagnetic behavior, characterized by\nzero net magnetization and strong spin-dependent phenomena, stabilized through\ndimensionality reduction. This stability is achieved by breaking inversion\nsymmetry along the z-axis, favoring altermagnetic properties even in the\nabsence of van der Waals interactions. Through theoretical models and\ncomputational analysis, we explore the altermagnetic behavior of 2D-CRO, both\nwith and without spin-orbit coupling. We identify the spin components that\ncontribute to the altermagnetic character and highlight the potential of 2D-CRO\nas a promising material for investigating altermagnetic phenomena and\ntopological features.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
