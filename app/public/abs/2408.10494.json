The\noperators are constructed by splitting the simplices into quadrilateral or\nhexahedral subdomains, mapping tensor-product SBP operators onto the\nsubdomains, and assembling back using a continuous-Galerkin-type procedure.\nThese tensor-product split-simplex operators do not have repeated degrees of\nfreedom at the interior interfaces between the split subdomains. Furthermore,\nthey satisfy the SBP property by construction, leading to stable\ndiscretizations. The accuracy and sparsity of the operators substantially\nenhance the efficiency of SBP discretizations on simplicial meshes. The\nsparsity is particularly important for entropy-stable discretizations based on\ntwo-point flux functions, as it reduces the number of two-point flux\ncomputations. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that the operators\nexhibit efficiency surpassing that of the existing dense multidimensional SBP\noperators by more than an order of magnitude in many cases. This superiority is\nevident in both accuracy per degree of freedom and computational time required\nto achieve a specified error threshold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
