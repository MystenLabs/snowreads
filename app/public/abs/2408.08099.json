In recent years, several approaches\nhave been introduced and improved to analyze these fields using topological\nfeatures, such as degenerate tensor locations, i.e., the tensor has repeated\neigenvalues, or normal surfaces. Traditionally, the identification of such\nfeatures has been limited to single tensor fields. However, it has become\ncommon to create ensembles to account for uncertainties and variability in\nsimulations and measurements. In this work, we explore novel methods for\ndescribing and visualizing degenerate tensor locations in 3D symmetric\nsecond-order tensor field ensembles. We base our considerations on the tensor\nmode and analyze its practicality in characterizing the uncertainty of\ndegenerate tensor locations before proposing a variety of visualization\nstrategies to effectively communicate degenerate tensor information. We\ndemonstrate our techniques for synthetic and simulation data sets. The results\nindicate that the interplay of different descriptions for uncertainty can\neffectively convey information on degenerate tensor locations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
