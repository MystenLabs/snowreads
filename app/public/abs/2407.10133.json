{"id":"2407.10133","title":"Programming Manipulators by Instructions","authors":"Rafael de la Guardia","authorsParsed":[["de la Guardia","Rafael",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 14 Jul 2024 09:33:08 GMT"},{"version":"v2","created":"Sun, 28 Jul 2024 18:55:40 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-30","timestamp":1720949588000,"abstract":"  We propose an instructions-based approach for robot programming where the\nprogrammer interacts with the robot by issuing simple commands in a scripting\nlanguage, like python. Internally, these commands make use of pre-programmed\nmotion and manipulation skills coordinated by a behaviour tree task controller.\nA knowledge graph keeps track of the state of the robot and the environment and\nof all the instructions given to the robot by the programmer. This allows to\neasily transform sequences of instructions into new skills that can be reused\nin the same or in other tasks. An advantage of this approach is that the\nprogrammer does not need to be located physically next to the robot, but can\nwork remotely, either with a physical robot or with a digital twin. To\ndemonstrate the concept, we show an interactive simulation of a robot\nmanipulator in a pick and place scenario.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
