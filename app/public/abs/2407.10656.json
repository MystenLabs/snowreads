Using the data for 15\nhydrogen (Hi) VLA super spirals and the Tully-Fisher relation we obtain\nconstraints for each galaxy. The results are consistent with previous results\nfor spiral galaxies, as well as with the scaling relations for the halos, thus\nconfirming the efficiency of the use of dark halo data and Tully-Fisher\nrelation, including the baryonic Tully{Fisher index (BTFR), for testing\nmodified gravity models.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hZImjUlc5oty2Dqz3e4AIgL8rKmt5_etiyHNAzP96bk","pdfSize":"115598"}
