Likewise,\nnew methods of counterfeit detection are developed that are, e.g., based on\nPhysical Unclonable Functions (PUFs). In order to ensure trust and integrity of\nproduct lifecycle data, multiple existing supply chain tracing systems are\nbuilt on blockchain technology. However, only few solutions employ secure\nidentifiers such as PUFs. Furthermore, existing systems that publish the data\nof individual products, in part fully transparently, have a detrimental impact\non scalability and the privacy of users. This work proposes SPOQchain, a novel\nblockchain-based platform that provides comprehensive lifecycle traceability\nand originality verification while ensuring high efficiency and user privacy.\nThe improved efficiency is achieved by a sophisticated batching mechanism that\nremoves lifecycle redundancies. In addition to the successful evaluation of\nSPOQchain's scalability, this work provides a comprehensive analysis of privacy\nand security aspects, demonstrating the need and qualification of SPOQchain for\nthe future of supply chain tracing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
