However, these harmonics\nare not detected in the presence of substantial measurement irregularities.\n  In summary, the NLSA approach can be used to both extract the seasonal cycle\nmore accurately than linear methods, but likewise detect irregular signals\nresulting from irregular land-atmosphere interactions or measurement failures.\nImproving the detection capabilities of time-series decomposition is essential\nfor improving land-atmosphere interactions models that should operate\naccurately on any time scale.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NrJFPAjvykfQZYNwrYgmkDNjqA-5eOGph-ytJENcC0s","pdfSize":"9691728","objectId":"0x9c5bbd37c50446d751e7c40b0022b4524184dd38b78d05ea1ea41bd570356f0a","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
