In contrast to General Relativity, we show that the\nNariai spacetime is not the only solution of this type when general $f(R)$\ntheories are considered. In particular, we find four different solutions for\nthe non-constant Ricci scalar case, all of them corresponding to the same\ntheory, given by $f(R) = r_0^{-1}\\left\\lvert R-3/r_0^2\\right\\rvert^{1/2}$,\nwhere $r_0$ is a non-null constant. Finally, we briefly present some geometric\nproperties of these solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MSj9qq7mjAzwO7ll_odQPoxOoEe6dRacLm_Y_3ht78o","pdfSize":"542126"}
