In recent years, spin torque nano-oscillators\n(STNOs) have emerged as a promising platform for a variety of applications in\nnanoscale systems such as neuromorphic computing, due to their compact size,\nlow power consumption, and tunable properties. However, achieving\nsynchronization in a large array of STNOs remains a challenge, for the\ncomplexity of the interactions between the oscillators. To address this\nchallenge, we report on the achievement of synchronization across a 2D array of\nSTNOs. We designed a honeycomb model that created a network of interactions\namong the oscillators that only involved nearest neighbors. Using micromagnetic\nsimulations, we demonstrated the effectiveness of our design and observed that\nglobal synchronization across the whole array. Such global synchronization can\nalso be tuned by enable/disenable next-nearest neighbor interactions. We also\nfound that our design enables synchronization at room temperature, which is\ncrucial for practical applications. Our work contributes to the growing body of\nresearch on the synchronization of coupled oscillators in spintronics and could\npave the way for the development of new types of spintronic devices and\npotential applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
