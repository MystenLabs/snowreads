One intriguing possibility is that planet 9 could be a\ndilute axion star captured by the solar system, with the ratio of the axion\nstar to dark matter being approximately 1/10. Although dilute axion stars can\nemit monochromatic signals through two-photon decay, the spontaneous decay\nsignal is too weak to be detected by radio telescopes. However, we find that\nstimulated decay of the dilute axion star, which explains planet 9, can occur\nby directing a radio beam with a power of 50MW into the star. The resulting\necho can be detected by terrestrial telescopes such as SKA, FAST, ngLOBO, and\nLOFAR. Therefore, the dilute axion star can be distinguished from other planet\n9 candidates, such as a primordial black hole or a free-floating planet\ncaptured by the solar system.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
