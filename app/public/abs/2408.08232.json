In the literature, it is known that the Aubin property\nimplies the constraint nondegeneracy by Fusek [SIAM J. Optim. 23 (2013), pp.\n1041-1061] and the second-order sufficient condition by Ding et al. [SIAM J.\nOptim. 27 (2017), pp. 67-90]. Based on the Mordukhovich criterion, here we\nfurther prove that the strong second-order sufficient condition is also\nnecessary for the Aubin property to hold. Consequently, several equivalent\nconditions including the strong regularity are established for NLSDP's Aubin\nproperty. Together with the recent progress made by Chen et al. on the\nequivalence between the Aubin property and the strong regularity for nonlinear\nsecond-order cone programming [arXiv:2406.13798v1 (2024)], this paper\nconstitutes a significant step forward in characterizing the Aubin property for\ngeneral non-polyhedral $C^2$-cone reducible constrained optimization problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
