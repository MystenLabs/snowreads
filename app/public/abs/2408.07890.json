Based on the\nframework of causal graphical models, previous works have proposed identifying\nwhether a variable is a cause or non-cause of a target in every Markov\nequivalent graph solely by learning a local structure. However, the presence of\nprior knowledge, often represented as a partially known causal graph, is common\nin many causal modeling applications. Leveraging this prior knowledge allows\nfor the further identification of causal relationships. In this paper, we first\npropose a method for learning the local structure using all types of causal\nbackground knowledge, including direct causal information, non-ancestral\ninformation and ancestral information. Then we introduce criteria for\nidentifying causal relationships based solely on the local structure in the\npresence of prior knowledge. We also apply out method to fair machine learning,\nand experiments involving local structure learning, causal relationship\nidentification, and fair machine learning demonstrate that our method is both\neffective and efficient.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
