Reducing the requisite number of qubits\nand gates is essential to fit a quantum algorithm onto near-term quantum\ndevices. Inspired by the Newton-Girard method, we developed an algorithm that\nuses only $\\mathcal{O}(r)$ qubits and $\\mathcal{O}(r)$ multi-qubit gates, where\n$r$ is the rank of $\\rho$. We prove that the estimation of\n$\\{\\text{Tr}(\\rho^i)\\}_{i=1}^r$ is sufficient for estimating the trace of\npowers with large $k > r$. With these advantages, our algorithm brings the\nestimation of the trace of powers closer to the capabilities of near-term\nquantum processors. We show that our results can be generalized for estimating\n$\\text{Tr}(M\\rho^k)$, where $M$ is an arbitrary observable, and demonstrate the\nadvantages of our algorithm in several applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_J4tvtynjRgbL9puCn7ooOFp1eq9T_yqSGqNHpJIY8E","pdfSize":"3194765"}
