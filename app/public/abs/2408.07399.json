The microscopic\nfoundations are established, leading to Green-Kubo and Einstein-Helfand\nformulas for the transport coefficients, including the vacancy conductivities\nand the coefficients of vacancy thermodiffusion. As a consequence of having\nintroduced the chemical potential of vacancies, a relationship is obtained\nbetween the conductivities and the Fickian diffusion coefficients for the\nvacancies. The macroscopic equations are linearized around equilibrium to\ndeduce the dispersion relations of the eight hydrodynamic modes. The\ntheoretical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations of the\nhard-sphere crystal with vacancies. The study explicitly shows that the eighth\nhydrodynamic mode of nonperfect monatomic crystals is indeed a mode of vacancy\ndiffusion.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
