We introduce a\nnovel method and successfully test it in application to the Schwinger model in\nthe presence of a topological $\\theta$-term. We explore the\nfirst-order-phase-transition and the no-transition regions of the corresponding\nphase diagram. The core idea of the method is to separately evolve the ground\nand the first excited states with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, the\ntime-dependence of which interpolates between different values of $\\theta$.\nDespite our approach being a direct application of the adiabatic theorem, in\nsome cases we are able to demonstrate its advantages in comparison to a\ndifferent method from the literature that also employs adiabatic state\npreparation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"euCpwLMvz-rPvEzlwEdEuW-FYQKG32VTX44HY0EIfks","pdfSize":"1148669"}
