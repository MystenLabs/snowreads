Traditional speech emotion recognition (SER) systems,\nwhich typically rely on a singular, precise emotion label, struggle with this\ncomplexity. Therefore, modeling the inherent ambiguity of emotions is an urgent\nproblem. In this paper, we propose an iterative prototype refinement framework\n(IPR) for ambiguous SER. IPR comprises two interlinked components: contrastive\nlearning and class prototypes. The former provides an efficient way to obtain\nhigh-quality representations of ambiguous samples. The latter are dynamically\nupdated based on ambiguous labels -- the similarity of the ambiguous data to\nall prototypes. These refined embeddings yield precise pseudo labels, thus\nreinforcing representation quality. Experimental evaluations conducted on the\nIEMOCAP dataset validate the superior performance of IPR over state-of-the-art\nmethods, thus proving the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
