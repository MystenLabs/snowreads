When imaged from the Earth's\nground, images may be polluted by terrestrial clouds which hinder the detection\nof solar structures. We propose a new method to remove cloud shadows, based on\na U-Net architecture, and compare classical supervision with conditional GAN.\nWe evaluate our method on two different imaging modalities, using both real\nimages and a new dataset of synthetic clouds. Quantitative assessments are\nobtained through image quality indices (RMSE, PSNR, SSIM, and FID). We\ndemonstrate improved results with regards to the traditional cloud removal\ntechnique and a sparse coding baseline, on different cloud types and textures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zCl9PGdZ3KIDxN8IIyGv-EC2rBt86_Vn-6LtOaHYYxE","pdfSize":"5318397","objectId":"0xff0f5d8c914313c1bc2fb4dc79b4abed46a6ab72c00f74b1f29a577b4c018c37","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
