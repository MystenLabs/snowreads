This representation is intrinsic, but requires to identify some\npoints through an equivalence relation. On the other hand, embedding a surface\nin a Euclidean space is not intrinsic but does not require to identify points.\nIn the present paper, we are interested in the M\\\"obius strip, the torus, and\nthe real projective plane. More precisely, we construct explicit\nhomeomorphisms, as well as their inverses, from cellular complexes to surfaces\nof 3-dimensional (for the M\\\"obius strip and the torus) and 4-dimensional (for\nthe projective plane) Euclidean spaces. All the embeddings were already known,\nbut we are not aware if explicit formulas for their inverses exist.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
