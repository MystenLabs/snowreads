This idea\nis examined further in $t$-$x$ as well as $\\tau$-$p$ domain. We suggest better\nways to deconvolve data in $\\tau$-$p$ domain, taking into account varying\ndegree of convolution in this domain. We derive formulae for periods of surface\nmultiples in $\\tau$-$p$ domain, e.g., water column peg-legs and reverberations,\nwhich have a fixed period depending only on the value of $p$ -- and suggest a\nway to check/revise the picked velocity using the formulae, provided the\nmultiples are well separated from the primary. Periodicity of two way surface\nmultiples is also studied.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
