A paradigmatic example is that of a double-slit experiment,\nwhere observing the interference pattern on the screen in a series of\nexperimental settings where one, the other, and both slits are open\nunambiguously proves quantum coherence. Here we show that this is not necessary\nby verifying quantum coherence in a network scenario without the need for\ninputs. We show that there exist probability distributions for joint outcomes\nof three parties in a triangular network with independent sources that cannot\nbe replicated using classical resources. Furthermore, we generalize our results\nto $n$-party networks and show that the discrepancy between correlations in\nclassical and quantum networks increases with the number of parties. To this\nend, we derive nonlinear inequalities that are satisfied by classical\ncorrelations and find quantum states that violate them.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"asPlp6iHeG1Hl50lZujndOQo1zZXWsKWyZOzjO8KWpQ","pdfSize":"2732218"}
