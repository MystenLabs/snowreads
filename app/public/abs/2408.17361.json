We furthermore consider future scenarios in which\nresource-intensive, large geospatial models may homogenize the representation\nof complex landscapes, and suggest strategies to prepare for this condition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
