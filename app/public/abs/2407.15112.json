We also\nfind several other necessary and sufficient conditions in this thread such that\na Banach sapce becomes a Hilbert space. We construct examples of strict\ncontractions on non-Hilbert Banach spaces that do not dilate to isometries.\nThen we characterize all strict contractions on a non-Hilbert Banach space that\ndilate to isometries and find explicit isometric dilation for them. We prove\nseveral other results including characterizations of complemented subspaces in\na Banach space, extension of a Wold isometry to a Banach space unitary and\ndescribing norm attainment sets of Banach space operators in terms of\ndilations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
