We introduce a weakly-supervised method that avoids\nsuch requirements by leveraging fundamental principles well-established in the\nunderstanding of the human hand's unique structure and functionality.\nSpecifically, we systematically study hand knowledge from different sources,\nincluding biomechanics, functional anatomy, and physics. We effectively\nincorporate these valuable foundational insights into 3D hand reconstruction\nmodels through an appropriate set of differentiable training losses. This\nenables training solely with readily-obtainable 2D hand landmark annotations\nand eliminates the need for expensive 3D supervision. Moreover, we explicitly\nmodel the uncertainty that is inherent in image observations. We enhance the\ntraining process by exploiting a simple yet effective Negative Log Likelihood\n(NLL) loss that incorporates uncertainty into the loss function. Through\nextensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms\nstate-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods. For example, our method achieves\nnearly a 21\\% performance improvement on the widely adopted FreiHAND dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
