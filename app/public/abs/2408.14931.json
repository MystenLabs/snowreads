Such equations describe the\nstochastic dynamics of processes where the drift and diffusion coefficients are\nsubject to random state changes according to a Markov chain with finite state\nspace. We propose a variant of the Jump Adapted-Adaptive approach introduced by\nK, Lord, \\& Sun~(2025) to construct nonuniform meshes for explicit numerical\nschemes that adjust timesteps locally to rapid changes in the numerical\nsolution and which also incorporate the switching times of an underlying Markov\nchain as meshpoints. It is shown that a hybrid scheme using such a mesh that\ncombines an efficient explicit method (to be used frequently) and a potentially\ninefficient backstop method (to be used occasionally) will display strong\nconvergence in mean-square of order $\\delta$ if both methods satisfy a\nmean-square consistency condition of the same order in the absence of\nswitching. We demonstrate the construction of an order $\\delta=1$ method of\nthis type and apply it to generate empirical distributions of a nonlinear SDE\nmodel of telomere length in DNA replication.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
