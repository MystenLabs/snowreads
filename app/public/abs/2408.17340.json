A notion of observational equivalence\ncapturing computational indistinguishability and a class of approximate logical\nrelations are then presented, showing that the latter represent a sound proof\ntechnique for the former. The work concludes with the presentation of an\nexample of a security proof in which the encryption scheme induced by a\npseudorandom function is proven secure against active adversaries in a purely\nequational style.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"lkaKIbExAX4oXXDgyK9Jxbji45Chpp7xXoP8PB4ugqE","pdfSize":"372039"}
