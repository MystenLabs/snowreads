The existence of an optimal policy is first proved. In\nparticular, for a special and important case of controlled branching processes\n(CBPs), it is proved that the minimal hitting probability is the unique\nsolution to an improved optimal system of equations. Furthermore, a novel and\nprecise improved-policy iteration algorithm of an optimal policy and the\nminimal hitting probability (minimal extinction probability) is presented for\nCBPs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
