In the present paper, we explore\nthe use of Shapley values in ontology-mediated query answering (OMQA) and\npresent a detailed complexity analysis of Shapley value computation (SVC) in\nthe OMQA setting. In particular, we establish a PF/#P-hard dichotomy for SVC\nfor ontology-mediated queries (T,q) composed of an ontology T formulated in the\ndescription logic ELHI_\\bot and a connected constant-free homomorphism-closed\nquery q. We further show that the #P-hardness side of the dichotomy can be\nstrengthened to cover possibly disconnected queries with constants. Our results\nexploit recently discovered connections between SVC and probabilistic query\nevaluation and allow us to generalize existing results on probabilistic OMQA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qPdVxPZqnrUaQGKq5Pk1PSs1DXsZsgTmCGStAh44wmo","pdfSize":"920223"}
