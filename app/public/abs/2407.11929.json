Key to this ability are the experimental progress in preparing and\nmeasuring massive resonators in the quantum regime, and the correlation with\nindependent LIGO detections of gravitational waves that induce stimulated\nabsorption. But do stimulated single-graviton processes imply the quantization\nof gravity? Here we analyze this question and make a historic analogy to the\nearly days of quantum theory. We discuss in what ways such experiments can\nindeed probe key features of the quantized interaction between gravity and\nmatter, and outline five experimental tests. This capability would open the\nfirst window into experimental exploration of quantum gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
