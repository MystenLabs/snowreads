We first construct a new\nmulti-dimensional Markov process based on the multi-type Markov branching\nprocess, which can reveal the multiple birth characteristics. Then the joint\nprobability distribution of multiple birth of multi-type Markov branching\nprocess until any time $t$ is obtained by using the new process. Furthermore,\nthe probability distribution of multiple birth until the extinction of the\nprocess is also given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
