Unfortunately, the\ncurrent interaction functionality of smartwatches is primarily limited by the\nsmall touch screen. This paper proposes SonarWatch, a novel sensing technique\nthat uses the acoustic field generated by the transceiver on the opposite sides\nof the watch to detect the presence of nearby objects and their shapes. This\nenables a range of gesture interactions and natural behavior perception. We\ndesigned an algorithm combining IMU and acoustic fields to identify these\nactions and optimize power consumption. We tested the performance of SonarWatch\nin different noise environments, achieving an overall accuracy of 93.7%. Its\npower consumption is close to that of physiological sensors. SonarWatch can\nachieve the above capabilities by utilizing the existing built-in sensors,\nmaking it a technology with solid practical value.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
