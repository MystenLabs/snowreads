We propose that\nwidely used potentials, such as the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potential, the embedded\natom model (EAM), and artificial neural network (ANN) potentials, can be\ninterpreted within the KAN framework. Specifically, we demonstrate that the\ndescriptors for ANN potentials, typically constructed using polynomials, can be\nredefined using KAN's non-linear functions. By employing linear or cubic spline\ninterpolations for these KAN functions, we show that the computational cost of\nevaluating ANN potentials and their derivatives is reduced.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
