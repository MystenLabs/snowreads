Research on TES over\nthe last two decades have led to a number of proposals many of which have\nalready been implemented using FPGAs. This paper considers the FPGA\nimplementations of two more recent and promising TESs, namely AEZ and FAST. The\nrelevant architectures are described and simulation results on the Xilinx\nVirtex 5 and Virtex 7 FPGAs are presented. For comparison, two IEEE standard\nschemes, XCB and EME2 are considered. The results indicate that FAST\noutperforms the other schemes making it a serious candidate for future\nincorporation by disk manufacturers and standardisation bodies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
