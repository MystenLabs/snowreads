These debates focus on assumptions about defining\nincome and handling deductions. However, the choice of interpolation methods\nfor using tax authorities' tabular data to estimate the income of the richest\ncentiles -- especially when no micro-files are available -- has not been\ndiscussed. This is crucial because tabular data were consistently used from\n1917 to 1965. In this paper, we show that there is an alternative to the\nstandard method of Pareto Interpolation (PI). We demonstrate that this\nalternative -- Maximum Entropy (ME) -- provides more accurate results and leads\nto significant revisions in the shape of the U-curve of income inequality.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
