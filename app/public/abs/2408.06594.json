Here, holographic CFT is the CFT\nhaving the gravity dual. We will start from the boundary and thermofield double\nstates, evolve the systems in Euclidean time with the Hamiltonian on the curved\nbackground, and then evolve them in real-time with the same Hamiltonian. We\nfound that the early- and late-time entanglement structure depends on the\ncurved background, while the entanglement growth does not, and is linear.\nFurthermore, in the gravity dual for the thermofield double state, this\nentanglement growth is due to the linear growth of the wormhole, while in the\none for the boundary state, it is due to the in-falling of the end of the world\nbrane to the black hole. We discussed the low temperature system can be\nregarded as the dynamical system induced by the multi-joining quenches. We also\ndiscussed the effective description of the high temperature system, called line\ntension picture.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
