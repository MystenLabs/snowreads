The proposed Bayesian framework effectively identifies sparse and\nimportant cointegration relationships amongst large baskets of stocks across\nvarious asset spaces, resulting in portfolios with reduced volatility. Such\ncointegration relationships persist well over the out-of-sample testing time,\nproviding practical benefits in portfolio construction and optimization.\nFurther studies on drawdown and volatility minimization also highlight the\nbenefits of including cointegrated portfolios as risk management instruments.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Economics/Econometrics","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w3Z-qX--WvO53XCKN-bYmDoZj3AKtmPwhgwJqHQ57zA","pdfSize":"1269621"}
