However, the\ndynamic nature of FL systems, characterized by the ongoing incorporation of new\nclients with potentially diverse data distributions and computational\ncapabilities, poses a significant challenge to the stability and efficiency of\nthese distributed learning networks. The seamless integration of new clients is\nimperative to sustain and enhance the performance and robustness of FL systems.\nThis paper looks into the complexities of integrating new clients into existing\nFL systems and explores how data heterogeneity and varying data distribution\n(not independent and identically distributed) among them can affect model\ntraining, system efficiency, scalability and stability. Despite these\nchallenges, the integration of new clients into FL systems presents\nopportunities to enhance data diversity, improve learning performance, and\nleverage distributed computational power. In contrast to other fields of\napplication such as the distributed optimization of word predictions on Gboard\n(where federated learning once originated), there are usually only a few\nclients in the production environment, which is why information from each new\nclient becomes all the more valuable. This paper outlines strategies for\neffective client selection strategies and solutions for ensuring system\nscalability and stability. Using the example of images from optical quality\ninspection, it offers insights into practical approaches. In conclusion, this\npaper proposes that addressing the challenges presented by new client\nintegration is crucial to the advancement and efficiency of distributed\nlearning networks, thus paving the way for the adoption of Federated Learning\nin production environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
