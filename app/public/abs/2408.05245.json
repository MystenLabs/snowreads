By comparing it with several common machine\nlearning algorithms, the paper analyses the advantages of the new model in ad\nclick prediction. It is shown that the improved algorithm proposed in this\npaper performs well in user ad click prediction with an accuracy of 92%, which\nis an improvement of 13.6% compared to the highest of 78.4% among the other\nthree base models. This significant improvement indicates that the algorithm is\nmore capable of capturing user behavioural characteristics and time series\npatterns. In addition, this paper evaluates the model's performance on other\nperformance metrics, including accuracy, recall, and F1 score. The results show\nthat the improved Adaboost algorithm based on LSTM is significantly ahead of\nthe traditional model in all these metrics, which further validates its\neffectiveness and superiority. Especially when facing complex and dynamically\nchanging user behaviours, the model is able to better adapt and make accurate\npredictions. In order to ensure the practicality and reliability of the model,\nthis study also focuses on the accuracy difference between the training set and\nthe test set. After validation, the accuracy of the proposed model on these two\ndatasets only differs by 1.7%, which is a small difference indicating that the\nmodel has good generalisation ability and can be effectively applied to\nreal-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
