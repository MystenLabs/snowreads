Such\napplications favor the lowest noise state, typically the single-DKS state where\none soliton is in the resonator. Other multi-DKS states can also be reached,\noffering better conversion efficiency and thermal stability, potentially\nsimplifying DKS-based technologies. Yet they exhibit more noise due to relative\nsoliton jitter, and are usually not compatible with targeted applications. We\ndemonstrate that Kerr-induced synchronization, an all-optical trapping\ntechnique, can azimuthally pin the multi-DKS state to a common reference field.\nThis method ensures repetition rate noise independent of the number of\nsolitons, making a multi-DKS state indistinguishable from a single-DKS state in\nthat regard, akin to trapped-soliton molecule behavior. Supported by\ntheoretical analysis and experimental demonstration in an integrated\nmicroresonator, this approach provides metrological capacity regardless of the\nnumber of cavity solitons, benefiting numerous DKS-based metrology\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
