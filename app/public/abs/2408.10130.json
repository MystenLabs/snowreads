Using a pre-trained\nmodel directly results in poor performance. To enhance the rhyming quality of\ngenerated lyrics, we incorporate integrated rhyme information into our model,\nthereby improving lyric generation performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u0Cz02QX0tScR-IwnIb1pOQdKo9qh2bT0GJsKIlGaiE","pdfSize":"462922"}
