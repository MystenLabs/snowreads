Spatial parity\nsymmetry is conspicuously assumed in much of this progress, despite the\nubiquity of chirality in experimentally realized systems. In this Letter, we\nderive a theory for the phase coexistence and interfacial fluctuations of a\nsystem which microscopically violates spatial parity. We find suppression of\nthe phase separation as chirality is increased as well as the development of\nsteady-state currents tangential to the interface dividing the phases. These\nodd flows are irrelevant to stationary interfacial properties, with stability,\ncapillary fluctuations, and surface area minimization determined entirely by\nthe capillary surface tension. Using large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations,\nwe find excellent agreement with our theoretical scaling predictions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
