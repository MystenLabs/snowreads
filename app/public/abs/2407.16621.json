We prove that the direct problem is well-posed,\ni.e., the solution exists, unique and depends continuously on the heat flux.\nThen the Fr\\'echet differentiability of the cost functional is proved. The\nConjugate Gradient Algorithm, based on the gradient formula for the cost\nfunctional, is proposed for numerical solution of the inverse flux problem. The\nnumerical examples, both with noise-free and noisy data, provide a clear\ndemonstration of the applicability and accuracy of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
