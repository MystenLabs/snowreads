Compared\nwith previous literature, we revisit the direct and inverse scattering map to\nobtain asymptotics in some weighted energy space that requires less restrictive\ndecay and regularity assumptions. The main result is derived from an\napplication of uniform resolvent bound and an approximation argument in the\nspirit of Riemann-Lebesgue lemma. As a consequence, our result depicts the long\ntime dynamics of the zeros of the solution to the defocussing NLS equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R6y-YRgLOXeGQdyL5SZI0K5zEQ4Fypjxk7b0KgbI9NA","pdfSize":"309768"}
