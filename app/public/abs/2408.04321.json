Yet QSP implementations still\nstruggle to complete a classical pre-processing step ('QSP-processing') that\ndetermines the set of $SU(2)$ rotation matrices defining the QSP circuit. We\nintroduce a method of QSP-processing for complex polynomials that identifies a\nsolution without optimization or root-finding and verify the success of our\nmethods with polynomials characterized by floating point precision\ncoefficients. We demonstrate the success of our technique for relevant target\npolynomials and precision regimes, including the Jacobi-Anger expansion used in\nQSP Hamiltonian Simulation. For popular choices of sign and inverse function\napproximations, we characterize regimes where all known QSP-processing methods\nshould be expected to struggle without arbitrary precision arithmetic.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
