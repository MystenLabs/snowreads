Most\nimplementations of machine-learning-based non-adiabatic dynamics inherently\napproximate the NACVs, with an underlying assumption that the\nenergy-difference-scaled NACVs are conservative fields. We overcome this\napproximation, implementing the method recently introduced by Richardson [J.\nChem. Phys. 158 011102 (2023)], which learns the symmetric dyad of the\nenergy-difference-scaled NACV. The efficiency and accuracy of our neural\nnetwork architecture is demonstrated through the example of the methaniminium\ncation CH$_2$NH$_2^+$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
