The\ncorrelation between the number of hadronic interaction vertices in a shower and\ninvisible energy is found to be strong and is used to estimate invisible energy\nfraction in highly granular calorimeters in short time intervals (<10 ns). We\nsimulated images of hadronic showers using GEANT4 and deployed a neural network\nto analyze the images for energy regression. The neural network-based approach\nresults in significant improvement in energy resolution, from 13 % to 4 % in\nthe case of a Cherenkov calorimeter for 100 GeV pion showers. We discuss the\nsignificance of the phenomena responsible for this improvement and the plans\nfor experimental verification of these results and further development.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
