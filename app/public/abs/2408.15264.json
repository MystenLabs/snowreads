In particular, comprehensive\nanalyses should go beyond comparing data based on canonical biomedical\ndatabases, suggesting the use of AI to interpret changes in biomarkers and\noutcomes. Our requirements motivate the use of LLMs with Knowledge Graphs and\ndedicated workflows employing, e.g., Retrieval-Augmented Generation. While\nnaive trust in the responses of AI tools can cause harm, adding our\nrequirements to LLM queries can improve response quality, calling for\nbenchmarking efforts and justifying the informed use of LLMs for advice on\nlongevity interventions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
