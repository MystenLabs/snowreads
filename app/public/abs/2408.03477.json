Let\n$s_i$ be the length of the projection of X onto the i-th component of the\nmultiprojective space. A result of A. Van Tuyl states that the Hilbert function\nof X, in the case when X is reduced, is completely determined by its\nrestriction to the product of the intervals $[0, s_i - 1]$. We prove that the\nsame is also true for non-reduced schemes X.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
