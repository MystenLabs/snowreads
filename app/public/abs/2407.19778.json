The surge in data complexity and volume\npresents significant challenges in translating this wealth of information into\nknowledge. The recently emerged Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)\nexhibit strong emergent capacities, such as understanding, analyzing,\nreasoning, and generalization. With these capabilities, MLLMs hold promise to\nextract intricate information from biological images and data obtained through\nvarious modalities, thereby expediting our biological understanding and aiding\nin the development of novel computational frameworks. Previously, such\ncapabilities were mostly attributed to humans for interpreting and summarizing\nmeaningful conclusions from comprehensive observations and analysis of\nbiological images. However, the current development of MLLMs shows increasing\npromise in serving as intelligent assistants or agents for augmenting human\nresearchers in biology research\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uPmoq7jkLxdygjzR4CDcpxy611Xt-GJ7QKjCcBGYcMM","pdfSize":"1062503"}
