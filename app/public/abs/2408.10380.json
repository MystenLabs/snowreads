Here we theoretically demonstrate the\npossibility to reach the viscous hydrodynamic -- liquid-like -- regime of\nexciton propagation in two-dimensional materials, focusing on the mono- and\nbi-layers of transition metal dichalcogenides. This regime can be realized\nwhere the exciton-exciton collisions dominate over exciton-phonon and disorder\nscattering. We have derived the hydrodynamic-like set of equations describing\nviscous flow of interacting excitons based on the Boltzmann kinetic equation\nfor the exciton distribution function. A comparison of various exciton\npropagation regimes including diffusive, viscous hydrodynamic, and superfluid\nregime is presented. Conditions which allow one to observe the hydrodynamic\nregime of exciton transport, and the role of material are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
