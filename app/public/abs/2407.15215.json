As a result, we obtain\ninfinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic hyperbolic groups all of whose\nassociated crossed products are isomorphic. These isomomorphisms are not of\ndynamical nature in the sense that they are not induced by isomorphisms of the\nunderlying groupoids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
