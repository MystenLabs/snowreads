As a result, we obtain\ninfinitely many pairwise non-isomorphic hyperbolic groups all of whose\nassociated crossed products are isomorphic. These isomomorphisms are not of\ndynamical nature in the sense that they are not induced by isomorphisms of the\nunderlying groupoids.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JFoGBE4C7JVxvR3c42U9BmKAnJdbQ1yje-xyPPdLq_Y","pdfSize":"214189","objectId":"0xffe11e8b20b4807d04a38f28a48bbda23f87e6fe88536b722387c4591bb649de","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
