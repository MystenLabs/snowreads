These hypersurfaces are asymptotic at infinity\nto a fixed Lawson cone $C_{m,n}$. In the case $m+n\\ge 8$, we show that such\nhypersurfaces are strictly stable and we provide a full classification of their\nbounded Jacobi fields, which in turn allows us to prove the non-degeneracy of\nsuch surfaces. In the case $m+n\\le 7$, we prove that such hypersurfaces have\ninfinite Morse index.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
