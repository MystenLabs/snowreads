Their frequencies are consistent\nwith those of the radial and quadrupolar oscillations of binary neutron star\nmerger remnants, as obtained in numerical relativity simulations. These\nsimulations reveal quasiuniversal relations between the remnant oscillation\nfrequencies and the tidal coupling constant of the binaries. Under the\nassumption that the observed QPOs are due to these postmerger oscillations, we\nuse the frequency-tide relations in a Bayesian framework to infer the source\nredshift, as well as the chirp mass and the binary tidal deformability of the\nbinary neutron star progenitors for GRBs 910711 and 931101B. We further use\nthis inference to estimate bounds on the mass-radius relation for neutron\nstars. By combining the estimates from the two GRBs, we find a 68\\% credible\nrange $R_{1.4}=12.48^{+0.41}_{-0.41}$~km for the radius of a neutron star with\nmass $M=1.4$~M$_\\odot$, which is one of the tightest bounds to date.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"E44AMyhbB2TfPhGGFyRnkvw3LDFb-pvmrcQwAG_JfcM","pdfSize":"724689"}
