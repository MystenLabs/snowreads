Such a prompt refinement process is\nanalogous to translating the prompt from \"user languages\" into \"system\nlanguages\". However, the scarcity of such parallel corpora makes it difficult\nto train a prompt refinement model. Inspired by zero-shot machine translation\ntechniques, we introduce Prompt Refinement with Image Pivot (PRIP). PRIP\ninnovatively uses the latent representation of a user-preferred image as an\nintermediary \"pivot\" between the user and system languages. It decomposes the\nrefinement process into two data-rich tasks: inferring representations of\nuser-preferred images from user languages and subsequently translating image\nrepresentations into system languages. Thus, it can leverage abundant data for\ntraining. Extensive experiments show that PRIP substantially outperforms a wide\nrange of baselines and effectively transfers to unseen systems in a zero-shot\nmanner.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
