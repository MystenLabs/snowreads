To study how backtracking of RNAP affects\ncooperative pushing we incorporate into this model backward (upstream) RNAP\nmoves. With a rigorous mathematical treatment of the model we derive conditions\non the mutual static and kinetic interactions between RNAP under which\nbacktracking preserves cooperative pushing. This is achieved by exact\ncomputation of several key properties in the steady state of this model,\nincluding the distribution of headway between two RNAP along the DNA template\nand the average RNAP velocity and flux.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
