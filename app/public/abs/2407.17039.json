However, simply\nincreasing the number of antennas will increase the cost of radio frequency\nchains and power consumption. To address this issue, in this paper, we consider\nan uplink ISAC system with nested array deployed at the base station. Nested\narray is a classic sparse array architecture that is able to enlarge the array\naperture without increasing the number of physical antennas. While nested array\nfor wireless sensing has been extensively studied, its potential for ISAC\nsystem has not been fully exploited. To fill this gap, in this paper, we\nprovide the beam pattern analysis of nested arrays, and derive the closed-form\nexpressions for the three beam pattern metrics, namely, the main lobe beam\nwidth, peak-to-local-minimum ratio, and prominent side lobes height. Extensive\nsimulation results are provided to show that compared with conventional uniform\narrays, nested arrays can achieve higher communication performance for densely\nlocated users while maintaining its advantage of sensing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
