We exploit the partial errors-in-variables (PEIV)\nprinciple and formulate a regression problem in the sense of weighted total\nleast squares, where the uncertainty in the parameter prior is explicitly\nconsidered. Based thereon, the PEIV regression can be solved iteratively\nthrough the Kalman smoothing and the regularized least squares for estimating\nthe state and the parameter, respectively. The simulations demonstrate improved\naccuracy of the proposed method compared to existing approaches, including the\njoint maximum a posterior-maximum likelihood, the expectation maximisation, and\nthe augmented state extended Kalman smoother.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
