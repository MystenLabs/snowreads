Among various GNN variants, graph attention\nnetwork (GAT) stands out since it is able to dynamically learn the importance\nof different nodes. However, present GATs heavily rely on the smoothed node\nfeatures to obtain the attention coefficients rather than graph structural\ninformation, which fails to provide crucial contextual cues for node\nrepresentations. To address this issue, this study proposes a neighbor\noverlay-induced graph attention network (NO-GAT) with the following two-fold\nideas: a) learning favorable structural information, i.e., overlaid neighbors,\noutside the node feature propagation process from an adjacency matrix; b)\ninjecting the information of overlaid neighbors into the node feature\npropagation process to compute the attention coefficient jointly. Empirical\nstudies on graph benchmark datasets indicate that the proposed NO-GAT\nconsistently outperforms state-of-the-art models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
