Recovering this signal\nremains an ongoing problem for cosmologists in the field, with the signal being\nhidden behind foregrounds approximately five orders of magnitude brighter than\nitself. A traditional forward modelling data analysis pipeline using Bayesian\ndata analysis and a physically motivated foreground model to find this signal\nshows great promise in the case of unchanging environmental conditions. However\nwe demonstrate in this paper that in the presence of a soil with changing\ndielectric properties under the antenna over time, or a changing soil\ntemperature in the far field of our observation these traditional methods\nstruggle.\n  In this paper we detail a tool using Masked Auto-regressive Flows that\nimproves upon previous physically motivated foreground models when one is\ntrying to recover this signal in the presence of changing environmental\nconditions. We demonstrate that with these changing parameters our tool\nconsistently recovers the signal with a much greater Bayesian evidence than the\ntraditional data analysis pipeline, decreasing the root mean square error in\nthe recovery of the injected signal by up to 45 %.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
