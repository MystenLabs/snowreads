The whole\nfamily of admissible self-adjoint realizations is characterized by means of\nfour different methods: von Neumann theory, boundary triplets, quadratic forms\nand Kre{\\u\\i}n's resolvent formalism. The relation between the different\nparametrizations thus obtained is explored, comparing the asymptotic behavior\nof functions in the corresponding operator domains close to the flux\nsingularity. Special attention is devoted to those self-adjoint realizations\nwhich preserve the same rotational symmetry and homogeneity under dilations of\nthe basic differential operator. The spectral and scattering properties of all\nthe Hamiltonian operators are finally described.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
