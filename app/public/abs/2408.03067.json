As a\nconsequence, we derive $C^{\\infty}$ estimates and decay estimates for all\nderivatives, conditional to these macroscopic bounds. Our $L^\\infty$ estimates\nare uniform in the limit $s \\nearrow 1$ and hence we recover the same results\nalso for the Landau equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
