Binding energy for ions may be\nfound by subtracting known ionization potentials. Accuracy of the results for\n$17<Z \\le105$ significantly exceeds that in NIST tables (there are no data for\n$Z>105$ there). We fit numerical results for binding energies by analytical\nfunction of $Z$. We also calculate numerical values and determine dependence on\n$Z$ of the correlation corrections, Dirac and Breit relativistic corrections\nand quantum electrodynamics (QED) corrections.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_z76apo6RgpMfrM8ExgxcpOpMKbUYCp5ZopWeb-B120","pdfSize":"184022"}
