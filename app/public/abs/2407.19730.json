This model involves a complex scalar\n$\\phi$, sterile neutrinos $N$, and Majorana dark matter $\\chi$, where only dark\nmatter $\\chi$ is charged under the $Z_2$ symmetry. Masses of $N$ and $\\chi$ are\ngenerated via the Yukawa interactions to $\\phi$ after breaking of the\n$U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. TeV scale sterile neutrinos $N$ are responsible for the\ngeneration of baryon asymmetry through the resonance leptogenesis mechanism.\nThe new particles in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ have a significant impact on the dilution\nof $N$, thus on leptogenesis. Meanwhile, the annihilation processes of dark\nmatter $\\chi$ are almost identical to that of $N$, which indicates that both\nleptogenesis and dark matter are closely related to satisfying the observed\nresults simultaneously. Under various theoretical and experimental constraints,\nthe viable common parameter space of dark matter and leptogenesis is obtained\nfor both global and local $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DVTvv2elZGCGJzFVH2Rb3f4RYrreQhh_ImPF6PnDQeI","pdfSize":"3554555","objectId":"0x8ee81dee743a647b88d7897dec66c5986f8385e0a6fa7d5b3ec643053da1278e","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
