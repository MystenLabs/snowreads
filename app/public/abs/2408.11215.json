We provide a simple guideline for the effects of aerosol\nmorphology on opacity and residence time in the atmosphere, as it pertains to\ntransit observations, particularly those with flat spectra due to high altitude\naerosols. This framework can be used for understanding complex cloud and haze\nparticle properties before getting into detailed microphysical modeling. We\nconsider high altitude aerosols to be composed of large fluffy particles that\ncan have large residence times in the atmosphere and influence the deposition\nof stellar flux and/or the emergence of thermal emission in a different way\nthan compact droplet particles, as generally modeled to date for extrasolar\nplanetary atmospheres. We demonstrate the important influence of aggregate\nparticle porosity and composition on the extent of the wavelength independent\nregime. We also consider how such fluffy particles reach such high altitudes\nand conclude that the most likely scenario is their local production at high\naltitudes via UV bombardment and subsequent blanketing of the atmosphere,\nrather than some mechanism of lofting or transport from the lower atmosphere.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dkUUj3tsoWldXD3NsSTnzPxHEeoBCbcjsvIFoR-Bj_o","pdfSize":"7447909"}
