The seamless\nintegration between different series has gained attention due to the scene's\ndiversity. However, the high cost of full scale racing makes it a more\naccessible development model, to research at smaller form factors and scale up\nthe achieved results. This paper presents a scalable architecture designed for\nautonomous racing that emphasizes modularity, adaptability to diverse\nconfigurations, and the ability to supervise parallel execution of pipelines\nthat allows the use of different dynamic strategies. The system showcased\nconsistent racing performance across different environments, demonstrated\nthrough successful participation in two relevant competitions. The results\nconfirm the architecture's scalability and versatility, providing a robust\nfoundation for the development of competitive autonomous racing systems. The\nsuccessful application in real-world scenarios validates its practical\neffectiveness and highlights its potential for future advancements in\nautonomous racing technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
