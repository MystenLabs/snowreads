However, the interactions favoring\nincompressible states over compressible composite-Fermi liquids at such\nfillings are not well understood. We devise a method of computing the trial\nenergies for Haldane pseudopotentials via Monte Carlo sampling. Applying it to\nthe quarter-filled lowest Landau level, we find that tuning the third and fifth\npseudopotential can stabilize anti-Pfaffian, Moore-Read, and f-wave states. The\nsmallest deviations from pure Coulomb interactions are required by\nanti-Pfaffian, whose presence is indicated by daughter states in recent\nexperiments of bilayer graphene at $\\nu=\\frac{3}{4}$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
