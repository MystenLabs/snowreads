In particular, we prove Fefferman-Stein inequality for\n$\\mathcal{M}^{\\#} _\\beta f$ by giving a good lambda estimate for\n$\\beta$-dimensional sharp maximal operator in the context of Hausdorff content.\nAdditionally, we prove the Muckenhoupt-Wheeden inequality in this framework by\nestablishing a good lambda inequality of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
