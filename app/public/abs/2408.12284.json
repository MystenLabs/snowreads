The\nmodel for numerical calculations were formalized in terms of the integral\nequations previously obtained for the half--filled paramagnetic Hubbard model\nby means of the variational derivatives technique and subsequent Legendre\ntransformation. For principal results we submit in series the momentum\ndistribution functions $n(k)$ which display distinct attributes for the\nincipient regimes: the pure doublon phase, the metal phase, Weyl semimetal\nphase, and Weyl excitonic insulator phase at the sequential increasing the\nonsite Coulomb interaction $U$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
