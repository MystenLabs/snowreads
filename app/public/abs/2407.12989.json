However, tire\nparameters such as the friction coefficient have been conventionally treated as\nconstant values in automated vehicle motion planning. This paper develops a\nsimple thermodynamic model that captures tire friction temperature variation.\nTo verify the model, it is implemented into trajectory planning for automated\ndrifting - a challenging application that requires leveraging an unstable,\ndrifting equilibrium at the friction limits. The proposed method which captures\nthe hidden tire dynamics provides a dynamically feasible trajectory, leading to\nmore precise tracking during experiments with an LQR (Linear Quadratic\nRegulator) controller.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
