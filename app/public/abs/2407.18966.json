That is, it becomes inevitable to\nconsider to implement a post-quantum cryptography, which is also referred to as\nquantum-resistant cryptography, for attaining quantum resistance in\nblockchains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"35UjpBqt5Ha-yd5Hs9nr3Zc_mWsG_HbbkxehIsCwFl0","pdfSize":"225356"}
