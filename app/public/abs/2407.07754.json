In a\nsimilar manner, we construct pseudorandom unitaries (PRUs) in 1D circuits in\n$\\text{poly} \\log n $ depth, and in all-to-all-connected circuits in\n$\\text{poly} \\log \\log n $ depth. In all three cases, the $n$ dependence is\noptimal and improves exponentially over known results. These shallow quantum\ncircuits have low complexity and create only short-range entanglement, yet are\nindistinguishable from unitaries with exponential complexity. Our construction\nglues local random unitaries on $\\log n$-sized or $\\text{poly} \\log n$-sized\npatches of qubits to form a global random unitary on all $n$ qubits. In the\ncase of designs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing constructions of\napproximate unitary $k$-designs, and hence also inherit an optimal scaling in\n$k$. In the case of PRUs, the local unitaries are drawn from existing unitary\nensembles conjectured to form PRUs. Applications of our results include proving\nthat classical shadows with 1D log-depth Clifford circuits are as powerful as\nthose with deep circuits, demonstrating superpolynomial quantum advantage in\nlearning low-complexity physical systems, and establishing quantum hardness for\nrecognizing phases of matter with topological order.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
