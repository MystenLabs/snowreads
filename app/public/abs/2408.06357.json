The existing\nembedded zero sample learning methods only use the known classes to construct\nthe embedded space, so there is an overfitting of the known classes in the\ntesting process. This project uses category semantic similarity measures to\nclassify multiple tags. This enables it to incorporate unknown classes that\nhave the same meaning as currently known classes into the vector space when it\nis built. At the same time, most of the existing zero sample learning\nalgorithms directly use the depth features of medical images as input, and the\nfeature extraction process does not consider semantic information. This project\nintends to take ELMo-MCT as the main task and obtain multiple visual features\nrelated to the original image through self-attention mechanism. In this paper,\na large number of experiments are carried out on three zero-shot learning\nreference datasets, and the best harmonic average accuracy is obtained compared\nwith the most advanced algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
