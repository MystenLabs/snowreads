This allows us to\ngeneralize the in-degree polynomial invariant of links to linkoids.\nAdditionally, we introduce a new linkoid invariant, which we call the in-degree\nquiver polynomial matrix. Lastly, we study the pointed quandle coloring quivers\nof linkoids of $(p,2)$-torus type with respect to pointed dihedral quandles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
