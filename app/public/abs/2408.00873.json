Using thermal transport to probe how magnetic excitations\ninteract with phonons, we have uncovered an unusually large enhancement of the\nthermal conductivity $\\kappa_{xx}$ in an in-plane magnetic field ${\\bf H}$.\nJust above the N\\'{e}el temperature $T_{\\rm N}$, a field of 13 T increases\n$\\kappa_{xx}$ by a factor ($\\sim 211$), much larger than reported previously in\nany magnetic insulator. Interestingly, $\\kappa_{xx}(H,T)$ exhibits a scaling\nbehavior in the entire magnetically disordered region that surrounds the\nordered zigzag state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YF7X0hmoWIDdBJYuGtj0P7hZtiWgU1aRg4bt3jnRHNk","pdfSize":"1398602"}
