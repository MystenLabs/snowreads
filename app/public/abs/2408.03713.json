Previous study~\\cite{mHK, mHK2} deals with the mixed HK model\non finite graphs. In the study, we discuss the mixed HK model on infinite\ngraphs which also covers the HK model and the Deffuant model on infinite\ngraphs. We investigate conditions under which asymptotic stability holds or any\ntwo vertices in the same component approaches each other after some finite\ntime.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K9cJkB7OgRCVdVuBwazZhk0T0m3Hv0SIS1O9ifBHl4c","pdfSize":"132446"}
