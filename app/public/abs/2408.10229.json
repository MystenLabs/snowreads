This study employs a qualitative content analysis approach to examine the\nwebsites of a sample of 10 AI-enhanced academic search systems identified\nthrough university library guides. The assessed level of transparency varies\nacross these systems: five provide detailed information about their mechanisms,\nthree offer partial information, and two provide little to no information.\nThese findings indicate that the academic community is recommending and using\ntools with opaque functionalities, raising concerns about research integrity,\nincluding issues of reproducibility and researcher responsibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
