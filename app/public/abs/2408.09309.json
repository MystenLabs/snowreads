Specifically, the relative\ngeodesic position of leaders (which we use as a proxy for ease of communication\nbetween leaders) could be important for reaching consensus. Additionally,\ngroups searching for consensus can be confounded by noisy signals in which\nindividuals are given false information about the actions of their fellow group\nmembers. We tested the effects of the geodesic distance between leaders\n(geodesic distance ranging from 1-4) and of noise (noise levels at 0%, 5%, and\n10%) by recruiting participants (N=3,456) for a set of experiments (n=216\ngroups). We find that noise makes groups less likely to reach consensus, and\nthe groups that do reach consensus take longer to find it. We find that\nleadership changes the behavior of both leaders and followers in important ways\n(for instance, being labeled a leader makes people more likely to 'go with the\nflow'). However, we find no evidence that the distance between leaders is a\nsignificant factor in the probability of reaching consensus. While other\nnetwork properties of leaders undoubtedly impact consensus formation, the\ndistance between leaders in network sub-groups appears not to matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
