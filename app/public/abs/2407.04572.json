At all studied\ntemperatures and densities, ABBPs self-assemble in aggregating chains, as\nopposed to the uniformly space-distributed chains observed in the corresponding\npassive systems. The main effect of activity, other than inducing chain\naggregation, is to reduce the chain length and favor alignment of the\npropulsion vectors in the bonding process. At low activities, attraction\ndominates over activity in the bonding process, leading self-assembly to occur\nrandomly regardless of the particle orientations.Interestingly, we find that at\nthe lowest temperature, as density increases, chains aggregate forming a novel\nstate: MISP, i.e., Motility-Induced Spirals, where spirals are characterised by\na finite angular velocity. On the contrary, at the highest temperature, density\nand activity, chains aggregate forming a different novel state (a spinning\ncrystalline cluster) characterized by a compact and hexagonal ordered\nstructure, both translating and rotating. The rotation arises from an effective\ntorque generated by the presence of competing domains where particles\nself-propel in the same direction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hPEx4XmXdyG_l73LdVYdWebC32BVXhEUUK6tw0eojBI","pdfSize":"1287356"}
