However, the ability of current large language models (LLMs) to\nhandle such reasoning remains largely uncharted. In this paper, we introduce a\nnew benchmark, FRoG, for fuzzy reasoning, featuring real-world mathematical\nword problems that incorporate generalized quantifiers. Our experimental\nfindings reveal that fuzzy reasoning continues to pose significant challenges\nfor LLMs. Moreover, we find that existing methods designed to enhance reasoning\ndo not consistently improve performance in tasks involving fuzzy logic.\nAdditionally, our results show an inverse scaling effect in the performance of\nLLMs on FRoG. Interestingly, we also demonstrate that strong mathematical\nreasoning skills are not necessarily indicative of success on our benchmark.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
