The goal of the course is to explain a modern take on the\neigenvariety machine in the language of adic spaces. For this we build on the\ntheory developed in the first week of the school. We also explain some basic\nselective non-archimedean functional analysis.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
