In particular, we construct an infinite additive\n$5$-power-free rich word over $\\{0,1\\}$ and an infinite additive $4$-power-free\nrich word over $\\{0, 1, 2\\}$. The alphabet sizes are as small as possible in\nboth cases, even for abelian powers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
