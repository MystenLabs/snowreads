Our research demonstrated that Loihi-2, using spiking\nneural networks, significantly outperformed traditional computing methods in\nspeed and energy efficiency. Compared to conventional CPUs and GPUs, Loihi-2\nshowed remarkable energy efficiency, being over 100 times more efficient than a\nCPU and nearly 30 times more than a GPU. Additionally, our Loihi-2\nimplementation achieved faster processing speeds on various datasets, marking a\nsubstantial advancement over existing state-of-the-art implementations. This\npaper also discusses the specific challenges encountered during the\nimplementation and optimization processes, providing insights into the\narchitectural innovations of Loihi-2 that contribute to its superior\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8tN6fk4UvaqR4n5ZznXKk5YAhCiTgdsGURfxPL5cJ5c","pdfSize":"930751"}
