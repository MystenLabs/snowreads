Obtaining\nthree-dimensional structural information on these PPIs serves as a foundation\nto interfere with those or to guide drug design. Various strategies can be\nfollowed to model those complexes, all typically resulting in a large number of\nmodels. A challenging step in this process is the identification of good models\n(near-native PPI conformations) from the large pool of generated models. To\naddress this challenge, we previously developed DeepRank-GNN-esm, a graph-based\ndeep learning algorithm for ranking modelled PPI structures harnessing the\npower of protein language models. Here, we detail the use of our software with\nexamples.
