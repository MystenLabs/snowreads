We have also proposed a method for evaluating the\ndetection probability of electrons in a small region. This probability is\ninterpreted as that of detecting hydrogen in each state: positive ion, neutral\natom, and negative ion. As a result, the probabilities of detecting hydrogen\nafter a collision as a positive ion, neutral atom, and negative ion were\napproximately 30 percent, 50 percent, and 20 percent, respectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
