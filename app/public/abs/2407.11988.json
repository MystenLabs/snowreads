Furthermore, there is a dearth of event datasets for figurative\nlanguage, limiting a crucial avenue of research in event comprehension. We\naddress these two issues by introducing ECB+META, a lexically rich variant of\nEvent Coref Bank Plus (ECB+) for CDEC on symbolic and metaphoric language. We\nuse ChatGPT as a tool for the metaphoric transformation of sentences in the\ndocuments of ECB+, then tag the original event triggers in the transformed\nsentences in a semi-automated manner. In this way, we avoid the re-annotation\nof expensive coreference links. We present results that show existing methods\nthat work well on ECB+ struggle with ECB+META, thereby paving the way for CDEC\nresearch on a much more challenging dataset.
