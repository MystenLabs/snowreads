However, its control with light is challenging, because\ninducing chirality in a non-chiral material requires that all mirrors and all\nroto-inversions be simultaneously broken. Electromagnetic fields exert only\noscillatory forces that vanish on average, mostly leading to entropy increase\nthat does not break symmetries, per se. Here, we show that chirality of either\nhandedness can be generated in the non-chiral piezoelectric material BPO$_4$,\nin which two compensated sub-structures of opposite handedness coexist within\nthe same unit cell. By resonantly driving either one of two orthogonal, doubly\ndegenerate vibrational modes at Terahertz frequency, we rectify the lattice\ndistortion and exert a displacive force onto the crystal. The staggered\nchirality is in this way uncompensated in either direction, inducing chiral\nstructure with either handedness. The rotary power of the photo-induced phases\nis comparable to the static value of prototypical chiral alpha-quartz, limited\nby the strength of the pump laser pulse.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
