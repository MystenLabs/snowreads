Rainbow codes can be defined on any\n$D$-dimensional simplicial complex that admits a valid $(D+1)$-colouring of its\n$0$-simplices. We study in detail the case where these simplicial complexes are\nderived from chain complexes obtained via the hypergraph product and, by\nreinterpreting these codes as collections of colour codes joined at domain\nwalls, show that we can obtain code families with growing distance and number\nof encoded qubits as well as logical non-Clifford gates implemented by\ntransversal application of $T$ and $T^\\dag$. By combining these techniques with\nthe quasi-hyperbolic colour codes of Zhu et al. (arXiv:2310.16982) we obtain\nfamilies of codes with transversal non-Clifford gates and parameters\n$[\\![n,O(n),O(log(n))]\\!]$ which allow the magic-state yield parameter $\\gamma\n= \\log_d(n/k)$ to be made arbitrarily small. In contrast to other recent\nconstructions that achieve $\\gamma \\rightarrow 0$ our codes are natively\ndefined on qubits, are LDPC, and have logical non-Clifford gates implementable\nby single-qubit (rather than entangling) physical operations, but are not\nasymptotically good.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h06eOIBVxEQhTgBaXWk5tbj-1JOxpyFxxuGV_AYmjOI","pdfSize":"1481007"}
