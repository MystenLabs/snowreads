Across four warners (the social media platform,\nother social media users, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and fact checkers), we\nfound that all significantly decreased trust in false information relative to\ncontrol, but warnings from AI were modestly more effective. All warners\nsignificantly decreased the sharing intentions of false information, except\nwarnings from other social media users. AI was again the most effective. These\nresults were moderated by prior trust in media and the information itself. Most\nnoteworthy, we found that warning labels from AI were significantly more\neffective than all other warning labels for participants who reported a low\ntrust in news organizations, while warnings from AI were no more effective than\nany other warning label for participants who reported a high trust in news\norganizations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
