We investigated helium (He) ion injection\nonto a tungsten surface using time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT)\nsimulation. We developed the TDDFT code QUMASUN for this study, simulating the\nprocess of electron transfer from the surface to the He nucleus by solving the\ntime evolution of electron wave function and the classical motion of nuclei\nsimultaneously. Our results show that the probabilities of injected\n$\\text{He}^{2+}$ changing into $\\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\\text{He}^{0}$ on the\nsurface are approximately 40 percent and 13 percent, respectively. The captured\nelectrons by $\\text{He}^{1+}$ and $\\text{He}^{0}$ predominantly occupy the 2s\nand 2p orbitals, corresponding to excited states. In addition, we stated some\nchallenges for applying TDDFT to plasma-wall interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
