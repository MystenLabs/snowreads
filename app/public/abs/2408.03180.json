First, we re-visit monads and comonads in double categories and\nestablish a tensored and cotensored enrichment of the former in the latter,\nunder general conditions. These include monoidal closedness and local\npresentability of the double category, notions that are proposed as tools\nrequired for our main results, but are of interest in their own right. The\nnatural next step involves categories of the newly introduced modules for\nmonads and comodules for comonads in double categories. After we study their\nmain categorical properties, we establish a tensored and cotensored enrichment\nof modules in comodules, as well as an enriched fibration structure that\ninvolves (co)modules over (co)monads in double categories. Applying this\nabstract double categorical framework to the setting of V-matrices produces an\nenrichment of the category of V-enriched modules (fibred over V-categories) in\nV-enriched comodules (opfibred over V-cocategories), which is the many-object\ngeneralization of the respective result for modules (over algebras) and\ncomodules (over coalgebras) in monoidal categories.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v-oIsYIgA2Ck-6KWK1nsUq17e1wBRD43vIofYJhVTjU","pdfSize":"918543"}
