For such highly collisional plasma environment\nas the E-region ionosphere, kinetic theory represents the most accurate\ntheoretical description of wave processes. For the analytical treatment,\nhowever, the collisional kinetic theory is extremely complicated and succeeds\nonly in a limited number of physical problems. To date, most research applied\noversimplified fluid models that lack a number of critical kinetic aspects, so\nthat the coefficients in the corresponding fluid equations are often accurate\nonly to an order of magnitude. This paper presents the derivation for the\nhighly collisional, partially magnetized case relevant to E-region conditions.\nIt provides a more accurate reduction of the ion and, especially, electron\nkinetic equations to the corresponding 5-moment fluid equations by using a new\nset of analytic approximations. This derivation results in more accurate\nfluid-model set of equations appropriate for most E-region problems. The\nresults of this paper could be used for a routine practical analysis when\nworking with actual data. The improved equations can also serve as a basis for\nmore accurate plasma fluid computer simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
