Using the\nexpression for the spectral distribution function of plasma particles in the\npresence of laser beat waves, an anisotropic tensor of the plasma dielectric\npermittivity is obtained. In this case, an expression for the nonequilibrium\ncurrent density induced by the perturbed field and the constitutive equation\nconnecting the conductivity tensor with the dielectric permittivity are\ndetermined. Assuming that in equilibrium the particle distribution function has\nthe form of the Maxwellian distribution function, the dielectric tensor is\ndiagonalized. Analytical expressions are obtained for the longitudinal and\ntransverse components of the dielectric permittivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"umZY6oH6-zME8xSso8rggyT7t3h053LgYsSYbzOGMdo","pdfSize":"151465"}
