To the training data, we associate two systems of equations: a\n$\\max-\\min$ system and a $\\min-\\max$ system. By solving these two systems (in\nthe case that they are consistent) using Sanchez's results, we show that we can\ndirectly obtain the extremal capacities representing the training data. By\nreducing the $\\max-\\min$ (resp. $\\min-\\max$) system of equations to subsets of\ncriteria of cardinality less than or equal to $q$ (resp. of cardinality greater\nthan or equal to $n-q$), where $n$ is the number of criteria, we give a\nsufficient condition for deducing, from its potential greatest solution (resp.\nits potential lowest solution), a $q$-maxitive (resp. $q$-minitive) capacity.\nFinally, if these two reduced systems of equations are inconsistent, we show\nhow to obtain the greatest approximate $q$-maxitive capacity and the lowest\napproximate $q$-minitive capacity, using recent results to handle the\ninconsistency of systems of fuzzy relational equations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w2SHPbBo8KwI4NGbl5w4AonUastS67fSEy2cb6hnHbM","pdfSize":"159569"}
