However,\nnetworks tend to improve over time. In this paper, we focus on the improvement\nstep. Given a graph and a budget $k$, which $k$ edges do we add to the graph to\nminimise its dilation? Gudmundsson and Wong [TALG'22] provided the first\npositive result for this problem, but their approximation factor is linear in\n$k$.\n  Our main result is a $(2 \\sqrt[r]{2} \\ k^{1/r},2r)$-bicriteria approximation\nthat runs in $O(n^3 \\log n)$ time, for all $r \\geq 1$. In other words, if $t^*$\nis the minimum dilation after adding any $k$ edges to a graph, then our\nalgorithm adds $O(k^{1+1/r})$ edges to the graph to obtain a dilation of\n$2rt^*$. Moreover, our analysis of the algorithm is tight under the Erd\\H{o}s\ngirth conjecture.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
