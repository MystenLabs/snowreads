Previous frequency-domain methods for this problem rely on discrete\nFourier transform and require symmetric boundary conditions. We use the Fokas\nmethod to derive the optimal control law for general Dirichlet and Neumann\nboundary conditions. The Fokas method uses the continuous Fourier transform\nrestricted on the bounded spatial domain, with the frequency variable $k$\ndomain extended from the real line to the complex plane. This extension,\ntogether with results from complex analysis, allows us to eliminate the\ndependence of the optimal control on the unknown boundary values. As a result,\nwe derive an integral representation of the control similar to the inverse\nFourier transform. This representation contains integrals along complex\ncontours and only depends on known initial and boundary conditions. We also\nshow that for the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary value problem, the integral\nrepresentation recovers an existing series representation of the optimal\ncontrol. Moreover, the integral representation exhibits numerical advantages\ncompared to the traditional series representation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
