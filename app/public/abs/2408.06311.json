This algorithm introduces a shift parameter $s$ to\nprevent failure during the initial Cholesky factorization step. The choice of\nthis shift parameter $s$ is critical for the algorithm's effectiveness. Our\ngoal is to identify a smaller $s$ compared to the traditional selection\ninvolving $\\|X\\|_2$. In this research, we propose a new norm $\\|X\\|_g$, which\nis based on the column properties of $X$, to obtain a reduced shift parameter\n$s$ for the Shifted CholeskyQR3 algorithm. We provide rigorous proofs of\northogonality and residuals for the improved algorithm with our proposed $s$.\nNumerical experiments confirm the enhanced numerical stability of orthogonality\nand residuals with the reduced $s$. Furthermore, we compare CPU times with\nother algorithms to assess performance improvements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
