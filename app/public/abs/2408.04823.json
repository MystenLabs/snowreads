The highest point in the confidence map is used as the prompt to replace\nthe manual prompt. Then, to address the over-segmentation issue caused by the\ndomain gap, we design the point prompt-centric focusing (PPCF) module.\nSubsequently, to prevent miss and false detections, we introduce the\ntriple-level ensemble (TLE) module to produce the final mask. Experiments\ndemonstrate that our method requires only one shot to achieve comparable\nperformance to state-of-the-art IRSTS methods and significantly outperforms\nother one-shot segmentation methods. Moreover, ablation studies confirm the\nrobustness of our method in the type of annotations and the selection of\nreference images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
