We explore diverse manifestations of the atlas to\nunderstand their impact on explaining the muon \\((g-2)_{\\mu}\\) anomaly, as well\nas the origin of self-interacting dark matter, which serves as a feasible\nexplanation for the small-scale challenges of cold dark matter. We found that a\nsingle vector gauge boson with mass range of $\\sim 10~\\mathrm{MeV}$ and\nnon-universal couplings as indicated successfully mediates interactions in the\nfermion and dark matter sectors in such a way that $(g-2)_{\\mu}$ additional\ncontribution agrees with experimental constraints and the self-interacting dark\nmatter fluid behaves as suggested by observations at different astrophysical\nlength scales. Furthermore, the model requires a dark matter candidate within\n$10-100~ \\mathrm{GeV}$ order mass and a strong dark coupling ($g_{\\chi} \\sim\n0.3$, much stronger than the lepton's couplings $g'_l \\lesssim 10^{-4}$) to be\na successful scenario to unravel astrophysical small scale problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Itb77CbErH9NWYHKvnMe58p3uyozrsFAF-trw6hteUU","pdfSize":"1101947"}
