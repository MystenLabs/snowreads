We propose to apply techniques\nfrom formal explainability, most notably abductive and contrastive\nexplanations, to identify minimal subsets of a preference profile that either\nimply the current winner or explain why a different candidate was not elected.\nFormal explanations turn out to have strong connections with classical problems\nstudied in computational social choice such as bribery, possible and necessary\nwinner identification, and preference learning. We design algorithms for\ncomputing abductive and contrastive explanations for scoring rules. For the\nBorda rule, we find a lower bound on the size of the smallest abductive\nexplanations, and we conduct simulations to identify correlations between\nproperties of preference profiles and the size of their smallest abductive\nexplanations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"GcjyZVFlcmZh-BgSqCtm6hEJ-BMU26t92_ZG1z0faoI","pdfSize":"582797"}
