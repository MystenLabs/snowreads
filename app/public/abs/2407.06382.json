A database of Alcator C-Mod\ndischarges is analyzed to evaluate the impact of source modification via\ncryopumping. The database contains similarly-shaped H-modes at fixed $I_{p} =$\n0.8 MA and $B_{t} =$ 5.4 T, spanning a large range in $P_\\mathrm{net}$ and\nionization. Measurements from an edge Thomson Scattering system are combined\nwith those from a midplane-viewing Ly$_{\\alpha}$ camera to evaluate changes to\n$n_{e}$ and $T_{e}$ in response to changes to ionization rates,\n$S_\\mathrm{ion}$. $n_{e}^\\mathrm{sep}$ and $T_{e}^\\mathrm{ped}$ are found to be\nmost sensitive to changes to $S_\\mathrm{ion}^\\mathrm{sep}$, as opposed to\n$n_{e}^\\mathrm{ped}$ and $T_{e}^\\mathrm{sep}$. Dimensionless quantities, namely\n$\\alpha_\\mathrm{MHD}$ and $\\nu^{*}$, are found to regulate attainable pedestal\nvalues. Select discharges at different values of $P_\\mathrm{net}$ and in\ndifferent pumping configurations are analyzed further using SOLPS-ITER. It is\ndetermined that changes to plasma transport coefficients are required to\nself-consistently model both plasma and neutral edge dynamics. Pumping is found\nto modify the poloidal distribution of atomic neutral density, $n_{0}$, along\nthe separatrix, increasing $n_{0}$ at the active X-point. Opaqueness to\nneutrals from high $n_{e}$ in the divertor is found to play a role in mediating\nneutral penetration lengths and hence, the poloidal distribution of neutrals\nalong the separatrix. Pumped discharges thus require a larger particle\ndiffusion coefficient than that inferred purely from 1D experimental profiles\nat the outer midplane.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
