We demonstrate that blowing down a $(-1)$-divisor removes a\nsingle geometric critical point, ensuring that the resulting potential remains\na Morse function. Additionally, we show that the critical values are distinct,\nwhich implies that the quantum cohomology $QH^{\\ast}(X)$ is semi-simple.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
