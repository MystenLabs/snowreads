It often manifests itself by clusters of units\nexhibiting coincident dynamics. These clusters are a direct consequence of the\norganization of the Laplacian matrix eigenvalues into spectral localized\nblocks. We show how the concept of spectral blocks can be leveraged to design\nstraightforward yet powerful controllers able to fully manipulate cluster\nsynchronization of a generic network, thus shaping at will its parallel\nfunctioning. Specifically, we demonstrate how to induce the formation of\nspectral blocks in networks where such structures would not exist, and how to\nachieve precise mastering over the synchronizability of individual clusters by\ndictating the sequence in which each of them enters or exits the\nsynchronization stability region as the coupling strength varies. Our results\nunderscore the pivotal role of cluster synchronization control in shaping the\nparallel operation of networked systems, thereby enhancing their efficiency and\nadaptability across diverse applications.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"i5p5f4NVKfkxVqC4Tn_uQYK8c3BxIVC8fo9Kh50rHSA","pdfSize":"1299958"}
