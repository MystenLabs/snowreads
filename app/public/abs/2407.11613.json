While applauding the technical innovations in these projects, we\nidentify several shared assumptions including the generality of LLMs,\nextracting abstract values, soliciting solutions not problems and equating\nparticipation with democracy. We call instead for AI participation which\ninvolves specific communities and use cases and solicits concrete problems to\nbe remedied. We also find it important that these communities have a stake in\nthe outcome, including ownership of data or models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
