The free energy consists of the nonconvex Flory-Huggins energy\nand a fractional gradient energy, modeling nonlocal long-range correlations.\nThe existence of global weak solutions to this system in a bounded domain with\nno-flux boundary conditions is shown. The proof is based on a three-level\napproximation scheme, spectral-fractional calculus, and a priori estimates\ncoming from the energy inequality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
