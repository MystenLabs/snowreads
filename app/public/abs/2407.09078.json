The rising\ndemand and opportunities attract ride-share services. A common problem of such\nservices is abandoned e-scooters. An autonomous e-scooter capable of moving to\nthe charging station is a solution. This paper focuses on maintaining balance\nfor these riderless e-scooters. The paper presents a nonlinear model for an\ne-scooter moving with simultaneously varying speed and steering. A PD and a\nfeedback-linearized PD controller stabilize the model. The stability analysis\nshows that the controllers are ultimately bounded even with parameter\nuncertainties and measurement inaccuracy. Simulations on a realistic e-scooter\nwith a general demanding path to follow verify the ultimate boundedness of the\ncontrollers. In addition, the feedback-linearized PD controller outperforms the\nPD controller because it has narrower ultimate bounds. Future work focuses on\nexperiments using a self-balancing mechanism installed on an e-scooter.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"boLwzg9HMU0j2Xfp_B0pnRUq_7PItNOeYNnitXl1-mY","pdfSize":"1182071"}
