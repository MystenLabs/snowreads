We\ndivide the $(\\lambda,\\mu)$-plane of parameters $\\lambda$ and $\\mu$ into\nconnected components, such that in each component, the Schr\\\"{o}dinger operator\n$H_{\\lambda\\mu}(0)$ has a fixed number of eigenvalues. These eigenvalues are\nlocated both below the bottom of the essential spectrum and above its top.\nAdditionally, we establish a sharp lower bound for the number of isolated\neigenvalues of $H_{\\lambda\\mu}(K)$ within each connected component.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
