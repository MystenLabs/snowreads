In this paper we apply this bootstrap approach to fully\npermutation invariant amplitudes, deriving new deformations of the\nVirasoro-Shapiro amplitude for graviton scattering in string theory.\nSuperpolynomially soft Regge behavior yields the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude as\nthe unique solution, and we find the string spectrum as an output rather than\nan input of the bootstrap. While the remaining variations exhibit the same\nRegge scaling as pure gravity, in the tensionless limit they reproduce\nremarkable extremal amplitudes that have appeared in bottom-up studies of\npositivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
