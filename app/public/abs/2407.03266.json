{"id":"2407.03266","title":"Do Quantum Neural Networks have Simplicity Bias?","authors":"Jessica Pointing","authorsParsed":[["Pointing","Jessica",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2024 16:56:08 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-04","timestamp":1720025768000,"abstract":"  One hypothesis for the success of deep neural networks (DNNs) is that they\nare highly expressive, which enables them to be applied to many problems, and\nthey have a strong inductive bias towards solutions that are simple, known as\nsimplicity bias, which allows them to generalise well on unseen data because\nmost real-world data is structured (i.e. simple). In this work, we explore the\ninductive bias and expressivity of quantum neural networks (QNNs), which gives\nus a way to compare their performance to those of DNNs. Our results show that\nit is possible to have simplicity bias with certain QNNs, but we prove that\nthis type of QNN limits the expressivity of the QNN. We also show that it is\npossible to have QNNs with high expressivity, but they either have no inductive\nbias or a poor inductive bias and result in a worse generalisation performance\ncompared to DNNs. We demonstrate that an artificial (restricted) inductive bias\ncan be produced by intentionally restricting the expressivity of a QNN. Our\nresults suggest a bias-expressivity tradeoff. Our conclusion is that the QNNs\nwe studied can not generally offer an advantage over DNNs, because these QNNs\neither have a poor inductive bias or poor expressivity compared to DNNs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
