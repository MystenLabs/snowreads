Synthesizing Craig\ninterpolants is the cornerstone of these techniques.\n  In this paper, we investigate nonlinear Craig interpolant synthesis for two\npolynomial formulas of the general form, essentially corresponding to the\nunderlying mathematical problem to separate two disjoint semialgebraic sets. By\ncombining the homogenization approach with existing techniques, we prove the\nexistence of a novel class of non-polynomial interpolants called semialgebraic\ninterpolants. These semialgebraic interpolants subsume polynomial interpolants\nas a special case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first existence\nresult of this kind. Furthermore, we provide complete sum-of-squares\ncharacterizations for both polynomial and semialgebraic interpolants, which can\nbe efficiently solved as semidefinite programs. Examples are provided to\ndemonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
