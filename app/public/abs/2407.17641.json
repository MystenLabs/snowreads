They can be\nunderstood as the superposition of all the words in a regular language and\nencompass physically relevant states such as the GHZ-, W- or Dicke-states. By\nleveraging the theory of regular languages, we develop a theoretical framework\nto describe them. First, we express them in terms of matrix product states,\nproviding efficient criteria to recognize them. We then develop a canonical\nform which allows us to formulate a fundamental theorem for the equivalence of\nregular language states, including under local unitary operations. We also\nexploit the theory of tensor networks to find an efficient criterion to\ndetermine when regular languages are shift-invariant.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
