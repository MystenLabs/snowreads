Moreover, when the underlying domain\nis convex, we obtain universal, non-asymptotic bounds that correctly reproduce\nthe two leading terms in the asymptotics and depend on the domain only through\nsimple geometric characteristics. An important ingredient in the proof of the\nlatter result is a pointwise bound for the heat kernel of the Neumann Laplacian\nin a convex domain with universal constants. Additional ingredients in our\nproof are non-asymptotic versions of various Tauberian theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
