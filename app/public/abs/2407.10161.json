Indeed, this measure\npreserving property plays an important role in Lipschitz classification of\nfractal sets. In this paper, we show that such measure preserving property also\nholds for bi-Lipschitz maps between two Moran sets in a certain class.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
