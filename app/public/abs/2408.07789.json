Two scenarios\nare examined: in the first, quantum memory particles approach a Schwarzschild\nblack hole and are positioned near the event horizon, while the particle being\nmeasured remains in the asymptotically flat region. In the second scenario, the\nmeasured particle moves toward the black hole, and the quantum memories stay in\nthe asymptotically flat region. The study considers two initial quantum states:\nGHZ and W states. The findings reveal that in both cases, measurement\nuncertainty increases steadily with rising Hawking temperature. When comparing\nthe GHZ and W states, the GHZ state initially exhibits lower measurement\nuncertainty at low Hawking temperatures than the W state, indicating greater\nresilience to Hawking radiation. Additionally, when the quantum memories remain\nin the asymptotically flat region while the measured particle falls toward the\nblack hole, the uncertainties for GHZ and W states do not align at high\ntemperatures. The GHZ state consistently demonstrates lower measurement\nuncertainty, showcasing its superior robustness against Hawking radiation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
