These anomalies are patterns that deviate\nsignificantly from what the IAD model has learned from the data during\ntraining. However, in real-world scenarios, the criteria for what constitutes\nnormality often change, necessitating the reclassification of previously\nanomalous instances as normal. To address this challenge, we propose a new\nscenario termed \"normality addition,\" involving the post-training adjustment of\ndecision boundaries to incorporate new normalities. To address this challenge,\nwe propose a method called Normality Addition via Normality Detection (NAND),\nleveraging a vision-language model. NAND performs normality detection which\ndetect patterns related to the intended normality within images based on\ntextual descriptions. We then modify the results of a pre-trained IAD model to\nimplement this normality addition. Using the benchmark dataset in IAD, MVTec\nAD, we establish an evaluation protocol for the normality addition task and\nempirically demonstrate the effectiveness of the NAND method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
