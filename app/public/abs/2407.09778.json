Existing AI-based prediction methods suffer from limited\ndata availability and poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose\nDeepCSNet, a deep learning approach designed to predict electron-impact\nionization cross sections using minimal training data. We present two\nconfigurations of DeepCSNet: one tailored for specific molecules and another\nfor various molecules. Our numerical results, focusing on electron-impact\ndoubly differential ionization cross sections, demonstrate DeepCSNet's superior\ngeneralization ability, accurately predicting cross sections across a wide\nrange of energies and incident angles. Additionally, DeepCSNet shows promising\nresults in predicting cross sections for previously unencountered molecules,\nhighlighting its potential for practical applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
