Motivated by physical phenomena one of the\nunknowns in the system is accompanied by a singular perturbation parameter\n{\\epsilon}^2 . By employing variational techniques, we establish the existence\nof solutions for all values of {\\epsilon} and get results on their qualitative\nproperties, including regularity. Additionally, we analyse the behaviour of\nsolutions as {\\epsilon} {\\to} 0, demonstrating their pointwise convergence to\nthe solution of the problem for {\\epsilon} = 0. We establish the uniqueness of\nthis solution modulo translations. Additionally, in the final section, through\nan appropriate change of scale, we relate this problem and the second\nPainlev\\'e equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
