We demonstrate the\nexistence and uniqueness of a diffusion process that acts as a weak solution to\nour equation. This process can be described as a distorted Brownian motion\noriginating from a delocalized point. Utilizing Dirichlet form theory, we prove\nthe existence of a weak solution for a quasi-everywhere point in a state space.\nHowever uniqueness is not assured for solutions commencing from points outside\npolar sets, and explicitly characterizing these sets poses a significant\nchallenge. To address this, we employ the H_2-condition introduced by Albeverio\net al.(2003). This condition provides a more thorough understanding of the\nuniqueness issue within the framework of Dirichlet forms. Consequently the\nH_2-condition is pivotal in enhancing the analysis of weak solutions, ensuring\na more detailed comprehension of the problem. An explicit expression for the\ngeneralized Schr\\\"odinger operator associated with certain kernels is also\nprovided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
