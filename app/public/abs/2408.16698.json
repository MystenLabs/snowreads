Herein, we introduce\nSymplectic Graph Neural Networks (SympGNNs) that can effectively handle system\nidentification in high-dimensional Hamiltonian systems, as well as node\nclassification. SympGNNs combines symplectic maps with permutation\nequivariance, a property of graph neural networks. Specifically, we propose two\nvariants of SympGNNs: i) G-SympGNN and ii) LA-SympGNN, arising from different\nparameterizations of the kinetic and potential energy. We demonstrate the\ncapabilities of SympGNN on two physical examples: a 40-particle coupled\nHarmonic oscillator, and a 2000-particle molecular dynamics simulation in a\ntwo-dimensional Lennard-Jones potential. Furthermore, we demonstrate the\nperformance of SympGNN in the node classification task, achieving accuracy\ncomparable to the state-of-the-art. We also empirically show that SympGNN can\novercome the oversmoothing and heterophily problems, two key challenges in the\nfield of graph neural networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
