This paper presents a novel approach to human pose\nestimation using machine learning algorithms to predict human posture and\ntranslate them into robot motion commands using ultra-wideband (UWB) nodes, as\nan alternative to motion sensors. The study utilizes five UWB sensors\nimplemented on the human body to enable the classification of still poses and\nmore robust posture recognition. This approach ensures effective posture\nrecognition across a variety of subjects. These range measurements serve as\ninput features for posture prediction models, which are implemented and\ncompared for accuracy. For this purpose, machine learning algorithms including\nK-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and deep Multi-Layer\nPerceptron (MLP) neural network are employed and compared in predicting\ncorresponding postures. We demonstrate the proposed approach for real-time\ncontrol of different mobile/aerial robots with inference implemented in a ROS 2\nnode. Experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, showcasing\nsuccessful prediction of human posture and corresponding robot movements with\nhigh accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
