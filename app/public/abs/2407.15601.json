For that purpose we\nintroduce the notion of Mokobodzki's stochastic intervals $\\mathscr M(\\theta)$\n(roughly speaking, maximal stochastic interval on which Mokobodzki's condition\nis satisfied when starting from the stopping time $\\theta$) and the notion of\nreflected BSDEs without Mokobodzki's condition (this is a generalization and\nmodification of the notion introduced by Hamad\\'ene and Hassani (2005)). We\nprove an existence and uniqueness result for RBSDEs with driver $f$ that is\nnon-increasing with respect to the value variable (no restrictions on the\ngrowth) and Lipschitz continuous with respect to the control variable, and with\ndata in $L^1$ spaces. Next, by using RBSDEs, we show numerous results on Dynkin\ngames: existence of the value process, saddle points, and convergence of the\npenalty scheme. We also show that the game is not played beyond $\\mathscr\nM(\\theta)$, when starting from $\\theta$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
