Fundamentally, the\ngoal of classical factor modeling is statistical modeling of stock returns, and\nin this work, we explore using deep generative modeling to enhance classical\nfactor models. Prior work has explored the use of deep generative models in\norder to model hundreds of stocks, leading to accurate risk forecasting and\nalpha portfolio construction; however, that specific model does not allow for\neasy factor modeling interpretation in that the factor exposures cannot be\ndeduced. In this work, we introduce NeuralFactors, a novel machine-learning\nbased approach to factor analysis where a neural network outputs factor\nexposures and factor returns, trained using the same methodology as variational\nautoencoders. We show that this model outperforms prior approaches both in\nterms of log-likelihood performance and computational efficiency. Further, we\nshow that this method is competitive to prior work in generating realistic\nsynthetic data, covariance estimation, risk analysis (e.g., value at risk, or\nVaR, of portfolios), and portfolio optimization. Finally, due to the connection\nto classical factor analysis, we analyze how the factors our model learns\ncluster together and show that the factor exposures could be used for embedding\nstocks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
