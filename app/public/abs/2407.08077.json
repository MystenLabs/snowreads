Here, we report the results of density-functional\ntheory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic\nstructure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound,\nwhich was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention,\nhitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with\na total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows\nenergy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the\nFermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of\nlow-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of\nmagnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach\na magnitude up to 500 $\\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values\nobtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
