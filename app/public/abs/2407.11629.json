While most prior studies\nfocus solely on a single language, an ideal speaker anonymization system should\nbe capable of handling multiple languages. This paper proposes MUSA, a\nMulti-lingual Speaker Anonymization approach that employs a serial\ndisentanglement strategy to perform a step-by-step disentanglement from a\nglobal time-invariant representation to a temporal time-variant representation.\nBy utilizing semantic distillation and self-supervised speaker distillation,\nthe serial disentanglement strategy can avoid strong inductive biases and\nexhibit superior generalization performance across different languages.\nMeanwhile, we propose a straightforward anonymization strategy that employs\nempty embedding with zero values to simulate the speaker identity concealment\nprocess, eliminating the need for conversion to a pseudo-speaker identity and\nthereby reducing the complexity of speaker anonymization process. Experimental\nresults on VoicePrivacy official datasets and multi-lingual datasets\ndemonstrate that MUSA can effectively protect speaker privacy while preserving\nlinguistic content and para-linguistic information.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
