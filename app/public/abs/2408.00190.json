Our focus is on\nthe associated production of tau lepton with electron/muon at the\nelectron-positron ($e^+e^-$) colliders, related to four-Fermi SMEFT effective\noperators. To respect the upper limits on effective couplings from lepton\nflavor violating tau decays, we conduct a cut-based analysis to achieve\nsufficient signal significance. We utilize the optimal observable technique\n(OOT) to estimate the optimal sensitivity of the effective couplings. The\nimpact of electron beam polarization and the interplay of signal and background\nin enhancing the optimal sensitivity of the effective couplings are discussed\nin detail. We find that the sensitivity of flavor-violating effective couplings\nis enhanced by order of one for 3 TeV center of mass (CM) energy and 1000\n$\\rm{fb}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity at the $e^+e^-$ colliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
