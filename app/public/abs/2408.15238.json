On the other hand, the behaviour of orbits of \\textbf{all} points in\na dynamical system is much less understood, especially for sparse subsets of\nthe integers. We generalize a method introduced by A. Venkatesh to tackle this\nproblem in two directions, general $\\mathbb{R}^d$ actions instead of flows, and\nweak mixing, rather than mixing, actions. Along the way, we also establish some\nbasic properties of weak mixing and show weak mixing for the time 1-map of a\nweak mixing flow. The main examples are equidistribution along\n$\\{(n^{1+\\epsilon_i})_{i=1}^d\\}$, which is a direct generalisation of\nVenkatesh's example, and equidistribution along random subsets of\n$\\mathbb{Z}^d$ for horosperical action.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
