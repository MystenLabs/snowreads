In this work, we\nderive a batch update for the recently introduced elliptical-target tracker\ncalled MEM-EKF*. The MEM-EKF* is based on the same likelihood as the\nwell-established random matrix approach but is derived from the multiplicative\nerror model (MEM) and uses an extended Kalman filter (EKF) to update the target\nstate sequentially, i.e., measurement-by-measurement. Our batch variant updates\nthe target state in a single step based on straightforward sums over all\nmeasurements and the MEM-specific pseudo-measurements. This drastically reduces\nthe scaling constant for typical implementations and indeed we find a speedup\nof roughly 100x in our numerical experiments. At the same time, the estimation\nerror which we measure using the Gaussian Wasserstein distance stays\nsignificantly below that of the random matrix approach in coordinated turn\nscenarios while being comparable otherwise.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ee6nKXVOjfKZNJrO0lLRf91Rg7pdR4Stxh0xZ1fGQIE","pdfSize":"882074"}
