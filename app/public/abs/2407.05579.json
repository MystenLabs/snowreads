Furthermore, we make use of the angular\nacoustic scale to analyse the effect of introducing condensed CMB information\non the cosmological parameters informing DE evolution. The analysis is divided\ninto cases based on the variability of priors inferred from early-time physics.\nUsing a quadratic parametrisation, $X(z)$, for DE density, we find evidence for\nDE evolution in all cases, both with and without the angular acoustic scale. We\nreconstruct $X(z)$ using best fit parameters and find that DE density starts to\nexhibit dynamical behaviour at $z \\sim 0.5 $, assuming negative values beyond\n$z\\sim 1.5$. The data show no significant preference for $X(z)$CDM over a\n$\\Lambda$CDM, with both models performing equally well according to our chosen\nmetrics of reduced $\\chi^2$ and the Durbin-Watson statistic.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
