The quantum part of our method computes a fixed\nnumber of elements of a Hamiltonian-matrix polynomial via a quantum polynomial\nfiltering technique. This technique can be implemented using Hamiltonian\nsimulation or block encoding, suitable for early fault-tolerant and\nfault-tolerant regimes, respectively. The classical part of our method is a\nrandomized iterative algorithm that takes as input the matrix elements computed\nfrom the quantum part and outputs an approximation of ground state of the\nHamiltonian. For the per-iteration complexity of our method, the required\nclassical time is independent of system size, and the quantum circuit\ncomplexity depends polylogarithmically on the system size. We prove that with\nprobability one, our method converges to an approximation of a ground state of\nthe Hamiltonian. We also show a lower bound of the fidelity of the approximate\nground state with the true one. The lower bound depends linearly on the\nmagnitude of noise occurring from quantum computation if it is smaller than a\ncritical value. Several numerical experiments demonstrate that our method\nprovides a good approximation of ground state in the presence of systematic\nand/or sampling noise.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
