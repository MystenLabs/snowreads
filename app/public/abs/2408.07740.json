The presence of the axion field has structural consequences, in\nparticular, it results in a thinner (or even prevents its existence)\nheat-blanketing envelope, significantly altering the cooling patterns of\nneutron stars. We exploit the anomalous cooling behavior to constrain\npreviously uncharted regions of the axion parameter space by comparing model\npredictions with existing data from isolated neutron stars. Notably, this\nanalysis does not require the lighter-than-expected QCD axion to be the dark\nmatter candidate.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
