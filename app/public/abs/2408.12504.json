Here we propose a scheme to realize the all-electrical manipulation\nof spin-polarized current in an altermagnetic bilayer. Such a bilayer system\ncan host layer-spin locking, in which one layer hosts a spin-polarized current\nwhile the other layer hosts a current with opposite spin polarization. An\nout-of-plane electric field breaks the layer degeneracy, leading to a\ngate-tunable spin-polarized current whose polarization can be fully reversed\nupon flipping the polarity of the electric field. Using first-principles\ncalculations, we show that CrS bilayer with C-type antiferromagnetic exchange\ninteraction exhibits a hidden layer-spin locking mechanism that enables the\nspin polarization of the transport current to be electrically manipulated via\nthe layer degree of freedom. We demonstrate that sign-reversible spin\npolarization as high as 87% can be achieved at room temperature. This work\npresents the pioneering concept of layer-spintronics which synergizes\naltermagnetism and bilayer stacking to achieve efficient electrical control of\nspin.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
