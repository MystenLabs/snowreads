Targeted primarily at social scientists and other non-programmers,\nthis article explains the computational benefits of moving code to C++ in terms\nof speed and syntax. We provide a comprehensive overview of Armadillo's\ncapabilities, highlighting its user-friendly syntax akin to MATLAB and its\nefficiency for computationally intensive tasks. The 'cpp11armadillo' package\nsimplifies a part of the process of using C++ within R by offering additional\nease of integration for those who require high-performance linear algebra\noperations in their R workflows. This work aims to bridge the gap between\ncomputational efficiency and accessibility, making advanced linear algebra\noperations more approachable for R users without extensive programming\nbackgrounds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"c3YJ2v1KqiKcphioLZiTobT9RFfpAWrY6SpLpT_2fxY","pdfSize":"170277"}
