In this paper, we develop a realistic\n3D magneto-hydrodynamic model using which we explore the temporal evolution of\nreconnection flux during the MFR evolution using both numerical simulations and\nobservational data. Our initial coronal configuration features an isothermal\natmosphere and a potential arcade magnetic field beneath which an MFR emerges\nat the lower boundary. As the MFR rises, we observe significant stretching and\ncompression of the overlying magnetic field beneath it. Magnetic reconnection\nbegins with the gradual formation of a current sheet, eventually culminating\nwith the impulsive expulsion of the flux rope. We analyze the temporal\nevolution of reconnection fluxes during two successive MFR eruptions while\ncontinuously emerging the twisted flux rope through the lower boundary. We also\nconduct a similar analysis using observational data from the Helioseismic and\nMagnetic Imager (HMI) and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) for an\neruptive event. Comparing our MHD simulation with observational data, we find\nthat reconnection flux play a crucial role in determination of CME speeds. From\nthe onset to the eruption, the reconnection flux shows a strong linear\ncorrelation with the velocity. This nearly realistic simulation of a solar\neruption provides important insights into the complex dynamics of CME\ninitiation and progression.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
