A variety of ab\ninitio methods are now available for computing the properties of nuclei from\ninteractions rooted in Quantum Chromodynamics, but applications have largely\nbeen limited to zero temperature. In the present work, we extend one such\nmethod, the In-Medium Similarity Renormalization Group (IMSRG), to finite\ntemperature. Using an exactly-solvable schematic model that captures essential\nfeatures of nuclear interactions, we show that the FT-IMSRG can accurately\ndetermine the energetics of nuclei at finite temperature, and we explore the\naccuracy of the FT-IMSRG in different parameter regimes, e.g., strong and weak\npairing. In anticipation of FT-IMSRG applications for finite nuclei and\ninfinite matter, we discuss differences arising from the choice of working with\nthe canonical and the grand canonical ensembles. In future work, we will apply\nthe FT-IMSRG with realistic nuclear interactions to compute nuclear structure\nand reaction properties at finite temperature, which are important ingredients\nfor understanding nucleosynthesis in stellar environments, or modeling\nreactions of hot compound nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
