There is\nhowever no consistent explanation for the host of intriguing observations that\nhave accrued over the years, including a prominently non-monotonic resistivity\nnear $T_c$, and observation of spatial textures, with a characteristic spatial\nand energy scale, via scanning tunneling spectroscopy. We resolve all these\nfeatures using a Heisenberg-Kondo lattice model for EuB$_6$, solved using exact\ndiagonalisation based Langevin dynamics. Over a temperature window $\\sim 0.7T_c\n- 1.5T_c$ we observe electronic and magnetic textures with the correct spatial\nand energy scale, and confirm an associated non-monotonic resistivity. We\npredict a distinctly `non Drude' optical conductivity in the polaronic phase,\nand propose a field-temperature phase diagram testable through spin resolved\ntunneling spectroscopy. We argue that the anomalous properties of EuB$_6$, and\nmagnetic polaron materials in general, occur due to a non monotonic change in\nspatial character of `near Fermi level' eigenstates with temperature, and the\nappearance of a weak pseudogap near $T_c$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DgLU_q9Z7pnzj1nDNdhKYP2HYr0OyQO8HZ-UC3tvORk","pdfSize":"1446692"}
