Our proof uses\nbicategory theory for C*-bimodules developed by Meyer and Sehnem, allowing us\nto avoid the use of K-theory classification of C*-algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
