So far, most studies on the fluid profile of an expanding\nbubble are limited to transitions that complete in a much shorter time scale\nthan the cosmic expansion. In this study, we investigate gravitational effects\non the fluid profile beyond the self-similar regime. For this purpose we\ncombine a hydrodynamic scheme in the presence of gravity with a fluid\ncomputation scheme under energy injection from the bubble wall. By performing\n(1+1)d simulations of spherical bubble for constant wall velocities, we find\nthat the fluid generally develops a thinner shell in our cosmological setup,\nwhich qualitatively agrees with previous studies discussing the late-time\nbehavior of fluid in expanding spacetime. We also observe reduction in the\nenergy budget for the fluid kinetic energy. Furthermore, we find that the fluid\nprofile develops sub-structure for accelerating bubble walls. We also comment\non the possible broadening of the SGWB spectral plateau.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
