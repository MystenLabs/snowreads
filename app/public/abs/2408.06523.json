Together with the nova\nshell ejected in the 1970's this makes RX Pup the first system with three nova\nshells observed. This triad of eruptions suggests a change in the nova\nrecurrence time. The most likely explanation is an alteration in the mass\ntransfer rate attributed to evolutionary changes of the mass-donor in the\nsystem. Notably, comparative analyses with theoretical models indicate an\nincrease in the average mass transfer rate by a factor of three over the past\n10,000 years. This makes RX Pup a unique system, which allows us to probe\nmillenium-scale evolution of mass transfer rates in binary systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qsbbp-5TjpZQ2gz2MeRF4gAbP0rc0Vfz4--Zt05QR6Q","pdfSize":"1916111"}
