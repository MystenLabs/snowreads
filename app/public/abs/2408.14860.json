Specifically, we design a\ndiffusion transformer architecture that predicts noise from noisy 3D surface\nvertices and normals. With this architecture, DiffSurf is able to generate 3D\nsurfaces in various poses and shapes, such as human bodies, hands, animals and\nman-made objects. Further, DiffSurf is versatile in that it can address various\n3D downstream tasks including morphing, body shape variation and 3D human mesh\nfitting to 2D keypoints. Experimental results on 3D human model benchmarks\ndemonstrate that DiffSurf can generate shapes with greater diversity and higher\nquality than previous generative models. Furthermore, when applied to the task\nof single-image 3D human mesh recovery, DiffSurf achieves accuracy comparable\nto prior techniques at a near real-time rate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
