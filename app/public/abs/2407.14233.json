We provide the exact\nrate of decay of the sensitivity of the eigenvalues to the non-Hermiticity\nparameter $g$, on the logarithmic scale, as the Lyapunov exponent minus the\nnon-Hermiticity parameter. Namely, for $0 < g < \\gamma(\\lambda_{0})$ we show\nthat $-\\frac{1}{n}\\log|\\lambda_{g}-\\lambda_{0}|\\sim \\gamma(\\lambda_{0})-g$ and\nthat the eigenvalue remains real for all such $g$. This provides an alternative\nproof to that of Goldsheid and Sodin that the perturbed eigenvalue remains real\nand specifies the exact rate at which the eigenvalue is exponentially close to\nthe unperturbed eigenvalue.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
