In\n2020, Larry Rolen, Zack Tripp, and Ian Wagner generalized the crank for p(n) in\norder to accommodate Ramanujan-like congruences for $k$-colored partitions. In\nthis paper, we utilize the techniques used by Rolen, Tripp, and Wagner for\ncrank generating functions in order to define a crank generating function for\n$(k + j)$-colored partitions where $j$ colors have distinct parts. We provide\nthree infinite families of crank generating functions and conjecture a general\ncrank generating function for such partitions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CeWfct1aSxI82MHujmNvIzXs3Zl8Q9N7QosrPCNe5RQ","pdfSize":"126852"}
