For $p,q \\geq 1$, we\nshow that, up to a conformal transformation, there is only one domain in\n$\\mathbf{Ein}^{p,q}$ that is bounded in a suitable stereographic projection and\nwhose action by its conformal group is cocompact. This domain, which we call a\ndiamond, is a model for the symmetric space of $\\operatorname{PO}(p,1) \\times\n\\operatorname{PO}(1,q)$. We deduce a classification of closed conformally flat\nmanifolds with proper development.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
