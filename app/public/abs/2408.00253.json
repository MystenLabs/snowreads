In the cloud, a query is billed based on either its compute time or\nthe amount of data it processes. We observe that analytical queries are either\ncompute- or IO-bound and each query type executes cheaper in a different\npricing model. We exploit this opportunity and propose methods to build cheaper\nexecution plans across pricing models that complete within user-defined runtime\nconstraints. We implement these methods and produce execution plans spanning\nmultiple pricing models that reduce the monetary cost for workloads by as much\nas 56%. We reduce individual query costs by as much as 90%. The prices chosen\nby cloud vendors for cloud services also impact savings opportunities. To study\nthis effect, we simulate our proposed methods with different cloud prices and\nobserve that multi-cloud savings are robust to changes in cloud vendor prices.\nThese results indicate the massive opportunity to save money by executing\nworkloads across multiple pricing models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x2QzX7LhAFOfHOpQ-o042B8Dgk-eTsGhNtKazrzi9to","pdfSize":"1231528","txDigest":"21kYF5H16zWhnyvT5VUEeFvuyZsSbQqwqBxiGE2uYonj","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
