Solutions have previously been constructed by\nChaturvedi [SIAM J. Math. Anal., 55(5), 5345--5385, 2023] for initial data in\nan exponentially-weighted $H^{10}$ space, but it is not a priori clear whether\nthese solutions have more regularity than the initial data. We improve\nChaturvedi's existence result in two ways: our solutions are $C^\\infty$ for\npositive times, and we allow initial data in a sub-exponentially-weighted\n$L^\\infty$ space, at the cost of requiring a mild positivity condition at time\nzero.\n  To prove uniqueness, we require stronger assumptions on the initial data:\nH\\\"older continuity and the absence of vacuum regions. These are the same\nassumptions that are required for uniqueness in prior work on the soft\npotentials case.\n  Along the way to proving existence and uniqueness, we establish some useful\nresults that were previously only known in the case of soft potentials,\nincluding spreading of positivity and propagation of H\\\"older continuity. Many\nof the proof strategies from the soft potentials case do not apply here because\nof the more severe loss of velocity moments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
