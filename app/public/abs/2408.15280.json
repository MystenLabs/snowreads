As a corollary, we can also obtain the corresponding\n$L^p(\\mathbb{R}^n)$-boundedness when $1<p<2$.\n  These theorems are rigorous improvements on the recent works of Staubach and\nhis collaborators. When $0\\leq \\rho\\leq 1,\\delta\\leq \\max\\{\\rho,1-\\rho\\}$, by\nusing some similar techniques in this note, we can get the corresponding\ntheorems which coincide with the known results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
