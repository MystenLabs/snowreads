Radio\nobservations revealed a bright arc with an index of $\\sim -0.40$, which stands\nin contrast to the index of $\\sim -0.69$ for the rest. This arc is coincident\nwith the point-like \\emph{Fermi} source 4FGL J0426.5+5434 and KM2A source\n1LHAASO J0428+5531. The rest of the SNR has a hard GeV spectrum and a soft TeV\nspectrum, implying a spectral cut-off or break near 1 TeV. Since there is no\nX-ray counterpart and no pulse signal detected, the gamma-ray $(\\gamma$-ray)\nemission mechanism from the SNR and the point-like source appear puzzling. In\nthis work, we reanalyse the $\\gamma$-ray emission using 14 yr data recorded by\n\\emph{Fermi} Large Area Telescope and find that the spectrum of the northern\nhalf-sphere is compatible with a broken power law with a break at 146 $\\pm$ 11\nGeV and photon indices of $\\Gamma_{\\rm{Northlobe}}$\n=$1.54\\pm0.04_{\\rm{stat}}\\pm0.07_{\\rm{syst}}$\n($2.28\\pm0.08_{\\rm{stat}}\\pm0.12_{\\rm{syst}}$) below (above) the break. In\naddition, the southern half-sphere can be described well with a single power\nlaw with $\\Gamma_{\\rm{Southlobe}}$\n=$1.95\\pm0.07_{\\rm{stat}}\\pm0.09_{\\rm{syst}}$. Since the southern half-sphere\nis well correlated with CO emission, we propose that the $\\gamma$-ray emission\nof the northern half-sphere could be dominated by relativistic electrons via\ninverse-Compton processes, while the southern half-sphere is dominated by\ncosmic rays via hadronic processes. 4FGL J0426.5+5434 may result from the\nillumination of a cloud by escaping cosmic rays or recent shock-cloud\ninteraction. Observations from LHAASO-KM2A thus favour the possibility of a\ncosmic-ray PeVatron candidate, however, leptonic scenarios cannot be ruled out.\nFurther multi-wavelength observations are warranted to confirm the hadronic\nnature of 1LHAASO J4028+5531.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x1lgvSfg5-1xjj4VI2vkTsgwDEQEsjUdsDpCkpvGTr0","pdfSize":"1913332"}
