Theoretical calculations predict gapped and flat bands in EuZn2As2\nbut gapless structure in EuCd2As2. In this work, low-temperature (77 K) cleaved\nEuZn2As2 crystals are studied using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy\n(STM/S) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Defects-induced local\ndensity of states (LDOS) modification with a triangular shape helps identify\nthe surface terminations: Eu versus AsZn surface. While large bandgaps (~1.5 eV\nat 77 K) are observed on both pristine surfaces, the bandgap width is found to\nbe very sensitive to local heterogeneity, such as defects and step edges, with\nthe tendency of reduction. Combining experimental data with DFT simulations, we\nconclude that the modified bandgap in the heterogeneous area arises from Zn\nvacancies and/or substitution by As atoms. Our investigation offers important\ninformation for reevaluating the electron topology of the EuM2As2 family.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oIXfi9g6RT9V8h-_-c3FAwMYcpHE6eF4cdZmYOPYWzY","pdfSize":"1530723"}
