In this paper, we reveal a new security\nvulnerability of the RTC circuit, where the internal storage time or timestamp\ncan be arbitrarily modified forward or backward. The security threat of dynamic\nmodifications of system time caused by this vulnerability is called TimeTravel.\nBased on acoustic resonance and piezoelectric effects, TimeTravel applies\nacoustic guide waves to the quartz crystal, thereby adjusting the\ncharacteristics of the oscillating signal transmitted into the RTC circuit. By\nmanipulating the parameters of acoustic waves, TimeTravel can accelerate or\ndecelerate the timing speed of system time at an adjustable rate, resulting in\nthe relative drift of the timing, which can pose serious safety threats. To\nassess the severity of TimeTravel, we examine nine modules and two commercial\ndevices under the RTC circuit. The experimental results show that TimeTravel\ncan drift system time forward and backward at a chosen speed with a maximum 93%\naccuracy. Our analysis further shows that TimeTravel can maintain an attack\nsuccess rate of no less than 77% under environments with typical obstacle\nitems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
