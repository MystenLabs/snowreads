We derive weak\nconditions on the phase which ensure $L^p$ bounds beyond the universal $p \\geq\n2 \\cdot \\frac{n+1}{n-1}$ range guaranteed by Stein's oscillatory integral\ntheorem. This expands and elucidates pioneering work of Bourgain from the early\n1990s. We also consider a closely related class of variable coefficient\nSchr\\\"odinger propagator-type operators, and show that the corresponding theory\ndiffers significantly from that of the H\\\"ormander-type operators. The main\ningredient in the proof is a curved Kakeya/Nikodym maximal function estimate.\nThis is established by combining the polynomial method with certain uniform\nsublevel set estimates for real analytic functions. The sublevel set estimates\nare the main novelty in the argument and can be interpreted as a form of\nquantification of linear independence in the $C^{\\omega}$ category.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
