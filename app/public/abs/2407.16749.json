These stars are estimated to be magnified with a\nfactor of more than a few thousands. In addition to the smooth mass\ndistribution in the macro-lens model, the distribution of microlenses\noriginating from, for instance, intracluster stars affects the event rate and\nthe peak magnification significantly. We propose an analytic model of the\nhigh-magnification tail of the probability distribution function (PDF) in which\nthe probability is assumed to be proportional to the number of independent\nmicrolens critical curves. Our model can explain the parameter dependence of\nthe PDF on the mass fraction of the microlenses and the background\nmagnification seen in ray-tracing simulations. The effect of a finite source\nsize is also studied to derive a fitting formula for the suppression factor.\nFor an application of our model, we calculate the event rate of the Icarus-like\nsystem and the probability distribution of observed positions of such system,\nshowing good agreement with the HST observations. Our model predicts a\ncomplicated dependence of the probability distribution of observed positions of\nhighly magnified events on the magnification threshold.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
