In this paper, we aim to re-design\nWiFi so that monostatic sensing (mimicking radar) can be achieved over the\nmultistatic communication infrastructure. Specifically, we propose, design, and\nimplement ISAC-Fi as an ISAC-ready Wi-Fi prototype. We first present a novel\nself-interference cancellation scheme, in order to extract reflected (radio\nfrequency) signals for sensing purpose in the face of transmissions. We then\nsubtly revise existing Wi-Fi framework so as to seamlessly operate monostatic\nsensing under Wi-Fi communication standard. Finally, we offer two ISAC-Fi\ndesigns: while a USRP-based one emulates a totally re-designed ISAC-Fi device,\nanother plug-andplay design allows for backward compatibility by attaching an\nextra module to an arbitrary Wi-Fi device. We perform extensive experiments to\nvalidate the efficacy of ISAC-Fi and also to demonstrate its superiority over\nexisting Wi-Fi sensing proposals.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
