Here, we present laboratory\nexperiments aimed at extending the high-resolution spectroscopy of protonated\ncarbonyl sulphide (HOCS$^+$), a recently detected molecular ion in space. Using\na frequency-modulated free-space absorption spectrometer, we detected\nrotational transitions of HOCS$^+$ in an extended negative glow discharge with\na mixture of H$_2$ and OCS, extending the high-resolution rotational\ncharacterisation of the cation well into the millimetre wave region (200-370\nGHz). Comparisons with prior measurements and quantum chemical calculations\nrevealed an overall agreement in the spectroscopic parameters. With the new\nspectroscopic dataset in hand, we re-investigated the observations of HOCS$^+$\ntowards G+0.693-0.027, which were initially based solely on K$_a$ = 0 lines\ncontaminated by HNC$^{34}$S. This re-investigation enabled the detection of\nweak K$_a$ = 0 transitions, free from HNC$^{34}$S contamination. Our\nhigh-resolution spectroscopic characterisation also provides valuable insights\nfor future millimetre and submillimetre astronomical observations of these\nspecies in different interstellar environments. In particular, the new\nhigh-resolution catalogue will facilitate the search for this cation in cold\ndark clouds, where very narrow line widths are typically observed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_mlB8FCOJhFtF8wqKpqljb-cJzpBg3IkVV8m6Wc1DiI","pdfSize":"3216240"}
