Most of these analyses focus on either\nspatial properties of entanglement or its temporal behavior. Negativity, as an\nentanglement measure, quantifies entanglement between different\nnon-complementary blocks of a many-body system. Here, we consider a combined\nspatial-temporal analysis of entanglement negativity in a strongly correlated\nmany-body system to characterize complex formation of correlations through\nnon-equilibrium dynamics of such systems. A bond defect is introduced through a\nlocal quench at one of the boundaries of a uniform Heisenberg spin chain. Using\nnegativity and entanglement entropy, computed by the time-dependent density\nmatrix renormalization group, we analyze the extension of entanglement in the\nmodel as a function of time. We find that an entanglement cloud is formed,\ndetached from the boundary spin and composed of spins with which it is highly\nentangled. The cloud travels ballistically in the chain until it reaches the\nother end where it reflects back and the cycle repeats. The revival dynamics\nexhibits an intriguing contraction (expansion) of the cloud as it moves away\nfrom (towards) the boundary spin.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
