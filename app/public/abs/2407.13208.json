One puzzle involving these cubes\nis to create a $2\\times2\\times2$ model with eight distinct MacMahon cubes to\nrecreate a larger version with the external coloring of a specified target\ncube, also a MacMahon cube, and touching interior faces are the same color.\nJ.H. Conway is credited with arranging the cubes in a $6\\times6$ tableau that\ngives a solution to this puzzle. In fact, the particular set of eight cubes\nthat solves this puzzle can be arranged in exactly \\textit{two} distinct ways\nto solve the puzzle. We study a less restrictive puzzle without requiring\ninterior face matching. We describe solutions to the $2\\times2\\times2$ puzzle\nand the number of distinct solutions attainable for a collection of eight\ncubes. Additionally, given a collection of eight MacMahon cubes, we study the\nnumber of target cubes that can be built in a $2\\times2\\times2$ model. We\ncalculate the distribution of the number of cubes that can be built over all\ncollections of eight cubes (the maximum number is five) and provide a complete\ncharacterization of the collections that can build five distinct cubes.\nFurthermore, we identify nine new sets of twelve cubes, called Minimum\nUniversal sets, from which all 30 cubes can be built.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nfOFzjHnaagOz6eDGTWkXFPVI70-SC0c9VTcUAm9rUo","pdfSize":"718407"}
