This paper provides\na unified framework for $N$-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes Cahn-Hilliard\nAllen-Cahn mixture models with a single momentum equation. The framework\nnaturally emerges from continuum mixture theory, exhibits an energy-dissipative\nstructure, and is invariant to the choice of fundamental variables. This opens\nthe door to exploring connections between existing $N$-phase models and\nfacilitates the computation of $N$-phase flow models rooted in continuum\nmixture theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FQPAiHsiAzXF75ETGsWOgEeCv2jMUy-5aPirG0Yk4qE","pdfSize":"424864"}
