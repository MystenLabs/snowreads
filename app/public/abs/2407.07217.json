States could save up to 100% of their per-enrollee costs by reclassifying\noriginal enrollees into the newly eligible group. We examine whether this\nfiscal incentive changed states' enrollment practices. We find that Medicaid\nexpansion caused large declines in the number of beneficiaries enrolled in the\noriginal Medicaid population, suggesting widespread reclassifications. In 2019\nalone, this phenomenon affected 4.4 million Medicaid enrollees at a federal\ncost of $8.3 billion. Our results imply that reclassifications inflated the\nfederal cost of Medicaid expansion by 18.2%.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
