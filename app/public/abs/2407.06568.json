The\nproof exploits the characterization of Hardy's inequality in the fractional\nsetting in terms of positive local weak supersolutions of the relevant\nEuler-Lagrange equation and relies on the construction of suitable\nsupersolutions by means of the distance function from the boundary of $\\Omega$.\nMoreover, we compute the limit of $\\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}$ as $s\\nearrow 1$, as\nwell as the limit when $p \\nearrow \\infty$. Finally, we apply our results to\nestablish a lower bound for the non-local eigenvalue $\\lambda_{s,p}(\\Omega)$ in\nterms of $\\mathfrak{h}_{s,p}$ when $sp>N$, which, in turn, gives an improved\nCheeger inequality whose constant does not vanish as $p\\nearrow \\infty$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
