Any such\na subspace $H$ is isomorphic to some Orlicz sequence space $\\ell_\\psi$. In\nterms of dilations of the function $f$, a description of strongly embedded\nsubspaces of this type is obtained, and conditions, guaranteeing that the unit\nball of such a subspace consists of functions with equicontinuous norms in\n$L_M$, are found. In particular, we prove that there is a wide class of Orlicz\nspaces $L_M$ (containing $L^p$-spaces, $1\\le p< 2$), for which each of the\nabove properties of $H$ holds if and only if the Matuszewska-Orlicz indices of\nthe functions $M$ and $\\psi$ satisfy the inequality:\n$\\alpha_\\psi^0>\\beta_M^\\infty$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
