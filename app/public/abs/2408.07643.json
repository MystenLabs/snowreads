Starting from a collectively polarized initial state,\nwe map out the dynamical phase diagram and identify a crossover between regimes\nof regular and anomalously slow relaxation of the initial collective order,\nthat strongly depends on both the degree of interaction disorder and\nanisotropy. In addition, we find the regime of slow relaxation is characterized\nby a sub-ballistic propagation of correlations that remained confined to short\ndistances even at long times. To explain our findings we develop an analytic\nmodel based on decoupled clusters of interacting dipoles that goes beyond prior\ntheoretical works and enables us to identify multiple relaxation timescales.\nOur findings can be relevant for a wide variety of quantum science platforms\nnaturally featuring disordered dipolar interactions, including polar molecules,\nfrozen Rydberg gases and NV centers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BO-fu7cz98Y1W-qtoZiyAKCaV9d5B1o3wEhKzAuCarg","pdfSize":"4306822"}
