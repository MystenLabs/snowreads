A major goal\nof gravitational wave data analysis is to speed up the detection and parameter\nestimation process using machine learning techniques, in light of an\nanticipated surge in detected events that would render traditional methods\nimpractical. Here, we present the first detections of new gravitational-wave\ncandidate events in data from a network of interferometric detectors enabled by\nmachine learning. We discuss several new enhancements of our ResNet-based deep\nlearning code, AresGW, that increased its sensitivity, including a new\nhierarchical classification of triggers, based on different noise and frequency\nfilters. The enhancements resulted in a significant reduction in the false\nalarm rate, allowing AresGW to surpass traditional pipelines in the number of\ndetected events in its effective training range (single source masses between 7\nand 50 solar masses and source chirp masses between 10 and 40 solar masses),\nwhen the new detections are included. We calculate the astrophysical\nsignificance of events detected with AresGW using a logarithmic ranking\nstatistic and injections into O3 data. Furthermore, we present spectrograms,\nparameter estimation, and reconstruction in the time domain for our new\ncandidate events and discuss the distribution of their properties. In addition,\nthe AresGW code exhibited very good performance when tested across various\ntwo-detector setups and on observational data from the O1 and O2 observing\nperiods. Our findings underscore the remarkable potential of AresGW as a fast\nand sensitive detection algorithm for gravitational-wave astronomy, paving the\nway for a larger number of future discoveries.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
