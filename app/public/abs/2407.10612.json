When signals transmitted from light emitting diodes (LEDs) are\nreflected from IRSs and collected by a receiver, the position of the receiver\ncan be estimated based on power measurements by utilizing the known parameters\nof the LEDs and IRSs. Since the orientation vectors of IRS elements (mirrors)\ncannot be adjusted perfectly in practice, it is important to evaluate the\neffects of mismatches between desired and true orientations of IRS elements. In\nthis study, we derive the misspecified Cramer-Rao lower bound (MCRB) and the\nmismatched maximum likelihood (MML) estimator for specifying the estimation\nperformance and the lower bound in the presence of mismatches in IRS\norientations. We also provide comparisons with the conventional maximum\nlikelihood (ML) estimator and the CRB in absence of orientation mismatches for\nquantifying the effects of mismatches. It is shown that orientation mismatches\ncan result in significant degradation in localization accuracy at high\nsignal-to-noise ratios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
