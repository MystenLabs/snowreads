Therefore, this study explores X.509\nsecurity certificates based on Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and discusses\nimplemented solutions. This study compares mainstream asymmetric cryptographic\nmethods (including RSA and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA))\nwith standard PQC methods (including Falcon, Dilithium, SPHINCS+), comparing\nthe efficiency of certificate generation, signature generation, and signature\nverification. Finally, recommendations for a solution based on PQC for X.509\nsecurity certificates are proposed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
