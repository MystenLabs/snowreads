From the simulated\nexcited states, 'Bright', 'Spike', and 'Dark' defect configurations are\nclassified based on their absorption spectrum features. Furthermore, machine\nlearning molecular dynamics simulation provides insight into the possible\ndiffusion mechanism of Ci and NV, showing that Ci can diffuse away or recombine\nwith NV. The study yields new insight into the formation of NV defects in\ndiamond for quantum technology applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
