They can be engineered to stop wave\npropagation in specific frequency bands. Once manufactured, their dispersive\nqualities remain invariant in time and space, limiting their practical use.\nActively tuned arrangements have received growing interest to address this\nissue. Here, we introduce a new class of active metamaterial made from\ndual-state unit cells, either vibration sources when powered or passive\nresonators when left disconnected. They possess self-tuning capabilities,\nenabling deep subwavelength band gaps to automatically match the carrier signal\nof powered cells, typically around 200Hz. Swift electronic commutations between\nboth states establish the basis for real-time reconfiguration of waveguides and\nshaping of vibration patterns. A series of experiments highlight how these\ntailored acceleration fields can spatially encode information relevant to human\ntouch. This novel metamaterial can readily be made using off-the-shelf\nsmartphone vibration motors, paving the way for a widespread adoption of\nmulti-touch tactile displays.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OmBIiyUs_ZVB0ex_-iprWQIxtPHa2-ZbfQ5xyVElo1Q","pdfSize":"4933625"}
