Recently, the incorporation of generative artificial intelligence\n(AI) methods has provided new possibilities for improving privacy, augmenting\ndata, and customizing models. This research explores potential integrations of\ngenerative AI in federated learning, revealing various opportunities to enhance\nprivacy, data efficiency, and model performance. It particularly emphasizes the\nimportance of generative models like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and\nvariational autoencoders (VAEs) in creating synthetic data that replicates the\ndistribution of real data. Generating synthetic data helps federated learning\naddress challenges related to limited data availability and supports robust\nmodel development. Additionally, we examine various applications of generative\nAI in federated learning that enable more personalized solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
