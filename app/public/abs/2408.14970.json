Our analysis reveals the\nexistence of effective decoherence-free qudit subspaces, persisting for\ntimescales exponential in $\\beta$. Surprisingly, the appearance of metastable\nsubspaces is not directly related to the entanglement structure of the ground\nstate(s). Rather, they arise from symmetry relations in low-lying excited\nstates. Despite their stability within a 'phase', practical realization of\nstable qubits is hindered by susceptibility to symmetry-breaking perturbations.\nThis work highlights that there can be non-trivial quantum behavior in the\nthermal dynamics of noncommuting many body models, and opens the door to more\nextensive studies of self-correction in such systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q6bBZmb83TE-r8hOZDCCqsz5_ZgyHrgLBzxGKQ0Bd4o","pdfSize":"1061481"}
