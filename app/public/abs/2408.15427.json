The strategy of our proof combines a space-time\nresonances approach based on the distorted Fourier transform to capture\nmodified scattering effects with modulation techniques to take into account the\nsymmetries of the problem, namely the invariance under scaling and phase\nshifts. A major challenge is the slow local decay of the radiation term caused\nby the threshold resonances of the non-selfadjoint linearized matrix\nSchr\\\"odinger operator around the solitary waves. Our analysis hinges on two\nremarkable null structures that we uncover in the quadratic nonlinearities of\nthe evolution equation for the radiation term as well as of the modulation\nequations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
