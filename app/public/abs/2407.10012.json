Small errors that occur in the initial condition can grow\nexponentially until they saturate at $\\mathcal{O}$(1). Ensemble forecasting\naverages multiple runs with slightly different initial conditions and other\ndata to produce more accurate results and extend the predictability horizon.\nHowever, they can be computationally expensive. We develop a penalty-based\nensemble method with a shared coefficient matrix to reduce required memory and\ncomputational cost and thereby allow larger ensemble sizes. Penalty methods\nrelax the incompressibility condition to decouple the pressure and velocity,\nreducing memory requirements. This report gives stability proof and an error\nestimate of the penalty-based ensemble method, extends it to the Navier-Stokes\nequations with random variables using Monte Carlo sampling, and validates the\nmethod's accuracy and efficiency with three numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
