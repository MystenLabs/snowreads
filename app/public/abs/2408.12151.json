In particular, for the current $\\omega \\approx 2.371$\n[Alman, Duan, Williams, Xu, Xu, Zhou 2024], our running times boil down to\n$O(d^{2.53})$. This running time is due to the analysis of the lazy update\nbehavior in iterative maintenance problems, such as [Deng, Song, Weinstein\n2022, Brand, Song, Zhou ICML 2024].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
