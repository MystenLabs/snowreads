Under\ngeneric conditions on coupling and nodal dynamics, we prove that the network\nadmits a rigorous mean-field limit, resembling a Wilson-Cowan neural field\nequation. The state variables of the limiting systems are the mean and variance\nof neuronal activity. We select networks whose mean-field equations are\ntractable and we perform a bifurcation analysis using as control parameter the\ndiffusivity strength of the afferent white noise on each neuron. We find\nconditions for Turing-like bifurcations in a system where the cortex is\nmodelled as a ring, and we produce numerical evidence of noise-induced spiral\nwaves in models with a two-dimensional cortex. We provide numerical evidence\nthat solutions of the finite-size network converge weakly to solutions of the\nmean-field model. Finally, we prove a Large Deviation Principle, which provides\na means of assessing the likelihood of deviations from the mean-field equations\ninduced by finite-size effects.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TX-sgH4Vh1nW8p_bCSvO6uLQ33qKyTDgOo5ki4aMnQA","pdfSize":"3271049"}
