Effective inventory management is crucial in today's volatile,\nuncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) world. Previous research has\ndemonstrated the superiority of heuristic methods and reinforcement learning\napplications in inventory management. However, the application of large\nlanguage models (LLMs) as autonomous agents in multi-agent systems for\ninventory management remains underexplored. This study introduces a novel\napproach using LLMs to manage multi-agent inventory systems. Leveraging their\nzero-shot learning capabilities, our model, InvAgent, enhances resilience and\nimproves efficiency across the supply chain network. Our contributions include\nutilizing LLMs for zero-shot learning to enable adaptive and informed\ndecision-making without prior training, providing significant explainability\nand clarity through Chain-of-Thought (CoT), and demonstrating dynamic\nadaptability to varying demand scenarios while minimizing costs and avoiding\nstockouts. Extensive evaluations across different scenarios highlight the\nefficiency of our model in SCM.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
