We propose three types of minimum predictive models with\ndifferent assignments of modular weight, satisfying the neutrino oscillation\ndata in Nufit 5.2. The cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino mass is\nstringent to our models and CMB bound $\\sum D_\\nu\\le0.12$ eV can be satisfied\nby one of three models playing an important role in discriminating them.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"IkgD9bx-EXbUnOL9DCSeUkfT8uYTPWabyE2N2Nb3Wsw","pdfSize":"938545"}
