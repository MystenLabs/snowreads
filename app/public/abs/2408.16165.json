To improve the accuracy of\nmeasuring the temperature of cold objects, we used a shutter with a combined\nemissivity as an internal reference source of radiation at the input of the\ndevice optical unit. With this aim a small mirror was fixed in the center on\nits surface covered black, thereby ensuring an efficient reflection of\nradiation in a wide spectral range of wavelengths. When processing the signal\nfor each pixel of the thermal image, the differential value of the detector\nresponse to the shutter blackened and mirror areas was used as a reference. A\nrelative measurement error of 3 percent was obtained for the studied objects\nwith a temperature of -150 {\\deg}C. The device was successfully used for remote\nstudy of thermal field dynamics during freeze-thawing of biological tissues in\nvivo.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
