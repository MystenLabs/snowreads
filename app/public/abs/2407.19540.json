Firstly,\nwe modify NECHO, designed in a diagnosis code-centric fashion, to handle\nuncertain modality representation dominance under the imperfect data. Secondly,\nwe develop a systematic knowledge distillation by employing the modified NECHO\nas both teacher and student. It encompasses a modality-wise contrastive and\nhierarchical distillation, transformer representation random distillation,\nalong with other distillations to align representations between teacher and\nstudent tightly and effectively. We also utilise random erasing on individual\ndata points within sequences during both training and distillation of the\nteacher to lightly simulate scenario with missing visit information, thereby\nfostering effective knowledge transfer. As a result, NECHO v2 verifies itself\nby showing robust superiority in multimodal sequential diagnosis prediction\nunder both balanced and imbalanced incomplete settings on multimodal healthcare\ndata.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
