Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI) is one of the most effective ways to detect brain\ntumors. Accurate detection of brain tumors based on MRI scans is critical, as\nit can potentially save many lives and facilitate better decision-making at the\nearly stages of the disease. Within our paper, four different types of\nMRI-based images have been collected from the database: glioma tumor, no tumor,\npituitary tumor, and meningioma tumor. Our study focuses on making predictions\nfor brain tumor classification. Five models, including four pre-trained models\n(MobileNet, EfficientNet-B0, ResNet-18, and VGG16) and one new model,\nMobileNet-BT, have been proposed for this study.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
