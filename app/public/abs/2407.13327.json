Both are obtained from the K\\\"ahler\npotential of the underlying geometry of the sphere corresponding to the\nFubini-Study metric. Entropy is shown to be equal to the K\\\"ahler potential\nwritten in terms of dual symplectic variables as the Guillemin potential for\ntoric manifolds. The logarithm of complexity relating two states is shown to be\nequal to Calabi's diastasis function. Optimality of the Fubini-Study metric is\nindicated by considering its deformation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
