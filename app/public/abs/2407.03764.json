Central to trustworthy operation is the ability for the rover to\nrecognise and diagnose abnormal behaviours during its operation. Failure to\ndiagnose faulty behaviour could lead to degraded performance or an unplanned\nhalt in operation. This work investigates a health monitoring method that can\nbe used to improve the capabilities of a fault detection system for a planetary\nexploration rover. A suite of four metrics, named 'rover vitals', are evaluated\nas indicators of degradation in the rover's performance. These vitals are\ncombined to give an overall estimate of the rover's 'health'. By comparing the\nbehaviour of a faulty real system with a non-faulty observer, residuals are\ngenerated in terms of two high-level metrics: heading and velocity. Adaptive\nthresholds are applied to the residuals to enable the detection of faulty\nbehaviour, where the adaptive thresholds are informed by the rover's perceived\nhealth. Simulation experiments carried out in MATLAB showed that the proposed\nhealth monitoring and fault detection methodology can detect high-risk faults\nin both the sensors and actuators of the rover.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
