Metaphors\nplay an essential part in visual communication and are frequently employed to\nexplain complex concepts. However, their use is often based on intuition,\nrather than following a formal process. At present, we lack tools and language\nfor understanding and describing metaphor use in visualization to the extent\nwhere taxonomy and grammar could guide the creation of visual components, e.g.,\ninfographics. Our classification of the visual conceptual mappings within\nscientific representations is based on the breakdown of visual components in\nexisting scientific infographics. We demonstrate the development of this\nmapping through a detailed analysis of data collected from four domains\n(biomedicine, climate, space, and anthropology) that represent a diverse range\nof visual conceptual metaphors used in the visual communication of science.\nThis work allows us to identify patterns of visual conceptual metaphor use\nwithin the domains, resolve ambiguities about why specific conceptual metaphors\nare used, and develop a better overall understanding of visual metaphor use in\nscientific infographics. Our analysis shows that ontological and orientational\nconceptual metaphors are the most widely applied to translate complex\nscientific concepts. To support our findings we developed a visual exploratory\ntool based on the collected database that places the individual infographics on\na spatio-temporal scale and illustrates the breakdown of visual conceptual\nmetaphors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-Tloyy6SM5NSyRieqwl2uHcFydZdQFmYFpYUZUo7jdM","pdfSize":"4883745"}
