We develop the\nformalism of the effective Poisson equation to include the novel\nphenomenological model of the scalar-tensor tidal interactions that are\nexpected to be induced by the modification of the theory of gravity. We show\nthat the tensor clustering fossils can arise from the propagation of\ngravitational waves, the growth of the large-scale structures, and the\nsecond-order contributions from the effective Poisson equation. We construct\nthe small-scale effective Lagrangian from the Horndeski scalar-tensor theory\nand derive the formula applicable to the tensor clustering fossils in the\nlanguage of the effective field theory of dark energy. As a demonstration, we\napply the formalism to the constraint on the sound speed of gravitational waves\nin the futuristic survey.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"02VqevW5PABihesMn9q2HB6gR3FIV5dHRKOmVqMvf_g","pdfSize":"716271","objectId":"0xd055a190dede94df57e017a75933437e158421a88c88912878306765fcd7efe5","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
