Our results are based on a novel method for\ncontrolling $\\chi^2$ divergences between exchangeable mixtures, which is\ntighter than the existing methods of moments or cumulants. At a technical\nlevel, a key innovation in our proofs is a new Maclaurin-type inequality for\nelementary symmetric polynomials of variables that sum to zero and an upper\nbound on permanents of doubly-stochastic positive semidefinite matrices. Our\nresults imply a de Finetti-style theorem (in the language of Diaconis and\nFreedman, 1987) and general asymptotic results for compound decision problems,\ngeneralizing and strengthening a result of Hannan and Robbins (1955).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
