The partial widths of the processes\n$Y(4626)\\to J/\\psi\\eta$, $J/\\psi\\eta^{\\prime}$, $\\eta_{c}\\phi$, and $\n\\chi_{cJ}\\phi,\\ (J=\\{0,1,2\\})$ are estimated by employing the effective\nLagrangian approach. The present estimations indicate that the partial widths\nof the $J/\\psi\\eta$ and $J/\\psi \\eta^\\prime$ channels are of the order of 1\nMeV, while the one of $\\chi_{c1}\\phi$ is of the order of 0.1 MeV. Thus, we\npropose to further examine the molecular interpretation of $Y(4626)$ by\nsearching it in the cross sections for the $e^{+}e^{-}\\to\nJ/\\psi\\eta^{(\\prime)}$ processes, which should be accessible by the BES III and\nBelle II.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
