This paper explores\nthe development of a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) system for\nUncrewed Surface Vessels (USVs) in wavy conditions to minimize average roll.\nThe NMPC is based on a prediction method that uses information about the\nvessel's dynamics and an assumed wave model. This method is able to mitigate\nthe roll of an under-actuated USV in a variety of conditions by adjusting the\nweights of the cost function. The results show a reduction of 39% of average\nroll with a tuned controller in conditions with 1.75-metre sinusoidal waves. A\ngeneral and intuitive tuning strategy is established. This preliminary work is\na proof of concept which sets the stage for the leveraging of wave prediction\nmethodologies to perform planning and control in real time for USVs in\nreal-world scenarios and field trials.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
