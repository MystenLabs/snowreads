In this paper, we introduce Arabic KNN-NER, our submission to the\nWojood NER Shared Task 2024 (ArabicNLP 2024). We have participated in the\nshared sub-task 1 Flat NER. In this shared sub-task, we tackle fine-grained\nflat-entity recognition for Arabic text, where we identify a single main entity\nand possibly zero or multiple sub-entities for each word. Arabic KNN-NER\naugments the probability distribution of a fine-tuned model with another label\nprobability distribution derived from performing a KNN search over the cached\ntraining data. Our submission achieved 91% on the test set on the WojoodFine\ndataset, placing Arabic KNN-NER on top of the leaderboard for the shared task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
