We prove in this note that, for a class of Banach algebras including\nthe standard algebras in harmonic analysis, Garth's conditions force the\nalgebra to be even reflexive. We also give examples of Banach algebras with\nGarth's conditions, that are not Arens regular.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
