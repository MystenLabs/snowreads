The AOT algorithm is one of the most widely used methods in CDA due\nto its efficiency in incorporating observational data to enhance model\naccuracy. However, no research to date has evaluated the performance of the AOT\nalgorithm compared to the most widely used DA method, the ensemble Kalman\nfilter (EnKF). Hence, in this paper, we conduct an extensive numerical\nexamination to evaluate and compare these two algorithms for CDA problems with\nmeasurement error, addressing this gap. By analyzing the one-dimensional\nKuramoto-Sivashinsky equation and the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation,\nwhich are central to many applications and representative in CDA problems, we\nfound a significant computational advantage of the AOT algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
