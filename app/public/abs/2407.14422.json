To this end, we prove a new\nconcentration lemma about degrees and Laplacian eigenvalues. This lemma allows\nus to improve several bounds and to dispense from assuming that the graphon is\nbounded away from zero in several results. This extension leads, in particular,\nto correct the proof of Proposition 4. Additionally, we extend Proposition 4 to\ngraphs that are sampled from graphons by using deterministic latent variables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
