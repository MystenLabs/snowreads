However,\ntraditional data sets are based on fixed labels, resulting in models that often\nfocus on main emotions and ignore detailed emotional changes in complex scenes.\nThis report introduces the solution of using MLLMs technology to generate\nopen-vocabulary emotion labels from a video. The solution includes the use of\nframework, data generation and processing, training methods, results generation\nand multi-model co-judgment. In the MER-OV (Open-Word Emotion Recognition) of\nthe MER2024 challenge, our method achieved significant advantages, leading to\nits superior capabilities in complex emotion computation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
