The\nargument reinforces the principle of permanence, articulated in the early 19th\ncentury by Peacock, then adjusted by Hankel and adopted by many others.\nTypically regarded as a principle of theoretical rationality, permanence was\nunderstood by Peano, following Mach, and against Schubert, as a principle of\npractical rationality. The paper considers how permanence, thus understood, was\nused in justifying Burali-Forti and Marcolongo's notation for vectorial\ncalculus, and in rejecting Frege's logical notation, and closes by considering\nHahn's revival of Peano's argument against Pringsheim' reading of permanence as\na logically necessary principle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
