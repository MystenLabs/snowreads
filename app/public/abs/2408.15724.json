If the space is harmonic, the Green functions\ncontinue to depend on a single variable -- the geodesic distance. But now this\ndependence can be somewhat non-trivial. We demonstrate that, like in the flat\ncase, the coordinate differential equations for powers of Green functions can\nstill be expressed as determinants of certain operators. Therefore,\nnot-surprisingly, the coordinate equations remain straightforward -- while\ntheir reformulation in terms of momentum integrals and Picard-Fuchs equations\ncan seem problematic. However we show that the Feynman parameter representation\ncan also be generalized, at least for banana diagrams in simple harmonic\nspaces, so that the Picard-Fuchs equations retain their Euclidean form with\njust a minor modification. A separate story is the transfer to the case when\nthe Green function essentially depends on several rather than a single\nargument. In this case, we provide just one example, that the equations are\nstill there, but conceptual issues in the more general case will be discussed\nelsewhere.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
