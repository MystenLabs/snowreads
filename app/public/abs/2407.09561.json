The importance of atrial scarring in the development and progression\nof AFib has gained recognition, positioning late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic\nresonance imaging (LGE-MRI) as a crucial technique for the non-invasive\nevaluation of atrial scar tissue. This review delves into the recent progress\nin segmenting atrial scars using LGE-MRIs, emphasizing the importance of\nprecise scar measurement in the treatment and management of AFib. Initially, it\nprovides a detailed examination of AFib. Subsequently, it explores the\napplication of deep learning in this domain. The review culminates in a\ndiscussion of the latest research advancements in atrial scar segmentation\nusing deep learning methods. By offering a thorough analysis of current\ntechnologies and their impact on AFib management strategies, this review\nhighlights the integral role of deep learning in enhancing atrial scar\nsegmentation and its implications for future therapeutic approaches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
