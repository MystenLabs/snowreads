This model incorporates bulk\nviscosity and is analyzed using an effective equation of state. We consider the\nsimplest specific model, $f(R,T)=R+\\lambda T$, where $\\lambda$ is a constant.\nThe exact solution of our viscous $f(R,T)$ cosmological model is derived, and\nthen we use the combined datasets consisting of 31 $H(z)$ data points and 1701\nPantheon+ SNe data points to determine the best-fit values of the model\nparameters. We find good agreement with observations, particularly at higher\nredshifts. Our model's behavior, including energy density, pressure with\nviscosity, effective equation of state, and deceleration parameter, is\nanalyzed. It indicates a shift from decelerated to accelerated phases of the\nuniverse's expansion, suggesting that bulk viscosity in the cosmic fluid could\neffectively generate the negative pressure necessary for cosmic expansion.\nFinally, we explore statefinder diagnostics to differentiate between various\ndark energy models, revealing that our model resides in the quintessence\nregion.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
