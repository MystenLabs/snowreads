Two-body loss\nrates from light-assisted collisions (LACs) are measured across the $^{87}$Rb\nhyperfine spectrum and connected to properties of molecular photoassociation\npotentials via a semi-classical model. To obtain our results, we introduce an\nimaging technique that leverages repulsive LACs to detect two atoms in a trap,\nthereby circumventing parity constraints in tweezers. Our findings offer key\ninsights for exploiting hyperfine structure in laser-induced collisions to\ncontrol cold atoms and molecules in a broad range of quantum science\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KkW22bfYIWbqoXOidYH6O8uJiV0mPAlMpXQ3Y9z6hQI","pdfSize":"13528382"}
