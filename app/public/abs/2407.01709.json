This follows from the corresponding statement for\nautomorphism groups of Bruhat--Tits buildings, which hinges on the solution to\nthe flatmate conjecture raised in earlier work with Bucher. Vanishing and\ninvariance theorems for arithmetic groups are derived.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
