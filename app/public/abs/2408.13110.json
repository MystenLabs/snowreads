More\nprecisely, we complement the flexibility result for approximate solutions of\nthe associated differential inclusion which was deduced in \\cite{BFJK94} by a\nrigidity result on the level of exact solutions and by a quantitative rigidity\nestimate and scaling result. The $T_3$-structure for the symmetrized gradient\nfrom \\cite{BFJK94} can hence be regarded as a symmetrized gradient analogue of\nthe Tartar square for the gradient. As such a structure cannot exist in\n$\\mathbb{R}^{2\\times 2}_{sym}$ the example from \\cite{BFJK94} is in this sense\nminimal. We complement our theoretical findings with numerical simulations of\nthe resulting microstructure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
