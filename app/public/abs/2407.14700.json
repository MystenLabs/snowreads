Our work upgrades the\nComposer's Assistant system (which performs multi-track infilling of symbolic\nmusic at the track-measure level) with a wide range of new controls to give\nusers fine-grained control over the system's outputs. Controls introduced in\nthis work include two types of rhythmic conditioning controls, horizontal and\nvertical note onset density controls, several types of pitch controls, and a\nrhythmic interest control. We train a T5-like transformer model to implement\nthese controls and to serve as the backbone of our system. With these controls,\nwe achieve a dramatic improvement in objective metrics over the original\nsystem. We also study how well our model understands the meaning of our\ncontrols, and we conduct a listening study that does not find a significant\ndifference between real music and music composed in a co-creative fashion with\nour system. We release our complete system, consisting of source code,\npretrained models, and REAPER scripts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
