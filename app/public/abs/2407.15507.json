Various techniques, such as MultiDiffusion and\nSyncDiffusion, have further pushed image generation beyond training\nresolutions, i.e., from square images to panorama, by merging multiple\noverlapping diffusion paths or employing gradient descent to maintain\nperceptual coherence. However, these methods suffer from significant\ncomputational inefficiencies due to generating and averaging numerous\npredictions, which is required in practice to produce high-quality and seamless\nimages. This work addresses this limitation and presents a novel approach that\neliminates the need to generate and average numerous overlapping denoising\npredictions. Our method shifts non-overlapping denoising windows over time,\nensuring that seams in one timestep are corrected in the next. This results in\ncoherent, high-resolution images with fewer overall steps. We demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach through qualitative and quantitative evaluations,\ncomparing it with MultiDiffusion, SyncDiffusion, and StitchDiffusion. Our\nmethod offers several key benefits, including improved computational efficiency\nand faster inference times while producing comparable or better image quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
