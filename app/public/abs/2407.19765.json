Typical stochastic mobility models, e.g.,\nrandom waypoint model and Gauss Markov model, can hardly capture the\ndistribution characteristics of users within real-world areas. State-of-the-art\ntrace-based mobility models and existing learning-based trajectory generation\nmethods, however, are frequently constrained by the inaccessibility of\nsubstantial real trajectories due to privacy concerns. In this paper, we\nharness the intrinsic correlation between street maps and trajectories and\ndevelop a novel zero-shot trajectory generation method, named Map2Traj, by\nexploiting the diffusion model. We incorporate street maps as a condition to\nconsistently pilot the denoising process and train our model on diverse sets of\nreal trajectories from various regions in Xi'an, China, and their corresponding\nstreet maps. With solely the street map of an unobserved area, Map2Traj\ngenerates synthetic trajectories that not only closely resemble the real-world\nmobility pattern but also offer comparable efficacy. Extensive experiments\nvalidate the efficacy of our proposed method on zero-shot trajectory generation\ntasks in terms of both trajectory and distribution similarities. In addition, a\ncase study of employing Map2Traj in wireless network optimization is presented\nto validate its efficacy for downstream applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
