However, an issue of\nconcern has been always the fact that, as was shown in many publications, the\noptimal schedule in Mirrlees' paradigm of maximising the total utility\n(constructed from individually optimised individual ones) usually did not lead\nto progressive taxation (contradicting the ethically supported practice in\ndeveloped economies), and often even assigned minimal tax rates to the higher\npaid strata of society. The first objective of this paper is to support this\nconclusion by proving a theorem on optimal tax schedule in (practically most\nexploited) piecewise-linear environment under a simplest natural utility\nfunction. The second objective is to suggest a new paradigm for optimal\ntaxation, where instead of just total average utility maximization one\nintroduces a standard deviation of utility as a second parameter (in some\nanalogy with Marcowitz portfolio optimization). We show that this approach\nleads to transparent and easy interpreted optimality criteria for income tax.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Economics","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
