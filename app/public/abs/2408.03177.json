These restrictions endow\nsystem matrices with special structure. The purpose of this paper is to study\nsuch structure by investigating zeros and poses of linear quantum systems. In\nparticular, we show that $-s_0^\\ast$ is a transmission zero if and only if\n$s_0$ is a pole, and which is further generalized to the relationship between\nsystem eigenvalues and invariant zeros. Additionally, we study\nleft-invertibility and fundamental tradeoff for linear quantum systems in terms\nof their zeros and poles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M3hM87ryiop1SF4XBWSEenBuudFrGZpzFrziXuj3wVo","pdfSize":"174191"}
