However, it is still unclear the circumstances that drive developers\nto choose one or another. In this paper, we survey authors of both types of\ndebts using a large-scale dataset containing 74K SATD-C and 20K SATD-I\ninstances, extracted from 190 GitHub projects. As a result, we provide 13\nguidelines to support developers to decide when to use comments or issues to\nreport Technical Debt.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
