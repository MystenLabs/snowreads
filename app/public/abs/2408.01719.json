In about 90\\%, these are $\\alpha$\nparticles, which often referred to as the long-range alpha (LRA). Such decay\nhas been extensively studied over decades in various heavy fissioning systems.\nThe probability of such a process has been found to be about (2-4)$\\times\n10^{-3}$ relative to binary fission. The experimental data showed an increasing\ntrend in the probability of such a process with an increase in fissility\nparameter within the range of 35 - 39. In the last decades, a region of the\nheaviest nuclei has been substantially expanded in both proton and neutron\nnumbers. This includes neutron-deficient heavy and superheavy nuclei with\nfissility parameters, which are significantly exceeding the aforementioned\nrange. In the present work, the currently available experimental data on the\nprobability of the LRA emission, which is a representative of ternary fission,\nare discussed. The probabilities of LRA emission were calculated within the\nvarious empirical approaches, including the presently suggested semi-empirical\nexpression. The latter one was derived on the basis of the $\\alpha$-decay\nproperty of the fissioning nucleus. The results of all approaches discussed\nshow that the probabilities of LRA emission are substantial (up to a\npercentage) in the fission of neutron-deficient heavy and superheavy nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
