The extent to which students in the region\nacquire computational thinking skills remains largely unknown. To start\naddressing this void, this article presents findings from a cross-sectional\nstudy that characterizes the computational thinking abilities of incoming\nstudents at a Chilean university with a strong emphasis on STEM disciplines.\nBased on more than 500 responses, this study provides evidence of significant\ninequalities in computational thinking across gender, type of school (private\nor no), and prior programming knowledge. The discussion offers insights into\nhow these disparities relate to contextual factors of the country, such as a\nhighly socio-economically segregated educational system, public policies\nfocused mainly on technology access, and heavy reliance on voluntary\ninitiatives, to develop computational thinking. The findings can enlighten\nupcoming research endeavors and formulate strategies to create a more equitable\nfield for students entering STEM degrees in nations facing similar\ncircumstances.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
