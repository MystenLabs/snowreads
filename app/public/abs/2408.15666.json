Current methods\nusing large language models (LLMs) lack interpretability and controllability,\noften ignoring author-specific stylistic features, resulting in less robust\nperformance overall.\n  To address this, we develop StyleRemix, an adaptive and interpretable\nobfuscation method that perturbs specific, fine-grained style elements of the\noriginal input text. StyleRemix uses pre-trained Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\nmodules to rewrite an input specifically along various stylistic axes (e.g.,\nformality and length) while maintaining low computational cost. StyleRemix\noutperforms state-of-the-art baselines and much larger LLMs in a variety of\ndomains as assessed by both automatic and human evaluation.\n  Additionally, we release AuthorMix, a large set of 30K high-quality,\nlong-form texts from a diverse set of 14 authors and 4 domains, and DiSC, a\nparallel corpus of 1,500 texts spanning seven style axes in 16 unique\ndirections\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
