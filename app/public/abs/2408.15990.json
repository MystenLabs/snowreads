However, existing pricing strategies cannot\nguarantee that the closed-loop system converges to the optimal state, in which\nthe HOT lanes' capacity is fully utilized but there is no queue on the HOT\nlanes, and a well-behaved estimation and control method is quite challenging\nand still elusive. This paper attempts to fill the gap by making three\nfundamental contributions: (i) to present a simpler formulation of the point\nqueue model based on the new concept of residual capacity, (ii) to propose a\nsimple feedback control theoretic approach to estimate the average value of\ntime and calculate the dynamic price, and (iii) to analytically and numerically\nprove that the closed-loop system is stable and guaranteed to converge to the\noptimal state, in either Gaussian or exponential manners.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
