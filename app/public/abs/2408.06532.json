In dilute gas\nBose-Einstein condensates, the Jones- Roberts soliton family includes vortex\ndipoles and rarefaction pulses in the low and high velocity regimes,\nrespectively. These excitations carry both energy and linear momentum, making\ntheir decay characteristics crucial for understanding superfluid dynamics. In\nthis work, we develop the theory of planar soliton decay due to thermal\neffects, as described by the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii theory of\nreservoir interactions. We analyze two distinct damping terms involving\ntransfer between the condensate and the non-condensate reservoir: particle\ntransfer that also involves energy and usually drives condensate growth, and\nnumber-conserving energy transfer. We provide analytical treatments for both\nthe low and high velocity regimes and identify conditions under which either\nmechanism dominates. Our findings indicate that energy damping prevails at high\nphase space density. These theoretical results are supported by numerical\nstudies covering the entire velocity range from vortex dipole to rarefaction\npulse. We use interaction energy to characterize rarefaction pulses, analogous\nto the distance between vortices in vortex dipoles, offering an experimentally\naccessible test for finite temperature theory in Bose-Einstein condensates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
