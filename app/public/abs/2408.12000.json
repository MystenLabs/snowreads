In this model, the fluid evolves in a\npiecewise smooth or convex geometry $\\mathcal{O}$. On a portion of the\nboundary, a fourth order plate equation is coupled with the fluid through\npressure and matching velocities. The key to obtaining the conclusion of Gevrey\nregularity is an appropriate estimation of the resolvent of the associated\n$C_0$-semigroup operator. Moreover, a numerical scheme and example is provided\nwhich empirically demonstrates smoothing of the fluid-structure semigroup.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ldgzogD46tvkdTKyHooEQme1a25Zgq0ZXTViy9RvE6w","pdfSize":"831627"}
