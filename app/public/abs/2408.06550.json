To facilitate VR accessibility for blind users, in\nthis paper, we investigate the effectiveness of two types of haptic\ncues--vibrotactile and skin-stretch cues--in conveying the spatial information\nof a virtual object when applied to the dorsal side of a blind user's hand. We\nconducted a user study with 10 blind users to investigate how they perceive\nstatic and moving objects in VR with a custom-made haptic apparatus. Our\nresults reveal that blind users can more accurately understand an object's\nlocation and movement when receiving skin-stretch cues, as opposed to\nvibrotactile cues. We discuss the pros and cons of both types of haptic cues\nand conclude with design recommendations for future haptic solutions for VR\naccessibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
