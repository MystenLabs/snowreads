Instead, we leverage the\nfact that entangling gates not only manipulate quantum states but can also be\nexploited to transport quantum information. We demonstrate the effectiveness of\nthis method by applying it to the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and the\nQuantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) with $n$ qubits. This\nimproves upon all state-of-the-art implementations of the QFT on a linear\nnearest-neighbor architecture, resulting in a total circuit depth of ${5n-3}$\nand requiring ${n^2-1}$ CNOT gates. For the QAOA, our method outperforms SWAP\nnetworks, which are currently the most efficient implementation of the QAOA on\na linear architecture. We further demonstrate the potential to balance qubit\ncount against circuit depth by implementing the QAOA on twice the number of\nqubits using bi-linear connectivity, which approximately halves the circuit\ndepth.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6L75LyoYzfc_bwXTmVPtoPmufOGBfGd_4vp5p5sYKUg","pdfSize":"1255445"}
