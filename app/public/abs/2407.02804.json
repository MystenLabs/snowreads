First, an MEG-DT architecture is put\nforward to decentralize generative artificial intelligence (GAI) models onto\nedge servers (ESs) and user equipments (UEs), which has the advantages of low\nlatency, privacy preservation, and individual-level customization. Then,\nvarious single-user and multi-user generation mechanisms are conceived for\nMEG-DT, which strike trade-offs between generation latency, hardware costs, and\ndevice coordination. Furthermore, to perform efficient distributed generation,\ntwo operating protocols are explored for transmitting interpretable and latent\nfeatures between ESs and UEs, namely sketch-based generation and seed-based\ngeneration, respectively. Based on the proposed protocols, the convergence\nbetween MEG and DT are highlighted. Considering the seed-based image generation\nscenario, numerical case studies are provided to reveal the superiority of\nMEG-DT over centralized generation. Finally, promising applications and\nresearch opportunities are identified.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
