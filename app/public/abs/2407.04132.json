Random networks are modifications of\nthe Chalker-Coddington (CC) model for the integer quantum Hall transition that\nmore faithfully capture the physics of electrons moving in a strong magnetic\nfield and a smooth disorder potential. The new method has considerable\nadvantages compared to the transfer matrix approach, and gives the value $\\nu\n\\approx 2.4$ for the critical exponent of the localization length in a random\nnetwork. This finding confirms our previous result and is surprisingly close to\nthe experimental value $\\nu_{\\text{exp}} \\approx 2.38$ observed at the integer\nquantum Hall transition but substantially different from the CC value\n$\\nu_\\text{CC} \\approx 2.6$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
