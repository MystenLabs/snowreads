Analytical formulas on the conditions for the merging of two\nDMs and on the DMs with zero value of the reflection coefficient were obtained.\nDifferent typical 1D PC structures with two DLs were considered and compared,\nincluding their DMs behavior. The distribution of electromagnetic field within\nthe first photonic bandgap (PBG) was analyzed for several cases of DM merging\nand for the different orders of DMs. The results of this research permit the\nsimplification of the analysis of optical sensors and filters based on 1D PCs\nwith two DLs, as well as a more comprehensive understanding of the DM behavior\nwithin the PBGs of such PC structures. Furthermore, this paper helps to explain\nthe results obtained by other researchers earlier in this field, too.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-XuLa1-yogiQUvPYJ_5qiudc-q6f4jQi4d4wipz1a1I","pdfSize":"1668032"}
