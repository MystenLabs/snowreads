While weakly-supervised multiple instance\nlearning (MIL) has emerged as a promising approach, current MIL methods are\nconstrained by their limited ability to leverage the wealth of information\nembedded within unlabeled WSIs. This limitation often necessitates training MIL\nfeature aggregators from scratch after the feature extraction process,\nhindering efficiency and accuracy. PreMix extends the general MIL framework by\npre-training the MIL aggregator with an intra-batch slide mixing approach.\nSpecifically, PreMix incorporates Barlow Twins Slide Mixing during\npre-training, enhancing its ability to handle diverse WSI sizes and maximizing\nthe utility of unlabeled WSIs. Combined with Mixup and Manifold Mixup during\nfine-tuning, PreMix achieves a mean of 4.7% performance improvement over the\nbaseline MIL framework, the hierarchical image pyramid transformer (HIPT), on\nthe Camelyon16 dataset. The observed improvement across a range of active\nlearning acquisition functions and WSI-labeled training budgets highlights the\nframework's adaptability to diverse datasets and varying resource constraints.\nUltimately, PreMix paves the way for more efficient and accurate WSI\nclassification under limited WSI-labeled datasets, encouraging the broader\nadoption of unlabeled WSI data in histopathological research.
