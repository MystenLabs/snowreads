Our study focuses on identifying the\nregions within this parameter space that produce a thermal relic abundance of\n$\\widetilde\\chi_1^0$ smaller than the observed cold dark matter relic density\nwhile remaining consistent with constraints from LEP measurements, low-energy\nexperiments, Higgs measurements, LHC data, and dark matter direct detection\nexperiments. We identify the dominant annihilation modes of the LSP neutralino\nacross varying LSP mass ranges $\\sim \\mathcal{O}(1)-\\mathcal{O}(10^{3})~$GeV.\nFurthermore, we conduct a benchmark study to assess the production rates of\ntriple-boson final states emerging from direct electroweakino pair production\nat the LHC. Drawing insights from these findings, we perform a detailed\ncollider analysis to explore the future potential of probing the triple-boson\nfinal states involving a light Higgs boson at the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
