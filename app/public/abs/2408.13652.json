The system\nincludes hardware modules that generate synchronized experiment signals of\ndifferent kinds, and a protocol to communicate with all the modules. We also\nimplemented software that can automatically generate experiment sequences from\ndeclarative tables of parameters with variations. Both the hardware and the\nsoftware are open-source for adaptation and customization in other experiment\nplatforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
