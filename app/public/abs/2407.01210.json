In this work, we investigate the $ h \\rightarrow Z \\gamma $ decay\nwithin the minimal supersymmetric standard model (MSSM) and its nonholomorphic\nextension, the NHSSM. Calculations are performed using the FeynArts/FormCalc\nsetup, utilizing the pre-existing model file for MSSM and generating the NHSSM\nmodel file with the support of {\\tt SARAH}. In the allowed parameter space,\nMSSM contributions to $h \\rightarrow Z \\gamma$ can significantly surpass SM\npredictions reaching to the value $\\Gamma(h \\rightarrow Z \\gamma)= 9.77 \\times\n10^{-6} \\text{GeV}$, thereby bringing $ \\Gamma (h \\rightarrow Z \\gamma) $\ncloser to the experimental value. The SM predicted value deviates from the\nexperimental value by $1.7 \\sigma$. However, the MSSM contributions can reduce\nthis deviation to less than $1 \\sigma$. In contrast, NHSSM contributions remain\nnegligible and do not produce sizable corrections to the $ h \\rightarrow Z\n\\gamma $ decay width.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
