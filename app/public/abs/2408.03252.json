These two-loop running effects\nare relevant for processes where the effective Higgs-gluon coupling contributes\nat a lower loop order compared to the Standard Model contribution and where a\ndynamical scale choice is adopted. Such a situation arises, for instance, in\nthe Higgs transverse momentum distribution and Higgs pair production. We\ninvestigate the phenomenological impact of our computations on these two\nprocesses and find that the two-loop contributions are significant and can lead\nto deviations of up to 20\\% in the scenarios we consider.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
