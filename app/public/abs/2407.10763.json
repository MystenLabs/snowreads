In this paper, we\nconsider sampling from the posterior in the linear inverse problem, with an\ni.i.d. random design matrix. We develop a sampling algorithm by integrating the\nAMP algorithm and stochastic localization. We give a proof for the convergence\nin smoothed KL divergence between the distribution of the samples generated by\nour algorithm and the target distribution, whenever the noise variance $\\Delta$\nis below $\\Delta_{\\rm AMP}$, which is the computation threshold for mean\nestimation introduced in (Barbier et al., 2020).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
