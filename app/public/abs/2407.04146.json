As in the\nneutral case investigated previously, we find a ground state of the dust ball\nwith the size of a fraction of the outer horizon. Moreover, we determine a\nself-consistent configuration of layers in the ground state corresponding to an\neffective mass function that increases linearly with the areal radius and has\nno inner horizon.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
