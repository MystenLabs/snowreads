For example we focus on the case of a the random evolution of a\ntraded financial asset price with uncertain volatility. The quantum approach\npresented, allows us to encode different volatility levels in a state acting on\na Hilbert space. We consider different means of defining projective\nmeasurements in order to track the evolution of a traded market price, and\ndiscuss the results of different Monte-Carlo simulations.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
