We also introduce an essential cover with even stronger continuity\nproperties. For one-sided sofic subshifts, this generalizes the Krieger and\nFischer covers, respectively. Our construction is functorial in the sense that\ncertain equivariant maps between dynamical systems lift to equivariant maps\nbetween their covers, and these maps also satisfy better regularity properties.\nAs applications, we identify finiteness conditions which ensure that the\nthermodynamic formalism is valid for the covers. This establishes the\nthermodynamic formalism for a large class of non-invertible dynamical systems,\ne.g. certain piecewise invertible maps. When applied to semi-\\'etale groupoids,\nour minimal covers produce \\'etale groupoids which are models for\n$C^*$-algebras constructed by Thomsen. The dynamical covers and groupoid covers\nare unified under the common framework of topological graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O4Y-A9FxowkzPvV8cZGpWOfI_QGykkR3oZ16MEj0SKI","pdfSize":"520626"}
