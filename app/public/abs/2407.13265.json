In this\nstudy, we characterize the hydrodynamic forces and torques felt by a sphere\ntranslating in close proximity to a fluid interface, separating the viscous\nmedium of the sphere's motion from an infinitely-more-viscous medium. We employ\nlubrication theory and perform a perturbation analysis in capillary compliance.\nThe dominant response of the interface owing to surface tension results in a\nlong-ranged interface deformation, which leads to a modification of the forces\nand torques with respect to the rigid reference case, that we characterise in\ndetails with scaling arguments and numerical integrations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
