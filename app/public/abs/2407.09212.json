However, current query\nembedding models heavily rely on excessively parameterized neural networks and\ncannot explain the knowledge learned from the graph. We propose a novel query\nembedding method, AConE, which explains the knowledge learned from the graph in\nthe form of $SROI^-$ description logic axioms while being more\nparameter-efficient than most existing approaches. AConE associates queries to\na $SROI^-$ description logic concept. Every $SROI^-$ concept is embedded as a\ncone in complex vector space, and each $SROI^-$ relation is embedded as a\ntransformation that rotates and scales cones. We show theoretically that AConE\ncan learn $SROI^-$ axioms, and defines an algebra whose operations correspond\none to one to $SROI^-$ description logic concept constructs. Our empirical\nstudy on multiple query datasets shows that AConE achieves superior results\nover previous baselines with fewer parameters. Notably on the WN18RR dataset,\nAConE achieves significant improvement over baseline models. We provide\ncomprehensive analyses showing that the capability to represent axioms\npositively impacts the results of query answering.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ipf3GDu5yf1ZtrKCNGTVhcxRHTV_Hg1R6mKq3atoiIQ","pdfSize":"599611"}
