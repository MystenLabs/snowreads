This large scene\ndata intensive technology puts a high value on automatic target recognition\nwhich can free the utilizers and boost the efficiency. Recent advances in\nartificial intelligence have made it possible to create a deep learning based\nSAR ATR that can automatically identify target features from massive input\ndata. In the last 6 years, intensive research has been conducted in this area,\nhowever, most papers in the current SAR ATR field used recurrent neural network\nand convolutional neural network varied models to deepen the regime's\nunderstanding of the SAR images. To equip SAR ATR with updated deep learning\ntechnology, this paper tries to apply a lightweight vision transformer based\nmodel to classify SAR images. The entire structure was verified by an\nopen-accessed SAR data set and recognition results show that the final\nclassification outcomes are robust and more accurate in comparison with\nreferred traditional network structures without even using any convolutional\nlayers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
