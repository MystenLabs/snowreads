Equivalently, every $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a\nset $X$ of $O(\\sqrt{n}\\log^2 n)$ vertices such that $G-X$ has bandwidth\n$O(\\sqrt{n}\\log^2 n)$. This result holds in the more general setting of graphs\ncontained in the strong product of a bounded treewidth graph and a path, which\nincludes bounded genus graphs, graphs excluding a fixed apex graph as a minor,\nand $k$-planar graphs for fixed $k$. These results are obtained using two\ningredients. The first is a new local sparsification lemma, which shows that\nevery $n$-vertex planar graph $G$ has a set of $O((n\\log n)/D)$ vertices whose\nremoval results in a graph with local density at most $D$. The second is a\ngeneralization of a method of Feige and Rao, that relates bandwidth and local\ndensity using volume-preserving Euclidean embeddings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
