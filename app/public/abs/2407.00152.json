It is a difficult\noptimization problem, that depends on minimizing a convex non-linear function:\nthe (quantum) relative entropy. Standard conic optimization techniques have for\na long time been unable to handle the relative entropy cone, as it is a\nnon-symmetric cone, and the standard algorithms can only handle symmetric ones.\nRecently, however, a practical algorithm has been discovered for optimizing\nover non-symmetric cones, including the relative entropy. Here we adapt this\nalgorithm to the problem of computation of key rates, obtaining an efficient\ntechnique for lower bounding them. In comparison to previous techniques it has\nthe advantages of flexibility, ease of use, and above all performance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
