However, FL faces challenges with data\nheterogeneity among institutions, leading to suboptimal global models.\nIntegrating Disentangled Representation Learning (DRL) in FL can enhance\nrobustness by separating data into distinct representations. Existing DRL\nmethods assume heterogeneity lies solely in style features, overlooking\ncontent-based variability like lesion size and shape. We propose FedGS, a novel\nFL aggregation method, to improve segmentation performance on small,\nunder-represented targets while maintaining overall efficacy. FedGS\ndemonstrates superior performance over FedAvg, particularly for small lesions,\nacross PolypGen and LiTS datasets.
