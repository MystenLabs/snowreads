However, this also makes them vulnerable to various types\nof cyber attacks. SDNs work on a centralized control plane which makes them\nmore prone to network attacks. Research has demonstrated that deep learning\n(DL) methods can be successful in identifying intrusions in conventional\nnetworks, but their application in SDNs is still an open research area. In this\nresearch, we propose the use of DL techniques for intrusion detection in SDNs.\nWe measure the effectiveness of our method by experimentation on a dataset of\nnetwork traffic and comparing it to existing techniques. Our results show that\nthe DL-based approach outperforms traditional methods in terms of detection\naccuracy and computational efficiency. The deep learning architecture that has\nbeen used in this research is a Long Short Term Memory Network and\nSelf-Attention based architecture i.e. LSTM-Attn which achieves an Fl-score of\n0.9721. Furthermore, this technique can be trained to detect new attack\npatterns and improve the overall security of SDNs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DJsWc5c44Q68bPunVyEJnhJpfxZV10xhm0vYdbV1Img","pdfSize":"492586"}
