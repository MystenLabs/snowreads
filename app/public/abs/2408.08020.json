Especially for long-distance\nmaneuvers that require small sampling times, the necessary horizon lengths\nprevent its application on onboard computers. In this paper, we propose a\ncomputationally efficient tubebased shrinking horizon MPC that is scalable to\nlong prediction horizons. Using move blocking, we ensure that a given number of\ndecision inputs is efficiently used throughout the maneuver. Next, a method to\nsubstantially reduce the number of constraints is introduced. The approach is\ndemonstrated with a helicopter landing on an inclined platform using a\nprediction horizon of 300 steps. The constraint reduction decreases the\ncomputation time by an order of magnitude with a slight increase in trajectory\ncost.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
