In this manuscript, we expand on previous work by studying\nan ABM's mean-field behaviour using ordinary differential equation (ODE) models\nand a new tool, opinion response functions. Using these methods allows for\nformal analysis of the deterministic model which can provide a theoretical\nexplanation for observed behaviours, e.g., coexistence or overturning of\nopinions. In particular, opinion response functions are a method of\ncharacterizing the equilibria in our social model. Our analysis confirms\nearlier numerical results and supplements them with a precise formula for\ncomputing the minimum committed minority size required to overturn a social\nconvention.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
