We\nshow that for a simple class of measurement schemes, post-selected light-cone\ndynamical correlation functions can be obtained efficiently from the averaged\ncorrelations of a different unitary circuit. This connects rare measurement\noutcomes in one circuit to typical outcomes in another one. We derive\nconditions for the existence of this rare-to-typical mapping in brickwork\nquantum circuits made of XYZ gates. We illustrate these general results with a\nmodel system that exhibits a dynamical crossover (a smoothed dynamical\ntransition) in event statistics, and discuss extensions to more general\ndynamical correlations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
