In\nour framework, we assume that these instructions involve intricate linguistic\nstructures and multiple interdependent tasks that must be navigated\nsuccessfully to achieve the desired outcomes. To effectively manage these\ncomplexities, we propose a hierarchical framework that combines the deep\nlanguage comprehension of large language models with the adaptive\naction-execution capabilities of reinforcement learning agents. The language\nmodule (based on LLM) translates the language instruction into a high-level\naction plan, which is then executed by a pre-trained reinforcement learning\nagent. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approach in two different\nenvironments: in IGLU, where agents are instructed to build structures, and in\nCrafter, where agents perform tasks and interact with objects in the\nsurrounding environment according to language commands.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
