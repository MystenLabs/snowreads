Marginal homogeneity is\nrelevant in economic settings such as dynamic discrete games. In this paper, we\npropose several tests for the hypothesis of marginal homogeneity and\ninvestigate their properties. We consider an asymptotic framework in which the\nnumber of individuals n in the panel diverges, and the number of periods T is\nfixed. We implement our tests by comparing a studentized or non-studentized\nT-sample version of the Cramer-von Mises statistic with a suitable critical\nvalue. We propose three methods to construct the critical value: asymptotic\napproximations, the bootstrap, and time permutations. We show that the first\ntwo methods result in asymptotically exact hypothesis tests. The permutation\ntest based on a non-studentized statistic is asymptotically exact when T=2, but\nis asymptotically invalid when T>2. In contrast, the permutation test based on\na studentized statistic is always asymptotically exact. Finally, under a\ntime-exchangeability assumption, the permutation test is exact in finite\nsamples, both with and without studentization.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
