The key to\nenergy stability is the addition of appropriate stabilisation terms into the\nconvective fluxes of mass and momenta, and the source term. The space-time\nfully-discrete scheme admits the positivity of the mass density, and is\nconsistent with the weak formulation of the EPB system upon mesh refinement. In\nthe quasineutral limit, the numerical scheme yields a consistent, semi-implicit\ndiscretisation of the isothermal compressible Euler system, thus leading to the\nAP property. Several benchmark numerical case studies are performed to confirm\nthe robustness and efficacy of the proposed scheme in the dispersive as well as\nthe quasineutral regimes. The numerical results also corroborates scheme's\nability to very well resolve plasma sheaths and the related dynamics, which\nindicates its potential to applications involving low-temperature plasma\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
