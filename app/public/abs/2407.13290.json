To address the dynamical\ninterparticle rearrangements in a minimal system, we here exactly solve the\nproblem of two hard disk-like interacting odd-diffusing particles. We calculate\nthe probability density function (PDF) of the interacting particles in the\nFourier-Laplace domain and find that oddness rotates all modes except the\nzeroth, resembling a ``mutual rolling'' of interacting odd particles. We show\nthat only the first Fourier mode of the PDF, the polarization, enters the\ncalculation of the force autocorrelation function (FACF) for generic systems\nwith central-force interactions. An analysis of the polarization as a function\nof time reveals that the relative rotation angle between interacting particles\novershoots before relaxation, thereby rationalizing the recently observed\noscillating FACF in odd-diffusive systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7sVNPuCMv7h8Ccfgj4g3Q76IXPyQd-IxlGDy16zIuBk","pdfSize":"6343316"}
