These functions encompass standard independence\ntests but also the Lancaster/Streitberg interactions, and are multivariate\nextensions of Bernstein functions. Addressing a gap in these two probability\ncontexts of interactions, we introduce an indexed measure of independence that\ngeneralizes the Lancaster interaction. We present several examples of these\nfunctions derived from high-order completely monotone functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
