Mismatching the game difficulty and a player's\nskill or commitment results in frustration or boredom on the player's side, and\nhence reduces time spent playing the game. In this work, we explore balancing\ngame difficulty using machine learning-based agents to challenge players based\non their current behavior. This is achieved by a combination of two agents, in\nwhich one learns to imitate the player, while the second is trained to beat the\nfirst. In our demo, we investigate the proposed framework for personalized\ndynamic difficulty adjustment of AI agents in the context of the fighting game\nAI competition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
