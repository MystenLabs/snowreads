We analyze the elastic\nCoulomb breakup of $^{11}$Be on a $^{208}$Pb target at 72 MeV/A to determine\nthe photodisintegration cross-section and radiative capture cross-section.\nUtilizing the Maxwell-averaged velocity distribution, we calculate the\nresulting radiative neutron capture reaction rate for the\n$^{10}$Be(n,$\\gamma$)$^{11}$Be reaction. Comparative analyses are conducted\nwith experimental data, theoretical results from direct radiative capture\nmethods, and transfer reaction calculations. Additionally, we contrast our\nfindings with the existing $^{10}$Be($\\alpha$,$\\gamma$)$^{14}$C reaction rate\nand conclude the dominance of neutron capture over $\\alpha$ capture by\n$^{10}$Be.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
