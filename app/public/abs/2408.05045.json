In one of the earliest\ntheoretical works exploring this phenomenon, [L. Limat and H. A. Stone,\nEurophys. Lett. 65(3), 2004] elicited a self-similar conical structure of the\ninterface in the viscous regime. However, noting that inertia is not expected\nto be negligible at contact line speeds close to, and beyond the critical value\nfor many common liquids, we provide the leading-order inertial correction to\ntheir solution. In particular, we find the self-similar corrections to the\ninterface shape as well as the flow-field, and also determine their scaling\nwith the capillary number. We find that inertia invariably modifies the\ninterface into a cusp-like shape with an increased film thickness. Furthermore,\nwhen incorporating contact line dynamics into the model, resulting in a\nnarrowing of the corner as the contact line speed increases, we still observe\nan overall increase in the inertial contribution with speed despite the\nincreased confinement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aJTp0UfUdUiWFKUr5nk1fd5A4Xvxp-eg5r91Bg6siCk","pdfSize":"1686525"}
