Our findings indicate that the\nBethe-Heitler mechanism, which dominates at small momentum transfers, allows\nfor an extraction of the proton electromagnetic form factors in the extremely\nlow $Q^2$ region below $10^{-3}$ GeV$^2$ in the spacelike region, when the\nincident photon beam energy exceeds several hundred MeV. The optimal\nkinematical region and a sensitivity study of the proton charge radius from\ndimuon photoproduction are presented. Such a measurement is expected to provide\nan alternative to the elastic muon-proton scattering measurements such as MUSE\nat PSI and AMBER at CERN.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
