HS eliminates the need for surface reflectance, a challenging\nparameter to measure, based on the Helmholtz reciprocity principle. Its\nBayesian formulation using maximum a posteriori (MAP) probability approach has\nsignificantly improved reconstruction accuracy of HS method. This framework\nenables the inclusion of smoothness priors which enforces observations and\nneighborhood information in the formulation. We used Markov Random Fields (MRF)\nwhich is a powerful tool to integrate diverse prior contextual information and\nsolved the MAP-MRF using belief propagation algorithm. We propose a new\nsmoothness function utilizing the normal field integration method for refined\ndepth estimation within the Bayesian framework. Utilizing three pairs of images\nwith different viewpoints, our approach demonstrates superior depth label\naccuracy compared to conventional Bayesian methods. Experimental results\nindicate that our proposed method yields a better depth map with reduced RMS\nerror, showcasing its efficacy in improving depth estimation within Helmholtz\nstereopsis.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SUsn8575a43AGE27FVk0zQMdyzpx_aIlHCyhxayBijw","pdfSize":"21579297"}
