We apply the\nconstruction to the case of the trivial cohomological field theory to find it\nproduces the KdV hierarchy, although its relation to the untwisted case is\nnontrivial. The key role of the KdV hierarchy in controlling the intersection\ntheory of several natural tautological classes translates this relation into a\nseries of remarkable identities between intersection numbers involving\npsi-classes, Hodge classes, Norbury's theta class and the strata of meromorphic\ndifferentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EvtnlFI3xzxd0CkyLU90q7Eud8B7_t6HJiHKGMgXwJA","pdfSize":"345267"}
