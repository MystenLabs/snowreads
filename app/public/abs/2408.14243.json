This paper\nexploits the rollout of LTC insurance in China around 2016 to examine the\nimpact of public LTC insurance on healthy workers' labor supply, a critical\nself-insurance channel. We find that workers eligible for public LTC insurance\nwere less likely to engage in labor work and worked fewer weeks annually\nfollowing the policy change, suggesting a mitigation of uninsured risks.\nHowever, these impacts were insignificant among those with strong informal\ninsurance coverage. Parallel changes in anticipated formal care use corroborate\nthese findings. While our results reveal that public LTC insurance provides\nlimited additional risk-sharing when informal insurance predominates, they also\nunderscore its growing importance.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
