Using exact many-body methods based on neural\nnetwork quantum states and tensor networks, we determine the existence of a\nfirst order phase transition between stripe order and the topological quantum\nmagnet and the second order phase transition between the Neel order and quantum\nmagnet phase, further corroborated by calculations of the many-body gap. Using\nan auxiliary fermion parton formalism, we show the emergence of topological\nspinon corner modes stemming from the breathing order parameter of the parent\nHeisenberg model. Our results establish the breathing frustrated square lattice\nHeisenberg model as a paradigmatic system to engineer topological quantum\nmagnetism, as recently realized in Ti lattices at MgO.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
