For a given principle quantum number,\nmost of the energy levels are nearly degenerate at zero field and fan out with\nincreasing field to form a manifold. We excite Rydberg atoms to energy levels\nnear the center of the manifold, where the spacing is nearly harmonic, and\nallow them to exchange energy via resonant dipole-dipole interactions. We\nmeasure the time evolution as energy spreads away from the center of the\nmanifold, which reveals that the system fails to thermalize for long\ninteraction times. A computational model that includes only a few essential\nfeatures of the system qualitatively agrees with this result.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
