At its heart this package uses the\nsolutions of the time dependent general relativistic disc equations to compute\nmulti-band light curves and spectra. All relevant relativistic optics effects\n(Doppler and gravitational energy shifting, and gravitational lensing) are\nincluded. Additional, non-disc light curve and spectral components can be\nincluded to (for example) model the early time rise and decay of tidal\ndisruption event light curves in optical-to-UV bands. Monte Carlo Markov Chain\nfitting procedures are included which return posterior distributions of black\nhole and disc parameters, allowing for the future automated processing of the\nlarge populations of transient sources discovered by (e.g.,) the Vera Rubin\nObservatory. As an explicit example, in this paper we model the\nmulti-wavelength light curves of the tidal disruption event AT2019dsg, finding\na good fit to the data, a black hole mass consistent with galactic scaling\nrelationships, and a late-time disc Eddington ratio consistent with the\nobserved launching of an outflow observed in radio bands.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
