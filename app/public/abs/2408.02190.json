Calculating properties of these fractionalized metallic states\nin single-band models are generally restricted to mean-field patron\ndescriptions and small fluctuations around these states, which are insufficient\nfor quantitative comparison of observables to measurements performed in\nstrongly-correlated systems. In this work, we numerically study a class of\ncorrelated electronic wavefunctions which support fractionalized spin and\ncharge excitations and which fully take into account gauge fluctuations through\nthe enforcement of local Hilbert space constraints. By optimizing the energy of\nthese wavefunctions against the hole-doped Fermi Hubbard Hamiltonian, we obtain\na variational ansatz for describing the low-energy physics of this model. We\ncompare measurements of hole-induced spin-spin correlation functions to\nmeasurements taken in low temperature cold-atom simulations of the Hubbard\nmodel and find quantitative agreement between the two. In particular, we\ndemonstrate the emergence of magnetic polaron correlations in these metallic\nstates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YysbduD_DWKt2KQk9Gxc4QPwKmpbCGTbgJdrmSveRCs","pdfSize":"668979","txDigest":"YWCqfJyKoEyYJEdjZjQ5X312vJy6PeipSAPuVWZKH3N","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
