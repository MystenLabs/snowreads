NADI's objective is to help advance SoTA Arabic NLP by\nproviding guidance, datasets, modeling opportunities, and standardized\nevaluation conditions that allow researchers to collaboratively compete on\npre-specified tasks. NADI 2024 targeted both dialect identification cast as a\nmulti-label task (Subtask~1), identification of the Arabic level of dialectness\n(Subtask~2), and dialect-to-MSA machine translation (Subtask~3). A total of 51\nunique teams registered for the shared task, of whom 12 teams have participated\n(with 76 valid submissions during the test phase). Among these, three teams\nparticipated in Subtask~1, three in Subtask~2, and eight in Subtask~3. The\nwinning teams achieved 50.57 F\\textsubscript{1} on Subtask~1, 0.1403 RMSE for\nSubtask~2, and 20.44 BLEU in Subtask~3, respectively. Results show that Arabic\ndialect processing tasks such as dialect identification and machine translation\nremain challenging. We describe the methods employed by the participating teams\nand briefly offer an outlook for NADI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
