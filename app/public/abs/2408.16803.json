Log data, characterized by its hierarchical, dictionary-like\nstructure, poses unique challenges when processed using conventional\ntransformer models. Traditional methods often rely on manually crafted\ntemplates for parsing logs, a process that is labor-intensive and lacks\ngeneralizability. Additionally, the linear treatment of log sequences by\nstandard transformers neglects the rich, nested relationships within log\nentries, leading to suboptimal representations and excessive memory usage.\n  To address these issues, we introduce HLogformer, a novel hierarchical\ntransformer framework specifically designed for log data. HLogformer leverages\nthe hierarchical structure of log entries to significantly reduce memory costs\nand enhance representation learning. Unlike traditional models that treat log\ndata as flat sequences, our framework processes log entries in a manner that\nrespects their inherent hierarchical organization. This approach ensures\ncomprehensive encoding of both fine-grained details and broader contextual\nrelationships.\n  Our contributions are threefold: First, HLogformer is the first framework to\ndesign a dynamic hierarchical transformer tailored for dictionary-like log\ndata. Second, it dramatically reduces memory costs associated with processing\nextensive log sequences. Third, comprehensive experiments demonstrate that\nHLogformer more effectively encodes hierarchical contextual information,\nproving to be highly effective for downstream tasks such as synthetic anomaly\ndetection and product recommendation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
