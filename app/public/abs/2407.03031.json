While this assumption is not crucial for\nderiving the local properties of radiation at future null infinity, it plays a\nsignificant role in discussions about Hawking partners -- the field modes that\npurify Hawking radiation. This article aims to explore the definition and fate\nof Hawking partners in black hole scenarios where semiclassical mass loss due\nto Hawking radiation is considered. Our analysis avoids the assumption of event\nhorizons and instead focuses on collapse processes that feature a trapped\nregion bounded by a dynamical horizon. We derive the form of the partners,\naccounting for the effects of back-scattering. Furthermore, using these results\nand mild assumptions, we find that Hawking partners cannot \"leak\" out of the\ndynamical horizon to partially purify the Hawking radiation in the regime where\ngeneral relativity coexists semiclassically with quantum field theory. This\nfinding emphasizes the necessity for new physics, such as quantum gravity, to\nresolve the final fate of information.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
