A\nparticularly concerning threat is the vulnerability of CPS to deceptive attacks\nthat degrade system performance while remaining undetected. This paper\ninvestigates perfectly undetectable false data injection attacks (FDIAs)\ntargeting the trajectory tracking control of a non-holonomic mobile robot. The\nproposed attack method utilizes affine transformations of intercepted signals,\nexploiting weaknesses inherent in the partially linear dynamic properties and\nsymmetry of the nonlinear plant. The feasibility and potential impact of these\nattacks are validated through experiments using a Turtlebot 3 platform,\nhighlighting the urgent need for sophisticated detection mechanisms and\nresilient control strategies to safeguard CPS against such threats.\nFurthermore, a novel approach for detection of these attacks called the state\nmonitoring signature function (SMSF) is introduced. An example SMSF, a\ncarefully designed function resilient to FDIA, is shown to be able to detect\nthe presence of a FDIA through signatures based on systems states.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
