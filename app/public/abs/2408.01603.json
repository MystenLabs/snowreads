The salient feature of the FIVB ranking is the use of the\nprobabilistic model, which explicitly calculates the probabilities of the games\nto come. This explicit modeling is new in the context of official ranking, and\nwe study the optimality of its parameters as well as its relationship with the\nranking algorithm as such. The analysis is carried out using both analytical\nand numerical methods. We conclude that, from the modeling perspective, the use\nof the home-field advantage (HFA) would be beneficial and that the weighting of\nthe game results is counterproductive. Regarding the algorithm itself, we\nexplain the rationale beyond the approximations currently used and explain how\nto find new parameters which improve the performance. Finally, we propose a new\nmodel that drastically simplifies both the implementation and interpretation of\nthe resulting algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
