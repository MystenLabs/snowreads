A Gutzwiller projection is a standard\napproach of constructing spin liquid states. For example, if one starts with a\ngapless free fermion pure quantum state, the steady state of the Lindbladian\nevolution in the doubled Hilbert space is an analog of an algebraic spin\nliquid, which is dubbed the \"Choi-spin liquid\". The Choi-spin liquid can also\nbe produced through strong measurement without post-selection. Predictions of\nthe Choi-spin liquids can be made based on the understanding on spin liquids,\nand we will design the experimental protocol to test these predictions. If one\nstarts with a Chern insulator, theory predicts that the steady state of the\nLindbladian evolution is expected to have a spontaneous \"strong-to-weak\" U(1)\nsymmetry breaking, which corresponds to a superconductor in the doubled Hilbert\nspace.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b8FWeNCKzss2LDtk2eNkzTvlM0uHuGsOIc4_Fchtnq4","pdfSize":"243122"}
