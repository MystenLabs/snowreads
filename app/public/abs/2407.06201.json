This has\na map to the moduli space of elliptic curves which is onto and generically\nthree-to-one. The reason is that from any acute or right triangle we can\nconstruct an elliptic curve, and every elliptic curve is isomorphic to one\nconstructed this way.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
