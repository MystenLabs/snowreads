When secondary\ninformation about options is accessible, such problems can be framed as\ncontextual multi-armed bandits (CMABs). Neuro-inspired active inference has\ngained interest for its ability to balance exploration and exploitation using\nthe expected free energy objective function. Unlike previous studies that\nshowed the effectiveness of active inference based strategy for CMABs using\nsynthetic data, this study aims to apply active inference to realistic\nscenarios, using a simulated mineralogical survey site selection problem.\nHyperspectral data from AVIRIS-NG at Cuprite, Nevada, serves as contextual\ninformation for predicting outcome probabilities, while geologists' mineral\nlabels represent outcomes. Monte Carlo simulations assess the robustness of\nactive inference against changing expert preferences. Results show that active\ninference requires fewer iterations than standard bandit approaches with\nreal-world noisy and biased data, and performs better when outcome preferences\nvary online by adapting the selection strategy to align with expert shifts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
