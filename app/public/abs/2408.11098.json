We consider the possibility that some of them were seeded by the\ndirect collapse of primordial density perturbations from inflation into\nprimordial black holes and analyze the consequences of this on current dark\nmatter substructures assuming non-Gaussian primordial curvature perturbation\ndistributions. We derive bounds on the enhanced curvature perturbation\namplitude from the number of dwarf spheroidal galaxies in our Galaxy,\nobservations of stellar streams and gravitational lensing. We find this bound\nregion significantly overlaps with that required for SMBH seed formation and\nenables us to probe Gaussian and non-Gaussian curvature perturbations\ncorresponding to the SMBH seeds in the range ${\\cal O}(10^5$-$10^{12})\nM_\\odot$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4TY-M0dHMw-e_zb47CIHGOiuhF3Vn0vMVSpvdA7clHY","pdfSize":"1119719"}
