In this limit, the transmission probability through the\nstructure is shown to be blocked for all the parameter values of the well,\nexcept a resonance set of Lebesgue measure zero. The peak-to-valley ratio is\nshown to increase crucially with the squeezing of the well: the thinner is its\nthickness, the resonant peaks become sharper and localized at isolated points.\nContrary, a discrete spectrum of the heterostructure (if any) does exist both\non the resonance set and beyond it, however, the squeezing scenario here turns\nout to be quite interesting and sophisticated.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5O-6BV1mASHWHNg-MefVz-16rGiemcILWIkUvdb_Ies","pdfSize":"470055"}
