However, the resources currently\navailable to the public are limited and fail to provide a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the relationship between drugs and their side effects. This\npaper introduces DrugWatch, an easy-to-use and interactive multi-source\ninformation visualisation platform for drug safety study. It allows users to\nunderstand common side effects of drugs and their statistical information,\nflexibly retrieve relevant medical reports, or annotate their own medical texts\nwith our automated annotation tool. Supported by NLP technology and enriched\nwith interactive visual components, we are committed to providing researchers\nand practitioners with a one-stop information analysis, retrieval, and\nannotation service. The demonstration video is available at\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RTqDgxzETjw. We also deployed an online\ndemonstration system at https://drugwatch.net/.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
