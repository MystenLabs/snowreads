We\nprove that transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms, or more generally continuum-wise\nhyperbolic homeomorphisms, do not satisfy the shadowing property for the\ninduced map on the hyperspace of continua. We prove that dendrite monotone maps\nsatisfy the shadowing property if, and only if, their induced map on the\nhyperspace of continua also satisfies it. We give some algorithms that show\nthat there are abundant dynamical systems satisfying the shadowing property\nwith dendrites (compact metric trees) as the underlying space. As a\nconsequence, we show that the universal dendrite of order n admits a\nhomeomorphism with the shadowing property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8grMEJNRFX17Zb4VPNcCkA-HUfyoCu4Fs9MRy3ZOO5g","pdfSize":"284073"}
