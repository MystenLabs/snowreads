Probabilistic Reservoir Computing (RC) is well-suited for\nlong-term chaotic predictions by handling complex dynamic systems. Spin-Orbit\nTorque (SOT) devices in spintronics, with their nonlinear and probabilistic\noperations, can enhance performance in these tasks. This study proposes an RC\nsystem utilizing SOT devices for predicting chaotic dynamics. By simulating the\nreservoir in an RC network with SOT devices that achieve nonlinear resistance\nchanges with random distribution, we enhance the robustness for the predictive\ncapability of the model. The RC network predicted the behaviors of the\nMackey-Glass and Lorenz chaotic systems, demonstrating that stochastic SOT\ndevices significantly improve long-term prediction accuracy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
