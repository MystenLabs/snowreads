Despite their success,\na paradox remains: MetaBBO still rely on human-crafted Exploratory Landscape\nAnalysis features to inform the meta-level agent about the low-level\noptimization progress. To address the gap, this paper proposes Neural\nExploratory Landscape Analysis (NeurELA), a novel framework that dynamically\nprofiles landscape features through a two-stage, attention-based neural\nnetwork, executed in an entirely end-to-end fashion. NeurELA is pre-trained\nover a variety of MetaBBO algorithms using a multi-task neuroevolution\nstrategy. Extensive experiments show that NeurELA achieves consistently\nsuperior performance when integrated into different and even unseen MetaBBO\ntasks and can be efficiently fine-tuned for further performance boost. This\nadvancement marks a pivotal step in making MetaBBO algorithms more autonomous\nand broadly applicable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
