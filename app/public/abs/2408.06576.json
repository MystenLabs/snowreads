To this end, we present CTISum,\na new benchmark for CTI summarization task. Considering the importance of\nattack process, a novel fine-grained subtask of attack process summarization is\nproposed to enable defenders to assess risk, identify security gaps,\nvulnerabilities, and so on. Specifically, we first design a multi-stage\nannotation pipeline to gather and annotate the CTI data, and then benchmark the\nCTISum with a collection of extractive and abstractive summarization methods.\nExperimental results show that current state-of-the-art models exhibit\nlimitations when applied to CTISum, underscoring the fact that automatically\nproducing concise summaries of CTI reports remains an open research challenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
