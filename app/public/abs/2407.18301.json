These swaps of eigenvectors weave\nthe entanglement in multi-partite systems. The efficiency of this weaving of\nentanglement depends on the narrowness of the avoided level crossings and it\nis, therefore, constraining the speed of adiabatic evolution. This relates an\nadiabatic quantum computation's complexity, as measured by its minimum\nduration, to that quantum computation's usage of the resource of entanglement.\nTo derive these results, we employ the spectral theorem to decompose\ninteraction Hamiltonians into rank-one projectors and we then use the adiabatic\ntheorem to successively adiabatically introduce these projectors. For each\nprojector activation, using recent exact results on the behaviour of\neigensystems under the addition of Hamiltonians, we can then non-perturbatively\ncalculate the entanglement dynamics. Our findings provide new tools for the\nanalysis and control of the dynamics of entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
