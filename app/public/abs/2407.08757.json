Inspired by their result, we study the convergence rate of the\n$Q$-curvature flow in this paper. In particular, we provide an example of a\nslowly converging $Q_6$-curvature flow in dimension 6, in constrast to the\ndimension 2 case, where the $Q$-curvature flow always converges exponentially.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
