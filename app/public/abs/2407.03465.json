We associate the largest intrinsic mass scale generated by the flow\naway from the fixed point with the scale of present dark energy density. This\nresults in a highly predictive scenario for the evolution of dynamical dark\nenergy. It solves the cosmological constant problem dynamically, and may be\ncalled \"quantum gravity quintessence\". A first setting without quantum scale\nsymmetry violation in the neutrino sector could explain the present amount of\ndark energy, but fails for the constraints on its time evolution. In contrast,\na logarithmic scale symmetry violation in the beyond standard model sector\nresponsible for the neutrino masses induces a non-vanishing cosmon-neutrino\ncoupling in the Einstein frame. This yields a cosmology similar to growing\nneutrino quintessence, which could be compatible with present observation. The\nsmall number of unknown parameters turns the scaling solution for quantum\ngravity into a fundamental explanation of dynamical dark energy which can be\nfalsified.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
