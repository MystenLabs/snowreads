However, current methods are hindered\nby initialization problems such as prolonged writing duration, and limitations\non the number of magnetic states. Consequently, a universal method for\nachieving multistate in PMA-based stacks remains elusive. Here, we propose a\ngeneral experimental method for achieving multistate without any initialization\nstep in SOT-driven magnetization switching by integrating an external\nout-of-plane magnetic field. Motivated by macrospin calculations coupled with\nmicromagnetic simulations, which demonstrate the plausibility of magnetization\nstate changes due to out-of-plane field integration, we experimentally verify\nmultistate behavior in Pt/Co/Pt and W/Pt/Co/AlOx stacks. The occurrence of\nmultistate behavior is attributed to intermediate domain states with N\\'eel\ndomain walls. We achieve repeatable 18 multistate configurations with a minimal\nreduction in retentivity through energy barrier measurements, paving the way\nfor efficient analog computing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
