Examples\ninclude: (a) for indecomposable $\\mathcal{E}$ and $\\mathcal{E'}$ with slopes\nand ranks increasing strictly in that order the space of monomorphisms whose\ncokernel is semistable and maximally rigid (i.e. has minimal-dimensional\nautomorphism group) is open dense; (b) for indecomposable $\\mathcal{K}$,\n$\\mathcal{E}$ and stable $\\mathcal{F}$ with slopes increasing strictly in that\norder and ranks and determinants satisfying the obvious additivity constraints\nthe space of embeddings $\\mathcal{K}\\to \\mathcal{E}$ whose cokernel is\nisomorphic to $\\mathcal{F}$ is open dense; (c) the obvious mirror images of\nthese results; (d) generalizations weakening indecomposability to semistability\n+ maximal rigidity; (e) various examples illustrating the necessity of the\nassorted assumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
