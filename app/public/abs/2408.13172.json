This paper presents a cost-efficient platform to\nfacilitate the pre-deployment security checks of IoT devices by predicting\npotential weaknesses and associated attack patterns. The platform employs a\nBidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) network to analyse\ndevice-related textual data and predict weaknesses. At the same time, a\nGradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model predicts likely attack patterns that\ncould exploit these weaknesses. When evaluated on a dataset curated from the\nNational Vulnerability Database (NVD) and publicly accessible IoT data sources,\nthe system demonstrates high accuracy and reliability. The dataset created for\nthis solution is publicly accessible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
