This galaxy is\ndetected in Chandra imaging, suggesting the presence of an AGN with a high\nblack hole accretion rate of $\\dot{M}_{\\rm BH}=0.22\\pm0.03\\, {\\rm M_\\odot\nyr^{-1}}$. Using multi-wavelength photometry from X-ray to sub-millimeter,\nincluding the latest JWST imaging, we confirm that COS-XQG1 is massive\n($M_\\star = (1.6\\pm0.2)\\times10^{11}\\, M_\\odot$) and quiescent (${\\rm\nsSFR}=(0.9\\pm 1.8)\\times10^{-11}\\, {\\rm yr^{-1}}$) as reported previously, even\nconsidering the contribution from AGN emission. Noticeably, COS-XQG1 displays a\nbroad line H$\\alpha$ emission component with a full width at half maximum of\n$4491^{+118}_{-110}\\, {\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}$ in its NIRSpec spectrum. The line\nwidth and luminosity of the broad H$\\alpha$ emission give a black hole mass of\n$\\log{(M_{\\rm BH}/M_\\odot)} = 8.45\\pm0.02\\, (\\pm 0.5)$. With a stellar velocity\ndispersion measurement ($\\sigma_\\star=235\\pm35\\, {\\rm km\\, s^{-1}}$), we find\nthat this galaxy is consistent with the local relations in the $M_{\\rm BH} -\n\\sigma_\\star$ and $M_{\\rm BH}- M_\\star$ planes, which might suggest that\nmassive quiescent galaxies at $z\\geq2$ have already been mature in terms of\nboth stellar and black hole masses and will not evolve significantly. In\naddition, image 2D-decomposition analysis finds that this galaxy comprises disk\nand point source components. The latter is likely the composition of an AGN and\na stellar bulge. Based on a comparison with numerical simulations, we expect\nthat COS-XQG1 will evolve into a typical bulge-dominated quiescent galaxy with\nlower AGN activity by redshift 0. This study shows the usefulness of\nX-ray-detected quiescent galaxies in investigating the co-evolution between\nSMBHs and galaxies in the early Universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nVfObK4be6vDoqZDqCCvSgIm73BxaRwZ8G9iZBNQNFk","pdfSize":"4029994"}
