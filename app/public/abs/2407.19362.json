Towards this\nconjecture, Caro, Petru\\v{s}evski, and \\v{S}krekovski showed that every\nouterplanar graph is odd 5-colorable, and this bound is tight since the cycle\nof length 5 is not odd 4-colorable. Recently, the first author and others\nshowed that every maximal outerplanar graph is odd 4-colorable. In this paper,\nwe show that a connected outerplanar graph $G$ is odd 4-colorable if and only\nif $G$ contains a block which is not a copy of the cycle of length 5. This\nstrengthens the result by Caro, Petru\\v{s}evski, and \\v{S}krekovski, and gives\na complete characterization of odd 4-colorable outerplanar graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
