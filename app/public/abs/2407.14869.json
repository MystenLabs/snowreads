Schnorr random\nreals are not closed upwards under Solovay reducibility. Recall that for two\nleft-c.e. reals~$\\alpha$ and~$\\beta$, the former is Solovay reducible to the\nlatter in case there is a partially computable function $\\varphi$ and\nconstant~$c$ such that for all rational numbers $q < \\beta$ we have \\[\\alpha -\n\\varphi(q) < c(\\beta - q).\\] By requiring the translation function $\\varphi$ to\nbe total, we introduce a total version of Solovay reducibility that implies\nSchnorr reducibility. Accordingly, by Downey and Griffiths\n(DOI:10.2178/jsl/1082418542), the set of Schnorr random left-c.e. reals is\nclosed upwards relative to total Solovay reducibility.\n  Furthermore, we observe that the notion of speedability introduced by Merkle\nand Titov (DOI:10.1007/978-3-030-50026-9_22) can be equivalently characterized\nvia partial computable translation functions in a way that resembles Solovay\nreducibility. By requiring the translation function to be total, we obtain the\nconcept of total speedability. Like for speedability, this notion does not\ndepend on the choice of the speeding constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
