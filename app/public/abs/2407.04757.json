The widespread use of these languages makes the risk of\nmemory-related attacks very high. There are well-known detection mechanisms,\nbut they do not address software resilience. An earlier approach proposes the\nSecure Domain Rewind and Discard (SDRaD) of isolated domains as a method to\nenhance the resilience of software targeted by runtime attacks on x86\narchitecture, based on hardware-enforced Memory Protection Key (MPK). In this\nwork, SDRaD has been adapted to work with the Capability Hardware Enhanced RISC\nInstructions (CHERI) architecture to be more lightweight and performant. The\nresults obtained in this thesis show that CHERI-SDRaD, the prototype adaption\nthat leverages the memory-safety properties inherent to the CHERI architecture,\nresults in a solution with less performance degradation (2.2% in Nginx\nbenchmarks) compared to earlier results obtained with the original SDRaD\nprototype on an Intel-based architecture. The adaption to CHERI additionally\nallowed limitations inherent to the MPK-based approach to be resolved.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
