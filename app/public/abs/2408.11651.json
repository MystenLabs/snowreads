For propositional logic, a negative answer was given by Pratt:\nformulae over one set of operators can always be translated into an equivalent\nformula over any other complete set of operators with only polynomial increase\nin size. Surprisingly, for modal logic the picture is different: we show that\nelimination of bi-implication is only possible at the cost of an exponential\nnumber of occurrences of the modal operator $\\lozenge$ and therefore of an\nexponential increase in formula size, i.e., the De Morgan basis and its\nextension by bi-implication differ in succinctness. Moreover, we prove that any\ncomplete set of Boolean operators agrees in succinctness with the De Morgan\nbasis or with its extension by bi-implication. More precisely, these results\nare shown for the modal logic $\\mathrm{T}$ (and therefore for $\\mathrm{K}$). We\ncomplement them showing that the modal logic $\\mathrm{S5}$ behaves as\npropositional logic: the choice of Boolean operators has no significant impact\non the size of formulae.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"My4sYzlf-f2f2UZ87OIPmhK9UBcUfNvcw7Nbwsf_i5k","pdfSize":"380229"}
