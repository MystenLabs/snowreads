Despite their widespread\nuse for approximating nonlinear PDEs, the majority of these methods neglect\nfundamental physical laws and lack interpretability. We address these\nshortcomings by introducing Physics-embedded Fourier Neural Networks (PeFNN)\nwith flexible and explainable error control. PeFNN is designed to enforce\nmomentum conservation and yields interpretable nonlinear expressions by\nutilizing unique multi-scale momentum-conserving Fourier (MC-Fourier) layers\nand an element-wise product operation. The MC-Fourier layer is by design\ntranslation- and rotation-invariant in the frequency domain, serving as a\nplug-and-play module that adheres to the laws of momentum conservation. PeFNN\nestablishes a new state-of-the-art in solving widely employed spatiotemporal\nPDEs and generalizes well across input resolutions. Further, we demonstrate its\noutstanding performance for challenging real-world applications such as\nlarge-scale flood simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
