They would replace the\ntime-consuming performance estimation or simulation of design with a proxy\nmodel, and automatically insert pragmas to guide hardware optimizations. In\nthis work, we address the challenges associated with high-level synthesis (HLS)\ndesign space exploration (DSE) through the evolving landscape of HLS tools. As\nthese tools develop, the quality of results (QoR) from synthesis can vary\nsignificantly, complicating the maintenance of optimal design strategies across\ndifferent toolchains. We introduce Active-CEM, a task transfer learning scheme\nthat leverages a model-based explorer designed to adapt efficiently to changes\nin toolchains. This approach optimizes sample efficiency by identifying\nhigh-quality design configurations under a new toolchain without requiring\nextensive re-evaluation. We further refine our methodology by incorporating\ntoolchain-invariant modeling. This allows us to predict QoR changes more\naccurately despite shifts in the black-box implementation of the toolchains.\nExperiment results on the HLSyn benchmark transitioning to new toolchain show\nan average performance improvement of 1.58$\\times$ compared to AutoDSE and a\n1.2$\\times$ improvement over HARP, while also increasing the sample efficiency\nby 5.26$\\times$, and reducing the runtime by 2.7$\\times$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
