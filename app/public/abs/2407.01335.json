The analysis uses $pp$ collision data at\n$\\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding\nto an integrated luminosity of 140 ${fb}^{-1}$. No significant excess above the\nStandard Model (SM) prediction is observed. Assuming the SM Higgs boson\nproduction cross-section, the search sets upper limits at 95% confidence level\non the branching ratio of Higgs bosons decaying into $b\\bar{b}\\tau^+\\tau^-$,\n$\\mathcal{B}(H \\rightarrow aa \\rightarrow b\\bar{b}\\tau^+\\tau^-)$, between 2.2%\nand 3.9% depending on the pseudoscalar mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
