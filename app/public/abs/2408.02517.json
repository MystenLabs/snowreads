A dome is a polyhedral surface whose faces are equilateral triangles\nand whose boundary is an integral curve. Glazyrin and Pak showed that not every\nintegral curve can be domed by analyzing the case of unit rhombi, and\nconjectured that every integral curve is cobordant to a unit rhombus. We show\nthat this is false for oriented domes, but that every integral curve is\ncobordant to the union of finitely many unit rhombi.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"0fSVV7szzZNDdWI4m_t0AFvl7WDTvm4KZpnWutSfeHc","pdfSize":"382355"}
