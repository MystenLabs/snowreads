Specifically, we build on\nscholarship in HCI which emphasizes the role of small, offline networks in\nsupporting entrepreneurs' technology maintenance. We detail how entrepreneurs\nresourcefully leveraged their local networks to discover new use cases of\ngenerative AI (e.g., by sharing accounts), assuage heightened techno-anxieties\n(e.g., by recruiting trusted confidants), overcome barriers to sustained use\n(e.g., by receiving wrap-around support), and establish boundaries of use.\nFurther, we suggest how generative AI platforms may be redesigned to better\nsupport entrepreneurs, such as by taking into account the benefits and tensions\nof use in a social context.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
