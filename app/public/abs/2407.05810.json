With the launch of\nChatGPT-4 Turbo in November 2023, we developed a ChatGPT-based teaching\napplication (https://chat.openai.com/g/g-1imx1py4K-chatge-medical-imaging) and\nintegrated it into our undergraduate medical imaging course in the Spring 2024\nsemester. This study investigates the use of ChatGPT throughout a semester-long\ntrial, providing insights into students' engagement, perception, and the\noverall educational effectiveness of the technology. We systematically\ncollected and analyzed data concerning students' interaction with ChatGPT,\nfocusing on their attitudes, concerns, and usage patterns. The findings\nindicate that ChatGPT offers significant advantages such as improved\ninformation access and increased interactivity, but its adoption is accompanied\nby concerns about the accuracy of the information provided and the necessity\nfor well-defined guidelines to optimize its use.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
