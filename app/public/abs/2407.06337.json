To that end,\nwe introduce GeoWATCH, a flexible framework for training models on long\nsequences of satellite images sourced from multiple sensor platforms, which is\ndesigned to handle image classification, activity recognition, object\ndetection, or object tracking tasks. Our system includes a novel partial weight\nloading mechanism based on sub-graph isomorphism which allows for continually\ntraining and modifying a network over many training cycles. This has allowed us\nto train a lineage of models over a long period of time, which we have observed\nhas improved performance as we adjust configurations while maintaining a core\nbackbone.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
