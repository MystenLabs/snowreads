The system is designed to seamlessly aggregate and\ncurate diverse social media data sources, including user posts, multimedia\ncontent, and trending news. Leveraging Federated Learning techniques, the GPT\nmodel is trained on decentralized data sources to ensure privacy and security\nwhile providing personalized insights and recommendations. Users interact with\nthe chatbot through an intuitive interface, accessing tailored information and\nreal-time updates on social media trends and user-generated content. The\nsystem's innovative architecture enables efficient processing of input files,\nparsing and enriching text data with metadata, and generating relevant\nquestions and answers using advanced language models. By facilitating\ninteractive access to a wealth of social network information, this personalized\nchatbot system represents a significant advancement in social media\ncommunication and knowledge dissemination.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
