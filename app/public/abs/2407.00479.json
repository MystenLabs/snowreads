In the first half of the paper, we give four statements equivalent to the\nassertion that a maximally monotone subset be quasidense, including the\nstatement that the set be of ``type (NI)''. Then we consider the Fitzpatrick\nand Gossez extensions of a maximally monotone set to the dual. We give eight\nequivalent formulations for the Fitzpatrick extension of a quasidense maximally\nmonotone set and prove that in, this case, the Fitzpatrick and Gossez\nextensions coincide. This leads to the result that a maximally monotone set is\nquasidense exactly when it is of ``type (D)''. We also give an example of a\nquasidense maximally monotone set whose Fitzpatrick extension, though maximally\nmonotone, is not quasidense. In the final part of this paper, we prove that a\nmaximally monotone set is quasidense if, and only if, it is of ``type (FP)''.\nThe proof of ``only if'' is much simpler than the two which have been given up\nto now.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
