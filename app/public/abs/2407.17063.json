Adapted from Nesterov's accelerated gradient method for convex\nfunctions, the generated sequence guarantees a decay of the function values of\n$\\mathcal{O}\\left(n^{-2}\\right)$ in the convex setting. We show that for\ncoercive functions satisfying some local growth condition (namely a\nH\\''olderian or quadratic growth condition), this sequence strongly converges\nto a minimizer. This property, which has never been proved without assuming the\nuniqueness of the minimizer, is associated with improved convergence rates for\nthe function values. The proposed analysis is based on a preliminary study of\nthe Asymptotic Vanishing Damping system introduced by Su et al. in to\nmodelNesterov's accelerated gradient method in a continuous setting. Novel\nimproved convergence results are also shown for the solutions of this dynamical\nsystem, including the finite length of the trajectory under the aforementioned\ngeometry conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
