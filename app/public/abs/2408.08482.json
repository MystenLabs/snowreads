In the case of hypersurfaces in the torus $\\mathbb{G}_m^n$, a natural\nclass to consider are those with a fixed Newton polyhedron that are\nnondegenerate with respect to it. Using an approach similar to that of\nLawrence-Sawin for abelian varieties (arXiv:2004.09046), we prove the\nShafarevich conjecture for certain classes of Newton polyhedra. In the course\nof our proof we construct a fiber functor for the Tannakian category of\nperverse sheaves on the torus in positive characteristic and compute the\nweights of the Frobenius on it, which leads to the big monodromy results which\nare key to this method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
