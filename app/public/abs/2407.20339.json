By considering non-trivial couplings between the\ndark energy field and the electromagnetic sector, the electromagnetic wave can\npropagate through the cosmological background at non-unit speed, altering the\nphenomenological constraints on its gravitational counterpart. In particular,\nwe show that recent models derived from a Kaluza-Klein compactification of\nhigher dimensional Horndeski models fall into a broader class of theories\ndisformally related to those whose gravitational waves propagate with unit\nspeed. This disformal equivalence can, however, be broken by the gravitational\ncouplings to other sectors with interesting phenomenological consequences. We\nalso consider higher order couplings between the scalar and the photon with\nsecond order field equations, and show that they are not compatible with\nconstraints coming from multi-messenger speed tests and the decay of the\ngravitational wave.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
