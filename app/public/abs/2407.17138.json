A model is employed to systematically investigate droplet\nmorphology and particle distribution in relation to activity and\nconcentration,revealing that active particles have the capacity to induce\nenhanced shape fluctuations in the droplet interface with respect to the\nthermal fluctuations, aligning with recent experimental observations. A rich\nphase behaviour can be identified with two different mechanism of droplet\nbreakage.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
