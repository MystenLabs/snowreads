We then look if the obtained shift operator $B_{(T_k)}$ defined on\nthe $\\ell^p$-sum (or the $c_0$-sum) of the spaces $X_k$ is hypercyclic, weakly\nmixing, mixing, chaotic or frequently hypercyclic. We also compare the\ndynamical properties of $T$ and of the corresponding shift operator $B_T$.\nFinally, we interpret some classical criteria in Linear Dynamics in terms of\nthe dynamical properties of a shift operator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
