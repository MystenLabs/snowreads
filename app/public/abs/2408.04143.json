We prove $W(x)=O(x)$,\nand in particular, that $|W(x)|<2260x$ for all $x\\geq 1$. This result provides\nnew progress towards a conjecture of Sun, which asks whether $|W(x)|<x$ for all\n$x\\geq 3078$. To obtain our results, we computed new explicit bounds on the\nMertens function $M(x)$. These may be of independent interest.\n  Moreover, we obtain similar results and make further conjectures that pertain\nto the more general function \\begin{equation*}\n  W_a(x)=\\sum_{n\\leq x}(-a)^{\\Omega(n)} \\end{equation*} for any real $a>0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
