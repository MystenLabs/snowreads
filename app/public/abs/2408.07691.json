They are embarrassingly parallelizable and lead to\nglobal-in-time approximations that can be efficiently evaluated anywhere within\na finite time horizon. In this article, we propose a family of new high-order\nquadrature schemes for strongly continuous semigroups based on regularized\ncontour integral representations. Our algorithms are accompanied by explicit\nhigh-order error bounds and near-optimal parameter selection. We demonstrate\nkey features of the schemes on singular first-order PDEs from Koopman operator\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
