In particular, LCU approaches present a\nway of encoding information from the electronic structure Hamiltonian into a\nquantum circuit. Over the past years, many different decomposition techniques\nhave appeared for the electronic structure Hamiltonian. Here we present the\nMajorana Tensor Decomposition (MTD), a framework that unifies existing LCUs and\noffers novel decomposition methods by using popular low-rank tensor\nfactorizations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
