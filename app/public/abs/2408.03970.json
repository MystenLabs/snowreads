An electron-correlated internal energy\n(or grand potential) is postulated in consultation with the second-order\nfinite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which then dictates\nthe corresponding thermal orbital (quasi-particle) energies in such a way that\nall fundamental thermodynamic relations are obeyed. The associated density\nmatrix is of a one-electron type, whose diagonal elements take the form of the\nFermi-Dirac distribution functions, when the grand potential is minimized. The\nformulas for the entropy and chemical potential are unchanged from those of\nFermi-Dirac or thermal HF theory. The theory thus constitutes a\nfinite-temperature extension of the second-order Dyson self-energy of\none-particle many-body Green's function theory and can be viewed as a\nsecond-order, diagonal, frequency-independent, thermal inverse Dyson equation.\nAt low temperature, the theory approaches finite-temperature MBPT of the same\norder, but it may outperform the latter at intermediate temperature by\nincluding additional electron-correlation effects through orbital energies. A\nphysical meaning of these thermal orbital energies is proposed (encompassing\nthat of thermal HF orbital energies, which has been elusive) as a\nfinite-temperature version of Janak's theorem.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
