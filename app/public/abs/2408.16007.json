A checklist for designing scientific data\n  visualizations","authors":"Helena Klara Jambor","authorsParsed":[["Jambor","Helena Klara",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 14 Aug 2024 08:03:08 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-30","timestamp":1723622588000,"abstract":"  Biological research spans scales and methodologies, generating complex data\nvisualizations such as images, text, numbers, networks, and maps. With\nincreasingly large and multimodal datasets, effective visualization is\nessential for efficiently conveying scientific insights. Despite this crucial\nrole, biologist often lack training in data visualization and information\ndesign. This work addresses this gap by providing a framework for creating\nclear, accurate, and impactful visualizations of biological data. It is\ncentered around a checklist that guides biologists through the process of\ndeveloping publishable figures. The guide and checklist cover key aspects such\nas selecting appropriate display types, using color palettes effectively, and\noptimizing figure layouts to communicate complex data. Additionally, the work\nis supported by evidence from visualization research, ensuring that the\nchecklist recommendations are grounded in established principles. By following\nthis guide, biologists can enhance their visual data presentations, ultimately\nincreasing the impact of their scientific findings on diverse audiences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1mkxgQDl0rnwalgInRjXm-OpGsK9bmzFZcfm6laby7o","pdfSize":"2752127"}
