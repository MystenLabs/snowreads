The integration of a sparsity-inducing $L_1$ or elastic net penalty\noffers additional modeling flexibility. For the resulting challenging\noptimization problem, an algorithm based on Riemannian stochastic gradient\ndescent is developed, with the advantage of being scalable to high-dimensional\ndata, both in terms of many variables as well as observations. The resulting\nmethod is called SCRAMBLE (Sparse Cellwise Robust Algorithm for Manifold-based\nLearning and Estimation). Simulations reveal the superiority of this approach\nin comparison to established methods, both in the casewise and cellwise\nrobustness paradigms. Two applications from the field of tribology underline\nthe advantages of a cellwise robust and sparse PCA method.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
