These protocols make use\nof nondeterministic gates, enabling universal quantum computation. However, the\nsuggested solutions heavily use particle number resolving detectors (PNRDs),\nwhich are experimentally hard to realize and are usually biased in practice. We\ninvestigate the possibility of suppressing such errors caused by such\nphotodetector imperfections by adjusting the optimal beamsplitter and\nphaseshifter angles in the interferometer corresponding to nondeterministic\ngates. Moreover, we devise an optimization method for determining the adjusted\nangles, which may achieve higher output state fidelities while controlling the\nsuccess probabilities of the nondeterministic gates.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
