Recently, the imaginary\nunit $i$ has been experimentally proven to be indispensable for quantum\nmechanics. It motivates us to study the differences in detection power between\nreal and complex entanglement witnesses (EWs), and analyze the detection power\nof real EWs under local equivalences. We show that a real EW must detect a real\nentangled state, and conversely a real entangled state must be detected by a\nreal EW. We present a necessary and sufficient condition for the entangled\nstates detected by real EWs, and give a specific example which implies the\ndetection limitations of real EWs. Then, we conjecture that all entangled\nstates are detected by the EWs locally equivalent to real ones. We prove the\nconjecture for all states with non-positive partial transpose. We also derive a\nnecessary and sufficient condition for the complex PPT\n(positive-partial-transpose) entangled states detected by the EWs locally\nequivalent to real ones. We further prove the conjecture for a family of\ntwo-quqart PPT entangled states. Another way to figure out the conjecture is to\ncheck whether a counterexample exists. We propose an equivalent method to\nexamine the existence of a counterexample from a set-theoretic perspective, and\nprovide some supporting evidence of non-existence. Finally, we derive some\nresults on local projections of EWs with product projectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
