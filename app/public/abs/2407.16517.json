This purely\nelastic turbulence is well studied, but little is known about the transition to\nchaos. In 2D channel flow and parallel shear flow, traveling wave solutions\ninvolving coherent structures are present for sufficiently large fluid\nelasticity. We numerically study 2D periodic parallel shear flow in\nviscoelastic fluids and show that these traveling waves become oscillatory and\nundergo a series of period-doubling bifurcations en-route to chaos.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
