Their detection\nis crucial for many applications. In this article, we propose an unsupervised\nplug-and-play framework for the segmentation of curvilinear structures that\nfocuses on the preservation of their connectivity. This framework includes an\nalgorithm for generating realistic pairs of connected/disconnected curvilinear\nstructures and a reconnecting regularization operator that can be learned from\na synthetic dataset. Once learned, this regularization operator can be plugged\ninto a variational segmentation scheme and used to segment curvilinear\nstructure images without requiring annotations. We demonstrate the interest of\nour approach on the segmentation of vascular images both in 2D and 3D and\ncompare its results with classic unsupervised and deep learning-based approach.\nComparative evaluations against unsupervised classic and deep learning-based\nmethods highlight the superior performance of our approach, showcasing\nremarkable improvements in preserving the connectivity of curvilinear\nstructures (approximately 90% in 2D and 70% in 3D). We finally showcase the\ngood generalizability behavior of our approach on two different applications :\nroad cracks and porcine corneal cells segmentations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
