By means of the locally-constant field approximation\n(LCFA), we calculate the total particle yield for the corresponding\nfour-dimensional setup and compare it with the estimates obtained for\nsimplified low-dimensional scenarios. Within the domain where the LCFA is well\njustified, we examine a combination of two plane-wave pulses, a standing\nelectromagnetic wave, and a spatially uniform oscillating field and demonstrate\nthat at each of these three levels of approximation, one can accurately predict\nthe actual particle number by multiplying the results by properly chosen volume\nfactors depending on the field parameters. We present closed-form expressions\nfor these factors providing universal prescriptions for evaluating the particle\nyield. Our final formula connecting the spatially uniform setup with the\nfour-dimensional scenario has a relative uncertainty of the level of $5\\%$. The\nexplicit correspondences deduced in this study not only prove the relevance of\nthe approximate predictions, but also allow one to quickly estimate the number\nof pairs for various realistic scenarios without performing complicated\nnumerical calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jGhnBV5lrB-arQuJesEAn3EW08BwRU0FRewt_bGZlOQ","pdfSize":"619565"}
