Because of their non-thermal spectrum, gamma-ray\nbursts (GRBs) are prime particle acceleration sites and one of the candidate\nclasses for significant neutrino production. Exhaustive searches, based on\nstacking analysis of GRBs however could not establish the link between\nneutrinos and GRBs. Gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A had the highest time integrated\ngamma-ray flux of any detected GRB so far. The total fluence exceeds the sum of\nall Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) detected GRBs by a factor of two.\nBecause it happened relatively nearby, it is one of the most favorable events\nfor neutrino production from GRBs yet no neutrinos were detected. We calculate\nneutrino fluxes for this GRB in the TeV-PeV range using the most accurate,\ntime-resolved spectral data covering the brightest intervals. We place limits\non the physical parameters (Lorentz factor, baryon loading or emission radius)\nof the burst that are better by a factor of 2 compared to previous limits. The\nneutrino non-detection indicates a bulk Lorentz factor greater than 500 and\npossibly even 1000, consistent with other observations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
