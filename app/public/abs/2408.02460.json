This augmented logic is known as STL*. The\nprevious algorithms for STL* monitoring were intractable, and did not scale\nformulae with nested freeze variables. We present offline discrete-time\nmonitoring algorithms with an acceleration heuristic, both for Boolean\nmonitoring as well as for quantitative robustness monitoring. The acceleration\nheuristic operates over time intervals where subformulae hold true, rather than\nover the original trace sample-points. We present experimental validation of\nour algorithms, the results show that our algorithms can monitor over long\ntraces for formulae with two or three nested freeze variables.\n  Our work is the first work with monitoring algorithm implementations for STL*\nformulae with nested freeze variables.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3aBg7Eh4Ar2RE_v3-2GiazN3xB9jkLtzh_NONIuiYkg","pdfSize":"732321"}
