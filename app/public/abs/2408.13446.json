To study\nthese kind of maps, first, we find the condition of geodesic of a regular\ncurve.

Further, we find the curvature tensor\nfor this map.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NAyI5OVrxtOWPMeLvoJR3SUZtWAPeOf_MnkGrPTU_fg","pdfSize":"152237"}
