This research addresses the challenges inherent in space\nastrometry missions, focusing on focal plane calibration and telescope optical\ndistortion. We propose to assess the future feasibility of large-format\ndetectors (50 to 200 megapixels) in a controlled laboratory environment. The\naim is to improve the architecture of the focal plane while ensuring that\nspecifications are met. The use of field stars as metrological sources for\ncalibrating the optical distortion of the field may help to constrain telescope\nstability. The paper concludes with an attempt to confirm in the laboratory the\nperformance predicted by simulations. We will also address the possibility of\nusing such techniques with a dedicated instrument for the Habitable World\nObservatory.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
