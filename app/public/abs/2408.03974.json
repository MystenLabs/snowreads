For the highly investigated\nunipolar system, including only one ion-selective component, it has been shown\nthat above a supercritical voltage, an electroosmotic instability is triggered,\nleading to over-limiting currents. In contrast, the effects of this instability\non the current-voltage response of the second most common system of a bipolar\nsystem, including two oppositely charged permselective regions, have yet to be\nreported. Using simulations, we investigate the steady-state electrical\nresponse of bipolar systems as we vary the ratio of the charge within the two\noppositely charged regions. The responses are divided into those with an\ninternal symmetry related to the surface charge and those without. In contrast\nto the unipolar systems, bipolar systems with the internal symmetry do not\nexhibit overlimiting currents, and their steady-state response is identical to\nthe convectionless steady-state response. In contrast, the systems without the\ninternal symmetry exhibit much more complicated behavior. For positive\nvoltages, they have overlimiting currents, while for negative voltages, they do\nnot have over-limiting currents. Our findings contribute to a more profound\nunderstanding of the behavior of the current-voltage response in bipolar\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WbRApx8bRJIuyB1BeK_3GhijCsRe-g9Pn2xkCUR_vGY","pdfSize":"1137844"}
