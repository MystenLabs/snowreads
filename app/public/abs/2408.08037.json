Current approaches to analyze these experiments involve\nclustering or low-dimensional projections. Here we use the principle of maximum\nentropy to obtain a probabilistic description that captures the observed\npresence or absence of mRNAs from hundreds of genes in cells from the mammalian\nbrain. We construct the Ising model compatible with experimental means and\npairwise correlations, and validate it by showing that it gives good\npredictions for higher-order statistics. We notice that the probability\ndistribution of cell states has many local maxima. By labeling cell states\naccording to the associated maximum, we obtain a cell classification that\nagrees well with previous results that use traditional clustering techniques.\nOur results provide quantitative descriptions of gene expression statistics and\ninterpretable criteria for defining cell classes, supporting the hypothesis\nthat cell classes emerge from the collective interaction of gene expression\nlevels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
