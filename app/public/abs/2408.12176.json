Magnetic\nmaterials possessing superior performance characteristics are essential for\nfunctional applications. Experimental observations and ab-initio density\nfunctional theory calculations were used to design and investigate an MPCA,\nAlCuFeMn, based on the medium-entropy effect. This study examines the\nmicrostructure evolution, phase formation, and soft magnetic behaviour of a\ncast and annealed AlCuFeMn MPCA. We conducted first-principles\ndensity-functional-theory (DFT) calculations to explain a selected multi-phase\nalloy's atomic, electronic, and magnetic structures at absolute zero\ntemperature to understand the experimental findings better. We verified the\npredictions based on DFT by comparing them with the experimental observations.\nDespite the emphasis on equimolar compositions, the findings and conclusions of\nthis study can enhance phase prediction and magnetic characteristics in\nnon-equimolar alloys.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
