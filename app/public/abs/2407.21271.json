In this paper we give an internal characterization of these\ndomains, namely, that $G$ is horo-convex if and only if any two points can be\njoined inside $G$ by a $C^1$ curve composed with finitely many Jordan arcs with\nhyperbolic curvature in $(-2,2)$. We also give a lower bound for the hyperbolic\nmetric of horo-convex regions and some consequences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
