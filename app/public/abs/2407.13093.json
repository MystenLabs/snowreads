However, modern SIEMs face a big\nchallenge: they still cannot relieve analysts from the repetitive tasks\ninvolved in analyzing CTI (Cyber Threat Intelligence) reports written in\nnatural languages. This project aims to develop an AI agent to replace the\nlabor intensive repetitive tasks involved in analyzing CTI reports. The agent\nexploits the revolutionary capabilities of LLMs (e.g., GPT-4), but it does not\nrequire any human intervention.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
