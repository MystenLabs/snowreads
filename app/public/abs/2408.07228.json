Pinatubo, an acronym for Processing In Non-volatile memory\nArchiTecture for bUlk Bitwise Operations, facilitates the concurrent activation\nof two or more rows, enabling bitwise operations such as OR, AND, XOR, and NOT\non the activated rows. We implement Pinatubo using phase change memory (PCM)\nand compare our experimental results with the simulated data from the original\nPinatubo study. Our findings highlight a significant four-orders of magnitude\ndifference between resistance states, suggesting the robustness of the Pinatubo\narchitecture with PCM technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
