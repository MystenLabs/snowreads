Meanwhile, the k-space data\nacquisition process in MRI is time-consuming by PET-MRI systems. We aim to\naccelerate MRI and improve PET image quality. This paper proposed a novel joint\nreconstruction model by diffusion stochastic differential equations based on\nlearning the joint probability distribution of PET and MRI. Compare the results\nunderscore the qualitative and quantitative improvements our model brings to\nPET and MRI reconstruction, surpassing the current state-of-the-art\nmethodologies. Joint PET-MRI reconstruction is a challenge in the PET-MRI\nsystem. This studies focused on the relationship extends beyond edges. In this\nstudy, PET is generated from MRI by learning joint probability distribution as\nthe relationship.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
