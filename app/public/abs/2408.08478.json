These developments pose\nnew challenges for electronic intelligence (Elint) and electronic support\nmeasures (ESM), which need to identify and interpret sophisticated radar\nbehaviors. This paper introduces a Deep Multi-Intentional Inverse Reinforcement\nLearning (DMIIRL) method for the identification and inverse cognition of\ncognitive multi-function radars (CMFR). Traditional Inverse Reinforcement\nLearning (IRL) methods primarily target single reward functions, but the\ncomplexity of CMFRs necessitates multiple reward functions to fully encapsulate\ntheir behavior. To this end, we develop a method that integrates IRL with\nExpectation-Maximization (EM) to concurrently handle multiple reward functions,\noffering better trajectory clustering and reward function estimation.\nSimulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over\nbaseline approaches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
