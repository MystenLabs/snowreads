The\nproblem of synthesizing and optimizing such circuits has received a lot of\nattention in the quantum computing literature. This problem is especially\nchallenging for quantum devices with restricted connectivity, where two-qubit\ngates can only be placed between adjacent qubits. The state-of-the-art\nalgorithms for optimizing the number of CNOT gates are heuristic algorithms\nthat are based on Gaussian elimination and that use Steiner trees to connect\nbetween different subsets of qubits. In this article, we suggest considering\nweighted Steiner trees, and we present a simple low-cost heuristic to compute\nweights. The simulated evaluation shows that the suggested heuristic is almost\nalways beneficial and reduces the number of CNOT gates by up to 10%.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
