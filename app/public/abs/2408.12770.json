Rubin Observatory's Legacy\nSurvey of Space and Time (LSST) and the Nancy Grace Roman Telescope (Roman)\nwill detect hundreds of high-redshift (z > 7) quasars, but distinguishing them\nfrom the billions of other sources in these catalogues represents a significant\ndata analysis challenge. We address this problem by extending existing\nselection methods by using both i) Bayesian model comparison on measured fluxes\nand ii) a likelihood-based goodness-of-fit test on images, which are then\ncombined using an Fbeta statistic. The result is an automated, reproduceable\nand objective high-redshift quasar selection pipeline. We test this on both\nsimulations and real data from the cross-matched Sloan Digital Sky Survey\n(SDSS) and UKIRT Infrared Deep Sky Survey (UKIDSS) catalogues. On this\ncross-matched dataset we achieve an AUC score of up to 0.795 and an F3 score of\nup to 0.79, sufficient to be applied to the Euclid, LSST and Roman data when\navailable.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
