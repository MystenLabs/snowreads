We\nelaborate scenarios for charge exchange between ultracold charged atom-dimer\ncomplex (Rb$+$Rb$_2^+$ or Rb$^+$$+$Rb$_2$), predicting a strong selectivity on\nthe preparation of the initial state of the dimer. We also demonstrate that the\nJT couplings must drive the three-body recombination (TBR) of Rb$^+$, Rb, and\nRb at ultracold energies. Using the current analysis, we provide a consistent\npicture of the TBR experiments performed in ion-atom hybrid Rb samples\n\\cite{dieterle2020inelastic,harter2012single}. We also demonstrate the presence\nof JT coupling as a general phenomenon in the singly-charged homonuclear alkali\ntriatomic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"N7TN31ZAV7HXY482uOS14vpdrVO9YrhSiO1ygGnKpi0","pdfSize":"1951743"}
