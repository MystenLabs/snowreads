In this work, we\nexamine whether such agents can perform realistic and time-consuming tasks on\nthe web, e.g., monitoring real-estate markets or locating relevant nearby\nbusinesses. We introduce AssistantBench, a challenging new benchmark consisting\nof 214 realistic tasks that can be automatically evaluated, covering different\nscenarios and domains. We find that AssistantBench exposes the limitations of\ncurrent systems, including language models and retrieval-augmented language\nmodels, as no model reaches an accuracy of more than 25 points. While\nclosed-book LMs perform well, they exhibit low precision since they tend to\nhallucinate facts. State-of-the-art web agents reach a score of near zero.\nAdditionally, we introduce SeePlanAct (SPA), a new web agent that significantly\noutperforms previous agents, and an ensemble of SPA and closed-book models\nreaches the best overall performance. Moreover, we analyze failures of current\nsystems and highlight that web navigation remains a major challenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
