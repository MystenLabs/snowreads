Selection\nof bridge span has a significant impact on the total cost of bridge, and a\nreasonable selection of span can reduce engineering cost. Economic span of\nbridge is theoretically analyzed, and the theoretical solution formula of\neconomic span is deduced. Construction process of bridge simulation environment\nis described in detail, including observation space, action space and reward\nfunction of the environment. Agent is constructed, convolutional neural network\nis used to approximate Q function,{\\epsilon} greedy policy is used for action\nselection, and experience replay is used for training. The test verifies that\nthe agent can successfully learn optimal policy and realize economic span\nselection of bridge. This study provides a potential decision-making tool for\nbridge design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
