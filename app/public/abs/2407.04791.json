Using a shooting method of our design, we solve the corresponding\nscalar-tensor equilibrium equations for a Chandrasekhar equation of state,\nexploring various energy scales and couplings of the chameleon field to matter.\nWe find the chameleon field to be in a thick-shell configuration, identifying\nfor the first time in the literature a similarity relation for the radially\nnormalised scalar field gradient. Our analysis reveals that the chameleon\nmechanism significantly alters the internal pressure of white dwarfs, leading\nto a notable reduction in the stellar radii and masses and shifting the\nmass-radius curves below those predicted by Newtonian gravity. Finally, we\nderive parametric expressions from our results to expedite future analyses of\nwhite dwarfs in scalar-tensor theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
