In this paper, we present a novel data simulation pipeline that\nproduces diverse training data from a range of acoustic environments and\ncontent, and propose new training paradigms to improve quality of a general\nspeech separation model. Specifically, we first introduce AC-SIM, a data\nsimulation pipeline that incorporates broad variations in both content and\nacoustics. Then we integrate multiple training objectives into the permutation\ninvariant training (PIT) to enhance separation quality and generalization of\nthe trained model. Finally, we conduct comprehensive objective and human\nlistening experiments across separation architectures and benchmarks to\nvalidate our methods, demonstrating substantial improvement of generalization\non both non-homologous and real-world test sets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
