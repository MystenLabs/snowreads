By including the antenna's characteristic modal\nresponses (resonance frequencies and quality factors) in the cost function, the\nshape synthesis process is conducted without including excitation feeds.\nThrough the optimization procedure, a non-canonical dielectric body is formed\nfrom tetrahedral elements to support the required modal properties. As a\ndemonstration of the proposed design approach, two three-mode MIMO DRAs are\nsynthesized from both a rectangular and a cylindrical volume to operate at 2.45\nGHz. The synthesized MIMO DRA's complex shape (based on rectangle) is then\nfabricated using Nanoparticle jetted zirconia. A combination of probe and slot\nfeeds are employed to excite the desired modes. Due to the orthogonality of the\ncharacteristic modes and the careful design of the feeding network, isolation\n$>20$ dB is achieved between all ports.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
