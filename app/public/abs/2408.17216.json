This study explores\nthe use of federated learning to overcome these barriers, focusing on perinatal\nhealth. We trained a fetal plane classifier using perinatal data from five\nAfrican countries: Algeria, Ghana, Egypt, Malawi, and Uganda, along with data\nfrom Spanish hospitals. To incorporate the lack of computational resources in\nthe analysis, we considered a heterogeneous set of devices, including a\nRaspberry Pi and several laptops, for model training. We demonstrate\ncomparative performance between a centralized and a federated model, despite\nthe compute limitations, and a significant improvement in model\ngeneralizability when compared to models trained only locally. These results\nshow the potential for a future implementation at a large scale of a federated\nlearning platform to bridge the accessibility gap and improve model\ngeneralizability with very little requirements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kE-xR6rTtx_yM0MeI7wWrlTFgGa5QYSRvVVTpTQs0nA","pdfSize":"611366"}
