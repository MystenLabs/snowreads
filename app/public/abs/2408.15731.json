By the method\nof divergence reconstruction operators, the formulation is valid for all shear\nstress exponents $p > \\tfrac{2d}{d+2}$. The Dirichlet boundary condition is\nimposed strongly, using any discretization of the boundary data which converges\nat a sufficient rate. $\\textit{A priori}$ error estimates for velocity vector\nfield and kinematic pressure are derived and numerical experiments are\nconducted. These confirm the quasi-optimality of the $\\textit{a priori}$ error\nestimate for the velocity vector field. The $\\textit{a priori}$ error estimates\nfor the kinematic pressure are quasi-optimal if $p \\leq 2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
