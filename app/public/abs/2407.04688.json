This paper introduces an innovative method for\ncollecting non-overlapping video data in weaving zones, enabling the generation\nof quantitative insights into lane-specific weaving behaviors. Our experimental\nresults confirm the efficacy of this approach, delivering critical data that\ncan assist transportation authorities in enhancing traffic control and roadway\ninfrastructure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
