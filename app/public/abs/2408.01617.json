However, many\npopular gradient-based methods for Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation from\nsuch posterior distributions use Hamiltonian Monte Carlo and accordingly\nrequire conditions on the differentiability of the unnormalized posterior\ndistribution that do not hold when $q \\leq 1$ (Plummer, 2023). This is\nlimiting; the setting where $q \\leq 1$ includes widely used sparsity inducing\npenalized regression models and heavy tailed robust regression models. In the\nspecial case where $q = 1$, a latent variable representation that facilitates\nsimulation from such a posterior distribution is well known. However, the\nsetting where $q < 1$ has not been treated as thoroughly. In this note, we\nreview the availability of a latent variable representation described in\nDevroye (2009), show how it can be used to simulate from such posterior\ndistributions when $0 < q < 2$, and demonstrate its utility in the context of\nestimating the parameters of a Bayesian penalized regression model.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
