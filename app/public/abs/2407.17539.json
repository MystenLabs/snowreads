Classical sPOD methods typically require an a priori knowledge of the\ntransport operators to determine the co-moving fields. However, in many\nreal-life problems, such knowledge is difficult or even impossible to obtain,\nlimiting the applicability and benefits of the sPOD. To address this issue, our\napproach estimates both the transport and co-moving fields simultaneously using\nneural networks. This is achieved by training two sub-networks dedicated to\nlearning the transports and the co-moving fields, respectively. Applications to\nsynthetic data and a wildland fire model illustrate the capabilities and\nefficiency of this neural sPOD approach, demonstrating its ability to separate\nthe different fields effectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
