Using a novel data, I develop and construct a\nstructural model and find that the cartels shifted shipping prices by 20-50\\%\nand encouraged firms' entry and investment. In the counterfactual, I find that\ncartels would increase producer surplus while slightly decreasing consumer\nsurplus, then may increase social welfare by encouraging firms' entry and\nshipbuilding investment. This would validate industry policies controlling\nprices and quantities in the early stage of the new industry, which may not be\nalways harmful. Investigating hypothetical allocation rules supporting large or\nsmall firms, I find that the actual rule based on tonnage shares is the best to\nmaximize social welfare.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oz00ofauVOzxQOUM9a5HmTBwmH4AGW-_enmu4TQoX6E","pdfSize":"2916533"}
