The generator can be used to study neutrino-nucleon interactions at\n(ultra) high energies, and is relevant for a range of fixed-target collider\nexperiments and large-volume neutrino detectors, investigating atmospheric and\nastrophysical neutrinos. The matching with multi-purpose event generators such\nas PYTHIA 8 is performed with the POWHEG method, and accounts for parton\nshowering and non-perturbative effects such as hadronization. This makes it\npossible to investigate higher-order perturbative corrections to realistic\nobservables, such as the distribution of charged particles. To illustrate the\ncapabilities of the code we provide predictions for several differential\ndistributions in fixed-target collisions for neutrino energies up to 1 PeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
