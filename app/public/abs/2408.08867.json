Traditional methods like LASSO often struggle with\nthe nonlinearities and multicollinearities in scRNA-seq data due to complex\ngene expression and extensive gene interactions. Quantum annealing, a form of\nquantum computing, offers a promising solution. In this study, we apply quantum\nannealing-empowered quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) for\nfeature selection in scRNA-seq data. Using data from a human cell\ndifferentiation system, we show that QUBO identifies genes with nonlinear\nexpression patterns related to differentiation time, many of which play roles\nin the differentiation process. In contrast, LASSO tends to select genes with\nmore linear expression changes. Our findings suggest that the QUBO method,\npowered by quantum annealing, can reveal complex gene expression patterns that\ntraditional methods might overlook, enhancing scRNA-seq data analysis and\ninterpretation.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pcK9152syBymLI1HoHGEz4r_ukbRavPYltchheE7Wdk","pdfSize":"2112960"}
