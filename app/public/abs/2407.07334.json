According to the deconfined criticality scenario, this\ntransition can be direct and continuous like the well-studied $S=1/2$ case. To\nstudy the global phase diagram, we work with four multi-spin couplings with\nfull rotational symmetry, that are free of the sign-problem of quantum Monte\nCarlo. Exploring the phase diagram with quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we\nfind that the phase transition between N\\'eel and valence-bond solid is\nstrongly first-order in the parts of the phase diagram that we have accessed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
