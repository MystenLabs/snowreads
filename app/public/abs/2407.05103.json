The only large\npowered mirror is spherical, the resulting spherical aberration is corrected\nfor each target separately, giving exceptional image quality. The telescope is\na transit design, but still allows all-sky coverage. Three simultaneous modes\nare proposed: (a) natural seeing multi-object spectroscopy with 12m aperture\nover 3dg FoV with ~25,000 targets; (b) multi-object AO with 12m aperture over\n3dg FoV with ~100 AO-corrected Integral Field Units each with 4 arcsec FoV; (c)\nground layer AO-corrected integral field spectroscopy with 15m aperture and 13\narcmin FoV. Such a telescope would be uniquely powerful for large-area\nfollow-up of imaging surveys; in each mode, the AOmega and survey speed exceed\nall existing facilities combined. The expected cost of this design is\nrelatively modest, much closer to $500M than $1000M.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
