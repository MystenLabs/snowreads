As applications, we\nshow that the Nygaard-completion of the site-theoretic log prismatic cohomology\ncoincides with the definition arising from log ${\\rm TC}$, and we establish a\nlog version of the ${\\rm TC}$-variant of the Beilinson fiber square of\nAntieau--Mathew--Morrow--Nikolaus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
