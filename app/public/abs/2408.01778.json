The\nconical spacetime around the cosmic string causes the frozen-in magnetic field\nto deform due to the fluid flow. We find that the overdensity in the wake\nregion amplifies the magnetic field. This amplification depends on the\ndirection and the lengthscale of the magnetic perturbations. Alfvens theorem of\nflux conservation explains this result. However, our study also shows that the\nmagnetic field can decay depending on the perturbation lengthscale, due to the\nbreakdown of Alfvens theorem at a certain lengthscale. This lengthscale is the\ngyroradius of the charged particles in the plasma. Our findings are significant\nfor understanding magnetic reconnection in cosmic string wakes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ebLCIDFckboajmjZmARFXzMUoz6bALyKtItJA4RdTAc","pdfSize":"746402"}
