Despite the advancements in speech\nrecognition, the task of text-based speaker identification (SpeakerID) has\nreceived limited attention, lacking large-scale, diverse datasets for effective\nmodel training. Addressing these gaps, we present a novel, large-scale dataset\nderived from the MediaSum corpus, encompassing transcripts from a wide range of\nmedia sources. We propose novel transformer-based models tailored for\nSpeakerID, leveraging contextual cues within dialogues to accurately attribute\nspeaker names. Through extensive experiments, our best model achieves a great\nprecision of 80.3\\%, setting a new benchmark for SpeakerID.
