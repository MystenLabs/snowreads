We investigate the maximum efficiency of two colliding particles in\nfour and six dimensions. The efficiency of collision for two particles near the\nfour-dimensional Kerr black holes is 130 %. We show that the efficiency\nincreases to 145 % for collision in six dimensions. We also show that the\nregion for the polar angle in which the particle can reach the high energy is\nlarger when the dimension of space-time increases.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
