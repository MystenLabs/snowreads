We\nconstruct fundamental market data combined with macroeconomic data and\ntechnical indicators to capture the broader behavior of the stock market. Our\napproach shows significant higher performance than state-of-the-art methods\nsuch as linear regression, decision trees, and neural network architectures\nincluding long short-term memory. It captures well the market's high volatility\nand nonlinear behaviors despite limited data, demonstrating great potential for\nreal-time, parallel, multi-dimensional data processing and predictions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GIT4nLDKJuQJKG4137FO6f2N4Q9QTj-K6GIgtH-WquY","pdfSize":"2238460","txDigest":"F1BrrMpppGGerZ2RYF5rGa8UaBridgPUWbQRbq17LEcJ","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
