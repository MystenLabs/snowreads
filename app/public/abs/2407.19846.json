The\naim is to reveal the manifestation of the cluster structure of $^{9}$Be.\nTheoretical analysis of the contributions of one-step and two-step neutron\ntransfer mechanisms is performed using the distorted wave Born approximation\nmethod with the Fresco code. Good agreement between the calculations and the\nexperimental data was obtained for the channels of elastic scattering\n$^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{6}$Li)$^{9}$Be, neutron\n$^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Li)$^{8}$Be and proton transfer\n$^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{7}$Be)$^{8}$Li, as well as the transfer of two neutrons\n$^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{8}$Li)$^{7}$Be. It is shown that the dineutron cluster\ntransfer mechanism makes a dominant contribution to the\n$^{9}$Be($^{6}$Li,$^{8}$Li)$^{7}$Be reaction channel at forward angles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
