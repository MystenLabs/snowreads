We find that quantum corrections to the classical horizon\nradius become significant if the matter core has a size comparable to the\nCompton length of the constituents and the system is indeed a black hole with\nprobability very close to one unless the core radius is close to the\n(classical) gravitational radius.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2U0JhPpB2DxyOIHZ5zeZ2ZZvmLhN52h2DDktFA_02XI","pdfSize":"458885"}
