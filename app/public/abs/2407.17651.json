A skew-symmetric matrix\nflips signs of symmetric pairs in a symmetric matrix. Our work, Parallel 3-Way\nBanded Skew-Symmetric Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication, equally improves\nparallel symmetric SpMV kernels with a different perspective than the common\nliterature trends, by manipulating the form of matrix in a preprocessing step\nto accelerate the repeated computations of iterative solvers. We effectively\nuse Reverse Cuthill-McKee (RCM) reordering algorithm to transform a sparse\nskew-symmetrix matrix into a band matrix, then efficiently parallelize it by\nsplitting the band structure into 3 different parts by considering its local\nsparsity. Our proposed method with RCM is novel in the sense that it is the\nfirst implementation of parallel skew-symmetric SpMV kernels. Our enhancements\nin SpMV and findings are valuable with significant strong scalings of up to 19x\nover the serial compressed SpMV implementation. We overperform a\nheuristic-based graph-coloring approach with synchronization phases in\nimplementing parallel symmetric SpMVs. Our approach also naturally applies to\nparallel sparse symmetric SpMVs, that can inspire widespread SpMV solutions to\nadapt presented optimizations in this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UA3WfuBOM3qJBrHFddrgQvxhiRw0NcTZVUzHd1nn4R4","pdfSize":"2128035"}
