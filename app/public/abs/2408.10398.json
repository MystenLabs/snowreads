We report the\napplication of the NME in alkali atomic vapors for projective measurement of\nmedium-frequency (MF) magnetic fields in a circular basis with an extinction\nratio up to 500:1 . Utilizing a longitudinal static magnetic field, we\ndemonstrate a high-sensitivity technique for characterizing the ellipticity of\nradio-frequency (RF) magnetic fields which can in turn be used for phase\nsensitive detection in mid frequency communication. Additionally, we\ndemonstrate the conversion of binary phase shift keyed RF magnetic fields into\namplitude modulation of generated optical fields, a versatile receiver for\ncommunication using the medium frequency band.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
