In this paper, we\nestablish a sufficient condition for mixing based on a quantum Markov-Dobrushin\ninequality. We prove that if the Markov-Dobrushin constant of a quantum channel\nexceeds zero, it exhibits exponential mixing behavior. We explore limitations\nof some quantum channels, demonstrating that unistochastic channels are not\nmixing. Additionally, we analyze ergodicity of a class of mixed-unitary\nchannels associated with finite groups of unitary operators. Finally, we apply\nour results to the qubit depolarizing channel.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
