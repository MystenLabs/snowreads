Therefore,\ntime-dependent model order reduction techniques such as the dynamical low-rank\napproximation are desirable. In this paper we propose a dynamical low-rank\nalgorithm for the kinetic CME using binary tree tensor networks. The\ndimensionality of the problem is reduced in this approach by hierarchically\ndividing the reaction network into partitions. Only reactions that cross\npartitions are subject to an approximation error. We demonstrate by two\nnumerical examples (a 5-dimensional lambda phage model and a 20-dimensional\nreaction cascade) that the proposed method drastically reduces memory\nconsumption and shows improved computational performance and better accuracy\ncompared to a Monte Carlo method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
