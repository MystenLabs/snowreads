We show that these results also hold for graphs\nwith countably many finite connected components, as long as every connected\ncomponent appears only finitely often (up to isomorphism). The proofs are via\nmonoid algebras and generalized power series rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
