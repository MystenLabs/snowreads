For multivariate data corrupted with outliers, it is\ngenerally hard to estimate the true low dimensional manifold from corrupted\ndata. The objective of the proposed framework is to find a robust estimate of\nthe low dimensional space of data to reliably perform regression. The\neffectiveness of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated experimentally for\nsimultaneous regression and dimensionality reduction in the presence of\noutliers in data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
