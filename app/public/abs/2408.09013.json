However, existing algorithms\nmay converge to poor local minima, or to one of several minima with similar\nobjective value but differing feature parametrizations. Additionally, the\nperformance of NMF greatly depends on the number of components, but choosing\nthe optimal count remains a challenge. Here we show that some of these\nweaknesses may be mitigated by performing NMF in a higher-dimensional feature\nspace and then iteratively combining components with an analytically-solvable\npairwise merge strategy. Experimental results demonstrate our method helps NMF\nachieve better local optima and greater consistency of the solutions. Iterative\nmerging also provides an efficient and informative framework for choosing the\nnumber of components. Surprisingly, despite these extra steps, our approach\noften improves computational performance by reducing the occurrence of\n``convergence stalling'' near saddle points. This can be recommended as a\npreferred approach for most applications of NMF.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
