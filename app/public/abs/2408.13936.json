This paper presents OpenNav, a zero-shot 3D object\ndetection pipeline based on RGB-D images for smart wheelchairs. Our pipeline\nintegrates an open-vocabulary 2D object detector with a mask generator for\nsemantic segmentation, followed by depth isolation and point cloud construction\nto create 3D bounding boxes. The smart wheelchair exploits these 3D bounding\nboxes to identify potential targets and navigate safely. We demonstrate\nOpenNav's performance through experiments on the Replica dataset and we report\npreliminary results with a real wheelchair. OpenNav improves state-of-the-art\nsignificantly on the Replica dataset at mAP25 (+9pts) and mAP50 (+5pts) with\nmarginal improvement at mAP.
