The use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)\nand deep operator networks (DeepONets) have emerged as two of the most useful\napproaches in approximating differential equation solutions using machine\nlearning. Here, we propose PinnDE, an open-source python library for solving\ndifferential equations with both PINNs and DeepONets. We give a brief review of\nboth PINNs and DeepONets, introduce PinnDE along with the structure and usage\nof the package, and present worked examples to show PinnDE's effectiveness in\napproximating solutions with both PINNs and DeepONets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
