In\nthis paper, we study the $B_2$ index for a prominent class of phylogenetic\nnetworks: galled trees. We show that the $B_2$ index of a uniform leaf-labeled\ngalled tree converges in distribution as the network becomes large. We\ncharacterize the corresponding limiting distribution, and show that its\nexpected value is 2.707911858984... This is the first time that a balance index\nhas been studied to this level of detail for a random phylogenetic network.\n  One specificity of this work is that we use two different and independent\napproaches, each with its advantages: analytic combinatorics, and local limits.\nThe analytic combinatorics approach is more direct, as it relies on standard\ntools; but it involves slightly more complex calculations. Because it has not\npreviously been used to study such questions, the local limit approach requires\ndeveloping an extensive framework beforehand; however, this framework is\ninteresting in itself and can be used to tackle other similar problems.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
