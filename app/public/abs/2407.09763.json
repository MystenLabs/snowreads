We test our method on over 40 reactions across 3\nbenchmark datasets covering a diverse set of chemical reactions. Our results\nshow that incorporation of internal coordinates interpolation improves the\ncomputational efficiency of the FSM by enabling the use of larger interpolation\nstep sizes and fewer optimization steps per cycle while maintaining 100%\nsuccess rate on benchmark chemical reaction test cases including systems where\nprevious attempts based on linear synchronous transit interpolation have\nfailed. We provide an open-source Python implementation of the FSM, in addition\nto the reactant, product, transition state structures of all reactions studied.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
