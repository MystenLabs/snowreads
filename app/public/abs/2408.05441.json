The construction is in terms of\nthe inverse Kasteleyn matrix and relies only on symmetries of the graph. Using\nknown formulas for the inverse Kasteleyn matrix, we derive exact contour\nintegral formulas for these embeddings and their origami maps. Through steepest\ndescent analysis, we establish scaling limits, proving convergence of origami\nmaps to a maximal surface in the Minkowski space $\\mathbb{R}^{2,1}$, and we\nverify structural rigidity conditions, leading to a new proof of convergence of\nheight fluctuations to the Gaussian free field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
