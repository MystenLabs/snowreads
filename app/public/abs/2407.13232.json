Key to the\nsafety of CDPs is the money supply architecture that enables issued debt to\nmaintain its value. In traditional markets, and with respect to the United\nStates Dollar system, interest rates are set by the Federal Reserve in an\nattempt to influence the effects of excessive inflation. DeFi enables a more\ntransparent approach that typically relies on interest rates or other debt\nrecovery mechanisms being directly informed by asset price. This research\ninvestigates contemporary DeFi money supply and debt management strategies and\ntheir limitations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a time-weighted approach\nto interest rate management that implements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative\ncontrol system to constantly adapt to market activities and protect the value\nof issued currency, while addressing observed limitations.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
