The experimental data of the $S(E)$ strength functions\nobtained from $(^{3}\\mathrm{He}, t)$ reactions, as well as the $S(E)$ strength\nfunctions calculated in the microscopic theory of finite fermi-systems, are\nanalyzed. The resonance structure of the strength function $S(E)$ is examined,\nand the Gamow-Teller and Pygmy resonances are identified. The resonance\nstructure of the strength function $S(E)$ is vital for the calculation and\nanalysis of the process of neutrino capture by atomic nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WXbAc6OlBSn5zEEepHUHN1lv77TLGtX8noF4JBPTebY","pdfSize":"525492"}
