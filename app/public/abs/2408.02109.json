We study banded operators with\nkernels that decay rapidly off-the-diagonal and $L^q$-sparse operators with an\nunordered sparsity pattern. For these classes of operators, we find the minimax\noptimal rate of estimation in operator norm, identifying the fundamental\ndimension-free quantities that determine the sample complexity. In addition, we\nprove that tapering and thresholding estimators attain the optimal rate. The\nproof of the upper bound for tapering estimators requires novel techniques to\ncircumvent the issue that discretization of a banded operator does not result,\nin general, in a banded covariance matrix. To derive lower bounds for banded\nand $L^q$-sparse classes, we introduce a general framework to lift theory from\nhigh-dimensional matrix estimation to the operator setting. Our work\ncontributes to the growing literature on operator estimation and learning,\nbuilding on ideas from high-dimensional statistics while also addressing new\nchallenges that emerge in infinite dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bEFRdMDBdhxCNuMCCRKfLiKzvTTy0ZAk_flEBu-M95I","pdfSize":"775528","txDigest":"JCCq9oJ26igpPSsjvHTKtDixmfg1Nts13VTVDUzARbKm","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
