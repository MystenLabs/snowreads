We\ninvestigate the effect of variation of squeeze parameter, field intensity, and\ncoupling strength parameter, on the dynamics of the Wigner-Yanase skew\ninformation. We observe that time-evolution of the Wigner-Yanase skew\ninformation records mixed state values for all variations of squeeze parameter,\nfield intensity and coupling strength parameter, congruent with squeezing\neffects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
