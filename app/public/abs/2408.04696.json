As appropriate for a quantum system, we start from the density\nmatrix which encodes the full information regarding the possible measurements\nwe could make of DM and their fluctuations. Following fundamental results in\nquantum optics, we argue that for DM it is most likely that the density matrix\ntakes the explicitly mixed form of a Gaussian over the basis of coherent\nstates. Deviations from this would generate non-Gaussian fluctuations in DM\nobservables, allowing a direct probe of the quantum state of DM. Our quantum\noptics inspired approach allows us to rigorously define and interpret various\nquantities that are often only described heuristically, such as the coherence\ntime or length. The formalism further provides a continuous description of DM\nthrough the wave-particle transition, which we exploit to study how density\nfluctuations over various physical scales evolve between the two limits and to\nreveal the unique behavior of DM near the boundary of the wave and particle\ndescriptions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
