The predictors in turn allow to\nformulate completely data-driven representations of the velocity form. The\nkernel-based formulation that we derive, inherently respects the structured\nquasi-linear and specific time-dependent relationship of the velocity form.\nThis results in an efficient multi-step predictor for the velocity form and\nhence for nonlinear systems. Moreover, by using the velocity form, our methods\nopen the door for data-driven behavioral analysis and control of nonlinear\nsystems with global stability and performance guarantees.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
