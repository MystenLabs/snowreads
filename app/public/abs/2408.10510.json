Accurate analytical prediction of RTI growth is of great\nsignificance to the success of ICF schemes. In this paper, we study the effects\nof mass diffusion and exponential density distribution on RTI under a large\ngravity, by solving the Rayleigh equation with a linear approximation to the\ndensity distribution of the mixing layer. While both effects tend to dampen the\ninstability growth, mass diffusion dominates the damping of perturbations of\nlarger wavenumber and exponential density distribution dominates those of\nsmaller wavenumber, resulting in a non-monotonicity of the density suppression\nfactor of the instability growth rate over perturbation wavenumbers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"odraWx2pIXRFH4DNkxrpY4Vs-x2HF-vJpYCtNX5X7CI","pdfSize":"846066"}
