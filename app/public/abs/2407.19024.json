In passive optical networks\nwithout wavelength conversion, we need to assign a full route between origin\nand destination with the same wavelength from a finite set. This problem is\ncomputationally intensive and the common solution in classical optical networks\nis using heuristics. We adapt these heuristics to hybrid quantum networks where\nthe quantum channel can share some of the optical links with classical\nchannels. In this quantum-classical multiplexing, nonlinear effects can become\nthe limiting factor in the range of the network. The signal in the classical\nchannels can be subject to Raman Scattering or Four-Wave-Mixing and produce\nlight in the quantum channels. While these effects are not efficient, even a\nsingle photon can ruin the quantum channel. We propose heuristics for the\nrouting and wavelength assignment problem for hybrid quantum-classical networks\nwith power control for the classical channels. By keeping the transmitted power\nto its bare functional minimum, we can reduce the interference to the quantum\nchannels. We study their efficiency under different scenarios.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
