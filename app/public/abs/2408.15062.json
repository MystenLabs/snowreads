We\npropose a multi-channel machine learning based physical-constrained nonlocal\n(CPN) KEDF and implement it within the ABACUS package. The CPN KEDF extends the\npreviously proposed MPN KEDF [Phys. Rev. B 109, 115135 (2024)] to semiconductor\nsystems by integrating information collected from multiple channels, with each\nchannel features specific length scale in real space. The CPN KEDF is\nsystematically tested on semiconductors, including silicon and binary\nsemiconductors. Our findings indicate that the multi-channel architecture is\nbeneficial for machine-learning-based models in capturing the characteristics\nof semiconductors, particularly in handling covalent bonds. In particular, the\nCPN5 KEDF, which utilizes five channels, demonstrates excellent accuracy across\nall tested systems. These results shed new light on designing transferable\nmachine-learning-based KEDF for semiconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G5YgihmNpCm6E4SVAGPCpsHE35D5_U7BcJMfKy6Elhs","pdfSize":"2788700"}
