Here,\nwe show that, in the presence of free carriers, an additional nonradiative\ndecay channel opens for excitons in TMDC monolayers. Although the usual Auger\ndecay channel is suppressed at low doping levels by the simultaneous momentum\nand energy conservation laws, exciton-phonon coupling relaxes this suppression.\nBy solving a Bethe-Salpeter Equation, we calculate the phonon-assisted Auger\ndecay rates in four typical TMDCs as a function of doping, temperature, and\ndielectric environment. We find that even for a relatively low doping of\n10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$, the nonradiative lifetime ranges from 16 ps to 165 ps in\ndifferent TMDCs, offering competition to the radiative decay channel.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
