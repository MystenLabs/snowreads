While evidence for\nhydrodynamic-like transport is reported in a variety of two-dimensional\nmaterials, precise quantitative measurement of the core parameter, electron\nviscosity, remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that\nmagnetoresistance in Corbino-shaped graphene devices offers a simultaneous\nOhmmeter/viscosometer, allowing us to disentangle the individual Ohmic and\nviscous contributions to the transport response, even in the mixed flow regime.\nMost surprising, we find that in both monolayer and bilayer graphene, the\neffective electron-electron scattering rate scales linearly with temperature,\nat odds with the expected $T$-squared dependence expected from conventional\nFermi liquid theory, but consistent with a recently identified tomographic flow\nregime, which was theoretically conjectured to be generic for two-dimensional\ncharged fluids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
