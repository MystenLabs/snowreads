In this\npaper, we investigate the randomness of energy and waiting time using four data\nsamples from three extremely active repeating FRBs observed by the\nFive-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). We report the\ndeviation from complete randomness of the burst activity using three\nstatistics, i.e., Hurst exponent, Pincus index and non-Gaussian probability\ndensity distribution of fluctuations. First, the Hurst exponent greater than\n0.5 reveals that there is long-term memory in the time series of energy and\nwaiting time. Second, the deviation of the Pincus index from 1.0 manifests that\nthe time series is not completely random. Finally, the fluctuations of energy\nand waiting time follow the scale-invariant $q$-Gaussian distribution. All\nthese statistical properties imply that, although the time series of repeating\nFRBs seems to be irregular, they are not completely random, similar to the\nfeatures of self-organized criticality.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
