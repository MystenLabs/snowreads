The method\ncomplements real measurements with virtual observations derived from the\nphysical model. In particular, weighted residuals are employed as probes to the\ngoverning PDE in order to formulate and solve a Bayesian inverse problem\nwithout ever formulating nor solving a forward model. The formulation treats\nthe state variables of the physical model as latent variables, inferred using\nStochastic Variational Inference (SVI), along with the usual unknowns. The\napproximate posterior employed uses neural networks to approximate the inverse\nmapping from state variables to the unknowns. We illustrate the proposed method\nin a biomedical setting where we infer spatially varying material properties\nfrom noisy tissue deformation data. We demonstrate that WNVI is not only as\naccurate and more efficient than traditional methods that rely on repeatedly\nsolving the (non)linear forward problem as a black-box, but it can also handle\nill-posed forward problems (e.g., with insufficient boundary conditions).\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
