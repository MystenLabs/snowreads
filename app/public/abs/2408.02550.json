The\nproblem remains co-NEXPTIME-hard if all variables are binary. The reduction\ngoes from a variant of the tiling problem and is based on a prior construction\nused by Cheuk Ting Li to show the undecidability of a related problem where the\ncardinality of some variables remains unbounded. The CI implication problem\nwith bounded cardinalities is known to be in EXPSPACE, as its negation can be\nstated as an existential first-order logic formula over the reals of size\nexponential with regard to the size of the input.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"uLtaIwjgoTPho48YeZ-drgpe4trLwh8k6ALYU5DSKu0","pdfSize":"674888"}
