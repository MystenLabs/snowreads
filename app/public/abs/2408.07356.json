It is assumed that the agents can cross the fixed boundary $x=0$,\nbut they will die immediately if they do it, which implies that the area\n$(-\\infty,0)$ is a hostile environment for the agents. We first show that this\nmodel is well posed, then prove that the longtime behaviors are governed by a\nspreading-vanishing dichotomy and finally give some criteria determining\nspreading and vanishing. Particularly, we obtain the asymptotical behaviors of\nthe principal eigenvalue of a cooperative system with nonlocal diffusions\nwithout assuming the related nonlocal operator is self-adjoint, and the steady\nstate problem of such cooperative system on half space $[0,\\infty)$ is studied\nin detail.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
