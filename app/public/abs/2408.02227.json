The system describes the interaction of the\nchemotherapeutic drug and the normal, tumor and immune cells. We first\nestablish well-posedness for the nonlinear reaction-diffusion system, then\ninvestigate the long-time behavior of solutions. Particularly, it is shown that\nthe cancer cells will be eliminated assuming that its reproduction rate is\nsufficiently small in a short time period in each treatment interval. The\nanalysis is then essentially exploited to study an optimal drug injection rate\nproblem during a chemotherapeutic drug treatment for tumor cells, which is\nformulated as an optimal boundary control problem with constraints. For this,\nwe show that the existence of an optimal drug injection rate through the\nboundary, and derive the first-order optimality condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
