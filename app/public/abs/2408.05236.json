Also, we give the\ngeneral expression of parametrizations of the canal hypersurfaces generated by\nnon-null curves with parallel frame in $E_{1}^{4}$ and we obtain some important\ngeometric invariants and characterizations for them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jxTQgm2rv_I4BWTtJfcXcrB1jgPDBLlwmCBi2cNHTKs","pdfSize":"217610"}
