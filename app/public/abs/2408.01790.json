It is found that the dynamics bears similarities to the breakup\nof free liquid bridges in the viscous regime. Nevertheless, the dynamics is\nsignificantly influenced by the wettability of the solid substrate. Therefore,\nit is essential to take into account the interaction between the solid and the\nliquid, especially at the three-phase contact line. It is shown that when the\nbreakup velocity is low and the solid surface is hydrophobic, the dominant\nchannel of energy dissipation is likely due to thermally activated jumping of\nmolecules, as described by the Molecular Kinetic Theory. Nevertheless, the\nviscous dissipation in the bulk due to axial flow along the bridge can be of\nimportance for long bridges. In view of this, a scaling relation for the time\ndependence of the minimum width of the liquid bridge is derived. For high\nviscosities, the scaling relation captures the time evolution of the minimum\nwidth very well. Furthermore, it is found that external geometrical constraints\nalter the dynamic behavior of low and high viscosity liquid bridges in a\ndifferent fashion. This discrepancy is explained by considering the dominant\nforces in each regime. Lastly, the morphology of the satellite droplets\ndeposited on the surface is qualitatively compared to that of free liquid\nbridges.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
