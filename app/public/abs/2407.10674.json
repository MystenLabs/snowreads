The symposium presents\nfour different aspects of physics teaching and learning, but all of them have\nresearch-based problem analysis in common. The problems analysed cover\ndifferent aspects of the physics teaching-learning process. Innovative aspects\nsuch as the effect on learning of the integration of engineering projects in\nthe science teaching process, the influence on the learning process of\nconceptions about science and attitudes, and aspects related to teaching\ncontents and students' learning difficulties. Its conclusions are not merely\nintuitive proposals based on teaching experience, but on a careful planning of\ndata collection, analysis of results and empirical basis\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
