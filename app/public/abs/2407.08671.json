Liu and X. Tan (2023), we would like to\nmeasure how the magnetic effect appears in the heat trace formula associated\nwith the magnetic Laplacian and the magnetic Dirichlet-to-Neumann operator. We\npropose to the reader an overview of magnetic heat trace formulas through\nexplicit examples. On the way we obtain new formulas and in particular we\ncalculate explicitely some non local terms and logarithmic terms appearing in\nthe Steklov heat trace asymptotics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
