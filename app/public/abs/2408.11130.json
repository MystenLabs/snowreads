In particular, we obtain\npointwise bounds for the matrix coefficients of the Gabor wave packet\ndecomposition of the generated semigroup $e^{tq^{\\mathrm{w}}}$ if $\\mathrm{Re}\n(q) \\le 0$ and the companion singular space associated is trivial, with\nexplicit and sharp exponential time decay rate. This result is then leveraged\nto achieve a comprehensive analysis of the phase regularity of\n$e^{tq^{\\mathrm{w}}}$ with $\\mathrm{Re} (q) \\le 0$, hence extending the $L^2$\nanalysis of quadratic semigroups initiated by Hitrik and Pravda-Starov to\ngeneral modulation spaces $M^p(\\mathbb{R}^d)$, $1 \\le p \\le \\infty$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
