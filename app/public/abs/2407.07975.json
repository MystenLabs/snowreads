The main result proved here is that for any for any $w \\in W$\nand reduced expression of $w$ there is an Elnitsky tiling of a $2m$-polygon,\nwhere $m = [W : W_J]$. The proof is constructive and draws together the work on\nE-embedding in \\cite{nicolaidesrowley1} and the deletion order in\n\\cite{nicolaidesrowley3}. Computer programs which produce such tilings may be\ndownloaded from \\cite{github} and here we also present examples of the tilings\nfor, among other Coxeter groups, the exceptional Coxeter group $\\mathrm{E}_8$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qvl5sgUcbH8q4QiQ-pfq9WEIeygwDknd_6LwiAeLAvc","pdfSize":"2500798"}
