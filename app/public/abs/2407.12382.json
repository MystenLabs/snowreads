Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) is a powerful method\nto quantify molecular motions in living cells but its application is limited to\na subset of random motions and to long acquisition times. Here, we propose a\nnew analysis approach that frees FCS of these limitations by using machine\nlearning to infer the underlying model of motion and estimate the motion\nparameters. Using simulated FCS recordings, we show that this approach enlarges\nthe range of anomalous motions available in FCS. We further validate our\napproach via experimental FCS recordings of calibrated fluorescent beads in\nincreasing concentrations of glycerol in water. Taken together, our approach\nsignificantly augments the analysis power of FCS to capacities that are similar\nto the best-in-class state-of-the-art algorithms for single-particle-tracking\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
