Updating the model requires detecting drift by monitoring the data\nand/or the model for unexpected changes. We show that, however, spurious\ncorrelations (SCs) can spoil the statistics tracked by detection algorithms.\nMotivated by this, we introduce ebc-exstream, a novel detector that leverages\nmodel explanations to identify potential SCs and human feedback to correct for\nthem. It leverages an entropy-based heuristic to reduce the amount of necessary\nfeedback, cutting annotation costs. Our preliminary experiments on artificially\nconfounded data highlight the promise of ebc-exstream for reducing the impact\nof SCs on detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
