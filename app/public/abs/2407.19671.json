First, we construct global H\\\"{o}lder\ncontinuous (stationary) solutions in $C(\\mathbb{R};C^{\\vartheta})$ space for\nsome $\\vartheta>0$ via a different method from \\cite{LZ24}. Our approach is\nbased on applying stochastic convex integration to the construction of Euler\nflows in \\cite{DelSze13} to derive uniform moment estimates independent of\ntime. Second, for any divergence-free H\\\"{o}lder continuous initial condition,\nwe show the existence of infinitely many global-in-time probabilistically\nstrong and analytically weak solutions in\n$L^p_{\\rm{loc}}([0,\\infty);C^{\\vartheta'}) \\cap\nC_{\\rm{loc}}([0,\\infty);H^{-1})$ for all $p\\in [1,\\infty)$ and some\n$\\vartheta'>0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
