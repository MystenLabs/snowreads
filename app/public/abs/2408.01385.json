This\ngeneralizes the positive $e_I$-expansion for the chromatic symmetric function\nof lollipops obtained by Tom, for that of KPK graphs obtained by Wang and Zhou,\nand as well for those of KKP graphs and PKP graphs obtained by Qi, Tang and\nWang. As an application, we confirm the $e$-positivity of twinned lollipops,\nwhich belong to the graph family that is concerned by Stanley and Stembridge's\n$e$-positivity conjecture. We also discover the first positive $e_I$-expansion\nfor the chromatic symmetric function of kayak paddle graphs which are formed by\nconnecting a vertex on a cycle and a vertex on another cycle with a path. This\nrefines the $e$-positivity of kayak paddle graphs which was obtained by\nAliniaeifard, Wang, and van Willigenburg using an expanded version of Gebhard\nand Sagan's appendable $(e)$-positivity technique.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9qgG-3boM_82Kl-B8Rb74bmVbMKlolSY-Cau84bIjFI","pdfSize":"337825","txDigest":"99m2PVWm37bZbiUdewFgu8FaK1N4tqGXo9KsMnnbUAem","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
