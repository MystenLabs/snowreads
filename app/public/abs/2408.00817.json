This\nresearch aims to theoretically compare these two contributions to the total\namount of light produced between ~ 128 - 500 nm for a proton travelling in LAr\nand explores how to leverage these under-utilized observables for future\ndetector applications.\n  A new theoretical fit of the refractive index of LAr was performed using\nrecent experimental data, which incorporates the physics of anomalous\ndispersion in the UV resonance for the first time. Using this fit, we integrate\nthe Frank-Tamm (FT) formula to calculate the instantaneous Cherenkov angular\ndistribution and yield of a proton with a given kinetic energy, as well as the\nintegrated distribution and yield over its trajectory. We compare our results\nwith those obtained using two other non-absorptive refractive index fits\navailable in the literature. Because those fits diverge at the resonance, they\nsignificantly overestimate the yield.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
