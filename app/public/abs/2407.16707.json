In this paper, we formulate a discrete\nBlotto game played on a general \\textit{accessibility network} (i.e., the\nbipartite graph made of players and the fields they can allocate resources to).\nThe primary goal is to find how the topology of the accessibility network\ncontrols the existence and uniqueness of equilibrium allocations, and how it\naffects the fraction of fields that are entered and the average payoff of\nplayers at equilibrium. We establish that, in a 2-regular topology, when the\nvalues of fields are close enough and the number of players is not a multiple\nof 4, then there is a unique equilbrium. We also prove that players are better\noff and fields are more likely to be entered in a regular topology than a\nrandom topology. We find numerically that dispersion of field weights\nnegatively affects average player payoff. The main contribution is a framework\nfor analyzing contests where players are permitted access to some (but not\nnecessarily all) venues of competition.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GTbXmFyM5FVgT3RLqTcWaFbYh9WH0vkLn6r7QBEJjT0","pdfSize":"476627"}
