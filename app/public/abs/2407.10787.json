We confirm their prediction numerically by\nfine-tuning the wave profile proposed by Gibbons and Hawking [2], and then\nanalytically for its approximation by a P\\\"oschl-Teller potential. Higher-order\nderivative profiles proposed for gravitational collapse, etc [2] are shortly\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
