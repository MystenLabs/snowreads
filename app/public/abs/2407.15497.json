In particular, the phase transition of the\n3-state Potts model in three dimensions is believed to be of the first order,\nwithout a definitive proof of absence of scale invariance in three-dimensional\nfield theory with $S_3$ symmetry. This scale invariance should appear as a\nnon-trivial fixed point of the renormalization group, which has not been found.\nOur new search, with the non-perturbative renormalization group, finds such a\nfixed point, as a bifurcation from the trivial fixed point at the critical\nspace dimension $d=10/3$, which extends continuously to $d=3$. It does not\ncorrespond to a second-order phase transition of the 3-state Potts model, but\nis interesting in its own right. In particular, it shows how the\n$\\varepsilon$-expansion can fail.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
