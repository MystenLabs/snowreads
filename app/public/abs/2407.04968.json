In the\nlimit of vanishing momentum transfer this occurs either via the exchange of a\nphoton, the Primakoff process, where the spin of the proton does not change.\nFor axial-vector meson production, as a consequence of the Landau-Yang theorem,\nthe Primakoff cross section is finite as $t \\to 0$. Alternatively, a $C$-odd\nspin dependent Odderon can be exchanged, which involves a spin flip of the\nproton. The resulting cross section is related to the square of the gluon\nSivers function or its $\\boldsymbol{k}_\\perp^2$-moment. Using two models for\nthe gluon Sivers function from the literature we compute the ratio of Sivers to\nPrimakoff cross sections and the angular coefficient $\\lambda_\\theta$ governing\nthe angular distribution of the $\\chi_{c1} \\to J/\\psi + \\gamma$ decay as\nfunctions of $x$. We point out that these observables constrain the magnitude\nof the gluon Sivers function at small $x$ which could be accessed in\nelectron-proton scattering and ultraperipheral proton-proton and nucleus-proton\ncollisions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
