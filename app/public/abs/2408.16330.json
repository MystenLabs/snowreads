This paper proposes two\nsensitivity analysis procedures for dynamic discrete choice models with respect\nto the fixed parameters. First, I develop a local sensitivity measure that\nestimates the change in the target parameter for a unit change in the fixed\nparameter. This measure is fast to compute as it does not require model\nre-estimation. Second, I propose a global sensitivity analysis procedure that\nuses model primitives to study the relationship between target parameters and\nfixed parameters. I show how to apply the sensitivity analysis procedures of\nthis paper through two empirical applications.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
