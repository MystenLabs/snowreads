ChatGPT-4o outperformed the\ncandidate with the highest scores of 113 and 106 according to CMST and BMST\nrespectively. This study highlights the importance of the potential of\nartificial intelligence in medical education and assessment. It demonstrates\nthat advanced models can achieve high accuracy and contextual understanding,\ndemonstrating their potential role in medical education and evaluation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"x3HH3hwhYFbxW4t9MpMt2Tqja_MnkrC5MDlMDezRUo8","pdfSize":"447393"}
