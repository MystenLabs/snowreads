We show that these varieties can be naturally decomposed\ninto a finite disjoint union of subvarieties, where explicit asymptotic\nformulas for the number of rational points of bounded height can be given.\nAdditionally, we present various examples, including the case of Hirzebruch\nsurfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
