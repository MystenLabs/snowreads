Eigenvalues of the\nmatrix that are above the rescaled Marchenko Pastur distribution can be\ninterpreted as collective modes behavior while the modes under are usually\nconsidered as noise. In this analysis we use complex network analysis to\nsimulate the \"noise\" and the \"market\" component of the return correlations, by\nintroducing some meaningful correlations in simulated geometric Brownian motion\nfor the stocks. We find that the returns correlation matrix is dominated by\nstocks with high eigenvector centrality and clustering found in the network. We\nthen use simulated \"market\" random walks to build an optimal portfolio and find\nthat the overall return performs better than using the historical mean-variance\ndata, up to 50% on short time scale.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Physics/Physics and Society","Quantitative Finance/Portfolio Management"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
