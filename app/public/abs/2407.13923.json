Robust trust management is\nnecessary to ensure the reliability of information in decentralized systems.\nThis paper presents the notion of a ``Trust Field\" in VANETs, conceptualized as\nthe behavior of the nodes that represents trust levels evolving in both spatial\nand temporal dimensions. Using the LogitTrust model, we provide empirical\nevidence of how trust fields in vehicular networks change over time in\ndifferent scenarios, including when malicious nodes are present. The results of\nour study demonstrate that the trust domain can adjust to fluctuations in\nnetwork conditions, thereby offering a comprehensive metric for assessing the\nreliability of nodes. This innovative method improves the dependability of\nVANET applications by efficiently detecting and mitigating malicious actions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
