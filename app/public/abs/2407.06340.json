When combined with matrix-free implementations of\nrelevant operators, this technique allows for the computation of the dynamics\nof an arbitrary quantum state to be done in $\\mathcal{O}(n)$ time, where $n$ is\nthe size of the original Hilbert space.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
