However, the well-accepted canonical\nmodel of sex chromosome evolution is not universally supported. There is no\nsingle trajectory for sex chromosome formation and evolution across the tree of\nlife, suggesting the underlying mechanisms and evolutionary forces are diverse\nand lineage specific. We review the diversity of sex chromosome systems,\ndescribe the canonical model of sex chromosome evolution, and summarize studies\nchallenging various aspects of this model. They include evidence that many\nlineages experience frequent sex chromosome turnovers or maintain homomorphic\nsex chromosomes over long periods of time, suggesting sex chromosome\ndegeneration is not inevitable. Sometimes the sex-limited Y/W chromosomes\nexpand before they contract in size. Both transposable elements and gene gains\ncould contribute to this size expansion, which further challenges gene loss\nbeing the hallmark of sex chromosome degeneration. Finally, empirical support\nfor the role of sexually antagonistic selection as a driver of recombination\nsuppression on sex chromosomes remains elusive. We summarize models that result\nin loss of recombination without invoking sexually antagonistic selection,\nwhich have not been empirically verified yet, and suggest future avenues for\nsex chromosome research.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
