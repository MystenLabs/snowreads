More specifically, this assumption will be dropped off by applying a\nsuitable diffeomorphism which straightens the boundary of the crack, before\nperforming the approximation procedure developed in [2] in order to derive a\nsuitable monotonicity formula. This will yield the appearence of a matrix in\nthe equation, which shall be handled appropriately: for this we will take a\nhint from [4].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
