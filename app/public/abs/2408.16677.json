Using molecular dynamics simulations with a newly parameterized\ninterfacial potential, we investigate the preservation of ultralow friction on\ngraphite with physisorbed n-hexadecane (HEX) as a model contaminant. Our\nfindings reveal that a well-ordered monolayer of HEX molecules strongly adheres\nto the graphite surface, replicating its lattice structure and maintaining\nsolid-like behavior, which leads to orientation-dependent shear stresses-an\neffect absent on a gold (111) surface. As the contaminant film thickens, this\norientation effect diminishes. Additionally, as coverage increases from zero to\none monolayer, the shear stress-velocity relationship transitions from Coulomb\nto quasi-Stokesian and then to quasi-Coulomb, highlighting the role of\nmolecular displacement in high-velocity dissipation. Despite a hundredfold\nincrease in shear stress compared to dry sliding, superlubricity on graphite\npersists under ambient conditions, enhancing our conventional understanding of\nstructural lubricity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
