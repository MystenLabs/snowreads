Such an effect is\nsymmetry forbidden in most cases and hence is very unusual. Interestingly, the\nexistence of a finite parallel-field Hall effect was reported for the layered\ntopological semimetal ZrTe$_5$ and was proposed to be due to Berry curvature.\nHowever, it is forbidden for the known symmetry of ZrTe$_5$ and the possible\nexistence of a misaligned out-of-plane magnetic field was not completely ruled\nout. Here, we elucidate the existence of the parallel-field Hall effect in\nZrTe$_5$ with careful magnetic-field alignment. We interpret this result to\noriginate from symmetry breaking and quantitatively explain the observed\nparallel-field Hall signal by considering a tilting of the Fermi surface\nallowed by broken symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
