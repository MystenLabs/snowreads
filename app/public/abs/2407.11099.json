A simplified simulation model based on computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD) for the mass transfer in the distillation column is used and a\ncorresponding shape optimization problem is formulated. The goal of the\noptimization is to increase the mass transfer in the column by changing the\npacking's shape, which has been previously used as criterion for increasing the\nseparation efficiency of the column. The computational shape optimization\nyields promising results, with an increased mass transfer of nearly 20 %. For\nvalidation, the resulting optimized shape is additively manufactured using\n3D-printing and investigated experimentally. The experimental results are in\ngood agreement with the performance improvement predicted by the computational\nmodel, yielding an increase in separation efficiency of around 20 %.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
