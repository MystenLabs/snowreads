Here we explore\nwhether this provides a reliable description of experiment, using matrix\nproduct states (MPS) to calculate magnon spectra beyond spin wave theory. We\nfind that analysis based on low orders of spin wave theory leads to systematic\noverestimates of exchange parameters, with corresponding errors in estimates of\nHubbard $t/U$. Once these are corrected, the ''standard'' model provides a good\naccount of magnon dispersion and lineshape in La$_2$CuO$_4$, but fails to fully\ncapture the continuum observed at high energies. The extension of this analysis\nto CaCuO$_2$ and Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
