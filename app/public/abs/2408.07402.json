In contrast, natural languages are much\nmore challenging and instigated the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP).\nOne major obstacle is the ubiquity of ambiguities. Recent advances in NLP have\nled to the development of large language models, which can resolve ambiguities\nwith high accuracy. At the same time, quantum computers have gained much\nattention in recent years as they can solve some computational problems faster\nthan classical computers. This new computing paradigm has reached the fields of\nmachine learning and NLP, where hybrid classical-quantum learning algorithms\nhave emerged. However, more research is needed to identify which NLP tasks\ncould benefit from a genuine quantum advantage. In this thesis, we applied\nformalisms arising from foundational quantum mechanics, such as contextuality\nand causality, to study ambiguities arising from linguistics. By doing so, we\nalso reproduced psycholinguistic results relating to the human disambiguation\nprocess. These results were subsequently used to predict human behaviour and\noutperformed current NLP methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
