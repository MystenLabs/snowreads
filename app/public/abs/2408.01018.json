Mainstream molecular\nrepresentation learning approaches are based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).\nHowever, these approaches struggle with three significant challenges:\ninsufficient annotations, molecular diversity, and architectural limitations\nsuch as over-squashing, which leads to the loss of critical structural details.\nTo address these challenges, we introduce a new class of GNNs that integrates\nthe Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), known for their robust data-fitting\ncapabilities and high accuracy in small-scale AI + Science tasks. By\nincorporating KANs into GNNs, our model enhances the representation of\nmolecular structures. We further advance this approach with a variant called\nSwallowKAN (SKAN), which employs adaptive Radial Basis Functions (RBFs) as the\ncore of the non-linear neurons. This innovation improves both computational\nefficiency and adaptability to diverse molecular structures. Building on the\nstrengths of SKAN, we propose a new class of GNNs, GNN-SKAN, and its augmented\nvariant, GNN-SKAN+, which incorporates a SKAN-based classifier to further boost\nperformance. To our knowledge, this is the first work to integrate KANs into\nGNN architectures tailored for molecular representation learning. Experiments\nacross 6 classification datasets, 6 regression datasets, and 4 few-shot\nlearning datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves new state-of-the-art\nperformance in terms of accuracy and computational cost.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
