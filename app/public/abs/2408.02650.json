This topic\nforms part of many biological science curricula but is rarely taught to physics\nstudents. Since physicists are becoming increasingly interested in biological\nevolution, we aim to provide a brief introduction to population genetics,\nwritten for physicists. We start with two background chapters: chapter 1\nprovides a brief historical introduction to the topic, while chapter 2 provides\nsome essential biological background. We begin our main content with chapter 3\nwhich discusses the key concepts behind Darwinian natural selection and\nMendelian inheritance. Chapter 4 covers the basics of how variation is\nmaintained in populations, while chapter 5 discusses mutation and selection. In\nchapter 6 we discuss stochastic effects in population genetics using the\nWright-Fisher model as our example, and finally we offer concluding thoughts\nand references to excellent textbooks in chapter 7.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
