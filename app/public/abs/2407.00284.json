The\nleading order geometric optics approximation admits a closed-form expression of\nsuch paths, and sets of source/receiver locations are quantified for a spectrum\nof black hole angular momenta. A conserved, conformal Yano-Killing scalar is\nthen exploited to determine the evolving polarization. Polarization holonomy,\nthe angle between outgoing and incoming polarizations, is quantified for the\nspectrum of admissible direct and retrograde trajectories.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
