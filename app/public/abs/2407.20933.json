The minimization of the parameter-dependent WIDE functional on\ntrajectories delivers an elliptic-in-time regularization. By taking the limit\nin the parameter, one recovers a solution to the given differential problem.\nThis survey is intended to provide a comprehensive account of the available\nresults on the WIDE variational approach. The basic concepts are illustrated in\nthe simplest finite-dimensional case, and the existing literature, both\ntheoretical and applied, is systematically reviewed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-ybAmES74_ChMMDBp7kP13cfr3gTqjndpyyj8Oot-gA","pdfSize":"647506"}
