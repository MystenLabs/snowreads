In accordance with the standard theory for\nhypergraphs, this model is constructed from a bipartite graph. In our\nstochastic model, both vertex sets of this bipartite graph form marked Poisson\npoint processes and the connection radius is inversely proportional to a\nproduct of suitable powers of the marks. Hence, our model is a common\ngeneralization of weighted random connection models and AB random geometric\ngraphs. For this hypergraph model, we investigate the limit theory of a variety\nof graph-theoretic and topological characteristics such as higher-order degree\ndistribution, Betti numbers of the associated Dowker complex as well as simplex\ncounts. In particular, for the latter quantity we identify regimes of\nconvergence to normal and to stable distribution depending on the\nheavy-tailedness of the weight distribution. We conclude our investigation by a\nsimulation study and an application to the collaboration network extracted from\nthe arXiv dataset.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
