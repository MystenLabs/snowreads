We summarize a\ntransitory UGV into several keyframes in linear time via fast graph sampling\nbased on Gershgorin disc alignment (GDA). Specifically, we first model a\nsequence of $N$ frames in a UGV as an $M$-hop path graph $\\mathcal{G}^o$ for $M\n\\ll N$, where the similarity between two frames within $M$ time instants is\nencoded as a positive edge based on feature similarity. Towards efficient\nsampling, we then \"unfold\" $\\mathcal{G}^o$ to a $1$-hop path graph\n$\\mathcal{G}$, specified by a generalized graph Laplacian matrix $\\mathcal{L}$,\nvia one of two graph unfolding procedures with provable performance bounds. We\nshow that maximizing the smallest eigenvalue $\\lambda_{\\min}(\\mathbf{B})$ of a\ncoefficient matrix $\\mathbf{B} = \\textit{diag}\\left(\\mathbf{h}\\right) + \\mu\n\\mathcal{L}$, where $\\mathbf{h}$ is the binary keyframe selection vector, is\nequivalent to minimizing a worst-case signal reconstruction error. We maximize\ninstead the Gershgorin circle theorem (GCT) lower bound\n$\\lambda^-_{\\min}(\\mathbf{B})$ by choosing $\\mathbf{h}$ via a new fast graph\nsampling algorithm that iteratively aligns left-ends of Gershgorin discs for\nall graph nodes (frames). Extensive experiments on multiple short video\ndatasets show that our algorithm achieves comparable or better video\nsummarization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, at a\nsubstantially reduced complexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
