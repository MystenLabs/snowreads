For\neach problem, we prove convergence of the iterates to a non-trivial principal\neigenfunction and show that the corresponding Rayleigh quotients converge to\nthe principal eigenvalue. We also propose a related iterative method for an\neigenvalue problem arising from a model for optimal insulation and provide some\npartial results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
