We detect this cross-correlation at a significance of\n38$\\sigma$; combining our measurement with the Planck Public Release 4 (PR4)\nlensing map, we detect the cross-correlation at 50$\\sigma$. Fitting this\njointly with the galaxy auto-correlation power spectrum to break the galaxy\nbias degeneracy with $\\sigma_8$, we perform a tomographic analysis in four LRG\nredshift bins spanning $0.4 \\le z \\le 1.0$ to constrain the amplitude of matter\ndensity fluctuations through the parameter combination $S_8^\\times = \\sigma_8\n\\left(\\Omega_m / 0.3\\right)^{0.4}$. Prior to unblinding, we confirm with\nextragalactic simulations that foreground biases are negligible and carry out a\ncomprehensive suite of null and consistency tests. Using a hybrid effective\nfield theory (HEFT) model that allows scales as small as $k_{\\rm max}=0.6$\n$h/{\\rm Mpc}$, we obtain a 3.3% constraint on $S_8^\\times = \\sigma_8\n\\left(\\Omega_m / 0.3\\right)^{0.4} = 0.792^{+0.024}_{-0.028}$ from ACT data, as\nwell as constraints on $S_8^\\times(z)$ that probe structure formation over\ncosmic time. Our result is consistent with the early-universe extrapolation\nfrom primary CMB anisotropies measured by Planck PR4 within 1.2$\\sigma$.\nJointly fitting ACT and Planck lensing cross-correlations we obtain a 2.7%\nconstraint of $S_8^\\times = 0.776^{+0.019}_{-0.021}$, which is consistent with\nthe Planck early-universe extrapolation within 2.1$\\sigma$, with the lowest\nredshift bin showing the largest difference in mean. The latter may motivate\nfurther CMB lensing tomography analyses at $z<0.6$ to assess the impact of\npotential systematics or the consistency of the $\\Lambda$CDM model over cosmic\ntime.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
