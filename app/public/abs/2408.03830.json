HD 19467 B is an old, $\\sim$9 Gyr, companion to a Solar-type\nstar with multiple measured dynamical masses. The spectra show detections of\nCO, CO$_2$, CH$_4$, and H$_2$O. We forward model the spectra using Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo methods and atmospheric model grids to constrain the effective\ntemperature and surface gravity. We then use NEWERA-PHOENIX grids to constrain\nnon-equilibrium chemistry parameterized by $K_{zz}$ and explore molecular\nabundance ratios of the detected molecules. We find an effective temperature of\n1103 K, with a probable range from 1000--1200 K, a surface gravity of 4.50 dex,\nwith a range of 4.14--5.00, and deep vertical mixing, log$_{10}$($K_{zz}$), of\n5.03, with a range of 5.00--5.44. All molecular mixing ratios are approximately\nSolar, leading to a C/O $\\sim$0.55, which is expected from a T5.5 brown dwarf.\nFinally, we calculate an updated dynamical mass of HD 19467 B using newly\nderived NIRCam astrometry which we find to be $71.6^{+5.3}_{-4.6}\nM_{\\rm{Jup}}$, in agreement with the mass range we derive from evolutionary\nmodels, which we find to be 63-75 $M_{\\rm{Jup}}$.These observations demonstrate\nthe excellent capabilities of the NIRSpec IFU to achieve detailed spectral\ncharacterization of substellar companions at high-contrast close to bright host\nstars, in this case at a separation of $\\sim$1.6\\arcsec with a contrast of\n10$^{-4}$ in the 3-5 $\\mu$m range.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
