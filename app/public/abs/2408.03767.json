The evolution of this matrix gives\nthe matrix form of null Raychaudhuri equation. Using this distinct geometric\napproach, we have reformulated the original Penrose singularity theorem on\nBlack-Hole and have commented on the characteristic of the Raychaudhuri matrix\nat the singularity. The paper also suggests two possible mitigations for the\nphysical singularity of Schwarzschild black hole via the Wheeler-DeWitt\nformalism and Bohemian formalism.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zNEb5hwMRBGP-Wf5VBHCyIrs89m2us4lZ9vP5i0g7zA","pdfSize":"269082"}
