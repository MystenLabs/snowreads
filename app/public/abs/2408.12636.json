This genomic complexity is known to be associated with poorer\noutcomes for patients but describing its contribution in detail has been\ndifficult. Copy number alterations can affect large regions spanning whole\nchromosomes or the entire genome itself but can also be localised to only small\nsegments of the genome and no methods exist that allow this multi-scale nature\nto be quantified. In this paper, we address this using Wave-LSTM, a signal\ndecomposition approach designed to capture the multi-scale structure of complex\nwhole genome copy number profiles. Using wavelet-based source separation in\ncombination with deep learning-based attention mechanisms. We show that\nWave-LSTM can be used to derive multi-scale representations from copy number\nprofiles which can be used to decipher sub-clonal structures from single-cell\ncopy number data and to improve survival prediction performance from patient\ntumour profiles.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GcEJL8hIVFOk578hAtpBo1cXXsXIBVg3XItgJSFprQc","pdfSize":"2465800"}
