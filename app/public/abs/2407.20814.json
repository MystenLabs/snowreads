We set out\nfairness issues in energy markets today, and propose a market design to address\nthem. Consumption is categorised as either essential or flexible with different\nprices and reliability levels for each. Prices are generated by an Automatic\nMarket Maker (AMM) based on instantaneous scarcity and resource is allocated\nusing a novel Fair Play algorithm. We empirically show the performance of the\nsystem over 1 year for 101 UK households and benchmark its performance against\nmore classical approaches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Qkg4UbdUtihHUj1gxwqFmed6fp9bWuTu9RYaGrIj-HM","pdfSize":"945620"}
