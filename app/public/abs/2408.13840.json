The four complexity classes are Logspace, NP-complete, co-NP-complete\nand Pspace-complete. The previous proof of this result relied on notions from\nuniversal algebra and core-like structures called U-X-cores. This new proof\nuses only relations, and works for infinite structures also in the distinction\nbetween Logspace and NP-hard under Turing reductions.\n  For finite domains, the membership in NP and co-NP follows from a simple\nargument, which breaks down already over an infinite set with a binary\nrelation. We develop some interesting new algorithms to solve NP and co-NP\nmembership for a variety of infinite structures. We begin with those\nfirst-order definable in (Q;=), the so-called equality languages, then move to\nthose first-order definable in (Q;<), the so-called temporal languages.\nHowever, it is first-order expansions of the Random Graph (V,E) that provide\nthe most interesting examples. In all of these cases, the derived\nclassification is a tetrachotomy between Logspace, NP-complete, co-NP-complete\nand Pspace-complete.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ovzzn7m5mVTiHzr9AyZOiH5j0_-b3klhZjv0-MUMi4c","pdfSize":"587687"}
