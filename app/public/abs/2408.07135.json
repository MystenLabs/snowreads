This study\nexamines the dynamics of Anti-Kremlin content on Telegram over seven phases of\nthe invasion, inspired by the concept of breach in narrative theory. A\ndata-driven, computational analysis of emerging topics revealed the Russian\neconomy, combat updates, international politics, and Russian domestic affairs,\namong others. Using a common set of statistical contrasts by phases of the\ninvasion, a longitudinal analysis of topic prevalence allowed us to examine\nassociations with documented offline events and viewer reactions, suggesting an\nadaptive breach-oriented communications strategy that maintained viewer\ninterest. Viewer approval of those events that threaten Kremlin control\nsuggests that Telegram levels the online playing field for the opposition,\nsurprising given the Kremlin's suppression of free speech offline.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"1uyhg4kDLNZ1YwfT8b7huBIMddeIFh7cPdWDjdzGBjo","pdfSize":"10044945"}
