However,\ntranslation-based JOPTs often fail to fully exploit the inherent features of\ngraphs, while index-based JOPTs may neglect optimal plans during the\noptimization process. In this paper, we propose a novel converged JOPT with\nefficient optimizations. Our approach enables efficient graph query\noptimization by facilitating precise cost estimation. Theoretical performance\nanalysis shows that JOOP with our method can be exponentially faster than\ntraditional methods. Experimental results further validate that our optimizer\nnot only reduces optimization time but also generates superior query plans\ncompared to existing solutions. Ultimately, this work addresses significant\nchallenges in JOOP and contributing to advancements in relational optimization\nstrategies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kf3DtyuDzIMkBGRQ-fNoWeGKT0QHOmN84-jVM8t96I8","pdfSize":"1532653"}
