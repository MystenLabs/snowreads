Beyond highlighting a \"green\" vehicle and CO2 emissions,\nCO2 equivalencies have been designed to provide understandable amounts; we ask\nwhich equivalencies will lead to eco-friendly decisions. We conducted five\nride-hailing scenario surveys where participants picked between regular and\neco-friendly options, testing equivalencies, social features, and valence-based\ninterventions. Further, we tested a car-rental embodiment to gauge how an\nindividual (needing a car for several days) might behave versus the immediate\nride-hailing context. We find that participants are more likely to choose green\nrides when presented with additional information about emissions; CO2 by weight\nwas found to be the most effective. Further, we found that information framing\n- be it individual or collective footprint, positive or negative valence - had\nan impact on participants' choices. Finally, we discuss how our findings inform\nthe design of effective interventions for reducing car-based carbon-emissions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
