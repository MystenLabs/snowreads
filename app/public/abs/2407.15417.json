This\nanalysis is enabled using proper parameterization approaches on the target\nanalysis domain. In this paper, we propose the usage of customizable\nparameterization coordinates that allow mapping open surfaces into oblate or\nprolate hemispheroidal surfaces. For this, we proposed the usage of Tutte,\nconformal, area-preserving, and balanced mappings for parameterizing any given\nsimply connected open surface onto an optimal hemispheroid. The hemispheroidal\nharmonic bases were introduced to spectrally expand these parametric surfaces\nby generalizing the known hemispherical ones. This approach uses the radius of\nthe hemispheroid as a degree of freedom to control the size of the\nparameterization domain of the open surfaces while providing numerically stable\nbasis functions. Several open surfaces have been tested using different mapping\ncombinations. We also propose optimization-based mappings to serve various\napplications on the reconstruction problem. Altogether, our work provides an\neffective way to represent and analyze simply connected open surfaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
