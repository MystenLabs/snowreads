However, these point clouds\noften suffer from incompleteness due to limited perspectives, scanner\nresolution and occlusion. Therefore the prediction of missing parts performs a\ncrucial task. In this paper, we propose a novel method for point cloud\ncompletion. We utilize a spherical template to guide the generation of the\ncoarse complete template and generate the dynamic query tokens through a\ncorrespondence pooling (Corres-Pooling) query generator. Specifically, we first\ngenerate the coarse complete template by embedding a Gaussian spherical\ntemplate into the partial input and transforming the template to best match the\ninput. Then we use the Corres-Pooling query generator to refine the coarse\ntemplate and generate dynamic query tokens which could be used to predict the\ncomplete point proxies. Finally, we generate the complete point cloud with a\nFoldingNet following the coarse-to-fine paradigm, according to the fine\ntemplate and the predicted point proxies. Experimental results demonstrate that\nour T-CorresNet outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on several benchmarks.\nOur Codes are available at https://github.com/df-boy/T-CorresNet.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
