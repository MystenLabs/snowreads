Incomplete or missing data in these\nthree-dimensional (3D) models can lead to erroneous or flawed renderings,\nlimiting their usefulness in a variety of applications such as visualization,\ngeometric computation, and 3D printing. Conventional surface estimation\napproaches often produce implausible results, especially when dealing with\ncomplex surfaces. To address this issue, we propose a technique that\nincorporates neural network-based 2D inpainting to effectively reconstruct 3D\nsurfaces. Our customized neural networks were trained on a dataset containing\nover 1 million curvature images. These images show the curvature of vertices as\nplanar representations in 2D. Furthermore, we used a coarse-to-fine surface\ndeformation technique to improve the accuracy of the reconstructed pictures and\nassure surface adaptability. This strategy enables the system to learn and\ngeneralize patterns from input data, resulting in the development of precise\nand comprehensive three-dimensional surfaces. Our methodology excels in the\nshape completion process, effectively filling complex holes in\nthree-dimensional surfaces with a remarkable level of realism and precision.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
