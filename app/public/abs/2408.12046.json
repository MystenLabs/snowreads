The hopping integrals for nearest-neighboring\nsites are considered. We examine the electronic band structures for systems\nwith (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Electronic states well localized around\nthe surfaces are found for the (110) and (111) surfaces. In particular, the\nsurface state is flat and extends in the entire Brillouin zone for the (111)\nsurface, provided the bulk band projected onto the surface Brillouin zone is\ngapped. We also find that these surface states possess octupole moments in both\nthe (110) and (111) surface cases.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
