This is achieved through\ncertain degeneracies of the functions forming their Lagrangian. They generalise\nthe Horndeski and beyond-Horndeski theories. Originally build to describe the\nlate-time acceleration of the expansion of the universe, generalising the\ncosmological constant, they can be used to build models for early universe, to\ndescribe inflation or alternatives to standard inflation. In the late universe,\nthey modify the standard Vainstein screening mechanism from Horndeski theories\nwhich can have observable consequences and are suited to build black hole\nmodels, featuring non-stealth Kerr black hole solutions. In this work we review\ntheir effects on cosmology, looking at their basic properties, their\nparameterisations and classifications, and then focusing on solutions in the\nearly and the late universe.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
