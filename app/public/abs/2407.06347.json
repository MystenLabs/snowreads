The hadronic part of the hybrid equation\nof state is constructed using a generalized piecewise polytropic scheme, while\nthe quark phase is described by the generic constant speed of sound model. We\nassume an abrupt first-order hadron-quark phase transition with a slow\nconversion speed between phases. Our equations of state align with modern\nChiral Effective Field Theory calculations near nuclear saturation density and\nare consistent with perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics calculations at high\ndensities. Using this theoretical framework, we derive a wide range of hybrid\nequations of state capable of explaining the light compact object in\nHESS~J1731-347 in a model-independent manner, without fine-tuning. These\nequations of state are also consistent with modern astronomical constraints\nfrom high-mass pulsar timing, NICER observations, and multimessenger astronomy\ninvolving gravitational waves. Our results support the hypothesis that the\ncompact object in HESS~J1731-347 could plausibly be a slow stable hybrid star.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
