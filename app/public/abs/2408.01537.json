We introduce\nSceneMotion, an attention-based model for forecasting scene-wide motion modes\nof multiple traffic agents. Our model transforms local agent-centric embeddings\ninto scene-wide forecasts using a novel latent context module. This module\nlearns a scene-wide latent space from multiple agent-centric embeddings,\nenabling joint forecasting and interaction modeling. The competitive\nperformance in the Waymo Open Interaction Prediction Challenge demonstrates the\neffectiveness of our approach. Moreover, we cluster future waypoints in time\nand space to quantify the interaction between agents. We merge all modes and\nanalyze each mode independently to determine which clusters are resolved\nthrough interaction or result in conflict.
