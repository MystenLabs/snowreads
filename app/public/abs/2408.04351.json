Such a method is unbiased and unconditionally stable, and can\ntherefore be used to provide an unbiased estimation of individual entries of\nthe solution, or the full solution. By using stochastic differentiation\ntechniques, it can be used as well to provide unbiased estimators of the\nsensitivities of the solution with respect to the problem parameters without\nany additional computational cost. The time complexity of the algorithm is\ndiscussed here, along with suitable variance bounds, which prove in practice\nthe convergence of the algorithm. Finally, several test cases were run to\nassess the validity of the algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yvEAdMPmAxJaL-aGTkmllIDysEf4Y2e-88ee_SLeG9k","pdfSize":"833634"}
