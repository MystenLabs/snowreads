Recent advancements\nintroduced several quantum Nash solvers aimed at identifying pure strategy NE\nsolutions (i.e., binary solutions) by integrating slack terms into the\nobjective function, commonly referred to as slack-quadratic unconstrained\nbinary optimization (S-QUBO). However, incorporation of slack terms into the\nquadratic optimization results in changes of the objective function, which may\ncause incorrect solutions. Furthermore, these quantum solvers only identify a\nlimited subset of pure strategy NE solutions, and fail to address mixed\nstrategy NE (i.e., decimal solutions), leaving many solutions undiscovered. In\nthis work, we propose C-Nash, a novel ferroelectric computing-in-memory (CiM)\narchitecture that can efficiently handle both pure and mixed strategy NE\nsolutions. The proposed architecture consists of (i) a transformation method\nthat converts quadratic optimization into a MAX-QUBO form without introducing\nadditional slack variables, thereby avoiding objective function changes; (ii) a\nferroelectric FET (FeFET) based bi-crossbar structure for storing payoff\nmatrices and accelerating the core vector-matrix-vector (VMV) multiplications\nof QUBO form; (iii) A winner-takes-all (WTA) tree implementing the MAX form and\na two-phase based simulated annealing (SA) logic for searching NE solutions.\nEvaluations show that C-Nash has up to 68.6% increase in the success rate for\nidentifying NE solutions, finding all pure and mixed NE solutions rather than\nonly a portion of pure NE solutions, compared to D-Wave based quantum\napproaches. Moreover, C-Nash boasts a reduction up to 157.9X/79.0X in\ntime-to-solutions compared to D-Wave 2000 Q6 and D-Wave Advantage 4.1,\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
