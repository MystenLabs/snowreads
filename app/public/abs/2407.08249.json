Most research on\nnetwork engineering automation has concentrated on configuration synthesis,\noften overlooking changes in the physical network topology. This paper\nintroduces GeNet, a multimodal co-pilot for enterprise network engineers. GeNet\nis a novel framework that leverages a large language model (LLM) to streamline\nnetwork design workflows. It uses visual and textual modalities to interpret\nand update network topologies and device configurations based on user intents.\nGeNet was evaluated on enterprise network scenarios adapted from Cisco\ncertification exercises. Our results demonstrate GeNet's ability to interpret\nnetwork topology images accurately, potentially reducing network engineers'\nefforts and accelerating network design processes in enterprise environments.\nFurthermore, we show the importance of precise topology understanding when\nhandling intents that require modifications to the network's topology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
