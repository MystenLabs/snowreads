A new\ninteractive CIDSS is proposed and compared with previous approaches.\nAddition-ally, the purpose uncertainty problem in building interactive systems\nis discussed, and criteria for measuring both quality and amount of user\nfeedback are proposed. In order to automate system evaluation, a new algorithm\nwas used to simulate expert feedback. The proposed interactive CIDSS\noutperforms previous approaches (both interactive and noninteractive) on the\ntask of lung lesion segmentation. This ap-proach looks promising both in terms\nof quality and expert user experience. At the same time, this paper discusses a\nbunch of possible modifications that can be done to improve both evaluation\ncriteria and proposed CIDSS in future works.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
