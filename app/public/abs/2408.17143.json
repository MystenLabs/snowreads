In this paper, we tackle this issue by verifying that all\ndetected shadows are real, i.e. they have paired shadow casters. We perform\nthis step in a physically-accurate manner by differentiably re-rendering the\nscene and observing the changes stemming from carving out estimated shadow\ncasters. Thanks to this approach, the RenDetNet proposed in this paper is the\nfirst learning-based shadow detection model whose supervisory signals can be\ncomputed in a self-supervised manner. The developed system compares favourably\nagainst recent models trained on our data. As part of this publication, we\nrelease our code on github.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wLMlK9WXh83gt6d-8uLDdEQOKiiSz1JMhO8o6kmQG0U","pdfSize":"2239588"}
