Taxel-based tactile signals often have low\nspatial-resolution, with non-standardized representations. In this paper, we\npropose a novel framework, HyperTaxel, for learning a geometrically-informed\nrepresentation of taxel-based tactile signals to address challenges associated\nwith their spatial resolution. We use this representation and a contrastive\nlearning objective to encode and map sparse low-resolution taxel signals to\nhigh-resolution contact surfaces. To address the uncertainty inherent in these\nsignals, we leverage joint probability distributions across multiple\nsimultaneous contacts to improve taxel hyper-resolution. We evaluate our\nrepresentation by comparing it with two baselines and present results that\nsuggest our representation outperforms the baselines. Furthermore, we present\nqualitative results that demonstrate the learned representation captures the\ngeometric features of the contact surface, such as flatness, curvature, and\nedges, and generalizes across different objects and sensor configurations.\nMoreover, we present results that suggest our representation improves the\nperformance of various downstream tasks, such as surface classification, 6D\nin-hand pose estimation, and sim-to-real transfer.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
