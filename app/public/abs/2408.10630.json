The system of equations in\nconsideration features a mixed (concave-convex) power nonlinearity depending on\na positive parameter $\\lambda$. We show multiplicity of nonnegative solutions\nof the system for a certain range of the parameter $\\lambda$ and we also\ndiscuss regularity and symmetry of nonnegative solutions of the system.\nBesides, we present a numerical strategy aiming at the exploration of the\noptimal range of $\\lambda$ for which multiplicity of solutions holds. The\nnumerical experiments are based on the Poincar\\'{e}-Miranda theorem and the\nshooting method, which have been lesser explored for systems of ODEs. Our work\nis motivated by the works of Ambrosetti et al., 1994 and Moreira dos Santos,\n2009.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
