Although the resilience of DNNs to\nintentional and unintentional perturbations has been widely investigated, a\nunified vision of these inherently intertwined problem domains is still\nmissing. In this work, we fill this gap by providing a survey of the state of\nthe art and highlighting the similarities of the proposed approaches.We also\nanalyze the research challenges that need to be addressed to deploy resilient\nand secure DNNs. As there has not been any such survey connecting the\nresilience of DNNs to intentional and unintentional perturbations, we believe\nthis work can help advance the frontier in both domains by enabling the\nexchange of ideas between the two communities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mxBWw5dyLM2ba_ZwV2S833WSmMNkVAT82woWkpS4oDo","pdfSize":"1764397"}
