However, the development of this field is\nrigorously restricted by the deployment dilemma of simultaneously achieving\nhigh accuracy, excellent power efficiency, and meeting strict real-time\nrequirements. To tackle this dilemma, we propose AyE-Edge, the\nfirst-of-this-kind development tool that explores automated algorithm-device\ndeployment space search to realize Accurate yet power-Efficient real-time\nobject detection on the Edge. Through a collaborative exploration of keyframe\nselection, CPU-GPU configuration, and DNN pruning strategy, AyE-Edge excels in\nextensive real-world experiments conducted on a mobile device. The results\nconsistently demonstrate AyE-Edge's effectiveness, realizing outstanding\nreal-time performance, detection accuracy, and notably, a remarkable 96.7%\nreduction in power consumption, compared to state-of-the-art (SOTA)\ncompetitors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
