This raises the question whether the sensitivity of\nsuch measurements is sufficient to assess the quality of theoretical models for\nthe interaction. We here compare measured collision cross sections to those\nobtained with exact quantum coupled-channels scattering calculations for three\ndifferent ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find that the ability to test\nthe correct prediction of energy redistribution over molecular degrees of\nfreedom is within reach, requiring only a modest improvement in energy\nresolution of current experiments. Such improvement will enable the separation\nof individual resonances and allow for an unambiguous experimental test of\ndifferent theory approaches.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
