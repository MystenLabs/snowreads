Special attention is given to the case where the\nrefractive index has a discontinuity for which the Fresnel conditions are\nnecessary. We assume that the only spatial variable of interest is the altitude\n(stratified medium). An algorithm based on iterations of the sources is shown\nto be monotone and convergent. Numerical examples are given with highly varying\nabsorption coefficient kappa and Rayleigh scattering as in the Earth\natmosphere. To study the effect of CO2 in the atmosphere kappa is changed in\nthe frequency ranges where CO2 is absorbing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rN3wn7FJabZH46y1whqMZLPj8pt_Aod0Izadf1BJcb8","pdfSize":"927684","objectId":"0x9083a946b236975fd7496f3c451bd4c6cd36e2ddb11118cba3cfd0f664b9807e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
