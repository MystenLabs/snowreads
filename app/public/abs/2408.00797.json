The problem is known to be\nNP-complete even on split graphs and planar bipartite graphs. In this paper, we\napproach the problem from the algorithmic standpoint and obtain several\ninteresting results. We give an $\\mathcal{O}^*(1.747^n)$ time algorithm for the\nproblem on split graphs. Following a reduction from a special case of 1-in-3\nSAT problem, we show that there is no sub-exponential time algorithm running in\ntime $\\mathcal{O}^*(2^{o(n)})$ for bipartite graphs, for any $k \\geq 2$. We\nalso prove that the problem is NP-complete when $\\Delta = k+2$, for any $k\\geq\n5$, even for bipartite graphs. We investigate the parameterized complexity of\nthe problem for the parameter twin cover and the combined parameter distance to\ncluster, membership($k$) and prove that the problem is fixed-parameter\ntractable. Using a dynamic programming based approach, we obtain a linear-time\nalgorithm for trees.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NBeUJ27bm0y-DzEJgy7uU-VGtCGXuPfAoUiEMpFTagU","pdfSize":"277998"}
