It is natural to ask, how much the number of crossings may\nincrease over the traditional (unrestricted) crossing number. Previous\napproaches to bound such ratios, e.g. [arXiv:1908.03153, arXiv:2105.12452],\nrequire very specialized constructions and arguments for each considered beyond\nplanarity concept, and mostly only yield asymptotically non-tight bounds. We\npropose a very general proof framework that allows us to obtain asymptotically\ntight bounds, and where the concept-specific parts of the proof typically boil\ndown to a couple of lines. We show the strength of our approach by giving\nimproved or first bounds for several beyond planarity concepts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
