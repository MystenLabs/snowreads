We show that the conditions that $kh/p$ be sufficiently small\nand that $\\log(k) / p$ be bounded imply quasi-optimality of both conforming and\nDG-method, where $k$ is the wavenumber, $h$ the mesh size, and $p$ the\napproximation order. The analysis relies on a $k$-explicit regularity theory\nfor a three-field coupling formulation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
