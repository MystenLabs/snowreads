These schemes were first introduced in [Altmann, Maier, Unger,\nBIT Numer. Math., 64:20, 2024], where a convergence proof for the second-order\ncase is presented. Here, we present a slightly modified version of these\nschemes using a different construction of related time delay systems. We\npresent a novel convergence proof relying on concepts from G-stability\napplicable for any order and providing a sharper characterization of the\nrequired weak coupling condition. The key tool for the convergence analysis is\nthe construction of a weighted norm enabling a telescoping argument for the sum\nof the errors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
