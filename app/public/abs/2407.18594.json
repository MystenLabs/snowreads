These schemes were first introduced in [Altmann, Maier, Unger,\nBIT Numer. Math., 64:20, 2024], where a convergence proof for the second-order\ncase is presented. Here, we present a slightly modified version of these\nschemes using a different construction of related time delay systems. We\npresent a novel convergence proof relying on concepts from G-stability\napplicable for any order and providing a sharper characterization of the\nrequired weak coupling condition. The key tool for the convergence analysis is\nthe construction of a weighted norm enabling a telescoping argument for the sum\nof the errors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8WA8lLm--g8G4Nf_1KmvwINNXo_ZAM3lGs_jt5_iB0s","pdfSize":"718092","objectId":"0x5a8862702656bb10837cbe9fa72e6418a534d6a4a4eca7b350d544f70b40e9ae","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
