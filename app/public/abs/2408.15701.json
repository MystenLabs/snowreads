In its standard form, DA uses the arithmetic mean and\nsample covariance matrix to estimate the center and scatter of each class. We\ndiscuss and illustrate how this makes standard DA very sensitive to suspicious\ndata points, such as outliers and mislabeled cases. We then present an overview\nof techniques for robust DA, which are more reliable in the presence of\ndeviating cases. In particular, we review DA based on robust estimates of\nlocation and scatter, along with graphical diagnostic tools for visualizing the\nresults of DA.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
