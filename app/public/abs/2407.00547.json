Assuming a regular and spherically symmetric background,\nspecifically a regular black hole solution, the energy-momentum tensor is\ncalculated. Using the Thermo Field Dynamics (TFD) formalism and its topological\nstructure, the corresponding Stefan-Boltzmann law and Casimir effect are\ninvestigated. The results for the regular black hole are compared with those\nobtained for the Schwarzschild black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hmrW00ldghaZ-y64Ejb3PbOv7Iq9WuE2PpbXydItW34","pdfSize":"578429"}
