Many fields,\nsuch as supply chain management, weather and meteorology, energy markets, and\nfinance, have pivoted towards using probabilistic forecasts, which yields the\nneed not only for accurate learning of the expected value but also for learning\nthe conditional heteroskedasticity and conditional distribution moments.\nAgainst this backdrop, we present a methodology for online estimation of\nregularized, linear distributional models. The proposed algorithm is based on a\ncombination of recent developments for the online estimation of LASSO models\nand the well-known GAMLSS framework. We provide a case study on day-ahead\nelectricity price forecasting, in which we show the competitive performance of\nthe incremental estimation combined with strongly reduced computational effort.\nOur algorithms are implemented in a computationally efficient Python package.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
