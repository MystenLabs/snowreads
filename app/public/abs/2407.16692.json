Of particular interest is the case of Neumann and Robin boundary\nconditions which is known to lead to stable Universe in Einstein-Hilbert\ngravity in four spacetime dimensions. After setting up the variational problem\nand computing the necessary boundary terms, the transition amplitude can be\nexactly computed in the mini-superspace approximation. The $\\hbar\\to0$ limit\nbrings out the dominant pieces in the path-integral which is traced to an\ninitial configuration corresponding to Hartle-Hawking no-boundary Universe. A\ndeeper study involving Picard-Lefschetz methods not only allow us to find the\nintegration contour along which the path-integral becomes convergent but also\naids in understanding the crossover from Euclidean to Lorentzian signature.\nSaddle analysis further highlights the boundary configurations giving dominant\ncontribution to the path-integral which is seen to be those corresponding to\nHartle-Hawking no-boundary proposal and agrees with the exact computation. To\nensure completeness, a comparison with the results from Wheeler-DeWitt equation\nis done.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
