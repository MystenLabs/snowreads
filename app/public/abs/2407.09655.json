We show how to use the resulting oracle simulation to bound the\nsuccess probability of an algorithm for any predicate on input-output pairs, a\nkey feature of Zhandry's technique that had hitherto resisted attempts at\ngeneralization to random permutations. One key technical ingredient is to use\nstrictly monotone factorizations to represent the permutation in the oracle's\ndatabase. As an application of our framework, we show that the one-round sponge\nconstruction is unconditionally preimage resistant in the random permutation\nmodel. This proves a conjecture by Unruh.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
