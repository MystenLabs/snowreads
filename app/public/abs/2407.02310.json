Initial\nstudies report the capability of LLMs to support process analysis and even, to\nsome extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This latter\nproperty suggests that LLMs could also be used to tackle process mining tasks\nthat benefit from an understanding of process behavior. Examples of such tasks\ninclude (semantic) anomaly detection and next activity prediction, which both\ninvolve considerations of the meaning of activities and their inter-relations.\nIn this paper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to tackle such\nsemantics-aware process mining tasks. Furthermore, whereas most works on the\nintersection of LLMs and process mining only focus on testing these models out\nof the box, we provide a more principled investigation of the utility of LLMs\nfor process mining, including their ability to obtain process mining knowledge\npost-hoc by means of in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning.\nConcretely, we define three process mining tasks that benefit from an\nunderstanding of process semantics and provide extensive benchmarking datasets\nfor each of them. Our evaluation experiments reveal that (1) LLMs fail to solve\nchallenging process mining tasks out of the box and when provided only a\nhandful of in-context examples, (2) but they yield strong performance when\nfine-tuned for these tasks, consistently surpassing smaller, encoder-based\nlanguage models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
