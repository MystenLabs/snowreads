To establish a reliable\ncommunication link between implanted devices, the preambles play a crucial role\nby e.g. conveying syncronization information or supporting channel response\nestimation. The preambles are carefully designed to ensure that they are\nmutually orthogonal, to minimize self-interference and maximize separability.\nFor that purpose, many permeable sequences are proposed in the literature for\n5G and sensor networks. Golay code, Constant Amplitude Zero Auto Correlation\n(CAZAC) and Zadoff-Chu (Z-Chu) sequences are among the most popular ones. In\nthis work, we performed a comparative analysis of these sequences to determine\ntheir suitability for the GC-IBC system. We evaluated the effectiveness of the\npreamble sequences on the basis of their correlation properties and probability\nof error.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Xj7XERnRTlpabdpvfi-5MxaHBo2zkoS5nLbPIeiqYsE","pdfSize":"1428609"}
