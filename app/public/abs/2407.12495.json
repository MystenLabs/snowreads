We demonstrate that, typically, it is enough to take a few first\nterms of this infinite sum to obtain an excellent approximation to the\ncorrelation function at any time, with the large time behavior being determined\nsolely by the first pseudomode. The pseudomode expansion emerges in the\nframework of the Heisenberg version of the recursion method. This method\nessentially solves Heisenberg equations in a Lanczos tridiagonal basis\nconstructed in the Krylov space of a given observable. To obtain pseudomodes,\nwe first add artificial dissipation satisfying the dissipative generalization\nof the universal operator growth hypothesis, and then take the limit of the\nvanishing dissipation strength. Fast convergence of the pseudomode expansion is\nfacilitated by the localization in the Krylov space, which is generic in the\npresence of dissipation and can survive the limit of the vanishing dissipation\nstrength. As an illustration, we apply the pseudomode expansion to calculate\ninfinite-temperature autocorrelation functions in the quantum Ising and $XX$\nspin-$1/2$ models on the square lattice.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iUg0Fdm9raAq_2bQLVZ5NItvYIFtQBMvbugDTXRMfG8","pdfSize":"551217"}
