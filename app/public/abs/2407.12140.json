We have shown\nfor the ramp crosses a single quantum critical point, while the short-range\npairing Kitaev model displays a single critical time scale, the long-range\npairing induces a region with three DQPTs time scales. We have found that the\nregion with three DQPTs time scales shrinks in the presence of the noise. In\naddition, we have uncovered for a quench crossess two critical points, the\ncritical sweep velocity above which the DQPTs disappear, enhances by the\nlong-range pairing exponent while decreases in the presence of the noise. On\nthe basis of numerical simulations, we have shown that noise diminishes the\nlong-range pairing inductions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
