A crucial prerequisite for\nthe outstanding performance of GNNs is the availability of complete graph\ninformation, i.e., node features and graph structure, which is frequently unmet\nin real-world scenarios since graphs are often incomplete due to various\nuncontrollable factors. Existing approaches only focus on dealing with either\nincomplete features or incomplete structure, which leads to performance loss\ninevitably. To address this issue, this study proposes a mutual dual-stream\ngraph neural network (MDS-GNN), which implements a mutual benefit learning\nbetween features and structure. Its main ideas are as follows: a)\nreconstructing the missing node features based on the initial incomplete graph\nstructure; b) generating an augmented global graph based on the reconstructed\nnode features, and propagating the incomplete node features on this global\ngraph; and c) utilizing contrastive learning to make the dual-stream process\nmutually benefit from each other. Extensive experiments on six real-world\ndatasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed MDS-GNN on incomplete\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
