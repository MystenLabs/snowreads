We present a systematic and detailed construction of\na metric representation for locally distorted metric spaces that captures\ncomplex data structures more accurately than the previous schemes. Our approach\naddresses limitations in existing methods by accommodating non-uniform data\ndistributions and intricate local geometries. We validate its performance\nthrough extensive experiments on examples of various geometric objects and\nbenchmark real-world datasets, demonstrating significant improvements in\nrepresentation quality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Z4IXxbi38zHZW91egp1ScjMcuDBp-T7cps75jFltxOQ","pdfSize":"19078120"}
