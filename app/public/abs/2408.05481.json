To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core\nidea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation\nincorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic\nformulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the\nworld via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by\nthe electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic\nfield at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion\nof individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"s9ADz8OE_pDYH2b6FroHytfOv47HbGGbpPSLz0K1PK0","pdfSize":"11295539"}
