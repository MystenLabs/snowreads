In this paper, we focus on medical\ntemporal variation modeling, \\emph{i.e.,} cuffless blood pressure (BP)\nmonitoring which has great value in cardiovascular healthcare. Although\nproviding a comfortable user experience, such methods are suffering from the\ndemand for a significant amount of realistic data to train an individual model\nfor each subject, especially considering the invasive or obtrusive BP\nground-truth measurements. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a novel\nphysics-informed temporal network~(PITN) with adversarial contrastive learning\nto enable precise BP estimation with very limited data. Specifically, we first\nenhance the physics-informed neural network~(PINN) with the temporal block for\ninvestigating BP dynamics' multi-periodicity for personal cardiovascular cycle\nmodeling and temporal variation. We then employ adversarial training to\ngenerate extra physiological time series data, improving PITN's robustness in\nthe face of sparse subject-specific training data. Furthermore, we utilize\ncontrastive learning to capture the discriminative variations of cardiovascular\nphysiologic phenomena. This approach aggregates physiological signals with\nsimilar blood pressure values in latent space while separating clusters of\nsamples with dissimilar blood pressure values. Experiments on three\nwidely-adopted datasets with different modailties (\\emph{i.e.,} bioimpedance,\nPPG, millimeter-wave) demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of the\nproposed methods over previous state-of-the-art approaches.
