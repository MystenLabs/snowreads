Key to the safety of money markets is the implementation of interest\nrates that determine the cost of borrowing, and govern counterparty exposure\nand return. In traditional markets, interest rates are set by risk managers,\nportfolio managers, the Federal Reserve, and a myriad of other sources\ndepending on the market function. DeFi enables an algorithmic approach that\ntypically relies on interest rates being directly dependent on market\nutilization. The benefit of algorithmic interest rate management is the\nsystem's continual response to market behaviors in real time, and thus an\ninherent ability to mitigate risks on behalf of protocols and users. These\ninterest rate strategies target an optimal utilization based on the protocol's\nrisk threshold, but historically lack the ability to compensate for excessive\nor diminished utilization over time. This research investigates contemporary\nDeFi interest rate management strategies and their limitations. Furthermore,\nthis paper introduces a time-weighted approach to interest rate management that\nimplements a Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) control system to\nconstantly adapt to market utilization patterns, addressing observed\nlimitations.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
