{"id":"2407.00296","title":"SolarSAM: Building-scale Photovoltaic Potential Assessment Based on\n  Segment Anything Model (SAM) and Remote Sensing for Emerging City","authors":"Guohao Wang","authorsParsed":[["Wang","Guohao",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 29 Jun 2024 03:29:27 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-02","timestamp":1719631767000,"abstract":"  Driven by advancements in photovoltaic (PV) technology, solar energy has\nemerged as a promising renewable energy source, due to its ease of integration\nonto building rooftops, facades, and windows. For the emerging cities, the lack\nof detailed street-level data presents a challenge for effectively assessing\nthe potential of building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV). To address this, this\nstudy introduces SolarSAM, a novel BIPV evaluation method that leverages remote\nsensing imagery and deep learning techniques, and an emerging city in northern\nChina is utilized to validate the model performance. During the process,\nSolarSAM segmented various building rooftops using text prompt guided semantic\nsegmentation. Separate PV models were then developed for Rooftop PV,\nFacade-integrated PV, and PV windows systems, using this segmented data and\nlocal climate information. The potential for BIPV installation, solar power\ngeneration, and city-wide power self-sufficiency were assessed, revealing that\nthe annual BIPV power generation potential surpassed the city's total\nelectricity consumption by a factor of 2.5. Economic and environmental analysis\nwere also conducted, including levelized cost of electricity and carbon\nreduction calculations, comparing different BIPV systems across various\nbuilding categories. These findings demonstrated the model's performance and\nreveled the potential of BIPV power generation in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
