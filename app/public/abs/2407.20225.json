We analytically solve this theory and\ndemonstrate that the mass gap in the continuum limit matches the well-known\ncontinuum formula. Our formulation preserves topological features such as the\nquantization of the Chern-Simons level, the degeneracy of energy eigenstates,\nthe non-trivial properties of Wilson loops, and the mutual and self statistics\nof anyons. This work lays the groundwork for future Hamiltonian-based\nsimulations of Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory on classical and quantum computers.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
