Furthermore, integrating lossy compression with\nmulti-resolution techniques to further boost storage efficiency encounters\nsignificant barriers. To this end, we introduce an innovative workflow that\nfacilitates high-quality multi-resolution data compression for both uniform and\nAMR simulations. Initially, to extend the usability of multi-resolution\ntechniques, our workflow employs a compression-oriented Region of Interest\n(ROI) extraction method, transforming uniform data into a multi-resolution\nformat. Subsequently, to bridge the gap between multi-resolution techniques and\nlossy compressors, we optimize three distinct compressors, ensuring their\noptimal performance on multi-resolution data. Lastly, we incorporate an\nadvanced uncertainty visualization method into our workflow to understand the\npotential impacts of lossy compression. Experimental evaluation demonstrates\nthat our workflow achieves significant compression quality improvements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
