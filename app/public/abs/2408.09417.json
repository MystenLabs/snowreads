Beyond conventional magnons, while theoretical\nstudies have predicted magnons associated with orbital magnetic moments, their\ndirect observation has remained challenging. Here, we present the discovery of\ntwo distinct terahertz orbitally-coupled magnon resonances in the topological\nkagome ferromagnet Co3Sn2S2. Using time-resolved Kerr rotation spectroscopy, we\npinpoint two magnon resonances at 0.61 and 0.49 THz at 6 K, surpassing all\npreviously reported magnon resonances in ferromagnets due to strong\nmagnetocrystalline anisotropy. These dual modes originate from the strong\ncoupling of localized spin and orbital magnetic moments. These findings unveil\na novel category of magnons stemming from orbital magnetic moments, and\nposition Co3Sn2S2 as a promising candidate for high-speed terahertz spintronic\napplications\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
