Existing ICMH methods are limited by high training\nand storage overheads due to heavy design of task-specific networks. To address\nthis issue, in this paper, we develop a novel lightweight adapter-based tuning\nframework for ICMH, named Adapt-ICMH, that better balances task performance and\nbitrates with reduced overheads. We propose a spatial-frequency modulation\nadapter (SFMA) that simultaneously eliminates non-semantic redundancy with a\nspatial modulation adapter, and enhances task-relevant frequency components and\nsuppresses task-irrelevant frequency components with a frequency modulation\nadapter. The proposed adapter is plug-and-play and compatible with almost all\nexisting learned image compression models without compromising the performance\nof pre-trained models. Experiments demonstrate that Adapt-ICMH consistently\noutperforms existing ICMH frameworks on various machine vision tasks with fewer\nfine-tuned parameters and reduced computational complexity.
