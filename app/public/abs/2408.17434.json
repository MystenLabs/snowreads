Several different\nrecordings could be found for many events. Such recordings are usually noisy,\nwhere noise for each device is local and unrelated to others. This case of\nmultiple microphones at unknown locations, capturing local, uncorrelated noise,\nwas rarely treated in the literature. In this work we propose a simple and\neffective crowdsourced audio enhancement method to remove local noises at each\ninput audio signal. Then, averaging all cleaned source signals gives an\nimproved audio of the event. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method\nusing synthetic audio signals, together with real-world recordings. This simple\napproach can set a new baseline for crowdsourced audio enhancement for more\nsophisticated methods which we hope will be developed by the research\ncommunity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
