Leveraging a diverse dataset encompassing\nthermal conductivity, the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivity, and the\nfigure of merit (ZT), the study demonstrates superior predictive performance of\nthe stacking Model, outperforming individual base models with high R2 values.\nKey features such as temperature, mean Covalent Radius, and average deviation\nof the Gibbs energy per atom emerge as critical influencers, highlighting their\npivotal roles in optimizing thermoelectric behavior. The unification of Random\nForest and XGBoost in the stacking model effectively captures nuanced\nrelationships, offering a holistic understanding of thermoelectric performance\nin Half Heusler alloys. This work advances predictive modelling in\nthermoelectricity and provides valuable insights for strategic material design,\npaving the way for enhanced efficiency and performance in thermoelectric\napplications. The ensemble modelling framework, coupled with insightful feature\nselection and meticulous engineering, establishes a robust foundation for\nfuture research in pursuing high-performance thermoelectric materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
