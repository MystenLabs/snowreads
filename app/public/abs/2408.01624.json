At each update\ntime, two random agents are selected, and the opinion of the first agent is\nupdated based on the opinion of the second (the ``persuader''). We derive the\nmean-field kinetic equation describing the large population limit of the model,\nand we provide several quantitative results establishing convergence to the\nunique equilibrium distribution. Surprisingly, in some range of the model\nparameters, the support of the equilibrium distribution exhibits a fractal\nstructure. This provides a new mathematical description for the so-called\nopinion fragmentation phenomenon.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
