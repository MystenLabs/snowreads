We show that from these\ndata alone we can determine the value of $a$ with better precision than so far\ndetermined, and the value of $r_0$ for the first time. The addition of the $K^-\np \\to \\eta \\Lambda$ data allows us to improve the precision of these\nmagnitudes, with errors smaller than $15\\%$. We also determine with high\nprecision the pole position of the $\\Lambda(1670)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
