The verifier sends the questions $x$, $y$\nand $z$ to the players Alice, Bob and Charlie respectively, receives answers\n$f(x)$, $g(y)$ and $h(z)$ that are elements in $\\mathcal{A}$ and accepts if\n$f(x)+g(y)+h(z) = t(x,y,z)$. The value, $\\mathsf{val}(\\mathcal{G})$, of the\ngame is defined to be the maximum probability the verifier accepts over all\nplayers' strategies.\n  We show that if $\\mathcal{G}$ is a $3$-$\\mathsf{XOR}$ game with value\nstrictly less than $1$, whose underlying distribution over questions $\\mu$ does\nnot admit Abelian embeddings into $(\\mathbb{Z},+)$, then the value of the\n$n$-fold repetition of $\\mathcal{G}$ is exponentially decaying. That is, there\nexists $c=c(\\mathcal{G})>0$ such that $\\mathsf{val}(\\mathcal{G}^{\\otimes\nn})\\leq 2^{-cn}$. This extends a previous result of [Braverman-Khot-Minzer,\nFOCS 2023] showing exponential decay for the GHZ game. Our proof combines tools\nfrom additive combinatorics and tools from discrete Fourier analysis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
