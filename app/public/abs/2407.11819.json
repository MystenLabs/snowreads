This is\nbecause strings can easily encode data arising from different sources. It is\noften crucial to represent such string datasets in a compact form but also to\nsimultaneously enable fast pattern matching queries. This is the classic text\nindexing problem. The four absolute measures anyone should pay attention to\nwhen designing or implementing a text index are: (i) index space; (ii) query\ntime; (iii) construction space; and (iv) construction time. Unfortunately,\nhowever, most (if not all) widely-used indexes (e.g., suffix tree, suffix\narray, or their compressed counterparts) are not optimized for all four\nmeasures simultaneously, as it is difficult to have the best of all four\nworlds. Here, we take an important step in this direction by showing that text\nindexing with sampling based on locally consistent anchors (lc-anchors) offers\nremarkably good performance in all four measures, when we have at hand a lower\nbound $\\ell$ on the length of the queried patterns -- which is arguably a quite\nreasonable assumption in practical applications. Our index offers average-case\nguarantees. In our experiments using real benchmark datasets, we show that it\ncompares favorably based on the four measures to all classic indexes:\n(compressed) suffix tree; (compressed) suffix array; and the FM-index. Notably,\nwe also present a counterpart of our index with worst-case guarantees based on\nthe lc-anchors notion of partitioning sets. To the best of our knowledge, this\nis the first index achieving the best of all worlds in the regime where we have\nat hand a lower bound $\\ell$ on the length of the queried patterns.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
