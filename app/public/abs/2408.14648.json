{"id":"2408.14648","title":"Induced Saturation of the Poset 2C_2","authors":"Ryan R Martin and Nick Veldt","authorsParsed":[["Martin","Ryan R",""],["Veldt","Nick",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 26 Aug 2024 21:24:21 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-28","timestamp":1724707461000,"abstract":"  Given a set $X$, the power set $\\mathbb{P}(X)$, and a finite poset $P$, a\nfamily $F\\subset \\mathbb{P}(X)$ is said to be induced-$P$-free if there is no\ninjection $\\phi: P\\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}(X)$ such that\n$\\phi(p)\\subseteq\\phi(q)$ if and only if $p\\leq_{P} q$. The family $F$ is\ninduced-$P$-saturated if it is maximal with respect to being induced-$P$-free.\nIf $n=|X|$, then the size of the smallest induced-$P$-saturated family in\n$\\mathbb{P}(X)$ is denoted $sat(n,P)$.\n  The poset $2C_2$ is two disjoint 2-chains (the Hasse diagram is two\nvertex-disjoint edges) and Keszegh, Lemons, Martin, P\\'alv\\\"olgyi, and Patk\\'os\nproved that $n+2\\leq sat(n,2C_2)\\leq 2n$ and gave one isomorphism class of an\ninduced-$2C_2$-saturated family that achieves the upper bound.\n  We show that the lower bound can be improved to $3n/2 + 1/2$ by examining the\nnecessary structure of a saturated family. In addition, we provide many\nexamples of induced-$2C_2$-saturated families of size $2n$ in $\\mathbb{P}(X)$\nwhere $|X|=n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
