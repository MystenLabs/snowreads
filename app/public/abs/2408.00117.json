The two-stage method for object pose\nestimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural\nnetwork-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point\n(PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods'\nrobustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on\ntheir local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust\nestimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform\nthe certification of local robustness into neural network verification for\nclassification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output\nspecifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate\nverification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear\noperations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of\ninjecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull\nrepresentation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict\nsemantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we\npropagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then\nformulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the\nsetting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each\npixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear,\nclassification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we\ndemonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both\nsound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on\nrealistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify\nthe robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in\nreal-world scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wGD1jqOy4dBQZviXIcOJ6E8fi1awTDgHWF9HcVj-Ams","pdfSize":"31026163","txDigest":"Ev3LyjHSYVctqNrfcxd7Zuwe4p5ZFNd8EGyhS4jy8x7u","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
