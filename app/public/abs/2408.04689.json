Among other criteria, a QMS shall help to i) identify, analyze,\nevaluate, and mitigate risks, ii) ensure evidence of compliance with training,\nvalidation, and testing data, and iii) verify and document the AI system design\nand quality. Current research mainly addresses conceptual considerations and\nframework designs for AI risk assessment and auditing processes. However, it\noften overlooks practical tools that actively involve and support humans in\nchecking and documenting high-risk or general-purpose AI systems. This paper\naddresses this gap by proposing requirements derived from legal regulations and\na generic design and architecture of a QMS for AI systems verification and\ndocumentation. A first version of a prototype QMS is implemented, integrating\nLLMs as examples of AI systems and focusing on an integrated risk management\nsub-service. The prototype is evaluated on i) a user story-based qualitative\nrequirements assessment using potential stakeholder scenarios and ii) a\ntechnical assessment of the required GPU storage and performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
