Increased spatial diversity in CFmMIMO is achieved by spreading the\nantennas into small access points (APs), which cooperate to serve the users.\nSequential fronthaul topologies in CFmMIMO, such as the daisy chain and\nmulti-branch tree topology, have gained considerable attention recently. In\nsuch a processing architecture, each AP must store its received signal vector\nin the memory until it receives the relevant information from the previous AP\nin the sequence to refine the estimate of the users' signal vector in the\nuplink. In this paper, we adopt vector-wise and element-wise compression on the\nraw or pre-processed received signal vectors to store them in the memory. We\ninvestigate the impact of the limited memory capacity in the APs on the optimal\nnumber of APs. We show that with no memory constraint, having single-antenna\nAPs is optimal, especially as the number of users grows. However, a limited\nmemory at the APs restricts the depth of the sequential processing pipeline.\nFurthermore, we investigate the relation between the memory capacity at the APs\nand the rate of the fronthaul link.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
