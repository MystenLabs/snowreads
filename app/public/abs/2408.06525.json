We provide the details on the\nnon-convex nature of the GW optimization problem that imply NP-hardness of the\nGW distance between finite spaces for any instance of an input data. We further\nillustrate the non-convexity of the problem with several explicit examples.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dVzewKlViR0Ku8VIaVz8pL0iwvhF4fAPWBa0wYmYyGk","pdfSize":"954885"}
