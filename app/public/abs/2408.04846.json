To date, the historical reliance on\nlegacy techniques has circumscribed possible integration of big data knowledge\nand exhibits sub-optimal efficiency for certain PDE formulations, while\ndata-driven neural methods typically lack mathematical guarantee of convergence\nand correctness. This paper articulates a mathematically rigorous neural solver\nfor linear PDEs. The proposed UGrid solver, built upon the principled\nintegration of U-Net and MultiGrid, manifests a mathematically rigorous proof\nof both convergence and correctness, and showcases high numerical accuracy, as\nwell as strong generalization power to various input geometry/values and\nmultiple PDE formulations. In addition, we devise a new residual loss metric,\nwhich enables unsupervised training and affords more stability and a larger\nsolution space over the legacy losses.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jKVKG2KoaZKdOL17QsDsiCLFFYbHWC3mvJ9mLeY3HdQ","pdfSize":"4494065"}
