The state-of-the-art quantum algorithm for this\nproblem is due to Costa, An, Sanders, Su, Babbush, and Berry (2022), with\noptimal query complexity $\\Theta(\\kappa)$. An important question left is\nwhether parallelism can bring further optimization. In this paper, we study the\nlimitation of parallel quantum computing on this problem. We show that any\nquantum algorithm for solving systems of linear equations with time complexity\n$\\operatorname{poly}(\\log(N), \\kappa)$ has a lower bound of $\\Omega(\\kappa)$ on\nthe depth of queries, which is tight up to a constant factor.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
