Inspired by the fact that Toda hierarchy is 2--component\ngeneralization of usual KP hierarchy, mToda hierarchy is constructed from\nbilinear equations of 2--component 1st modified KP hierarchy, where we provide\nthe corresponding equivalence with Lax formulations. Then it is demonstrated\nthat there are Miura links between Toda and mToda hierarchies, which means the\ndefinition of mToda hierarchy here is reasonable. Finally, Darboux\ntransformations of the Toda and mToda hierarchies are also constructed by using\nthe aforementioned Miura links.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
