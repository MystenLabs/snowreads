We study the probability of successful conveyance of a particle\ntrapping in a potential-well, i.e., survival probability in the process\ncarrying of the particle for a given length within a given fixed time. For the\nactual motion of conveyance, we need to accelerate the particle to move and\nthen decelerate it to stop at the destination. First, the relaxation of the\nsurvival probability in a constant acceleration rate is studied in detail by\ndirect numerical calculation, the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method, and a\nmethod of the resonance states. The survival probability was found to show an\nexponential decay in a long time, which is analyzed from a viewpoint of\neigenvalue problem. An important source of drop-off comes from a non-analytic\nchange of velocity at the starting point. When the rested particle begins to\nmove, the ground state of the rest frame is redistributed to eigenstates of the\nmoving frame, and then, each eigenstate of the moving frame evolves in time.\nThe dephasing of wavefunctions of the distributed populations reduces the\nprobability of successful conveyance. In general, a smooth start gives a small\ninitial disturbance but requires a large acceleration during the process to\nreach the destination in the fixed time which causes a larger drop-off in the\nprocess. Considering these conflicting facts, we study the survival probability\nin concrete conveyance schemes. We observe the time evolution of the trapped\nprobability and the population distribution during the conveyance process. In\ncases that the potential-well has several bound states, we propose a method to\nselect the particle trapped at the ground state by making use of the difference\nof survival probabilities of bound states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
