We provide a representation for its stationary\ndistribution as a marginal of the top layer of a two-layer ensemble under\nLiggett's condition. The representation is valid in the fan region and in the\nshock region, extending the representation previously obtained in\n[Bryc-Zatitskii-2024 arXiv:2403.03275] to ASEP. We also give a recursion for\nthe two-layer weight function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
