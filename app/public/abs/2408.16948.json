We show that the analogous statement about\ngeometrically essential surfaces is untrue. We then introduce new numerical\ninvariants, the algebraic and geometric essence of a spanning surface $F\\subset\nS^3$, which measure how far $F$ is from being compressible, and we extend\nOzawa's theorem by showing that plumbing respects the algebraic version of this\nnew invariant. We also introduce a ``twisted'' generalization of plumbing and\nuse it to compute essence for many examples, including checkerboard surfaces\nfrom reduced alternating diagrams. Finally, we extend all of these results to\nplumbings and twisted plumbings of spanning surfaces in arbitrary 3-manifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
