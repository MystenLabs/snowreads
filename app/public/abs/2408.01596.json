As\nmachine learning permeates various aspects of daily life, individuals and\norganizations increasingly interact with these systems, exhibiting a wide range\nof social and adversarial behaviors. These behaviors may have a notable impact\non the behavior and performance of machine learning systems. Specifically,\nduring these interactions, data may be generated by strategic individuals,\ncollected by self-interested data collectors, possibly poisoned by adversarial\nattackers, and used to create predictors, models, and policies satisfying\nmultiple objectives. As a result, the machine learning systems' outputs might\ndegrade, such as the susceptibility of deep neural networks to adversarial\nexamples (Shafahi et al., 2018; Szegedy et al., 2013) and the diminished\nperformance of classic algorithms in the presence of strategic individuals\n(Ahmadi et al., 2021). Addressing these challenges is imperative for the\nsuccess of machine learning in societal settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"iSklb5PSFn6ejU1EJCvz_AS2x2dROMx6sNFYu2dObIY","pdfSize":"5533222","txDigest":"3Rc3BVmkVa6WEqyB5mgj5Swqbgu7VzEehtvLqWKkMFfG","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
