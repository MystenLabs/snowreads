Nevertheless, even the optimal route\nconfigurations are provided to individual drivers, it is hard to achieve as\ngreedy drivers may switch to other routes for a lower individual cost. Recent\nresearch uses mean-field cavity approach from the studies of spin glasses to\nanalyze the impact of path switching in optimized transportation networks.\nHowever, this method only provides a mean-field approximation, which does not\ntake into account the collective herd behavior in path switching due to\nun-coordinated individual decisions. In this study, we propose an exhaustive\ncavity approach to investigate the impact of un-coordinated path switching in a\nre-routing game and reveal that greedy drivers' decision can be highly\ncorrelated which leads to the failure of mean-fielded approaches. Our\ntheoretical results fits well with simulations, and our developed framework can\nbe generalized to analyze other games with multiple players and rounds. Our\nresults shed light on the impact of herd behavior of un-coordinated human\ndrivers in suppressing congestions through path coordination.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
