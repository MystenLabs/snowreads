Recently, the\nLarge High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported measurements of\ndiffuse $\\gamma$-rays from the Galactic plane with energies ranging from\nsub-TeV to 1 PeV. Using publicly available 7 years of IceCube track data with\nthe full detector, we conduct a template search using the $\\gamma$-ray flux map\nobserved by LHAASO-KM2A as the neutrino emission template and perform a scan\nsearch of the Galactic plane. In the template search, a mild excess of\nneutrinos is observed in the Galactic plane with a pretrial significance of\n$1.9\\sigma$. The measured muon neutrino intensity at 25 TeV is\n$4.73^{+2.53}_{-2.51}\\times10^{-14}\\,{\\rm TeV^{-1}\\,cm^{-2}\\,s^{-1}\\,sr^{-1}}$,\nconsistent with the expected neutrino flux assuming that all the diffuse\nGalactic $\\gamma$-rays originate from hadronic interactions. In the Galactic\nplane scan search, the most significant location is found at $l=63.57^{\\circ}$\nand $b=0.93^{\\circ}$ with a pretrial (posttrial) significance of $4.6\\sigma$\n($1.8\\sigma$).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8bYIT8P_OKIhijUMk25wcDl7yx532IVKkewc2URpk7s","pdfSize":"2381219"}
