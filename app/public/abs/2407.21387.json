This article studies the comparison of the weighted\nkappa coefficients of two binary diagnostic tests subject to a paired design\nthrough confidence intervals. Three asymptotic confidence intervals are studied\nfor the difference between the parameters and five other intervals for the\nratio. Simulation experiments were carried out to study the coverage\nprobabilities and the average lengths of the intervals, giving some general\nrules for application. A method is also proposed to calculate the sample size\nnecessary to compare the two weighted kappa coefficients through a confidence\ninterval. A program in R has been written to solve the problem studied and it\nis available as supplementary material. The results were applied to a real\nexample of the diagnosis of malaria.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Other Statistics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JZhnZS9p0lXkaHVCfGtO510xTzzsGssCUNDYz9XgNc0","pdfSize":"681298","objectId":"0xd72bf1abf7cbdae28f9b3ea136fc70104838a67415f3072fc38d05f4437b8841","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
