We aim to precisely determine the radii and dynamical\nmasses of transiting planets orbiting the young M star AU Mic using public\nphotometric and spectroscopic datasets. We characterise the stellar activity\nand physical properties (radius, mass, density) of the transiting planets in\nthe young AU Mic system through joint transit and radial velocity fits with\nGaussian processes. We determine a radius of $R^{b}$= 4.79 +/- 0.29 R$_\\oplus$,\na mass of $M^{b}$= 9.0 +/- 2.7 M$_\\oplus$, and a bulk density of $\\rho^{b}$ =\n0.49 +/- 0.16 g cm$^{-3}$ for the innermost transiting planet AU Mic b. For the\nsecond known transiting planet, AU Mic c, we infer a radius of $R^{c}$= 2.79\n+/- 0.18 R$_\\oplus$, a mass of $M^{c}$= 14.5 +/- 3.4 M$_\\oplus$, and a bulk\ndensity of $\\rho^{c}$ = 3.90 +/- 1.17 g cm$^{-3}$. According to theoretical\nmodels, AU Mic b may harbour an H2 envelope larger than 5\\% by mass, with a\nfraction of rock and a fraction of water. AU Mic c could be made of rock and/or\nwater and may have an H2 atmosphere comprising at most 5\\% of its mass. AU Mic\nb has retained most of its atmosphere but might lose it over tens of millions\nof years due to the strong stellar radiation, while AU Mic c likely suffers\nmuch less photo-evaporation because it lies at a larger separation from its\nhost. Using all the datasets in hand, we determine a 3$\\sigma$ upper mass limit\nof $M^{[d]}\\sin{i}$ = 8.6 M$_{\\oplus}$ for the AU Mic 'd' TTV-candidate. In\naddition, we do not confirm the recently proposed existence of the planet\ncandidate AU Mic 'e' with an orbital period of 33.4 days.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-BSZbzB1yRg8tWY6tmmn4WZMHaK6HMKLRvSMwwDIGeA","pdfSize":"32434925"}
