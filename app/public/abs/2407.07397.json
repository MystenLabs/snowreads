Previous studies\nadvanced OSAHS evaluation through machine learning-based systems trained on\nsleep snoring or speech signal datasets. However, constructing datasets for\ntraining a precise and rapid OSAHS evaluation system poses a challenge, since\n1) it is time-consuming to collect sleep snores and 2) the speech signal is\nlimited in reflecting upper airway obstruction. In this paper, we propose a new\nsnoring dataset for OSAHS evaluation, named SimuSOE, in which a novel and\ntime-effective snoring collection method is introduced for tackling the above\nproblems. In particular, we adopt simulated snoring which is a type of snore\nintentionally emitted by patients to replace natural snoring. Experimental\nresults indicate that the simulated snoring signal during wakefulness can serve\nas an effective feature in OSAHS preliminary screening.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
