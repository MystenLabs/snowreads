High sensitivity in\nNV-based magnetic sensing requires a diamond sample with a high density of NV\ncenters and a long electron spin dephasing time. In this work, we propose a\nsystematic measurement method for determining the electron spin dephasing time\nof NV center ensembles and analyze the contributions to the dephasing time from\nvarious sources, including NV-NV interactions, strain distribution, $^{13}C$\nnuclear spin, and P1 electron spin. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our\nmethod on a series of high-performance diamond samples and provide a\ncomprehensive understanding of dephasing sources, enabling the optimization of\nNV-based quantum sensing applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3WC1LiEjSHzKfF1y58vCl4nrp4aWY9PSdityYOAQum0","pdfSize":"3191371"}
