The\napproach is demonstrated for one- and two-dimensional Ising models and we study\nthe dependence of the tensor renormalization group (TRG) on the form of the\ninitial tensors and their symmetries. We further introduce variants of several\ntensor renormalization algorithms. Our benchmarks reveal a significant\ndependence of various TRG algorithms on the choice of initial tensors and their\nsymmetries. However, we show that the boundary TRG technique can eliminate the\ninitial tensor dependence for all TRG methods. The numerical results of TRG\ncalculations can thus be made significantly more robust with only a few changes\nin the code. Furthermore, we study a three-dimensional $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge\ntheory without gauge-fixing and confirm the applicability of the initial tensor\nconstruction. Our method can straightforwardly be applied to systems with\nlonger range and multi-site interactions, such as the next-nearest neighbor\nIsing model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
