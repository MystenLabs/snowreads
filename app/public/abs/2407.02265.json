To alleviate the heavy burden, a\nnatural idea is to reuse the approved drug to treat new diseases. The process\nis also known as drug repurposing or drug repositioning. Machine learning\nmethods exhibited huge potential in automating drug repurposing. However, it\nstill encounter some challenges, such as lack of labels and multimodal feature\nrepresentation. To address these issues, we design DrugCLIP, a cutting-edge\ncontrastive learning method, to learn drug and disease's interaction without\nnegative labels. Additionally, we have curated a drug repurposing dataset based\non real-world clinical trial records. Thorough empirical studies are conducted\nto validate the effectiveness of the proposed DrugCLIP method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
