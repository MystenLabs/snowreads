Higgs boson\ndecays to pairs of tau leptons and pairs of leptonically decaying W bosons are\nconsidered. The search is performed using data collected from 2016 to 2018 by\nthe CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13\nTeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb${-1}$. Upper limits at\nthe 95% confidence level are placed on the signal strength for Higgs boson\nproduction in association with bottom quarks; the observed (expected) upper\nlimit is 3.7 (6.1) times the standard model prediction.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
