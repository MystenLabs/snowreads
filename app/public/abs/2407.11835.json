We interpret the known\nconstruction of its irreps, which are quasiparticles for the model, in a\ngeometric manner strictly analogous to the Wigner construction for the usual\nPoincar\\'e group of $\\Bbb R^{1,3}$. Irreps are labelled by pairs $(C, \\pi)$,\nwhere $C$ is a conjugacy class in the role of a mass-shell, and $\\pi$ is a\nrepresentation of the isotropy group $C_G$ in the role of spin. The geometric\npicture entails $D^\\vee(G)\\to \\Bbb C(C_G)\\blacktriangleright\\!\\!\\!\\!< \\Bbb C G$\nas a quantum homogeneous bundle where the base is $G/C_G$, and $D^\\vee(G)\\to\n\\Bbb C(G)$ as another homogeneous bundle where the base is the group algebra\n$\\Bbb C G$ as noncommutative spacetime. Analysis of the latter leads to a\nduality whereby the differential calculus and solutions of the wave equation on\n$\\Bbb C G$ are governed by irreps and conjugacy classes of $G$ respectively,\nwhile the same picture on $\\Bbb C(G)$ is governed by the reversed data.\nQuasiparticles as irreps of $D(G)$ also turn out to classify irreducible\nbicovariant differential structures $\\Omega^1_{C, \\pi}$ on $D^\\vee(G)$ and\nthese in turn correspond to braided-Lie algebras $\\mathcal{L}_{C, \\pi}$ in the\nbraided category of $G$-crossed modules, which we call `braided racks' and\nstudy. We show under mild assumptions that $U(\\mathcal{L}_{C,\\pi})$ quotients\nto a braided Hopf algebra $B_{C,\\pi}$ related by transmutation to a\ncoquasitriangular Hopf algebra $H_{C,\\pi}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
