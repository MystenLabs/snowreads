We study the preservation under Hadamard products of related\nproperties of significance in combinatorics. In particular, we show that ultra\nlog-concavity, $\\gamma$-positivity, and interlacing symmetric decompositions\nare preserved. Furthermore, we disprove a conjecture by Fischer and Kubitzke\n(2014) concerning the real-rootedness of Hadamard powers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
