One commonly used approach involves utilizing\nstructural causal models that postulate noisy functional relations among\ninteracting variables. A directed graph naturally represents these models and\nreflects the underlying causal structure. However, classical identifiability\nresults suggest that, without conducting additional experiments, this causal\ngraph can only be identified up to a Markov equivalence class of\nindistinguishable models. Recent research has shown that focusing on linear\nrelations with equal error variances can enable the identification of the\ncausal structure from mere observational data. Nonetheless, practitioners are\noften primarily interested in the effects of specific interventions, rendering\nthe complete identification of the causal structure unnecessary. In this work,\nwe investigate the extent to which less restrictive assumptions of partial\nhomoscedasticity are sufficient for identifying the causal effects of interest.\nFurthermore, we construct mathematically rigorous confidence regions for total\ncausal effects under structure uncertainty and explore the performance gain of\nrelying on stricter error assumptions in a simulation study.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
