The backbone of a\nDT, i.e. the concrete modelling methodologies and architectural frameworks\nsupporting these models, are complex, diverse and evolve fast, necessitating a\nthorough understanding of the latest state-of-the-art methods and trends to\nstay on top of a highly competitive market. From a research perspective,\ndespite the high research interest in reviewing various aspects of DTs,\nstructured literature reports specifically focusing on unravelling the utilized\nlearning paradigms (e.g. self-supervised learning) for DT-creation in the\nprocess industry are a novel contribution in this field. This study aims to\naddress these gaps by (1) systematically analyzing the modelling methodologies\n(e.g. Convolutional Neural Network, Encoder-Decoder, Hidden Markov Model) and\nparadigms (e.g. data-driven, physics-based, hybrid) used for DT-creation; (2)\nassessing the utilized learning strategies (e.g. supervised, unsupervised,\nself-supervised); (3) analyzing the type of modelling task (e.g. regression,\nclassification, clustering); and (4) identifying the challenges and research\ngaps, as well as, discuss potential resolutions provided.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
