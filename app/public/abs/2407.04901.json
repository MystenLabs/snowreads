For ground-state polar molecules dressed with a strong microwave\nfield, field-linked bound states can appear in the intermolecular potential. We\nmodel three-body recombination into such bound states using classical\ntrajectory calculations. Our results show that recombination can explain the\nenhanced loss rates observed at small microwave detunings in trapped samples of\nbosonic NaCs [Bigagli, $\\textit{et al.}$, Nat. Phys. $\\textbf{19}$ 1579-1584\n(2023)]. Specifically, our calculations reproduce the experimentally measured\nthree-body loss rates across a wide range of microwave Rabi couplings,\ndetunings, and temperatures. This work suggests that for bosonic shielded\nmolecular systems in which the two-body loss is sufficiently suppressed and a\nfield-linked bound state is present, the dominant loss process will be\nthree-body recombination.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"PtJ76pcmz65SF5PrcXA8H4ZwycCUpcZKYmXEuepjTTI","pdfSize":"2730873"}
