These\ncodes have demonstrated the ability to reduce the number of minimum weight\ncodewords, thereby closely achieving finite-block length capacity with\nsuccessive cancellation list (SCL) decoders in certain scenarios. However, when\nthe list size of the SCL decoder is small, which is crucial for low-latency\ncommunication applications, the reduction in the number of minimum weight\ncodewords does not necessarily improve decoding performance. To address this\nlimitation, we propose an alternative pre-transform technique to enhance the\nsuitability of polar codes for SCL decoders with practical list sizes.\nLeveraging the fact that the SCL decoding error event set can be decomposed\ninto two exclusive error event sets, our approach applies two different types\nof pre-transformations, each targeting the reduction of one of the two error\nevent sets. Extensive simulation results under various block lengths and code\nrates have demonstrated that our codes consistently outperform all existing\nstate-of-the-art pre-transformed polar codes, including CRC-aided polar codes\nand polarization-adjusted convolutional codes, when decoded using SCL decoders\nwith small list sizes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
