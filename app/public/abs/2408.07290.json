Based on the\nassumption that semiclassical gravity is valid in the vicinity of their\napparent horizons, we review their thermodynamic properties in static scenarios\nand demonstrate that 1-loop corrections to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy,\naccounting for the entanglement entropy of fields, depend on the regularization\nscheme used. Taking backreaction effects into consideration, we investigate\ntheir full dynamical evolution and we examine the behavior of the null energy\ncondition. We find that it is always violated in the vicinity of the outer\nhorizon while being satisfied in the vicinity of the inner horizon, which\nimplies that the trapped spacetime region, as determined from the behavior of\nnull geodesic congruences, is effectively separated into a null energy\ncondition-violating and a non-violating domain. Our findings suggest that\nquantum effects are more dominant close to the outer apparent horizon and\nbecome more pronounced towards the final stages of the evaporation process.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
