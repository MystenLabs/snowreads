The evolution of the two masses is described by a controlled\ntransport/continuity equation, where the control is given by the vector\nvelocity field. Our study is set in the framework of the viscosity solutions\ntheory in Hilbert spaces, and we prove the uniqueness of the value functions as\nsolutions of the Isaacs equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3xl24KrKgk1GZ_ISmpMasZ3Uwrdc3Vz6qN0Kn58QM9Q","pdfSize":"286166"}
