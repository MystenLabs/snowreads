This study proposed\na framework to analyze the performance of RIS-assisted free-space optics (FSO)\ncommunication over doubly inverted Gamma-Gamma (IGGG) distributions with\npointing error impairments. Furthermore, a special scenario addressing secure\ncommunication in the potential presence of an eavesdropper. Consequently, we\nderived closed-form expressions for the outage probability, average bit error\nrate, average channel capacity, average secrecy capacity, and secrecy outage\nprobability by employing an asymptotic analysis to provide deeper insights into\nthe influence of various system parameters. Finally, we verified our analytical\nresults through appropriate numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
