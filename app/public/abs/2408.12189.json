The famous Four Color Theorem, proved by\nAppel and Haken as well as Robertson et al., shows that every planar graph is\n$4$-colorable, i.e., every planar graph is packing $(1^4)$-colorable. The\nsquare coloring of planar graphs was first studied by Wegner in 1977.\nThomassen, and independently Hartke et al. proved one can always square color a\ncubic planar graph with $7$ colors, i.e., every subcubic planar graph is\npacking $(2^7)$-colorable. We focus on packing $(1^{\\ell}, 2^k)$-colorings,\nwhich lie between proper coloring and square coloring. Gastineau and Togni\nproved every subcubic graph is packing $(1,2^6)$-colorable. Furthermore, they\nasked whether every subcubic graph except the Petersen graph is packing\n$(1,2^5)$-colorable.\n  In this paper, we prove that every subcubic planar graph is packing\n$(1,2^5)$-colorable, extending the result of Thomassen and Hartke et al.. This\nalso answers the question of Gastineau and Togni affirmatively for subcubic\nplanar graphs. Moreover, we prove that there exists an infinite family of\nsubcubic planar graphs that are not packing $(1,2^4)$-colorable, which shows\nthat our result is the best possible. Besides, our result is also sharp in the\nsense that the disjoint union of Petersen graphs is subcubic and non-planar,\nbut not packing $(1,2^5)$-colorable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
