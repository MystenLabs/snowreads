Airports are considered a\nstrategic national asset, so protecting them from attacks, specifically\ncyberattacks, is a crucial mission. One way to increase airports' security is\nby using Digital Twins (DTs). This paper shows and demonstrates how DTs can\nenhance the security mission. The integration of DTs with Generative AI (GenAI)\nalgorithms can lead to synergy and new frontiers in fighting cyberattacks. The\npaper exemplifies ways to model cyberattack scenarios using simulations and\ngenerate synthetic data for testing defenses. It also discusses how DTs can be\nused as a crucial tool for vulnerability assessment by identifying weaknesses,\nprioritizing, and accelerating remediations in case of cyberattacks. Moreover,\nthe paper demonstrates approaches for anomaly detection and threat hunting\nusing Machine Learning (ML) and GenAI algorithms. Additionally, the paper\nprovides impact prediction and recovery coordination methods that can be used\nby DT operators and stakeholders. It also introduces ways to harness the human\nfactor by integrating training and simulation algorithms with Explainable AI\n(XAI) into the DT platforms. Lastly, the paper offers future applications and\ntechnologies that can be utilized in DT environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
