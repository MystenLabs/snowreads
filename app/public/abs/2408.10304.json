Using a combination\nof Bethe Ansatz (BA) and exact diagonalization (ED), we study the dynamics of\nboth the bulk and the impurity for the XXX (Heisenberg) and the XX qubit chains\nin the presence and absence of bulk noise. In the absence of noise, we show\nthat the impurity exhibits two distinct phases, the bound mode phase where the\nimpurity keeps oscillating in time, and the Kondo phase where it decays with\nKondo time $t_K$. Turning on the bulk dephasing noise, we find for the two\nmodels that in the long time limit in both regimes the quantum Zeno effect\ntakes place where the dynamics of the impurity magnetization slows down as the\nnoise strength $\\gamma$ increases. The impurity magnetization in the bound mode\nregime shows the opposite effect, decaying faster as the noise strength\nincreases for short times ($t \\ll 1/\\gamma$). We show that the bulk KPZ\ndynamics of the XXX model is converted to diffusive dynamics as in the XX case\nstudied before by V. Alba, driving both systems to the Zeno effect for the\nimpurity in the long time limit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
