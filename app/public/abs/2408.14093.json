We define products of such spaces, showing that they are\nreasonably well-behaved. In this manner, we provide the first example of a\nspace for which Reich's theorem holds and which is neither a CAT(0) space, nor\na convex subset of a normed space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
