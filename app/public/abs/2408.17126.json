It is well-known that the Necklace Splitting problem reduces to\nthe discrete Ham Sandwich problem. This reduction was crucial in the proof of\nPPA-completeness of the Ham Sandwich problem. Recently, Borzechowski, Schnider\nand Weber [ISAAC'23] introduced a variant of Necklace Splitting that similarly\nreduces to the $\\alpha$-Ham Sandwich problem, which lies in the complexity\nclass UEOPL but is not known to be complete. To make this reduction work, the\ninput necklace is guaranteed to be n-separable. They showed that these\nnecklaces can be fairly split in polynomial time and thus this subproblem\ncannot be used to prove UEOPL-hardness for $\\alpha$-Ham Sandwich. We consider\nthe more general unfair necklace splitting problem on n-separable necklaces,\ni.e., the problem of splitting these necklaces such that each thief gets a\ndesired fraction of each type of jewels. This more general problem is the\nnatural necklace-splitting-type version of $\\alpha$-Ham Sandwich, and its\ncomplexity status is one of the main open questions posed by Borzechowski,\nSchnider and Weber. We show that the unfair splitting problem is also\npolynomial-time solvable, and can thus also not be used to show UEOPL-hardness\nfor $\\alpha$-Ham Sandwich.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
