However, due to the characteristics of RDMA's\nretransmission strategy and the traffic mode of AI training, current load\nbalancing schemes for data center networks are unsuitable for RDMA. In this\npaper, we propose SeqBalance, a load balancing framework designed for RDMA.\nSeqBalance implements fine-grained load balancing for RDMA through a reasonable\ndesign and does not cause reordering problems. SeqBalance's designs are all\nbased on existing commercial RNICs and commercial programmable switches, so\nthey are compatible with existing data center networks. We have implemented\nSeqBalance in Mellanox CX-6 RNICs and Tofino switches. The results of hardware\ntestbed experiments and large-scale simulations show that compared with\nexisting load balancing schemes, SeqBalance improves 18.7% and 33.2% on average\nFCT and 99th percentile FCT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
