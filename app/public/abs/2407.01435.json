The project employs advanced object detection, the\nsystem utilizes the Mobile Net SSD model for real-time animal classification.\nThe methodology initiates with the creation of a dataset, where each animal is\nrepresented by annotated images. The SSD Mobile Net architecture facilitates\nthe use of a model for image classification and object detection. The model\nundergoes fine-tuning and optimization during training, enhancing accuracy for\nprecise animal classification. Real-time detection is achieved through a webcam\nand the OpenCV library, enabling prompt identification and categorization of\napproaching animals. By seamlessly integrating intelligent scarecrow technology\nwith object detection, this system offers a robust solution to field\nprotection, minimizing crop damage and promoting precision farming. It\nrepresents a valuable contribution to agricultural sustainability, addressing\nthe challenge of wildlife interference with crops. The implementation of the\nIntelligent Scarecrow Monitoring System stands as a progressive tool for\nproactive field management and protection, empowering farmers with an advanced\nsolution for precision agriculture.\n  Keywords: Machine learning, Deep Learning, Computer Vision, MobileNet SSD\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
