We also introduce Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) in the SAA setup to\nenhance the computational efficiency of solving optimization problems. In this\ncontext, we conduct a thorough analysis, exploiting Cram\\'er's large deviation\ntheory, to establish uniform convergence, quantify the convergence rate, and\ndetermine the sample complexity for both standard Monte Carlo and MLMC\nparadigms. Additionally, we perform a root-mean-squared error analysis\nutilizing tools from empirical process theory to derive sample complexity\nwithout relying on the finite moment condition typically required for uniform\nconvergence results. Finally, we validate our findings and demonstrate the\nadvantages of the MLMC estimator through numerical examples, estimating\nConditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) in the Geometric Brownian Motion and nested\nexpectation framework.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XxqrqrW7xf2Br4Fo6PHGpWCNmd-B_p0rCcr6gkWHYgc","pdfSize":"299801"}
