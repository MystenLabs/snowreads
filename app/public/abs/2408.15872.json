Our\nanalysis incorporates three different lag measurement methods, including the\ninterpolated cross-correlation function (ICCF), JAVELIN, and PyROA, alongside a\nconsistently defined lag searching window and an alias removal procedure. We\nfind that ICCF, albeit with larger uncertainties compared to other methods, is\nthe most reliable method based on our visual inspection of the matches between\nH$\\beta$ and the shifted continuum light curves. Combining this sample with the\n32 AGNs from the Seoul National University AGN Monitoring Project, we obtain\nthe best-fit relation between the BLR size ($R_{\\rm BLR}$) and the continuum\nluminosity at 5100$\\r{A}$ ($L_{5100}$) with a slope significantly flatter than\n0.5. By selecting a subsample of 157 AGNs with the best-quality lag\nmeasurements using a set of quantitative criteria and visual inspection, we\nfind a consistent slope and a slightly decreased intrinsic scatter. We further\ninvestigate the effect of luminosity tracers, including $L_{5100}$, H$\\beta$\nluminosity ($L_{\\rm H\\beta}$), ${\\rm [O\\,\\mathrm{III}]}$ luminosity ($L_{\\rm\n[O\\,\\mathrm{III}]}$), and 2 to 10 keV hard X-ray luminosity ($L_{\\rm\n2\\unicode{x2013}10\\,keV}$). We find that sub-Eddington and super-Eddington AGNs\nexhibit systematic offsets in both $R_{\\rm BLR}$$\\unicode{x2013}$$L_{5100}$ and\n$R_{\\rm BLR}$$\\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\\rm H\\beta}$ relation, but are comparable in\nthe $R_{\\rm BLR}$$\\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\\rm [O\\,\\mathrm{III}]}$ and $R_{\\rm\nBLR}$$\\unicode{x2013}$$L_{\\rm 2\\unicode{x2013}10\\,keV}$ relation. We discuss\nthe potential causes for these different deviations when employing different\nluminosity tracers.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
