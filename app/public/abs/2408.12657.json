It is therefore natural\nthat algorithmic problems in robotics and automation have a geometric\ncomponent, often central to the problem. Below we review ten challenging\nproblems at the intersection of robotics and computational geometry -- let's\ncall this intersection Geobotics. What is common to most of these problems is\nthat the prevalent algorithmic techniques used in robotics do not seem suitable\nfor solving them, or at least do not suggest quality guarantees for the\nsolution. Solving some of them, even partially, can shed light on less\nwell-understood aspects of computation in robotics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
