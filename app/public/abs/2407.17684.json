Given the same decryption failure rate (DFR) and security\nargument, we show it is feasible to reduce the communication overhead of the\nKyber by 54%. The improvement is based on two technologies: ciphertext\nquantization and plaintext encoding. First, we prove that the Lloyd-Max\nquantization is optimal to minimize the decryption decoding noise. The original\nKyber compression function is not optimal. Second, we propose an encoding\nscheme, which combines Pulse-Amplitude Modulation (PAM), Gray mapping, and a\nbinary error correcting code. An explicit expression for the DFR is derived.\nThe minimum possible communication overhead is also derived. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that with the Lloyd-Max quantization, 8-PAM, Gray mapping, and a\nshortened binary BCH(768,638,13) code, the proposed scheme encapsulates 638\nbits (e.g., 2.5 AES keys) in a single ciphertext.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
