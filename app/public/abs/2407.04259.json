Therefore, our approach goes beyond the well-studied\ncases involving ambiguity sets of balls around some reference measure with the\ndistance to reference measure being measured with respect to the Wasserstein\ndistance or the Kullback--Leibler divergence. Hence, our approach allows the\napplicant to create ambiguity sets better tailored to her needs and to solve\nthe associated robust Markov decision problem via a $Q$-learning algorithm\nwhose convergence is guaranteed by our main result. Moreover, we showcase in\nseveral numerical experiments the tractability of our approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
