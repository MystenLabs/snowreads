One of the standard\nestimators of dynamic synergy is based on the minimal mutual information\nbetween sets of elements, however, despite it's increasingly widespread use,\nthe mathematical features of this redundancy function have largely gone\nunexplored. Here, we show that it has two previously unrecognized limitations:\nit cannot disambiguate between truly integrated systems and disintegrated\nsystems with first-order autocorrelation. Second, paradoxically, there are some\nsystems that become more synergistic when dis-integrated (as long as\nfirst-order autocorrelations are preserved). In these systems, integrated\ninformation can decrease while synergy simultaneously increases. We derive\nconditions under which this occurs and discuss the implications of these\nfindings for past and future work in applied fields such as neuroscience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
