VisFly\noffers a user-friendly framework and interfaces, leveraging Habitat-Sim's\nrendering engines to achieve frame rates exceeding 10,000 frames per second for\nrendering motion and sensor data. The simulator incorporates differentiable\nphysics and is seamlessly wrapped with the Gym environment, facilitating the\nstraightforward implementation of various learning algorithms. It supports the\ndirectly importing open-source scene datasets compatible with Habitat-Sim,\nenabling training on diverse real-world environments simultaneously. To\nvalidate our simulator, we also make three reinforcement learning examples for\ntypical flight tasks relying on visual observations. The simulator is now\navailable at [https://github.com/SJTU-ViSYS-team/VisFly].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
