Such formalism allows to incorporate properly formation effects\n(color transparency), as well as the quantum coherence inherent in higher twist\nshadowing corrections related to the $|Q \\bar{Q}\\rangle$ Fock component of the\nphoton. The leading twist gluon shadowing associated with multi-gluon photon\nfluctuations is also included within the same formalism. The later effect\nrepresents the dominant source of shadowing at mid rapidities in the LHC\nkinematic region, while the reduced effect of quark shadowing leads to a\nsignificant modification of differential cross sections $d\\sigma/dy$ at forward\nand/or backwards rapidities. Model calculations for $d\\sigma/dy$ are in a good\nagreement with available UPC data on coherent charmonium production at RHIC and\nthe LHC. In addition, we also perform predictions for nuclear effects in the\nelectroproduction of charmonia, which can be verified by new data from\nelectron-ion colliders.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jX6OM-USKRVg7yRx802fFcS-NstjM0hvLOEOpw5eZEA","pdfSize":"379345","objectId":"0x94a0d68efe835dcc01c037b696b325b530ce1f50f2f57dc1693615170a510a24","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
