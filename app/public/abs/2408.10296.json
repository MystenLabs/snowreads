When these objects are turned\ninto black holes due to a supernova or a binary merger this ''hair'' could be\n''shorn'' off. Part of the field configuration would then be released leading\nto an outgoing field wave. For small masses this field transient remains rather\ncompact and can induce a transient signal in experiments, in particular those\nthat look for wave-like dark matter. This signal can be correlated with the\ncorresponding astrophysical signal of the event. In this note, we consider a\nvariety of couplings and the associated signals and estimate the corresponding\nsensitivities.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
