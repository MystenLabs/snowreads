We study the $p$-rank of the\nclass group of $\\mathbb{Q}(\\zeta_p, N^{1/p})$ using Galois cohomological\nmethods and obtain an exact formula for the $p$-rank in terms of the dimensions\nof certain Selmer groups. Using our formula, we provide a numerical criterion\nto establish upper and lower bounds for the $p$-rank, analogous to the\nnumerical criteria provided by F.~Calegari--M.~Emerton and\nK.~Schaefer--E.~Stubley for the $p$-ranks of the class group of\n$\\mathbb{Q}(N^{1/p})$. In the case $p=3$, we use Redei matrices to provide a\nnumerical criterion to exactly calculate the $3$-rank, and also study the\ndistribution of the $3$-ranks as $N$ varies through primes which are $4,7\n\\pmod{9}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
