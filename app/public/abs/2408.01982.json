Unlike traditional ferroelectrics with a wide band gap,\nferroelectric (FE) metals can naturally incorporate nontrivial band topology\nnear the Fermi level, endowing them with additional exotic properties. Here, we\nshow first-principles evidence that the metallic PtBi2 monolayer is an\nintrinsic two-dimensional (2D) topological FE metal, characterized by\nout-of-plane polarization and a moderate switching barrier. Moreover, it\nexhibits a topologically nontrivial electronic structure with Z2 invariant\nequal to 1, leading to a significant FE bulk photovoltaic effect. A slight\nstrain can further enhance this effect to a remarkable level, which far surpass\nthat of previously reported 2D/3D FE materials. Our work provides an important\nstep towards realizing intrinsic monolayer topological FE metals and paves a\npromising way for future nonlinear optical devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
