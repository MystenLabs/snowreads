Current\nsemantic-based registration methods only use semantics for point-to-point or\ninstance semantic correspondence generation, which has two problems. First,\nthese methods are highly dependent on the correctness of semantics. They\nperform poorly in scenarios with incorrect semantics and sparse semantics.\nSecond, the use of semantics is limited only to the correspondence generation,\nresulting in bad performance in the weak geometry scene. To solve these\nproblems, on the one hand, we propose secondary ground segmentation and loose\nsemantic consistency based on regional voting. It improves the robustness to\nsemantic correctness by reducing the dependence on single-point semantics. On\nthe other hand, we propose semantic-geometric consistency for outlier removal,\nwhich makes full use of semantic information and significantly improves the\nquality of correspondences. In addition, a two-stage hypothesis verification is\nproposed, which solves the problem of incorrect transformation selection in the\nweak geometry scene. In the outdoor dataset, our method demonstrates superior\nperformance, boosting a 22.5 percentage points improvement in registration\nrecall and achieving better robustness under various conditions. Our code is\navailable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
