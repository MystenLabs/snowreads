Moreover, we study the sign-balance for excedances\nover mod-k-alternating derangements. The results are obtained by constructing\nsuitable matrices and connecting their determinants with the signed excedance\nenumeration of mod-k-alternating permutations. As an application of the signed\nexcedance enumeration, we prove that when $n \\equiv k \\pmod {2k}$, the\nexcedance enumerating polynomials over the even and odd mod-k-alternating\npermutations, starting with a fixed remainder, are gamma-positive.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_RwxhxZuNw3ipBaEJywcjpISqEY_uQg8tSA5jrfnVuU","pdfSize":"175324"}
