In this work, we introduce a novel autonomous\nagent framework leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Instruction-Tuning (RAIT) to\nenhance open, customizable small code language models (SLMs) for these\ncalculations. By combining instruction tuned code SLMs with Retrieval-Augmented\nCode Generation (RACG) using external tools, the agent generates, debugs, and\noptimizes code from natural language specifications. Our approach addresses the\nlimitations of the current lack of a foundational AI model for specialized\nprocess engineering tasks and offers benefits of explainability, knowledge\nediting, and cost-effectiveness. Additionally, we curate custom datasets of\nchemical and process engineering problems and solutions to overcome data\nscarcity. Experimental results show that our framework matches the performance\nof large-scale proprietary models on benchmark datasets, proving its\neffectiveness and usability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"450p35yVfeSxaL2XGCYuQ8IISqUojWpRJxfOGaUTYDo","pdfSize":"966058"}
