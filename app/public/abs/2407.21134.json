Herein, we\npresent corner hierarchically approximated CI (CHACI), an approach to wave\nfunction compression based on corner hierarchical matrices (CH-matrices) -- a\nnew variant of hierarchical matrices based on a block-wise low-rank\ndecomposition. By application to dodecacene, a strongly correlated molecule, we\ndemonstrate that CH matrix compression provides superior compression compared\nto a truncated global singular value decomposition. The compression ratio is\nshown to improve with increasing active space size. By comparison of several\nalternative schemes, we demonstrate that superior compression is achieved by a)\nusing a blocking approach that emphasizes the upper-left corner of the CI\nvector, b) sorting the CI vector prior to compression, and c) optimizing the\nrank of each block to maximize information density.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
