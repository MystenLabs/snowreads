A previous Lie symmetry\nanalysis revealed a particular case which was conjectured to be integrable.\nNamely, a Lie-Baecklund symmetry exists, thus highlighting another associated\ndynamical system. Here, we investigate these two equations using the\ngradient-holonomic integrability scheme. Moreover, we construct their infinite\nhierarchy of conservation laws analytically, using three compatible Poisson\nstructures to prove the complete integrability of both dynamical systems. We\ninvestigate these two equations using the so-called gradient-holonomic\nintegrability scheme. Based on this scheme, applied to the equation under\nconsideration, we have analytically constructed its infinite hierarchy of\nconservation laws, derived two compatible Poisson structures and proved its\ncomplete integrability.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kRtdIMfaBUWJqixZ2b4Mt_elNZcwMB8zKhzWeJTadMc","pdfSize":"1054476"}
