As a result, deep\nlearning models tend to learn spurious correlations instead of causally related\nfeatures, limiting their generalizability to new and unseen data. This problem\ncan be addressed by minimizing dependence measures between intermediate\nrepresentations of task-related and non-task-related variables. These measures\ninclude mutual information, distance correlation, and the performance of\nadversarial classifiers. Here, we benchmark such dependence measures for the\ntask of preventing shortcut learning. We study a simplified setting using\nMorpho-MNIST and a medical imaging task with CheXpert chest radiographs. Our\nresults provide insights into how to mitigate confounding factors in medical\nimaging.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
