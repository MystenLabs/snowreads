Soft-gluon corrections\nfrom resummation are calculated through approximate N$^3$LO and added to\nfixed-order QCD results, and electroweak corrections are included at NLO.\nTop-quark transverse-momentum and rapidity distributions are also presented. In\nall cases the higher-order corrections are large, they reduce the scale\ndependence, and they improve agreement with recent data.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
