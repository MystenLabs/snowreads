The\ngraph structure allows for model-building without a priori specifying definite\nnumbers of new particles. As a case study, we apply our method to a simple\nclass of theories involving vectorlike leptons and a dark U(1) inspired by the\nportal matter paradigm. Using modern policy gradient methods, the agent\nsuccessfully explores a model space consisting of both continuous and discrete\nparameters and identifies consistent theories. The minimal models found include\nboth known and previously unstudied examples that can accommodate the muon\nanomalous magnetic moment and satisfy precision electroweak and flavor\nconstraints. The method represents a step forward in enabling an automated\nmodel-building process for physics beyond the Standard Model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
