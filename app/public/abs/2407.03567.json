In present work, we assume the $X_2$ as a pure\nmolecule of the $D^*\\bar{D}^*$ under three cases, i.e., pure neutral components\n($\\theta = 0$), isospin singlet ($\\theta = \\pi/4$) and neutral components\ndominant ($\\theta = \\pi/6$), where $\\theta$ is a phase angle describing the\nproportion of neutral and charged constituents. Using an effective Lagrangian\napproach, we calculated the partial widths of $X_2\\to VV$ and $X_2 \\to PP$ ($V$\nand $P$ stand for light vector and pseudoscalar mesons, respectively). The\npredicted decay widths of $X_2 \\to VV$ can reach a few hundreds of\n$\\mathrm{keV}$, while the decay widths of $X_2 \\to PP$ are about several tens\nof $\\mathrm{keV}$. In addition, the effects from the proportion of neutral and\ncharged constituent on the decay widths of $X_2\\to VV$ and $PP$ are also\ninvestigated. We hope that the present calculations will be checked\nexperimentally in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
