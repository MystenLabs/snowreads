By\nutilizing this concept we show that the probability and fidelity of\nteleportation in a two-mode cluster state can be handled by the localization of\nthe selectivity interval of the measurement apparatus. Besides, we provide a\nmathematical expression describing the probability distribution of the\nmeasurement outcomes in the two-mode cluster, which is a fundamental solution\nof the heat equation. In addition, we show that the fidelity of teleportation\nin the two mode cluster is given by the quotient between the squared solution\nof a non-homogeneous heat equation and the solution of the conventional heat\nequation. Furthermore, we extend our approach to a configuration involving\nsuccessive clusters with intermediate corrections between each teleportation\nstep. To exemplify our proposal, we consider the specific case of a\nsqueezed-coherent state as the quantum state under teleportation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gig0GauvfMk_weuSQC9tNLwfzlHWdqPVT4FQ5911OjQ","pdfSize":"2440336"}
