The paper presents three short, new\nproofs of Dowker duality using various poset fiber lemmas. We introduce\nmodifications of joins and products of simplicial complexes called relational\njoin and relational product complexes. These relational complexes can be\nconstructed whenever there is a relation between simplicial complexes, which\nincludes the context of Dowker duality and covers of simplicial complexes. In\nthis more general setting, we show that the homologies of the simplicial\ncomplexes and the relational complexes fit together in a long exact sequence.\nSimilar results are then established for profunctors, which are generalizations\nof relations to categories. The cograph and graph of profunctors play the role\nof the relational join and relational product complexes. For a profunctor that\narise from adjoint functors between $C$ and $D$, we show that $C$, $D$, the\ncograph, and the graph all have homotopy equivalent classifying spaces. Lastly,\nwe show that given any profunctor from $D$ to $C$, the homologies of $C$, $D$,\nthe cograph, and the graph form a long exact sequence. We make use of a\nspectral sequence for Grothendieck fibrations of small categories.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XDo0F5YJgi7K_GuTsOzlBX2SA0R02aWP3KyQDDOHS6g","pdfSize":"2599439"}
