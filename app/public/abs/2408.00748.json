We establish conditions\nunder which a weakly conformal, branched $\\Omega$-free boundary Hamiltonian\nstationary Lagrangian immersion $u$ of a disc in $\\mathbb{C}^2$ is a\n$\\Omega$-free boundary minimal immersion. We deduce that if $u$ is a weakly\nconformal, branched $B_1(0)$-free boundary Hamiltonian stationary Lagrangian\nimmersion of a disc with Legendrian boundary data, then $u(D^2)$ must be a\nLagrangian equatorial plane disc. We also present examples of $\\Omega$-free\nboundary Hamiltonain stationary discs, demonstrating the optimality of our\nassumptions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zlHhOCNzchHvBPjz2-ntSheI9FEb27cYTVGfoMUis-w","pdfSize":"230705"}
