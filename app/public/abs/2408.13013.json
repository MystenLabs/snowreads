Here we propose a new structural order parameter by taking into\naccount multiple rotational symmetries. By studying its statistics for\ntwo-dimensional disordered packings of hard particles along the jamming\ntransition line, we observe the evolution from disordered-particle-rich states\nto ordered-particle-rich states with the increase of packing fraction, together\nwith the unusual non-monotonic change of the degree of hyperuniformity. At the\nhigh packing fraction end of the jamming transition line, the packings are\nmostly composed of ordered particles and are nearly hyperuniform beyond a\nfinite length. Our work links the local order fluctuations to the thermodynamic\nstability and density fluctuations of disordered solids. Taking advantage of\nthe order parameter, we propose the structural characteristic of ultra-stable\nglasses: Although globally disordered evaluated by any single symmetry, they\nare rich of ordered particles and effectively `globally ordered' with\ncrystal-like density fluctuations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
