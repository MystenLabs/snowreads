For any graph $G$, the\n$F$-isolation number of $G$, denoted by $\\iota(G,F)$, is the size of a smallest\nsubset $D$ of the vertex set of $G$ such that the closed neighbourhood $N[D]$\nof $D$ in $G$ intersects the vertex sets of the $F$-copies contained by $G$\n(equivalently, $G-N[D]$ contains no $F$-copy). Thus, $\\iota(G,K_1)$ is the\ndomination number $\\gamma(G)$ of $G$, and $\\iota(G,K_2)$ is the vertex-edge\ndomination number of $G$. We prove that if $F$ is a $k$-edge graph, $\\gamma(F)\n= 1$ (that is, $F$ has a vertex that is adjacent to all the other vertices of\n$F$), and $G$ is a connected $m$-edge graph, then $\\iota(G,F) \\leq \\big\\lfloor\n\\frac{m+1}{k+2} \\big\\rfloor$ unless $G$ is an $F$-copy or $F$ is a $3$-path and\n$G$ is a $6$-cycle. This was recently posed as a conjecture by Zhang and Wu,\nwho settled the case where $F$ is a star. The result for the case where $F$ is\na clique had been obtained by Fenech, Kaemawichanurat and the present author.\nThe bound is attainable for any $m \\geq 0$ unless $1 \\leq m = k \\leq 2$. New\nideas, including divisibility considerations, are introduced in the proof of\nthe conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
