The task involves determining a sensor's precise\nposition and orientation, typically a camera, within a given space. Traditional\nlocalization methods often rely on passive sensing, which may struggle in\nscenarios with limited features or dynamic environments. In response, this\npaper explores the domain of active localization, emphasizing the importance of\nviewpoint selection to enhance localization accuracy. Our contributions involve\nusing a data-driven approach with a simple architecture designed for real-time\noperation, a self-supervised data training method, and the capability to\nconsistently integrate our map into a planning framework tailored for\nreal-world robotics applications. Our results demonstrate that our method\nperforms better than the existing one, targeting similar problems and\ngeneralizing on synthetic and real data. We also release an open-source\nimplementation to benefit the community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
