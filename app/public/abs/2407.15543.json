There is no clear consensus on which dynamical\nmechanisms determine the final shape of these objects. In turn, we explore a\nformation pathway where spin-up and rotational failure of a rubble pile\nasteroid lead to mass-shedding and a wide circumasteroidal debris disk in which\nthe satellite forms. Using a combination of smooth-particle hydrodynamical and\nN-body simulations, we study the dynamical evolution in detail. We find that a\ndebris disk containing matter corresponding to a few percent of the primary\nasteroid mass extending beyond the fluid Roche limit can consistently form both\noblate and bilobate satellites via a series of tidal encounters with the\nprimary body and mergers with other gravitational aggregates. Principally,\nsatellites end up prolate (elongated) and on synchronous orbits, accreting\nmainly in a radial direction while tides from the primary asteroid keep the\nshape intact. However, close encounters and mergers can break the orbital\nstate, leading to orbital migration and deformation. Satellite-satellite\nimpacts occurring in this regime have lower impact velocities than\nmerger-driven moon formation in e.g. planetary rings, leading to soft impacts\nbetween differently sized, non-spherical bodies. The resulting post-merger\nshape of the satellite is highly dependent on the impact geometry. Only moons\nhaving experienced a prior mild or catastrophic tidal disruption during a close\nencounter with the primary asteroid can become oblate spheroids, which is\nconsistent with the predominantly prolate observed population of binary\nasteroid satellites.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XkJpnJNZpKIvaTe4dYYaJqOMJahQdakXQYMZu5J3_0k","pdfSize":"6355491"}
