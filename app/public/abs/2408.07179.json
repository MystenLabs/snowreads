We also\nfound conjugate relationships among the kinetomagnetism of chirality, linear\nmagnetoelectricity, and electric field induced directional nonreciprocity,\nhighlighting their interconnections with magnetic, electric, and toroidal\norders. The concept of the kinetomagnetism of chirality will be an essential\nbasis for the theoretical understanding of known chiral phenomena such as\nnatural optical activity or chiral phonons, and also the discovery of\nunexplored chiral functionalities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U7FcKT_GAuW0GKV7HoNYzvzsWI1ZAPxWpnpIDIUDnJ0","pdfSize":"1003734"}
