The use of\ncompressibility is grounded in the concept of Kolmogorov complexity, which\ndefines the complexity of an object by the size of its smallest representation.\nWith this fitness function, we explore the complexity range accessible to the\nwell-known Flow Lenia cellular automaton, using image compression algorithms to\nassess state compressibility. Using a Genetic Algorithm to evolve Flow Lenia\npatterns, we conduct experiments with two primary objectives: 1) generating\npatterns of specific complexity levels, and 2) exploring the extrema of Flow\nLenia's complexity domain. Evolved patterns reflect the complexity targets,\nwith higher complexity targets yielding more intricate patterns, consistent\nwith human perceptions of complexity. This demonstrates that our fitness\nfunction can effectively evolve patterns that match specific complexity\nobjectives within the bounds of the complexity range accessible to Flow Lenia\nunder a given hyperparameter configuration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
