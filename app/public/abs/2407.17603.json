[Onishi and Fu, Phys. Rev. X {\\bf 14}, 011052 (2024)]. A\nnon-trivial indirect derivation builds on the properties of optical\nconductivity at an arbitrary frequency. We propose a simpler derivation,\nallowing multiple generalizations, such as a universal bound on a gap in\nanisotropic systems, systems with multiple charge carrier types, and\ntopological systems with zero Hall conductance. The derivation builds on the\nobservation that the bound equals $\\hbar$ times the ratio of the force by the\nexternal electric field on the charge carriers and their total kinematic\nmomentum in the direction perpendicular to the force.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
