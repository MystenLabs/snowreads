Such inclusions have attractive properties from the\npoint of view of harmonic analysis and noncommutative geometry. We establish\nseveral permanence properties of locally compact groups for which $L^1(G)\n\\subseteq C^*_{\\mathrm{red}}(G)$ has the ideal separation property.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eRA7sLkd_7FPi3rtAVXfoVRK37BnpC-j4lCEUZLVY1Q","pdfSize":"345607"}
