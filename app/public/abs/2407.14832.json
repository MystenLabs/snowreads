The recursion is obtained in terms of curves of\nlower degree that are tangent to a given divisor. This paper presents two\ngeneralizations of this method. The first result is on enumeration of one\ncuspidal curves on P^2, and the second result is an extension to the fiber\nbundle setting. We solve the question of counting the characteristic number\nplanar nodal cubics in P^3 by extending the idea of Caporaso-Harris.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
