As a\nproof of concept we show that the geometric Binder cumulant method described\nhere can reproduce the known literature values for the flat and raised cosine\ndistributions, which are the two distributions that occur in the delocalized\nphase. For the Aubry-Andr\\'{e} model at half-filling the phase transition point\nis accurately reproduced. Not only is the correct size scaling exponent of the\nvariance obtained in the extended and the localized phases, but the geometric\nBinder cumulant undergoes a sign change at the phase transition. We also\ncalculate the state resolved Binder cumulant as a function of disorder strength\nto gain insight into the mechanism of the localization transition.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cRBpt_vEwqbzzKAf-7-uDScyEuRjnx8Ss9DiHZK_chw","pdfSize":"290796"}
