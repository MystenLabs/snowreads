The spectral energy\ndistributions consist of NIRSpec PRISM and MIRI LRS spectra covering the\n$\\sim$1--12 $\\mu$m wavelength range at $\\lambda/ \\Delta \\lambda \\approx 100$\nand broadband photometry at 15, 18, and 21 $\\mu$m. The spectra exhibit\nabsorption features common to these objects including H$_2$O, CH$_4$, CO,\nCO$_2$, and NH$_3$. Interestingly, while the spectral morphology changes\nrelatively smoothly with spectral type at $\\lambda < 3$ $\\mu$m and $\\lambda >\n8$ $\\mu$m, it shows no clear trend in the 5 $\\mu$m region where a large\nfraction of the flux emerges. The broad wavelength coverage of the data enables\nus to compute the first accurate measurements of the bolometric fluxes of cool\nbrown dwarfs. Combining these bolometric fluxes with parallaxes from Spitzer\nand HST, we also obtain the first accurate bolometric luminosities of these\ncool dwarfs. We then used the Sonora Bobcat solar metallicity evolutionary\nmodels to estimate the radii of the dwarfs which results in effective\ntemperature estimates ranging from $\\sim$1000 to 350 K with a median\nuncertainty of $\\pm$20 K which is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over\nprevious work. We also discuss how various portions of the spectra either do or\ndo not exhibit a clear sequence when ordered by their effective temperatures.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xx8CpwfjDJNB0ru-6suL2r3Eha1lEmS9iWe7SqRAL98","pdfSize":"7667380","objectId":"0xd34a1e52aa0901d31ffb27747e751a09da40e53eeaf01ed439a33ddce09e482e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
