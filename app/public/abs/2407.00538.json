Current methods rely on Deep Learning (DL) to improve\nperformance and accuracy (Deep Radiomics). Given the sensitivity of medical\nimages, ensuring privacy throughout the Deep Radiomics pipeline-from data\ngeneration and collection to model training and inference-is essential,\nespecially when outsourced. Thus, Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) are\ncrucial tools for Deep Radiomics. Previous studies and systematization efforts\nhave either broadly overviewed PETs and their applications or mainly focused on\nsubsets of PETs for ML algorithms. In Deep Radiomics, where efficiency,\naccuracy, and privacy are crucial, many PETs, while theoretically applicable,\nmay not be practical without specialized optimizations or hybrid designs.\nAdditionally, not all DL models are suitable for Radiomics. Consequently, there\nis a need for specialized studies that investigate and systematize the\neffective and practical integration of PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline.\nThis work addresses this research gap by (1) classifying existing PETs,\npresenting practical hybrid PETS constructions, and a taxonomy illustrating\ntheir potential integration with the Deep Radiomics pipeline, with comparative\nanalyses detailing assumptions, architectural suitability, and security, (2)\nOffering technical insights, describing potential challenges and means of\ncombining PETs into the Deep Radiomics pipeline, including integration\nstrategies, subtilities, and potential challenges, (3) Proposing potential\nresearch directions, identifying challenges, and suggesting solutions to\nenhance the PETs in Deep Radiomics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
