The proposed tracker is capable of handling various chasing settings\nsuch as complex unstructured environments, crowded dynamic obstacles and\nmultiple-target following. Among the entire pipeline, we focus on developing a\npredictor for future target motion and a chasing trajectory planner. For rapid\ncomputation, we employ the sample-check-select strategy: modules sample a set\nof candidate movements, check multiple constraints, and then select the best\ntrajectory. Also, we leverage the properties of Bernstein polynomials for quick\ncalculations. The prediction module predicts the trajectories of the targets,\nwhich do not overlap with static and dynamic obstacles. Then the trajectory\nplanner outputs a trajectory, ensuring various conditions such as occlusion and\ncollision avoidance, the visibility of all targets within a camera image and\ndynamical limits. We fully test the proposed tracker in simulations and\nhardware experiments under challenging scenarios, including dual-target\nfollowing, environments with dozens of dynamic obstacles and complex indoor and\noutdoor spaces.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
