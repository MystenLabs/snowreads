The\nPDE component focuses on reaction-diffusion processes, while the ODE component\naddresses transmission via ion channels on the cell's or organelle's membrane.\nHowever, analytically determining the underlying equations for ion channels is\nhighly challenging due to the complexity and unknown factors inherent in\nbiological processes. Therefore, we employ deep neural networks (DNNs) to model\nthe open probability of ion channels, a task that can be intricate when\napproached with ODEs. This technique also reduces the number of unknowns\nrequired to model the open probability. When trained with valid data, the same\nneural network architecture can be used for different ion channels, such as\nsodium, potassium, and calcium. Furthermore, based on the given data, we can\nbuild more physiologically reasonable DNN models that can be customized.\nSubsequently, we integrated the DNN model into calcium dynamics in neurons with\nendoplasmic reticulum, resulting in a hybrid model that combines PDEs and DNNs.\nNumerical results are provided to demonstrate the flexibility and advantages of\nthe PDE-DNN model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
