Schizophrenia is caused by dopamine imbalances in the\nfronto-striatal pathways of the brain, which influences fine motor control in\nthe cerebellum. This leads to abnormalities in handwriting. The goal of this\nstudy was to develop an accurate, objective, and accessible computational\nmethod to be able to distinguish schizophrenic handwriting samples from\nnon-schizophrenic handwriting samples. To achieve this, data from Crespo et al.\n(2019) was used, which contains images of handwriting samples from\nschizophrenic and non-schizophrenic patients. The data was preprocessed and\naugmented to produce a more robust model that can recognize different types of\nhandwriting. The data was used to train several different convolutional neural\nnetworks, and the model with the base architecture of InceptionV3 performed the\nbest, differentiating between the two types of image with a 92% accuracy rate.\nTo make this model accessible, a secure website was developed for medical\nprofessionals to use for their patients. Such a result suggests that\nhandwriting analysis through computational models holds promise as a\nnon-invasive and objective method for clinicians to diagnose and monitor\nschizophrenia.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
