This manual approach, requiring substantial\nresources, becomes impractical at larger scales. Machine learning (ML) methods\noffer alternatives, but the scarcity of labeled data limits accuracy. In this\nstudy, we propose a self-supervised, large language model-based (LLMcap) method\nfor PCAP failure detection. LLMcap leverages language-learning abilities and\nemploys masked language modeling to learn grammar, context, and structure.\nTested rigorously on various PCAPs, it demonstrates high accuracy despite the\nabsence of labeled data during training, presenting a promising solution for\nefficient network analysis.
