As a\ncontrast to off-the-shelf methods that solve SR tasks across various scales\nwith the same computing costs, our AnySR innovates in: 1) building\narbitrary-scale tasks as any-resource implementation, reducing resource\nrequirements for smaller scales without additional parameters; 2) enhancing\nany-scale performance in a feature-interweaving fashion, inserting scale pairs\ninto features at regular intervals and ensuring correct feature/scale\nprocessing. The efficacy of our AnySR is fully demonstrated by rebuilding most\nexisting arbitrary-scale SISR methods and validating on five popular SISR test\ndatasets. The results show that our AnySR implements SISR tasks in a\ncomputing-more-efficient fashion, and performs on par with existing\narbitrary-scale SISR methods. For the first time, we realize SISR tasks as not\nonly any-scale in literature, but also as any-resource.
