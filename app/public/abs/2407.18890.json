Fore and S. Reddy, Phys. Rev. C 101 035809 (2020)] has shown\nthat the population of thermal pions could modify the equation of state and\ntransport properties of hot and dense neutron-rich matter and introduce new\nreaction pathways to change the proton fraction. In this article we study their\nimpact on the bulk viscosity of dense matter, focusing on the neutrino-trapped\nregime that would be realized in neutron star mergers and supernovae. We find\nthat the presence of a thermal population of pions alters the bulk viscosity by\nmodifying the EoS (via the susceptibilities) and by providing new reaction\npathways to achieve beta-equilibrium. In neutron star merger conditions, the\nbulk viscosity in neutrino-trapped $npe\\mu$ matter (without pions) has its peak\nat temperatures of at most a couple MeV and is quite small at temperatures of\ntens of MeV. We find that thermal pions enhance the low-temperature peak of the\nbulk viscosity by a factor of a few and shift it to slightly lower\ntemperatures. At higher temperatures, where the pion abundance is large but the\nbulk viscosity is traditionally small, pions can increase the bulk viscosity by\nan order of magnitude or more, although it is still orders of magnitude smaller\nthan its peak value.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dftGHd2Iw7fjDk83zsazYDfZfdHSD614NMFDaa-eqw8","pdfSize":"1626850"}
