We first identify a simple class of perturbations which\ntransfer mass from a suitable pair of preferences to the pair formed by\nswapping certain compatible lower contour sets. We show that two distributions\nover preferences are behaviorally equivalent if and only if they can be\nobtained from each other by a finite sequence of such transformations. Using\nthis, we obtain specialized characterizations of which restrictions on the\nsupport of a random utility model yield identification, as well as of the\nextreme points of the set of distributions rationalizing a given data set.\nFinally, when a model depends smoothly on some set of parameters, we show that\nunder mild topological assumptions, identification is characterized by a\nstraightforward, local test.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
