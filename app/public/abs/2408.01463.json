We calculate\nthe \"sound\" wave coefficient of reflection from (coefficient of transmission\nthrough) the shock wave. These coefficients are expressed in terms of the\nspeeds of the \"sound\" waves relative to the shock and the wave impedances. In\nthe second half of the paper we explicitly include into consideration the\ndissipation in the system, introducing ohmic resistors shunting the inductors\nand also in series with the capacitors. This allows us to justify the\nconditions on the shocks, postulated in the first half of the paper. This also\nallows us to describe the shocks as physical objects of finite width and study\ntheir profiles, same as the profiles of the waves closely connected with the\nshocks - the kinks. The profiles of the latter, and in some particular cases\nthe profiles of the former, were obtained in terms of elementary functions.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ddwjTi67KtUXJH5KZ2aHC0dvYoWrSRzB5znPuGlbeUg","pdfSize":"591092"}
