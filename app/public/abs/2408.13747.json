Initially demonstrated by Serrin \\cite{MR0282585}, the profiles\n$[\\bar{u}, \\bar{v}]$ were shown to act as a self-similar attractor of solutions\n$[u, v]$ to the Prandtl equation through the use of von Mises transform and\nmaximal principle techniques. Specifically, as $x \\to \\infty$, $\\|u -\n\\bar{u}\\|_{L^{\\infty}_{y}} \\to 0$. Iyer \\cite{MR4097332} employed refined\nenergy methods to derive an explicit convergence rate for initial data close to\nBlasius. Wang and Zhang \\cite{MR4657422} utilized barrier function methods,\nremoving smallness assumptions but imposing stronger asymptotic conditions on\nthe initial data. It was suggested that the optimal convergence rate should be\n$\\|u-\\bar{u}\\|_{L^{\\infty}_{y}}\\lesssim (x+1)^{-\\frac{1}{2}}$, treating the\nstationary Prandtl equation as a 1-D parabolic equation in the entire space.\n  In this study, we establish that $\\|u - \\bar{u}\\|_{L^{\\infty}_{y}} \\lesssim\n(x+1)^{-1}$. Our proof relies on discovering nearly conserved low-frequency\nquantities and inherent degenerate structures at the boundary, which enhance\nthe convergence rate through iteration techniques. Notably, the convergence\nrate we have demonstrated is optimal. We can find special solutions of\nPrandtl's equation such that the convergence between the solutions and the\nBlasius profile is exact, represented as $ (x+1)^{-1} $.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
