As a consequence we get the prime\nideal spectrum of the mod $2$ spin$^c$-cobordism ring. We also calculate the\nmod $2$ spin$^c$-cobordism ring ``on the nose'' in degrees $\\leq 33$. We\nconstruct an infinitely generated nonunital subring of the $2$-torsion in the\nspin$^c$-cobordism ring. We use our calculations of product structure in the\nspin and spin$^c$ cobordism rings to give an explicit example, up to cobordism,\nof a compact $24$-dimensional spin manifold which is not cobordant to a sum of\nsquares, which was asked about in a 1965 question of Milnor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
