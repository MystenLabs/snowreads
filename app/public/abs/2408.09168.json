For instance, audio\nstreaming services that started by offering music only, now also offer\npodcasts, merchandise items, and videos. Ranking items across different content\ntypes into a single slate poses a significant challenge for traditional\nlearning-to-rank (LTR) algorithms due to differing user engagement patterns for\ndifferent content types. We explore a simple method for cross-content-type\nranking, called multinomial blending (MB), which can be used in conjunction\nwith most existing LTR algorithms. We compare MB to existing baselines not only\nin terms of ranking quality but also from other industry-relevant perspectives\nsuch as interpretability, ease-of-use, and stability in dynamic environments\nwith changing user behavior and ranking model retraining. Finally, we report\nthe results of an A/B test from an Amazon Music ranking use-case.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LYKmd01CvP_dhq99DIQ-2wNsbAcZ_LnOH3T5EQJ4tkY","pdfSize":"964318"}
