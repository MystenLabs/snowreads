We propose a primitive model for predicting these\ncurrents based entirely on well-established ion diffusion coefficients. Changes\ninside the excitable cell due to the opening of a central sodium channel are\nconfined to a growing hemisphere with a radius that is governed by the sodium\nion diffusion coefficient. The sodium channel, which is open throughout the\ncalculation, activates and deactivates naturally due to coupled\nelectrodiffusion processes. The characteristic time of current pulses, which\nare in the picoampere range, increases from 10$^{-5}$ to 10$^{-1}$ s as channel\ndensity is decreased from 10,000 to 1 channel per micrometer squared. Model\npredictions are compared with data obtained from giant squid axons without\ninvoking any gating parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6vP9Nm_Ugtw4CCQX3tTOxIAdMztCsSsZepwgbjF6z9s","pdfSize":"1483952","objectId":"0xb44c5a65b9b59286ec53297d0d637afee78f8a7eb087ef8b48670aae336bd919","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
