A transition from a state\nwith unbroken symmetry to a state with broken symmetry leads to a qualitative\nchange in system properties, and respective states are called as symmetric and\nnon-symmetric phases of the system. Usually, the change in the system\nparameters is necessary for the transition between symmetric and non-symmetric\nphases. In this letter, we consider the behavior of an optomechanical system\nwith an exceptional point under the influence of noise. We demonstrate that\nbelow the exceptional point, PT-symmetric and non-PT-symmetric phases can\ncoexist. In this regime, a noise can lead to random transitions between the\nsymmetric and non-symmetric phases. These transitions are accompanied by the\nabrupt changes in the intensities of photon and phonon modes. The predicted\nphenomenon opens up the possibility of studying the kinetics of phase\ntransitions caused by spontaneous breaking of PT symmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
