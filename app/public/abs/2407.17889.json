In recent years, it has been used to optimize a variety of machine\nlearning and deep learning models, such as CNN, LSTM, SVM, etc. But it is easy\nto fall into local optimum for the lack of exploitation ability. It is found\nthat in the article, which is different from previous studies, The reason for\nthe poor performance is an error existing in their velocity update function,\nwhich leads to abnormal and chaotic behavior of particles. This not only makes\nthe algorithm difficult to converge, but also often searches the repeated\nspace. So, traditionally, it has to rely on a low w value in the later stage to\nforce these algorithms to converge, but also makes them quickly lose their\nsearch ability and prone to getting trapped in local optima. This article\nproposes a velocity legacy term correction method for all V-shaped BPSOs.\nExperimentals based on 0/1 knapsack problems show that it has a significant\neffect on accuracy and efficiency for all of the 4 commonly used V-Shaped\nBPSOs. Therefore it is an significant breakthrough in the field of swarm\nintelligence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
