Using the perturbative method, we find corrections of first and\nsecond orders in the nonlocality parameter around local solutions for several\nform factors and generate analytic expressions for the energy density up to the\nfirst order in this parameter. Additionally, we also address an inverse\nproblem, that is, we reconstruct the potential corresponding to the given\nsolution obtaining restrictions for the form factor.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
