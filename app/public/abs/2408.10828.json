Much\nlike the detector itself, the presented instrumentation is composed of modular\narrays that can be scaled up and easily serviced. A single such array can carry\nup to 30 photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) accompanied by electronics that generate\nhigh voltage in-situ and deliver time resolution of up to 0.69 ns. In addition,\nthe technology is compatible with the White Rabbit timing system, which can\nsynchronize its elements to within 100 ps. While deployment issues did not\npermit the presented DAQ system to operate beyond initial evaluation, the\npresented hardware and software successfully passed numerous commissioning\ntests that demonstrated their viability for use in a large-scale neutrino\ndetector, instrumented with thousands of PMTs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
