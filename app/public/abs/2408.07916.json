While general secure\ncomputation and privacy-enhancing techniques can partially address this\nproblem, one outstanding challenge is to provide near latency-free search and\ncompatibility with mainstream geographic search techniques, especially the\nDiscrete Global Grid Systems (DGGS). This paper proposes a new construction,\nnamely GridSE, for efficient and DGGS-compatible Secure Geographic Search (SGS)\nwith both backward and forward privacy. We first formulate the notion of a\nsemantic-secure primitive called \\textit{symmetric prefix predicate encryption}\n(SP$^2$E), for predicting whether or not a keyword contains a given prefix, and\nprovide a construction. Then we extend SP$^2$E for dynamic \\textit{prefix\nsymmetric searchable encryption} (pSSE), namely GridSE, which supports both\nbackward and forward privacy. GridSE only uses lightweight primitives including\ncryptographic hash and XOR operations and is extremely efficient. Furthermore,\nwe provide a generic pSSE framework that enables prefix search for traditional\ndynamic SSE that supports only full keyword search. Experimental results over\nreal-world geographic databases of sizes (by the number of entries) from $10^3$\nto $10^7$ and mainstream DGGS techniques show that GridSE achieves a speedup of\n$150\\times$ - $5000\\times$ on search latency and a saving of $99\\%$ on\ncommunication overhead as compared to the state-of-the-art. Interestingly, even\ncompared to plaintext search, GridSE introduces only $1.4\\times$ extra\ncomputational cost and $0.9\\times$ additional communication cost.
