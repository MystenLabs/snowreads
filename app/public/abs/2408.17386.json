We introduce the problem of deciding when two quantum lens\nspaces are equivariantly isomorphic, and solve it in certain basic cases. The\nresults can be formulated directly in terms of the parameters defining the\nquantum lens spaces, and here occasionally take on a rather complicated from\nwhich convinces us that there is a deep underlying explanation for our\nfindings. We complement the fully established partial results with computer\nexperiments that may indicate the way forward.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
