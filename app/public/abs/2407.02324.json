This theory assigns $\\nu_{1,2,3R}$\ndark charge to be $D=0$, $-1$, and $+1$, respectively, in order for anomaly\ncancelation. Additionally, it imposes an inert Higgs doublet $\\eta$ and two\nHiggs singlets $\\xi,\\phi$ with dark charge $D=+1$, $-1$, and $+2$,\nrespectively. That said, the dark symmetry is broken by $\\phi$ (by two units)\ndown to a dark parity $P_D=(-1)^D$, for which $\\nu_{2,3R}$ and $\\eta,\\xi$ are\nodd, whereas all other fields are even due to $D=0$. The lightest of these odd\nfields is stabilized by $P_D$, responsible for dark matter. Neutrino masses are\ngenerated by a scotoseesaw scheme, in which the seesaw part is mediated by\n$\\nu_{1R}$, while the scotogenic part is mediated by $\\nu_{2,3R}$, for which\nthe hierarchy of atmospheric and solar neutrino mass splittings is explained.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3WXK8BDL9W2Sm0gGyXYiNHvWOjHmaM2Cy0lDVJFlPfA","pdfSize":"474449"}
