Here,\nMLOps comes into play. MLOps refers to the processes, tools, and organizational\nstructures used to develop, test, deploy, and manage ML models reliably and\nefficiently. However, there is currently a lack of information on the practical\nimplementation of MLOps in industrial enterprises. To address this issue, we\nconducted a multiple case study on MLOps in three large companies with\ndedicated MLOps teams, using established tools and well-defined model\ndeployment processes in the Industry 4.0 environment. This study describes four\nof the companies' Industry 4.0 scenarios and provides relevant insights into\ntheir implementation and the challenges they faced in numerous projects.\nFurther, we discuss MLOps processes, procedures, technologies, as well as\ncontextual variations among companies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kC8MeQV1u3cUQYZe4LiXoyQ0D5L-XdA2p8PyQx7nwFc","pdfSize":"252534","objectId":"0xa86a130dd16ad78167edac4e1f07d14216e25f8f6be0beb3ee30950bc22b53b3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
