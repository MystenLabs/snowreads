Our formulation makes use of the isometric splitting theorem;\ngiven a convex set $\\Omega$ and the Busemann function associated with any\nstraight line, the volume of the intersection of $\\Omega$ and any sublevel set\nof the Busemann function that contains a barycenter of $\\Omega$ is bounded from\nbelow in terms of $N$. We also extend this inequality beyond uniform\ndistributions on convex sets. Moreover, we establish some rigidity results by\nusing the localization method, and the stability problem is also studied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
