Hence, a compelling case for\na manifestly relational framework ensues naturally. We propose our formulation\nfor such a framework, based on a significant development of the dressing field\nmethod of symmetry reduction.\n  We first develop a version for the group $\\text{Aut}(P)$ of automorphisms of\na principal bundle $P$ over a manifold $M$, as it is the most natural and\nelegant, and as $P$ hosts all the mathematical structures relevant to\ngeneral-relativistic gauge field theory. Yet, as the standard formulation is\nlocal, on $M$, we then develop the relational framework for local field theory.\nIt manifestly implements the generalised point-coincidence argument, whereby\nthe physical field-theoretical degrees of freedoms co-define each other and\ndefine, coordinatise, the physical spacetime itself. Applying the framework to\nGeneral Relativity, we obtain relational Einstein equations, encompassing\nvarious notions of \"scalar coordinatisation\" \\`a la Kretschmann-Komar and\nBrown-Kucha\\v{r}.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
