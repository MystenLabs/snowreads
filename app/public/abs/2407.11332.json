Here, we used a scanning superconducting quantum\ninterference device to image the in-situ diamagnetic and ferromagnetic\nresponses of RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ with high $T_c$ and $T_m$. We observed\nsignificant suppression of superfluid density in vicinity of the magnetic phase\ntransition, signifying fluctuation-enhanced magnetic scatterings between Eu\nspins and Fe 3$d$ conduction electrons. Intriguingly, we observed multiple\nferromagnetic domains which should be absent in an ideal magnetic helical\nphase. The formation of these domains demonstrates a weak $c$-axis\nferromagnetic component probably arising from Eu spin-canting effect,\nindicative of possible superconductivity-driven domain Meissner and domain\nvortex-antivortex phases as revealed in EuFe$_2$(As$_{0.79}$P$_{0.21}$)$_2$.\nOur observations highlight RbEuFe$_4$As$_4$ is a unique system which includes\nmultiple interplay channels between superconductivity and ferromagnetism.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
