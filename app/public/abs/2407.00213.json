A large body of work has focused on cascading models, viral\nmarketing, and finite-horizon diffusion. There is, however, a need for more\ndeveloped, mathematically principled \\emph{adversarial models}, in which\nmultiple, opposed actors strategically select nodes whose influence will\nmaximally sway the crowd to their point of view.\n  In the present work, we develop and analyze such a model based on harmonic\nfunctions and linear diffusion. We prove that our general problem is NP-hard\nand that the objective function is monotone and submodular; consequently, we\ncan greedily approximate the solution within a constant factor. Introducing and\nanalyzing a convex relaxation, we show that the problem can be approximately\nsolved using smooth optimization methods. We illustrate the effectiveness of\nour approach on a variety of example networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
