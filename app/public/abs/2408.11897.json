Using an effective description of\nnew physics in terms of four-fermion operators involving a charm quark, we\nconstrain the Wilson coefficients of the effective interaction from two and\nthree-body charmed meson decays. In our fit, we include charmed meson decays\nnot only to pseudoscalar final states but also to vector final states and\ninclude decays to the $\\eta$ and $\\eta^\\prime$ final states. We also consider\nconstraints from charmed baryon decays. We then study the effect of new physics\nin neutrino scattering processes, involving charm production at SND@LHC, for\nvarious benchmark new physics couplings obtained from the low energy fits.\nFinally, we also study the effects of lepton universality violation (LUV)\nassuming that the new physics coupling is not lepton universal.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
