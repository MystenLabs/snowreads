Econ. Finance 44(2), 2021) of finding a Nash equilibrium\nbetween two agents who can install irreversibly photovoltaic panels in order to\nmaximize their profits of selling the produced electricity net of installation\ncosts, in the case that their cumulative installations have an impact on power\nprices. Starting from a static version of the game, we find out that there\nexists a region in the state space where Nash equilibrium dictates that both\nplayers install, and in some cases this optimal installation strategy is\nnon-unique. We then come back to the original continuous time problem, which\nneeds a generalization of the Verification Theorem present in Awerkin and\nVargiolu (Decis. Econ. Finance 44(2), 2021), taking into account a lack of\nsmoothness of the value functions and the possible non-uniqueness of optimal\nstrategies seen above. Finally, we explicitly construct the equilibrium\nstrategies and the value functions, which depend on the two free boundaries\nwhich separate the region where each player installs or waits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S6FJl8oRM7KFYq8hE0a36TCItb1qTy5cOWXNarxIIeQ","pdfSize":"4939207"}
