As for many complex systems, full\nobservation of the system state is challenging in physical settings, so methods\nable to take this into account are important. The Navier-Stokes equations\nmodelling the flow are a complex, highly nonlinear set of PDEs, so standard\ncontrol theoretical results are not applicable. Instead, we chain together a\nhierarchy of increasingly idealised approximations, developing a control\nstrategy for the simplified model which is shown to be successfully applied to\nsimulations of the full system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
