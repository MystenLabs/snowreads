By incorporating non-unitary effects via, e.g.,\nmeasurements on ancilla qubits, these algorithms can be extended to open-system\ndynamics, such as Markovian processes described by the Lindblad master\nequation. In this paper, we analyze the convergence criteria and the\nconvergence speed of a Markovian, purely dissipative quantum random walk on an\nunstructured search space. We analytically derive the mixing time for\ncontinuous- and discrete-time processes for different coupling regimes that\ncontrol the random walk. Then, we map the results onto an actual implementation\nto correctly estimate the potential and show that it is no more efficient than\nclassical search. Despite this, we highlight the connections between the\nclassical random walks and open quantum random walks and demonstrate how to\nrecover a quadratic speedup in the unitary limit. Moreover, the study of the\nGrover problem reveals how the hyperparameters affect the cost of\nimplementation. This helps us refine the complexity analysis of the\ninvestigated algorithm to simulate the Lindblad equation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
