In response to these\nchallenges, we introduce a novel system named Deep Point Cloud Semantic\nTransmission (PCST), designed for end-to-end wireless point cloud transmission.\nOur approach employs a progressive resampling framework using sparse\nconvolution to project point cloud data into a semantic latent space. These\nsemantic features are subsequently encoded through a deep joint source-channel\n(JSCC) encoder, generating the channel-input sequence. To enhance transmission\nefficiency, we use an adaptive entropy-based approach to assess the importance\nof each semantic feature, allowing transmission lengths to vary according to\ntheir predicted entropy. PCST is robust across diverse Signal-to-Noise Ratio\n(SNR) levels and supports an adjustable rate-distortion (RD) trade-off,\nensuring flexible and efficient transmission. Experimental results indicate\nthat PCST significantly outperforms traditional separate source-channel coding\n(SSCC) schemes, delivering superior reconstruction quality while achieving over\na 50% reduction in bandwidth usage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
