NASA's Meteoroid Environment Office issues meteor shower forecasts that\ndescribe these periods of elevated risk, primarily for the purpose of helping\nplan extravehicular activities. These forecasts are constructed using a list of\nmeteor shower parameters that has evolved over time to include newly discovered\nshowers and incorporate improved measurements of their characteristics.\nHowever, at this point in time, more than a thousand meteor showers have been\nreported by researchers, many of which are extremely minor, are unconfirmed, or\nlack measurements of critical parameters. Thus, a comprehensive approach is no\nlonger feasible. In this report we present a quantitative criterion for a\npotentially hazardous meteor shower and apply this criterion to the list of\nestablished meteor showers in order to determine which showers should be\nincluded in our annual forecasts.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
