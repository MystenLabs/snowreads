We\npresent PolyHorn which is a tool for solving polynomial Horn clauses in which\nvariables on both sides of the implication are real valued. Our tool provides a\nunified framework for polynomial Horn clause solving problems that arise in\nseveral papers in the literature. Our experimental evaluation over a wide range\nof benchmarks show the applicability of the tool as well as its benefits as\nopposed to simply using existing SMT solvers to solve such constraints.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
