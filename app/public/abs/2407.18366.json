The\ndetection of the (H2)2 infrared absorption spectrum was reported more than\nthirty years ago at a temperature of 20 K. Due to the sharp decrease of the\n(H2)2 abundance with temperature, a detection at room temperature was generally\nconsidered as hardly achievable. Here we report the first room temperature\ndetection of partly resolved rotational structures of (H2)2 by cavity ring down\nspectroscopy at sub-atmospheric pressures, in the region of the first overtone\nband of H2 near 1.2 micron. The quantitative analysis of the absorption\nfeatures observed around ten allowed or forbidden transition frequencies of the\nmonomer provides insight on the structure of this elusive species and a\nbenchmark for future theoretical studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
