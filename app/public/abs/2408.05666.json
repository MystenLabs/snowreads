We have\nalready shown the existence of the critical accretion rates for the accretion\nof CO-rich matter above which the flow truncates in the supersonic region due\nto nuclear burning in the previous paper \\citep{2022ApJ...933...29N}. Here, we\nshow that there are also critical accretion rates for helium-rich matter. While\nwe used empirical formulae for the energy generation rates for carbon burning\nand oxygen burning without solving the nuclear reaction network in our previous\nwork, we solve a simple nuclear reaction network consisting of 13 elements from\n$^4$He to $^{56}$Ni to investigate influence of the energy generation from not\nonly triple-$\\alpha$ reactions but also the subsequent reactions of synthesized\nelements. We have also qualitatively confirmed the previous results for CO-rich\nmatter accretion using the revised code with the nuclear reaction network and\nreported some new findings.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NzNdR7xDAi2GQCEiIfG60raouFgGupz5tNNLXJPAd14","pdfSize":"1446680"}
