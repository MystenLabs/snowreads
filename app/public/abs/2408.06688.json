The multiscan principle allows to tailor\nthe writing regime to excel at key features of any integrated photonic\nplatform: coupling losses and propagation losses. We optimized the writing\nparameters for different sizes of square-shaped waveguides and reached the mode\noverlap value with a standard single-mode optical fiber of above 98.8\\% and\ndemonstrated very low coupling losses of 0.2 dB/facet on average. Propagation\nlosses in the fabricated waveguides amounted to 0.07 dB/cm. We applied the\ndeveloped recipe to the fabrication of a fiber-coupled 25-channel\ninterferometer with total insertion losses below 1 dB. The findings of this\nwork are of interest for broad range of applications and in particular for\noptical information processing and quantum photonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
