For this purpose,\nwe have added 229 Ti-related reactions in the chemical network. In addition, we\nconsider 230 fine-structure energy levels, the corresponding 223 radiative\ntransitions, and 444 collisional transitions with ortho and para H$_2$ and\npredict 66 TiO lines. We perform spectroscopic simulations of TiO emission from\nthe circumstellar region of the oxygen-rich red supergiant VY Canis Majoris to\nvalidate our update. Our model reproduces the observed TiO column density. This\nupdate is helpful in modeling dust-free astrophysical environments where Ti is\nin the gas phase and TiO can form.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
