We work within the solid axiomatic framework of the\nHaag-Ruelle scattering theory and derive formulae which can be used to\napproximate scattering amplitudes arbitrarily well in terms of linear\ncombinations of Euclidean correlators at discrete time separations. Our result\ngeneralizes and extends the range of applicability of a result previously\nobtained by Barata and Fredenhagen [Commun. Math. Phys. 138 (1991) 507-520]. We\nprovide a concrete procedure to construct such approximations, making our\nformulae ready to be used in numerical calculations of non-perturbative QCD\nscattering amplitudes. A detailed numerical investigation is needed to assess\nwhether the proposed strategy can lead to the calculation of scattering\namplitudes with phenomenologically satisfactory precision with presently\navailable lattice QCD data. This will be the subject of future work.\nNevertheless, the numerical accuracy and precision of lattice simulations is\nsystematically improvable, and we have little doubts that our approach will\nbecome useful in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
