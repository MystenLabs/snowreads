Importantly, our model takes into\naccount the long-range interactions between defects that result from the flows\nthey produce as well as the orientational coupling between defects inherent in\nnematics. We show that the model can analytically predict bound states between\ntwo $+1/2$ winding number defects, effective attraction between two $-1/2$\ndefects, and the scaling of a critical unbinding length between $\\pm 1/2$\ndefects with activity. The model also gives predictions for the trajectories of\ndefects, such as the scattering of $+1/2$ defects by $-1/2$ defects at a\ncritical impact parameter that depends on activity. In the presence of circular\nconfinement, the model predicts a braiding motion for three $+1/2$ defects that\nwas recently seen in experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kctMLDRJYzZyIS52xrTodc84Aq80IAWon5-IvjhniB8","pdfSize":"7941888"}
