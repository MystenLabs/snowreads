As we push the boundaries of technology creating smaller,\nmore precise tools for delicate surgery treatments, the behavior of these\nalloys at tiny scales becomes increasingly crucial. In this study, we discover\nthat the size effect of critical stress required for stress-induced phase\ntransformation is not universal. We propose an orientation-dependent power\ndecay law, indicating a specific increase in critical stress for pillars\nsmaller than 1 micron meter for the nominally soft [001] and hard [111]\norientations. Additionally, we observe high transformability with 11\\%\nrecoverable strain under high stress (2 GPa) through lattice frustration at\n200nm scale. This research opens new avenues for exploring the superior elastic\nbehavior of shape memory alloys for nanodevices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
