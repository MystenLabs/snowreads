This document aims\nto summarise this event and present the ECR perspective, outline the key\nquestions that came up during the discussions, and explore how ECRs can\ninfluence the decision process of future colliders community and beyond.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
