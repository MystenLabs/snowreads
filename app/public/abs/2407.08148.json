The concept of intra-modal\nself-supervised learning is first presented to facilitate the unsupervised\ncross-modal homography estimation. The correlation-based homography estimation\nnetwork and the consistent feature map projection are combined to form the\nlearnable architecture of SCPNet, boosting the unsupervised learning framework.\nSCPNet is the first to achieve effective unsupervised homography estimation on\nthe satellite-map image pair cross-modal dataset, GoogleMap, under [-32,+32]\noffset on a 128x128 image, leading the supervised approach MHN by 14.0% of mean\naverage corner error (MACE). We further conduct extensive experiments on\nseveral cross-modal/spectral and manually-made inconsistent datasets, on which\nSCPNet achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among unsupervised\napproaches, and owns 49.0%, 25.2%, 36.4%, and 10.7% lower MACEs than the\nsupervised approach MHN.
