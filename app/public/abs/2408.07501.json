The\nsystem is of a hybrid nature, partly cooperative and partly competitive, but\nneither of these entirely. As a result, the comparison principle does not hold.\nWe study spreading properties of solution fronts when the infection is\nlocalized initially. We show that there is a well-defined spreading speed and\nthat it coincides with the minimal speed of the traveling waves. Next we study\nthe case where the coefficients are spatially homogeneous and show that, when\nspreading occurs, every solution to the Cauchy problem converges to the unique\npositive stationary solution as $t\\to\\infty$. Finally we consider the case of\nrapidly oscillating coefficients, that is, when the spatial period of the\ncoefficients, denoted by $\\varepsilon$, is very small. We show that there\nexists a unique positive stationary solution, and that every positive solution\nto the Cauchy problem converges to this stationary solution as $t\\to\\infty$. We\nthen discuss the homogenization limit as $\\varepsilon\\to 0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
