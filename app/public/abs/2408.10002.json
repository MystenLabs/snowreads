We introduce novel algorithms for\ntracing the complete trade-off curve, or Pareto front, between quality and\nfairness in clustering problems; that is, computing all clusterings that are\nnot dominated in both objectives by other clusterings. Unlike previous work\nthat deals with specific objectives for quality and fairness, we deal with all\nobjectives for fairness and quality in two general classes encompassing most of\nthe special cases addressed in previous work. Our algorithm must take\nexponential time in the worst case as the Pareto front itself can be\nexponential. Even when the Pareto front is polynomial, our algorithm may take\nexponential time, and we prove that this is inevitable unless P = NP. However,\nwe also present a new polynomial-time algorithm for computing the entire Pareto\nfront when the cluster centers are fixed, and for perhaps the most natural\nfairness objective: minimizing the sum, over all clusters, of the imbalance\nbetween the two groups in each cluster.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
