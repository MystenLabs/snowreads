Learning Mesh-Based Simulation with Graph Networks. ICML\n2021] to unseen geometries for fluid dynamics, e.g. predicting the flow around\na new obstacle that was not part of the training data. For this purpose, we\ncreate a new benchmark dataset for data-driven computational fluid dynamics\n(CFD) which extends DeepMind's flow around a cylinder dataset by including\ndifferent shapes and multiple objects. We then use this new dataset to extend\nthe generalization experiments conducted by DeepMind on MGNs by testing how\nwell an MGN can generalize to different shapes. In our numerical tests, we show\nthat MGNs can sometimes generalize well to various shapes by training on a\ndataset of one obstacle shape and testing on a dataset of another obstacle\nshape.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
