The facilities may be positioned on the vertices as well as on the\ninterior of the edges. The goal is to position as few facilities as possible\nsuch that every point on every edge has distance at most $\\delta$ to one of\nthese facilities. For large $\\delta$, the problem is similar to dominating set,\nwhich is hard to approximate, while for small $\\delta$, say close to $1$, the\nproblem is similar to vertex cover. In fact, as shown by Hartmann et al. [Math.\nProgram. 22], $\\delta$-Covering for all unit-fractions $\\delta$ is polynomial\ntime solvable, while for all other values of $\\delta$ the problem is NP-hard.\n  We study the approximability of $\\delta$-Covering for every covering range\n$\\delta>0$. For $\\delta \\geq 3/2$, the problem is log-APX-hard, and allows an\n$\\mathcal O(\\log n)$ approximation. For every $\\delta < 3/2$, there is a\nconstant factor approximation of a minimum $\\delta$-cover (and the problem is\nAPX-hard when $\\delta$ is not a unit-fraction). We further study the dependency\nof the approximation ratio on the covering range $\\delta < 3/2$. By providing\nseveral polynomial time approximation algorithms and lower bounds under the\nUnique Games Conjecture, we narrow the possible approximation ratio, especially\nfor $\\delta$ close to the polynomial time solvable cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
