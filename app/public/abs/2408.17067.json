For such a model, we\npresent a combinatorial description of the structure of rotations and develop\nan algorithm to construct the poset of rotations, in time $O(|E|^2)$ (including\noracle calls). As a consequence, one can obtain a ``compact'' affine\nrepresentation of stable matchings and efficiently solve some related problems.\n(The paper is written in Russian.)\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
