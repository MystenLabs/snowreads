Typical examples include the half quantized\nChern-Simons orbital magnetoelectric coupling in three dimensional (3D) axion\ninsulators and topological insulators, which are the hallmarks of their\nnontrivial bulk band topology. While the Chern-Simons coupling is well defined\nonly for insulators with zero Chern number, the orbital magnetoelectric effects\nin 3D Chern insulators with nonzero (layer) Chern numbers are still open\nquestions. In this work, we propose a never-mentioned quantization rule for the\nlayer-resolved orbital magnetoelectric response in 3D Chern insulators, the\ngradient of which is exactly quantized in unit of $e^2/h$. By theoretical\nanalysis and numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the quantized orbital\nmagnetoelectric response remains robust for various types of interlayer\nhoppings and stackings, even against disorder and lack of symmetries. We argue\nthat the robustness has a topological origin and protected by layer Chern\nnumber. It is thus promising to observe the proposed quantized orbital\nmagnetoelectric response in a slab of 3D Chern insulator thanks to recent\nexperimental developments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"awYfV9QLRQYB4t1z7QMF9d5tKrUgQdd5liMHOLUlYno","pdfSize":"2242483"}
