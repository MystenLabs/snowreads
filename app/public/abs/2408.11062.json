Despite recent advancements,\nexisting LLM-based methods have not adequately addressed scalability, leading\nto inefficiencies when processing wide tables. Furthermore, current\ninteraction-based approaches either lack a step-by-step, interpretable SQL\ngeneration process or fail to provide an efficient and universally applicable\ninteraction design. To address these challenges, we introduce Interactive-T2S,\na framework that generates SQL queries through direct interactions with\ndatabases. This framework includes four general tools that facilitate proactive\nand efficient information retrieval by the LLM. Additionally, we have developed\ndetailed exemplars to demonstrate the step-wise reasoning processes within our\nframework. Our experiments on the BIRD-Dev dataset, employing a setting without\noracle knowledge, reveal that our method achieves state-of-the-art results with\nonly two exemplars, underscoring the effectiveness and robustness of our\nframework.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
