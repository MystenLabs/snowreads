Currently, the vast majority\nof quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up\nof qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and\nmany interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes\ndedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum\nprogramming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible,\ncomputationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing\neverything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator,\navoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum\nprogramming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics\nor linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in\nmind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language\nunder this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs,\nit also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning\nqubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MdJv4Ox5xTWocndeBmAW5rZIY_j4mTknKUyp-uBOYp0","pdfSize":"679284"}
