Here, without any gain or loss, the non-Bloch wave transport that is\nunique to NH systems is demonstrated at the junction of the two dimensional\nChern insulator and the normal conductor. In the band gap of the non-trivial\nChern insulator, the interface between two material types can be effectively\ndescribed by a one-dimensional NH Hamiltonian--such NH character of the\ninterface is ascribed to the conductor self-energy of a reservoir. As a\nconsequence of asymmetric hopping terms in the interface Hamiltonian,\ntheoretical analysis shows that the wave propagation along the interface\nexhibits dissipative non-reciprocity (dubed non-Bloch transport). What's more,\nthis anomaly transport is verified in the junction formed by the\nelectromagnetic metamaterial which is constructed by the reverse-design\nstrategy; the strategy enables the general solution of metamaterial structures\nfor emulating any tight-binding models. Further, implementing this strategy, we\nalso investigate the gapless boundary modes in the Haldane-like hyperbolic\nmetamaterial. Our work provides a conceptually rich avenue to construct NH\nsystems for both optics and electronics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
