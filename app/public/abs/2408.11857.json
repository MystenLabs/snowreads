As opposed to \"base\" or\n\"foundation\" models, instruct-tuned models are optimized to respond to\nimperative statements. We present Hermes 3, a neutrally-aligned generalist\ninstruct and tool use model with strong reasoning and creative abilities. Its\nlargest version, Hermes 3 405B, achieves state of the art performance among\nopen weight models on several public benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
