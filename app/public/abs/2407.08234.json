Firstly, we construct a position and orientation model\npredictive tracking control (POMPTC) scheme for mobile manipulators. The\nproposed POMPTC scheme can simultaneously minimize the tracking error, joint\nvelocity, and joint acceleration. Moreover, it can achieve synchronous control\nfor the position and orientation of the end-effector. Secondly, a finite-time\nconvergent neural dynamics (FTCND) model is constructed to find the optimal\nsolution of the POMPTC scheme. Then, based on the proposed POMPTC scheme, a\nnon-singular fast terminal sliding model (NFTSM) control method is presented,\nwhich considers the disturbances caused by the base motion on the manipulator\nat the dynamic level. It can achieve finite-time tracking performance and\nimprove the anti-disturbances ability. Finally, simulation and experiments show\nthat the proposed control method has the advantages of strong robustness, fast\nconvergence, and high control accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
