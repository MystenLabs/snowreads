The PDE coefficients are allowed to be\npiecewise regular and complex-valued; this set-up therefore includes scattering\nfrom a PEC obstacle and/or variable real-valued coefficients, with the\nradiation condition approximated by a perfectly matched layer (PML).\n  In the analysis of the $h$-version of the finite-element method, with fixed\npolynomial degree $p$, applied to the time-harmonic Maxwell equations, the\n$\\textit{asymptotic regime}$ is when the meshwidth, $h$, is small enough (in a\nwavenumber-dependent way) that the Galerkin solution is quasioptimal\nindependently of the wavenumber, while the $\\textit{preasymptotic regime}$ is\nthe complement of the asymptotic regime.\n  The results of this paper are the first preasymptotic error bounds for the\ntime-harmonic Maxwell equations using first-type N\\'ed\\'elec elements or\nhigher-than-lowest-order second-type N\\'ed\\'elec elements. Furthermore, they\nare the first wavenumber-explicit results, even in the asymptotic regime, for\nMaxwell scattering problems with a non-empty scatterer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
