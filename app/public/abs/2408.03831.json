Quantum resources, as quantified by non-stabilizerness,\nhave in one theoretical approach been linked to a family of entropic, monotonic\nfunctions. In this work, we demonstrate both analytically and numerically a\nsimple relationship between non-stabilizerness and information scrambling using\nthe fluctuations of an entropy-based quantifier. Specifically, we find that the\nnon-stabilizerness generated by a random quantum circuit is proportional to\nfluctuations of mutual information. Furthermore, we explore the role of\nnon-stabilizerness in measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions. We\nfind that the fluctuations of mutual information decrease with increasing\nnon-stabilizerness yielding potentially easier identification of the transition\npoint. Our work establishes a key connection between quantum resource theory,\ninformation scrambling and measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
