Universal control policies, applicable\nacross diverse robot morphologies, promise to mitigate this challenge.\nPredominantly, models based on Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Transformers are\nemployed, owing to their effectiveness in capturing relational dynamics across\na robot's limbs. However, these models typically employ homogeneous graph\nstructures that overlook the functional diversity of different limbs. To bridge\nthis gap, we introduce HeteroMorpheus, a novel method based on heterogeneous\ngraph Transformer. This method uniquely addresses limb heterogeneity, fostering\nbetter representation of robot dynamics of various morphologies. Through\nextensive experiments we demonstrate the superiority of HeteroMorpheus against\nstate-of-the-art methods in the capability of policy generalization, including\nzero-shot generalization and sample-efficient transfer to unfamiliar robot\nmorphologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
