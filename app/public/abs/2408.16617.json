However, a prevailing challenge is the coding\noverhead due to limited quantum connectivity, constrained by nearest-neighbor\ncoupling among superconducting qubits. Here, we propose a novel multimode\ncoupling scheme using three resonators driven by two microwaves, based on the\nresonator-induced phase gate, to extend the $ZZ$ interaction distance between\nqubits. We demonstrate a CZ gate fidelity exceeding 99.9\\% within 160 ns at\nfree spectral range (FSR) of 1.4 GHz, and by optimizing driving pulses, we\nfurther reduce the residual photon to nearly $10^{-3}$ within 100 ns at FSR of\n0.2 GHz. These facilitate the long-range CZ gate over separations reaching\nsub-meters, thus significantly enhancing qubit connectivity and making a\npractical step towards the scalable integration and modularization of quantum\nprocessors. Specifically, our approach supports the implementation of quantum\nerror correction codes requiring high connectivity, such as low-density parity\ncheck codes that paves the way to achieving fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
