However, for some\nflavor-symmetry scenarios (see section~3.1), the leptogenesis mechanism is\nprohibited to work as usual. To tackle this problem, in this paper we have made\nan exhausitive study on the possibility that the renormalization group\nevolution effect may induce a successful leptogenesis for these particular\nscenarios. Our study provides some complementarities to the previous related\nstudies in Refs. [26, 27, 28] (see section~3.2).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
