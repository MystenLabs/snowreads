To bridge this gap, this paper proposes a\nhybrid proactive safety model integrating data-driven and knowledge-driven\napproaches. The model comprises three main steps: proactive safety actions to\ngenerate safety data, data-driven approaches to mine safety data, and\nknowledge-driven approaches to depicting risk knowledge graphs. Application of\nthis model to a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) scenario demonstrates\nits efficacy in identifying and addressing safety issues proactively. The\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed\nproactive safety model, suggesting its endorsement within both academic and\nindustrial applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
