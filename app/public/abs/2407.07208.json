Inserting fictive reservoirs\n\\textemdash either Landauer Reservoirs (LRs) or Energy Preservings Reservoirs\n(EPRs) \\textemdash along the counter-propagating modes to mimic edge channel\nmixing, the conductance is shown rapidly converging towards the\nKane-Fisher-Polchinski conductance fixed point $2/3 \\times (e^2/h$) for both\nEPRs and LRs. However, LRs give equal charge and thermal relaxation lengths\nwhile EPRs show infinite thermal relaxation length. The Hall bar current noise\nis found varying linearly with current at large bias, leading to an apparent\n(or Fake) Fano factor $\\simeq 0.19.../\\sqrt{N+1}$ for N LRs, or exponentially\nvanishing for EPRs. Withal, inserting a Quantum Point Contact in the middle of\nthe Hall bar reveals the recently observed $0.5e^{2}/h$ conductance plateau.\nFinally, the 2010 Bid et al. first reported observation of neutral modes can be\nexplained by an upstream diffusive heat flow and delta-T noise, without\nintroducing any specific collective neutral mode.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
