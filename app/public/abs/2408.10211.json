Then, the interpreter-based information theory with its complexity\nis given by formula. Through the relationship between complexity and PAC\nlearnability, the general PAC learnability corresponding to general complexity\nis derived. Then we generalize the observation process to the formal system\nwith functors, in which we give concrete proof of the generalized G\\\"odel\nincompleteness theorem. Finally, the Cantor set, the original G\\\"odel\nincompleteness theorem, the Turing halting problem and the EPR paradox are put\ninto the same mathematical framework as the specific applications of the\ngeneral G\\\"odel incompleteness theorem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ncDUUd-Ww56bDyQ-XH1-wb1uedQ1HLI5X3q5mRiftVU","pdfSize":"1378052"}
