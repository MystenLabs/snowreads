In general, the articles related to this topic use\nmatrix systems to solve both direct and inverse kinematics, using complex\ntechniques such as decoupling or the Jacobian calculation. By simplifying the\nwalking process, its resolution has been proposed in a simple way using only\ngeometric techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aOi9ZofBafMtCNHJJyrAnAJmGmwN_royE9_GLFB-kco","pdfSize":"895122"}
