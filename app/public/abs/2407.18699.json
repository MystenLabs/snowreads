This is\nespecially true when it comes to Layer~2 (L2) ecosystems, and ZKsync, in\nparticular. To address these issues, we have curated a dataset from 1 year of\nactivity extracted from a ZKsync Era archive node and made it freely available\nto external parties. In this paper, we provide details on this dataset and how\nit was created, showcase a few example analyses that can be performed with it,\nand discuss some future research directions. We also publish and share the code\nused in our analysis on GitHub to promote reproducibility and to support\nfurther research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
