From two different perspectives, we\nanalyzed two entanglement transformations in the protocol. We evaluated the\nenergy costs and resource requirements of the analyzed schemes. Furthermore, we\nstudied the impact of experimental imperfections on the non-Gaussian states\ngenerated by measuring the number of particles. We explored the effects of\nphoton loss and imperfect detectors on the squeezed Fock state generation\nprotocol.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
