More precisely, we establish that on any compact set\nwith connected complement, local smooth solutions to the 3D unsteady Stokes\nsystem can be approximated with an arbitrary small positive error in $L^\\infty$\nnorm by a global solution of the 3D unsteady Stokes system, where the velocity\ngrows at most exponentially at spatial infinity and the pressure grows\npolynomially. Additionally, by considering a parasitic solution to the Stokes\nsystem, we establish that some growths at infinity are indeed necessary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"77gZfLwJSHotnBPougHPmdH2fQkVPaf5FlcTyaNE0vI","pdfSize":"310445"}
