In arXiv:2105.07724, the above construction for\n$\\mathrm{SL}_2$ has been generalized to Lusztig's quantum group for\n$\\mathfrak{sl}_2$ and root of unity $\\zeta$, which produces the mixed higher\nVerlinde categories $\\mathrm{Ver}^{\\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$. Inspired by the results\nof arXiv:2003.10499, we study the properties of these braided tensor categories\nin detail. In particular, we establish a Steinberg tensor product formula for\nthe simple objects of $\\mathrm{Ver}^{\\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$, construct a braided\nembedding $\\mathrm{Ver}_{p^n}\\hookrightarrow \\mathrm{Ver}^{\\zeta}_{p^{(n+1)}}$,\ncompute the symmetric center of $\\mathrm{Ver}^{\\zeta}_{p^{(n)}}$, and identify\nits Grothendieck ring.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
