The amalgamated\nduplication of $R$ along $I$ is the subring $R\\Join I:=\\{(r,r+i)| r\\in R, i\\in\nI\\}$ of $R\\times R$. This paper investigates the extended zero-divisor graph of\nthe amalgamated duplication of $R$ along $I$. The purpose of this work is to\nstudy when $\\overline{\\Gamma}(R\\Join I)$ and $\\Gamma(R\\Join I)$ coincide, to\ncharacterize when $\\overline{\\Gamma}(R\\Join I)$ is complete, and to compute the\ndiameter and the girth of $\\overline{\\Gamma}(R\\Join I)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
