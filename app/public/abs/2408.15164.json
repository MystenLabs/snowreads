It is proven that approximate controllability\nholds if we can find a saturating subset of actuators. The notion of saturating\nset is relaxed when compared to previous literature, so that a weaker\nsufficient condition for approximate controllability is provided. The result\nholds for general bounded two-dimensional spatial domains with smooth boundary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
