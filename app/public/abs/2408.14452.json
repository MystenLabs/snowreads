To achieve this, an\noptimal modification based optimization problem, equivalent to the original\none, is first formulated. This reformulated problem is then solved\nanalytically, and the optimal weight sets are derived from its solutions.\nContrary to existing literature that asserts the uniqueness of optimal weight\nsets based on numerical examples, our findings reveal that, in some cases, the\ntaxicab BWM leads to multiple optimal weight sets. This framework provides a\nsolid mathematical foundation that enhances understanding of the model. It also\neliminates the requirement for optimization software, improving the model's\nprecision and efficiency. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed framework\nis demonstrated through numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
