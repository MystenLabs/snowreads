In this paper, we\nprovide a categorical framework to combine fixpoints with derivatives by\nstudying Cartesian differential categories with a fixpoint operator. We\nintroduce an additional axiom relating the derivative of a fixpoint with the\nfixpoint of the derivative. We show how the standard examples of Cartesian\ndifferential categories where we can compute fixpoints provide canonical models\nof this notion. We also consider when the fixpoint operator is a Conway\noperator, or when the underlying category is closed. As an application, we show\nhow this framework is a suitable setting to formalize the Newton-Raphson\noptimization for fast approximation of fixpoints and extend it to higher order\nlanguages.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jHMijp-f8ttYfa2ockiKKZbA8de-ypSYVqgfhtlts1Y","pdfSize":"369307"}
