Microwave spectroscopy in tunable\nloop-gap resonator structures identifies and characterizes the soft mode and\nhigher-energy electronuclear states. We study these modes as a function of\nfrequency and magnetic fields applied transverse and parallel to the Ising\naxis. These are understood in the context of a theoretical model of a soft\nelectronuclear mode that interacts with soft photons as well as soft phonons.\nWe identify competing infrared divergences at the quantum critical point,\ncoming from the photons and the electronuclear soft mode. It is an incomplete\ncancellation of these divergences that leads to the muted but distinct\nsignatures observed in the experiments. The application of a longitudinal\nmagnetic field gaps the soft mode. Measurements well away from the quantum\ncritical point reveal a set of ``Walker'' modes associated with ferromagnetic\ndomain dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
