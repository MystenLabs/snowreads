By relating the half-filled 2D topological flat bands to\nthe surface states of 3D topological insulators in symmetry class AIII, we\nreveal the topological obstruction to the formation of gapped SC and\ninter-valley charge orders without intrinsic topological orders, in the\npresence of the anti-unitary particle-hole symmetry at half filling. This is a\ngeneralization of the Li-Haldane arguments for nodal superconductivity to\nstrongly interacting electrons. In contrast to the $\\mathbb{Z}$-valued\nobstruction derived from the non-interacting band topology, the topological\nobstruction of interacting electrons in half-filled flat bands has a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_{8}$ classification, depending on the charge (valley) Chern number\nof the superconducting (inter-valley charge) orders. This is demonstrated by an\ninteracting Hamiltonian for half-filled flat bands with a net Chern number\n$C=4$, where superconductivity and $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order coexist in\na gapped ground state with particle-hole symmetry.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9jizYlnZymZ8W3L9e0-TaNCHWZhFibg_3_QK4tFJ9lU","pdfSize":"545963"}
