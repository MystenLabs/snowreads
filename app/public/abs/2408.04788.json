For the\nfirst time, we simulate the evolution and saturation of the parallel proton\nfirehose instability using a multi-fluid model without adding artificial\nviscosity. These simulations are performed using a 10-moment, multi-fluid model\nwith local and gradient relaxation heat-flux closures in high-$\\beta$\nproton-electron plasmas. When these higher-order moments are included and\npressure anisotropy is permitted to develop in all species, we find that the\nelectrons have a significant impact on the saturation of the parallel proton\nfirehose instability, modulating the proton pressure anisotropy as the\ninstability saturates. Even for lower $\\beta$s more relevant to heliospheric\nplasmas, we observe a pronounced electron energization in simulations using the\ngradient relaxation closure. Our results indicate that resolving the electron\npressure anisotropy is important to correctly describe the behavior of\nmulti-species plasma systems.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"liHAbyDnXAjkTBIqYsZjhcppTbvWLkRnSd6PbFGG5eU","pdfSize":"8707989"}
