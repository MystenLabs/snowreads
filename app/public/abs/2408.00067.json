These\nare examples of Chern-Weil symmetries, with conserved currents built out of the\ngauge field strength, which can only be explicitly broken through violations of\nthe Bianchi identity. For U(1) gauge theory, it is clear that magnetic\nmonopoles violate not only the $(d-3)$-form magnetic symmetry but also\nlower-form symmetries like the instantonic symmetry. It is also known that an\nimproved instanton number symmetry current, which is conserved, can be\nconstructed in the case that the magnetic monopole admits a dyonic excitation.\nWe study the generalization to other gauge groups, showing that magnetic\nmonopoles also violate instantonic symmetries for nonabelian groups like\nPSU($n$), and that dyon modes can restore such symmetries. Furthermore, we show\nthat in many (but not all) examples where a gauge group $G$ is Higgsed to a\ngauge group $H$, the structure of monopoles and dyons emerging from the\nHiggsing process explicitly breaks the instantonic symmetries of $H$ to those\nof $G$. The meaning of explicit breaking of a $(d-5)$-form symmetry is clearest\nfor $d > 4$, but these results also extend to $d = 4$, where the breaking is\ninterpreted as an obstruction to coupling the theory to a background axion\nfield.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jtLOqE4OoqNk7dY3CJ2PCbK4jbEGz5VEPJWwsZeeNuQ","pdfSize":"967789","txDigest":"AGRpE9mrKJSnnJzcvw13YBSyWk7dXmSpWZQ7ceq7536f","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
