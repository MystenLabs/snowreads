This selection is\nshown to be exponentially fast in an almost sure sense and in average. This\nresult generalizes a known result for non demolition measurements to arbitrary\nrepeated indirect measurements. Our proofs are based on the introduction of a\ndeformation of the original instrument to an equivalent one with a unique\ninvariant state.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
