For practical use in\nprotein engineering, it is important that we can also provide reliable\nuncertainty estimates for our predictions, and while prediction accuracy has\nseen much progress in recent years, uncertainty metrics are rarely reported. We\nhere provide a Gaussian process regression model, Kermut, with a novel\ncomposite kernel for modelling mutation similarity, which obtains\nstate-of-the-art performance for protein variant effect prediction while also\noffering estimates of uncertainty through its posterior. An analysis of the\nquality of the uncertainty estimates demonstrates that our model provides\nmeaningful levels of overall calibration, but that instance-specific\nuncertainty calibration remains more challenging. We hope that this will\nencourage future work in this promising direction.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9FaxtVrtzfdjg7gIVs_uITZLf_1zO7chnIoMi0dkM2g","pdfSize":"4062347","txDigest":"5hsP5qpmKQpSaL1MAT18ctkcimGkGW1JXRyAPP6JdF54","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED","objectId":"0x825ca0c401e45a676b935e23f3a14361a745a0d74cfc9def0a8c37284c3c0475","storedEpoch":"0","certifiedEpoch":"0","startEpoch":"0"}
