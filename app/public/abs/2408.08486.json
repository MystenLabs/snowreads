This approach constitutes a new\nclass of algorithms that combine emerging quantum and analog platforms to\naccelerate computations. Our hybrid algorithm is equivalent to spectral\nclustering and has a computational complexity of $O(N)$, where $N$ is the\nnumber of nodes in the graph, compared to $O(N^3)$ scaling on classical\ncomputing platforms. The proposed method employs the dynamic mode decomposition\n(DMD) framework on the data generated by Schr\\\"{o}dinger dynamics that evolves\non the manifold induced by the graph Laplacian. In particular, we prove and\ndemonstrate that one can extract the eigenvalues and scaled eigenvectors of the\nnormalized graph Laplacian by evolving Schr\\\"{o}dinger dynamics on quantum\ncomputers followed by DMD computations on analog devices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
