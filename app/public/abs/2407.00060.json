  "abstract": "  We consider a system of three analytic functions, two of which are known to\nhave all their zeros on the critical line $\\Re (s)=\\sigma=1/2$. We construct\ninequalities which constrain the third function, $\\xi(s)$, on $\\Im(s)=0$ to lie\nbetween the other two functions, in a sandwich structure. We investigate what\ncan be said about the location of zeros and radius of convergence of expansions\nof $\\xi(s)$, with promising results.\n",
