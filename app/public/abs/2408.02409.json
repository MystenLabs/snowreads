Here, the e-beam-induced transformation of precursor\nmicroparticles employing a low-energy e-beam with an acceleration voltage of 30\nkV in a scanning electron microscope is developed to increase the versatility\nand efficiency of the technique. Under these conditions, the technique can be\nclassified between e-beam lithography, where the e-beam is used to mill holes\nin or grow some different material onto a substrate, and e-beam welding, where\nmatter can be welded together when overcoming the melting phase. Modifying gold\nmicroparticles on an amorphous SiOx substrate reveals the dominant role of\ninelastic electron-matter interaction and subsequent localized heating for the\nobserved melting and vaporization of the precursor microparticles under the\nelectron beam. Monte-Carlo scattering simulations and thermodynamic modeling\nfurther support the findings.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"AO5KMINPd5cMnvBEly7pq_QOqaoGVG8DPL08RkdpUg4","pdfSize":"1053933"}
