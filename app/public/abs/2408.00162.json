We prompt ChatGPT 3.5, Llama 3, and Mixtral 8x7B, three\npowerful and widely used LLMs, for the characteristics associated with 87\nsocial categories (e.g., gender, race, occupations). We identify 14 stereotype\ndimensions (e.g., Morality, Ability, Health, Beliefs, Emotions), accounting for\n~90% of LLM stereotype associations. Warmth and Competence facets were the most\nfrequent content, but all other dimensions were significantly prevalent.\nStereotypes were more positive in LLMs (vs. humans), but there was significant\nvariability across categories and dimensions. Finally, the taxonomy predicted\nthe LLMs' internal evaluations of social categories (e.g., how\npositively/negatively the categories were represented), supporting the\nrelevance of a multidimensional taxonomy for characterizing LLM stereotypes.\nOur findings suggest that high-dimensional human stereotypes are reflected in\nLLMs and must be considered in AI auditing and debiasing to minimize\nunidentified harms from reliance in low-dimensional views of bias in LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oPE0DEy6JPHPrFXHzw4g_DGsQZqwXpYP_GGxI_jMVo8","pdfSize":"2913138"}
