The\napproach here similarly applies cylindrical approximate decoupling at its core,\nalbeit in a new format. However, the presence of additional rulings as $n$\nincreases necessitates a case-by-case analysis, which in itself reveals\ninteresting aspects of the geometry of $\\mathfrak{M}$. The contributions of\nthis paper can be viewed as culminating in the optimal $\\ell^2(L^p)$ decoupling\nover Frenet boxes approximating a suitably defined, arbitrarily thin\nneighborhood of a curve $\\phi$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
