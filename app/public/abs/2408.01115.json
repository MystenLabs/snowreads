We study two types of\nmathematical semantics for epistemic ensembles based on a common syntactic\noperational ensemble semantics: a semantic environment defined by a class of\nglobal epistemic states, and a symbolic environment consisting of a set of\nepistemic formul{\\ae}. For relating these environments, we use the concept of\n{\\Phi}-equivalence, where a class of epistemic states and a knowledge base are\n{\\Phi}-equivalent, if any formula of {\\Phi} holds in the class of epistemic\nstates if, and only if, it is an element of the knowledge base. Our main\ntheorem shows that {\\Phi}-equivalent configurations simulate each other and\nsatisfy the same dynamic epistemic ensemble formulae.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"AFrxjWOCubTO1QQtHEHg0S6_4mQFJROhyoHkiRL-DvU","pdfSize":"289794"}
