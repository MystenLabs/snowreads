However, the conventional approach in\nexisting wheeled bipedal robots involves motor-driven joints with high-ratio\ngearboxes. While this approach provides specific benefits, it also presents\nseveral challenges, including increased mechanical complexity, efficiency\nlosses, noise, vibrations, and higher maintenance and lubrication requirements.\nAddressing the aforementioned concerns, we developed a direct-drive wheeled\nbipedal robot called DIABLO, which eliminates the use of gearboxes entirely.\nOur robotic system is simplified as a second-order inverted pendulum, and we\nhave designed an LQR-based balance controller to ensure stability.\nAdditionally, we implemented comprehensive motion controller, including yaw,\nsplit-angle, height, and roll controllers. Through expriments in simulations\nand real-world prototype, we have demonstrated that our platform achieves\nsatisfactory performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
