In this review paper we provide an\noverview of (1) the structure, properties, growth and transfer of hexagonal\nboron nitride; (2) the creation and assignment of colour centres in hexagonal\nboron nitride for applications in photonic quantum technologies; and (3)\nheterostructure devices for the electrical tuning and charge control of colour\ncentres that form the basis for photonic quantum technology devices. The aim of\nthis review is to provide readers a summary of progress in both defect\nengineering and device fabrication in hexagonal boron nitride based photonic\nquantum technologies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
