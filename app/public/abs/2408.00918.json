The approach infers the dynamics of the other\nagents, and incorporates the inferred quantities into the design of control\nbarrier function (CBF)-based controllers for the ego agent. The inference\nmethod combines offline and online learning with radial basis function neural\nnetworks (RBFNNs). The RBFNNs are initially trained offline using collected\ndatasets. To enhance the generalization of the RBFNNs, the weights are then\nupdated online with new observations, without requiring persistent excitation\nconditions in order to enhance the applicability of the method. Additionally,\nwe employ adaptive conformal prediction to quantify the estimation error of the\nRBFNNs for the other agents' dynamics, generating prediction sets to cover the\ntrue value with high probability. Finally, we formulate a CBF-based controller\nfor the ego agent to guarantee safety with the desired confidence level by\naccounting for the prediction sets of other agents' dynamics in the\nsampled-data CBF conditions. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
