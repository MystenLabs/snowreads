Here, we\nconsider the Battaglia-Treves neural network model for cognitive map storage\nand reconstruction, instantiated with McCulloch & Pitts binary neurons. To\nquantify the information processing capabilities of these networks, we exploit\nspin-glass techniques based on Guerra's interpolation: in the low-storage\nregime (i.e., when the number of stored maps scales sub-linearly with the\nnetwork size and the order parameters self-average around their means) we\nobtain an exact phase diagram in the noise vs inhibition strength plane (in\nagreement with previous findings) by adapting the Hamilton-Jacobi PDE-approach.\nConversely, in the high-storage regime, we find that -- for mild inhibition and\nnot too high noise -- memorization and retrieval of an extensive number of\nspatial maps is indeed possible, since the maximal storage capacity is shown to\nbe strictly positive. These results, holding under the replica-symmetry\nassumption, are obtained by adapting the standard interpolation based on\nstochastic stability and are further corroborated by Monte Carlo simulations\n(and replica-trick outcomes for the sake of completeness). Finally, by relying\nupon an interpretation in terms of hidden units, in the last part of the work,\nwe adapt the Battaglia-Treves model to cope with more general frameworks, such\nas bats flying in long tunnels.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m24FfdWw04yslLIzLnxt6AzalIR9gKI-oISHMpytf4Y","pdfSize":"2241608"}
