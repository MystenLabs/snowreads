Very high redshifts are being detected for extragalactic objects that\nare presumably very distant and young while also exhibiting properties that are\ncharacteristic of a more mature galaxy such as ours. According to Halton Arp\nand Geoffrey Burbidge, redshift disparities consist of an intrinsic component\nand are related to an evolutionary process. Karlsson observed redshift\nperiodicity at integer multiples of 0.089 in log scale and Burbidge observed\nredshift periodicity at integer multiples of 0.061 in linear scale. Since\nSingular Value Decomposition (SVD) based periodicity estimation is known to be\nsuperior for noisy data sets, especially when the data contains multiple\nharmonics and overtones, mainly irregular in nature, we have chosen it to be\nour primary tool for analysis of the quasar-galaxy pair redshift data. We have\nobserved a fundamental periodicity of 0.051 with a confidence interval of 95%\nin linear scale with the site-available Sloan Digital Sky Survey data release 7\n(SDSS DR7) quasar-galaxy pair data set. We have independently generated\nquasar-galaxy pair data sets from both 2dF and SDSS and found fundamental\nperiodicities of 0.077 and 0.089 in log scale with a confidence interval of\n95%.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
