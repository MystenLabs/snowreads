The\nvariational approach captures not only the system dynamics but also the field\ndynamics and is applicable to a variety of quantum models of light-matter\ninteraction such as the Jaynes-Cummings model, Rabi model, and Dicke model, and\nis feasible to tackle the multimode quantized fields. By comparison of the\nvariational and semiclassical dynamics of both the system and field, we\nillustrate that the variational dynamics from the quantum models agrees with\nthose from the corresponding semiclassical models as long as the mean number of\nphotons is sufficiently large. Moreover, we illustrate that in the crossover\nbetween the quantum and semiclassical limits, the quantum corrections lead to\nthe collapse of the oscillations in dynamics, which is absent in the\nsemiclassical models. The variational approach provides a unified treatment of\nlight-matter interaction from the quantum to the semiclassical limit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
