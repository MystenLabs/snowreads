On the A-model side, $X$ arises as a\ncomplete intersection in a projective bundle over a Fano fourfold\n$V_m^{[i,j]}$, and admits a Tyurin degeneration into a pair of degree $m$ Fano\nthreefolds $F_m^{[i]}\\cup F_m^{[j]}$ intersecting on an anticanonical K3\ndivisor of degree $2m$. On the B-model side, $Y$ is fibered by\n$M_{m}$-polarized K3-surfaces of Picard rank 19, and determined by a branched\ncovering of $\\mathbb{P}^1$, consistent with the Doran-Harder-Thompson mirror\nconjecture. When $s=0$, $Y$ itself acquires a Tyurin degeneration, and\ncorrespondingly $X$ acquires a fibration by degree $2m$ K3 surfaces, such that\nthe two K\\\"ahler moduli control the size of the K3-fiber and base\n$\\mathbb{P}^1$. While the mirror pairs with $m\\leq 4$ can be realized as\ncomplete intersections in products of projective spaces or as hypersurfaces in\ntoric varieties, the examples with $m\\geq 5$ are intrinsically non-toric. We\nobtain uniform formulae for the genus 0 and 1 topological free energies near\nthe Tyurin degeneration (mirror to the large base limit), exhibiting modular\nproperties under the Fricke-extended congruence group $\\Gamma_0(m)^+$. We use\nthese results to compute the vertical Gopakumar-Vafa and Noether-Lefschetz\ninvariants and check that their generating functions satisfy the expected\nmodular properties. We also compute generating series of Gopakumar-Vafa\ninvariants with fixed non-zero base degree and exhibit their modular\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"akGP3RdnRn3TqQX3thufgoID8WJ__qatbQg3pY_TF4I","pdfSize":"1609126"}
