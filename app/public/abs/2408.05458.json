It is a two-step limit of the local projective space\n$Z_{\\kappa}^{\\alpha}$, which generalizes the usual Zastava for a simply laced\ngroup $G$. The usual loop Grassmannian of $G$ is recovered when the matrix\n$\\kappa$ is the Cartan matrix of $G$.\n  On the other hand, Braverman, Finkelberg, and Nakajima showed that the\nCompactified Coulomb branch $\\mathbf{M}_{Q}^{\\alpha}$ for the quiver gauge\ntheory with no framing also generalizes the usual Zastava. We show that in the\ncase when $\\kappa$ is the associated matrix of the quiver $Q$, these two\ngeneralizations of Zastava coincide, i.e $\\mathbf{M}_{Q}^{\\alpha}\\cong\nZ_{\\kappa(Q)}^{\\alpha}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xXv3VjTK6AILcZVuyd63FNypZE5k6dUP2dRCXehvLVo","pdfSize":"417033"}
