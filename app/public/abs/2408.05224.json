It not only plays\na key role in protein structure analysis and protein folding kinetics, but also\naffects protein functionality to a large extent and thus has wide applications\nin medicine, food industry, etc. However, due to concerns about side effects or\nfinancial costs of stabilizers, identifying optimal strategies for enhancing\nprotein stability with a minimal amount of stabilizers is of great importance.\nHere we prove that either for the fixed terminal time (including both finite\nand infinite cases) or the free one, the optimal control strategy for\nstabilizing the folding intermediates with a linear strategy for stabilizer\naddition belongs to the class of Bang-Bang controls. The corresponding optimal\nswitching time is derived analytically, whose phase diagram with respect to\nseveral key parameters is explored in detail. The Bang-Bang control will be\nbroken when nonlinear strategies for stabilizer addition are adopted. Our\ncurrent study on optimal strategies for protein stabilizers not only offers\ndeep insights into the general picture of protein folding kinetics, but also\nprovides valuable theoretical guidance on treatments for protein-related\ndiseases in medicine.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
