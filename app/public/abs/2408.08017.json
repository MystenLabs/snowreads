Here, we intruduce a new formula by combining the\ndensity matrix of the Liouville-Master Equation simulating quantum transport in\nnanoscale devices, and the phenomenological model of electronic conductance\nthrough molecules, that can account for the observed distance- and temperature\ndependence of conductance in proteins. We demonstrate its efficacy on\nexperimentally highly conductive extracellular cytochrome nanowires, which are\ngood candidates to illustrate our new approach by calculating and visualizing\ntheir electronic wiring, given the interest in the arrangement of their\nconducting and insulating parts. As proteins and protein nanowires exhibit\nsignificant potential for diverse applications, including energy production and\nsensing, our computational technique can accelerate the design of\nnano-bioelectronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
