We\nfound that this process is mostly sensitive to the behavior of the unpolarized\ngluon GPD $H_{g}$ in the Efremov-Radyushkin-Brodsky-Lepage kinematics. We\nestimated numerically the cross-section and the expected counting rates in the\nkinematics of middle-energy photoproduction experiments which can be realized\nat the future Electron-Ion Collider and in the kinematics of ultraperipheral\ncollisions at LHC. We found that the cross-section is sufficiently large for\ndedicated experimental study.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
