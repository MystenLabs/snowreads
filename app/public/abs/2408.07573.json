Using recursive\nrenormalization group {in Craya-Herring basis}, we show that the nonequilibrium\nsolution is valid only for $d < 6$, whereas equilibrium solution with zero\nviscosity is the only solution for $d>6$. Thus, $d=6$ is the critical dimension\nfor hydrodynamic turbulence. In addition, we show that the energy flux changes\nsign from positive to negative near $d=2.15$. We also compute the energy flux\nand Kolmogorov's constants for various $d$'s, and observe that our results are\nin good agreement with past numerical results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w53jrLYTprfgVYJgEKtmZSJWr_tAcB4BpAIYN9aotSA","pdfSize":"4046545"}
