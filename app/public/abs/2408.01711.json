We develop an analysis of privacy in terms of a\nmanipulation of the quantum Fisher information matrix, and find the optimal\nstate achieving maximum privacy in the estimation of linear combination of the\nunknown parameters in a network of quantum sensors. We also discuss the effect\nof uncorrelated noise on the privacy of the network. Moreover, we illustrate\nour results with an example where the goal is to estimate the average value of\nthe unknown parameters in the network. In this example, we also introduce the\nnotion of quasi-privacy ($\\epsilon$-privacy), quantifying how close the state\nis to being private.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"DKEcjHuoGlD5ROaO7RlT0bCFaqH5Fk1pEjRBTjX5LeE","pdfSize":"420106"}
