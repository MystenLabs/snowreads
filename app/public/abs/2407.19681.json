In this paper we propose a text-based trajectory\ngeneration model that attempts to address all three challenges while relying on\nonly a handful of demonstration trajectory data. Our key idea is to leverage\nrecent flow-based models capable of capturing complex conditional\ndistributions, not directly in the high-dimensional trajectory space, but\nrather in the low-dimensional latent coordinate space of the motion manifold,\nwith deliberately designed regularization terms to ensure smoothness of motions\nand robustness to text variations. We show that our {\\it Motion Manifold Flow\nPrimitive (MMFP)} framework can accurately generate qualitatively distinct\nmotions for a wide range of text inputs, significantly outperforming existing\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
