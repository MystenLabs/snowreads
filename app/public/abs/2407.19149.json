A graph\n$G$ is $1$-tough if for each cut set $S\\subseteq V(G)$, $G-S$ has at most $|S|$\ncomponents. Recently, Shi and Shan \\cite{Shi} conjectured that for each integer\n$k\\geq 4$, being $2k$-connected is sufficient for $1$-tough $(P_2\\cup\nkP_1)$-free graphs to be hamiltonian, which was confirmed by Xu et al.\n\\cite{Xu} and Ota and Sanka \\cite{Ota2}, respectively. In this article, we\ngeneralize the above results through the following Fan-type theorem: Let $k$ be\nan integer with $k\\geq 2$ and let $G$ be a $1$-tough and $k$-connected\n$(P_2\\cup kP_1)$-free graph with $\\mu_{k+1}(G)\\geq\\frac{7k-6}{5}$, then $G$ is\nhamiltonian or the Petersen graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
