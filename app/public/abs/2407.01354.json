The complete dependence on the top-quark mass is taken into account\nwithout making any approximations to the top quark loops mediating the coupling\nbetween the gluons and the Higgs boson. To this end, we have included the\n$gg\\to H$ amplitudes up to three loops and the $pp\\to H$+jet amplitudes up to\ntwo loops in the full SM theory. This is the first fully differential\ncalculation of the top-quark mass effects up to NNLO in QCD, and we study their\nimpact on relevant observables for the LHC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
