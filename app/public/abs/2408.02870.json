This\ninformation is derived from Maxwell's equations and the natural language of\nelectromagnetics is employed. As a result, the coupling matrix coefficients\nstand only for electromagnetics. In this work, we enhance this approach to\nreveal valuable design information for microwave engineering, showing the\nelectromagnetic (EM) coupling among all EM resonators and ports. By the same\ntoken, the similarities with the well-known classical coupling matrix theory\nare addressed. We bridge this gap since the classical theory is the\npreferential language among microwave engineers.\n  Classical coupling matrix theory is a narrowband model for electromagnetics.\nThus, we carry out a narrowband approximation in the electromagnetic coupling\nmatrix. This makes it possible to describe the EM coupling coefficients in the\nsame framework as classical circuits. As a result, proper comparison between\nboth coupling matrices is allowed.\n  Finally, both coupling matrix approaches have a common ground, namely, get\nphysical insight and valuable information for design purposes in\ncoupled-resonator microwave circuits. However, only the electromagnetic\ncoupling matrix details all EM behavior, including parasitic and leakage\ncouplings, and the higher-order mode influence in the microwave circuit.\nSeveral microwave circuits, such as filters and diplexers, will show the\npossibilities of this new technique and its relation to classical coupling\nmatrix theory.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rcJ50CJjA75X0GJ3WHAFGwxRZMSBLU63K8rRErTNV6A","pdfSize":"3990387"}
