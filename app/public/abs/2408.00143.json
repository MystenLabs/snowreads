Can we understand the full system\nfrom what we measure? In the mathematics literature, this question is framed as\nthe observability problem. It has to do with recovering information about the\nstate variables from the observed states (the measurements). In this paper, we\nrelate the observability problem to another structural feature of many models\nrelevant in the physical and biological sciences: the conserved quantity. For\nmodels based on systems of differential equations, conserved quantities offer\ndesirable properties such as dimension reduction which simplifies model\nanalysis. Here, we use differential embeddings to show that conserved\nquantities involving a set of special variables provide more flexibility in\nwhat can be measured to address the observability problem for systems of\ninterest in biology. Specifically, we provide conditions under which a\ncollection of conserved quantities make the system observable. We apply our\nmethods to provide alternate measurable variables in models where conserved\nquantities have been used for model analysis historically in biological\ncontexts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h71f-Y3VqBio2OXv0tyRWWqqI76BFArK6fTbzmq-N-k","pdfSize":"1603351"}
