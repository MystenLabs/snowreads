In the early 1980's Kashiwara solved a generalized version of the\nproblem, valid on complex manifolds of any dimension. He presented it as a\ncorrespondence between regular holonomic D-modules and perverse sheaves. The\nanalogous problem where one drops the regularity condition remained open for\nabout thirty years. We solved it in the paper that received a 2024 Frontiers of\nScience Award. Our construction requires in particular an enhancement of the\ncategory of perverse sheaves. Here, using some examples in dimension one, we\nwish to convey the gist of the main ingredients used in our work.\n  This is a written account of a talk given by the first named author at the\nInternational Congress of Basic Sciences on July 2024 in Beijing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
