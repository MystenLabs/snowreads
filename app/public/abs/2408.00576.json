In this work, we show\nthat an in-gap bound state emerges from the localized hole of the doped charge\ntransfer insulator. We propose an approximate ground state wavefunction based\non one localized Zhang-Rice singlet and the Neel state. By calculating the\nexcitation states with one hole added and removed from this ground state, we\nsuccessfully identify the existence of bound states inside the charge transfer\ngap. This feature is further proved by the MPS-based Lanczos study of a system\nof $4\\times4$ CuO$_2$ unit cells. How these bound states evolve into metallic\nstates is further discussed. Our findings identify the key component of recent\nSTM results on lightly doped Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ and provide a new\nunderstanding of hole-doped charge transfer insulators.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
