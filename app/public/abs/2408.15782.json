More specifically, the local\nnonlinear ITG mode equation is derived adopting the fluid-ion approximation,\nwith the contributions of zonal field structure and phase space zonal structure\nbeat-driven by finite amplitude TAE accounted for on the same footing. The\nobtained nonlinear ITG mode equation is solved both analytically and\nnumerically, and it is found that, the zonal structure beat-driven by TAE has\nonly weakly destabilizing effects on ITG, contrary to usual speculations and\nexisting numerical results.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
