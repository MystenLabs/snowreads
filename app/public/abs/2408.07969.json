By introducing two indexes which\nrespectively express the average profitability of the risky asset (AP) and the\ncurrent profitability of the risky asset (CP), the optimal portfolio selection\nis represented by AP and CP. Furthermore, instead of the traditional maximum\nlikelihood estimation (MLE) of return rate and volatility of the risky asset,\nwe estimate AP and CP with the second-order variation of an auxiliary wealth\nprocess. We prove that the estimations of AP and CP in this paper are more\naccurate than that in MLE. And, the portfolio selection is implemented in\nvarious simulated and real financial markets. Numerical studies confirm the\nsuperior performance of our portfolio selection with the estimation of AP and\nCP under various evaluation criteria.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
