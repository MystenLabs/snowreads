Here we\nintroduce a new matching prescription at this interface, based on the entropy,\nand we compare it with the standard one relying on local energy conservation.\nWe study the behavior of various quantities at the switching time between the\nmodels and investigate a number of final-state hadronic observables. For the\nlatter, we show that they are not modified significantly by the choice of\nmatching prescription, provided an appropriate normalization is chosen for the\ninitial state. In turn, our approach reduces sizeably the ratio of bulk over\nthermodynamic pressure at the beginning of the fluid-dynamical stage.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
