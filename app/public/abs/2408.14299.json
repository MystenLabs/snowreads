For planar 3-trees we can further improve\nthe bound to (3n-9)/4, and for so-called Kleetopes we obtain a bound of at most\n(n-8)/3 edges that cross the spine. The bound for Kleetopes is tight, even if\nthe drawing is not required to be monotone. A Kleetope is a plane triangulation\nthat is derived from another plane triangulation T by inserting a new vertex\nv_f into each face f of T and then connecting v_f to the three vertices of f.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
