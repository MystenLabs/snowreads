  "abstract": "  Entropy is a very useful concept from physics that tries to explain how a\nsystem behaves from a point of view of the thermodynamics. However, there are\ntwo ways to explain entropy, and it depends on if we are studying a microsystem\nor a microsystem. From a macroscopically point of view, it is important to\ndescribe if the system is a reversible system or not. However, form the\nmicroscopically point of view, the concept of chaos is related to entropy. In\nsuch case, entropy measures the amount of disorder into the system. Otherwise,\nthe idea of connecting at the same time the analysis of the macro and micro\nsystem with the use of entropy it is not very common.\n",
