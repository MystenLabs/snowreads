We propose an innovative and inspiring VR system to experience and\nimprove concentration. In the experience of pulling out the holy sword, which\ncannot be achieved simply by force, the player receives multimodal\nconcentration feedback in visual, auditory, and haptic senses. We believe that\nthis experience will help the user confront his/her concentration and improve\nthe ability to control it consciously.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
