In\nthis paper, we focus on the RIS phase configuration problem for the exemplary\ncase of the Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) maximization for an RIS-enabled\nsingle-input single-output system where the metasurface tunable elements admit\na phase difference of $\\pi$ radians. We present a novel closed-form\nconfiguration which serves as a lower bound guaranteeing at least half the SNR\nof the ideal continuous (upper bound) SNR gain, and whose mean performance is\nshown to be asymptotically optimal. The proposed sign alignment configuration\ncan be further used as initialization to standard discrete optimization\nalgorithms. A discussion on the reduced complexity hardware benefits via the\npresented configuration is also included. Our numerical results demonstrate the\nefficacy of the proposed RIS sign alignment scheme over iterative approaches as\nwell as the commonplace continuous phase quantization treatment.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"taieLwrrR-QG__Bpn1I_gXvSkHsx2ttp9ogB07uuhos","pdfSize":"546616"}
