By incorporating a scalar\nfield potential, we show that key features of Loop Quantum Cosmology (LQC),\nsuch as the quantum bounce and the super-inflationary phase, are preserved.\nNumerical solutions to the modified Hamiltonian equations, with initial\nconditions set at the quantum bounce, reveal that the universe's early\nexpansion rate is sensitive to the shape of the potential. For a chaotic\npotential, the inclusion of noncommutativity results in a faster expansion\nrate, whereas for the Starobinsky potential, the expansion rate decreases with\nincreasing noncommutative parameter $\\theta$. Additionally, higher values of\n$\\theta$ lead to an increased time derivative of the Hubble parameter, causing\na shorter yet more expansive super-inflationary phase. Over time, Hubble\nparameters for different values of $\\theta$ converge. For the Starobinsky\npotential, the Hubble parameter consistently decreases with larger $\\theta$,\nresulting in a prolonged super-inflationary stage. The study also addresses the\nvalidation of the Hamiltonian constraint during the evolutionary time.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
