This\npaper presents a framework designed for assessing traffic safety in\nmulti-vehicle situations, facilitating the simultaneous utilization of diverse\nobjective safety metrics. Additionally, it allows the integration of subjective\nperception of safety by adjusting model parameters. The framework was applied\nto evaluate various model configurations in car-following scenarios on a\nhighway, utilizing naturalistic driving datasets. The evaluation of the model\nshowed an outstanding performance, particularly when integrating multiple\nobjective safety measures. Furthermore, the performance was significantly\nenhanced when considering all surrounding vehicles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
