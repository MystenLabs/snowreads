Numerous studies have been conducted on\nthe degree of maps between orientable topological spaces. For each $d \\in\n\\mathbb{Z}$, we construct a degree $ d$ simplicial map from a $(2(n+1)\n\\max\\{|d|,1\\})$-facet colored triangulation of $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \\times\n\\mathbb{S}^1$ to the standard $ 2(n+1) $-facet colored triangulation of $\n\\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{S}^1 $. We demonstrate that these are the\nminimal possible colored triangulations for a degree $d $ simplicial self-map\nof $\\mathbb{S}^{n-1} \\times \\mathbb{S}^1 $, where $n \\geq 2 $. Additionally, we\nconstruct a minimal degree $d $ simplicial map from a closed orientable $\nn$-manifold to $ \\mathbb{S}^n $, where $n \\geq 1 $.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
