Our work has two main contributions. We introduce Spike Threshold\nAdaptive Learning (STAL), a trainable encoder that effectively converts\ncontinuous biosignals into spike trains. Additionally, we propose an ensemble\nof Spiking Recurrent Neural Network (SRNN) classifiers for the multi-stream\nprocessing of sEMG and IMU data. To tackle the challenges of small sample size\nand class imbalance, we implement minority over-sampling with weighted sample\nreplacement during batch creation. Our method achieves outstanding performance\nwith an accuracy of 80.43%, AUC of 67.90%, F1 score of 52.60%, and Matthews\nCorrelation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.437, surpassing traditional rate-based and\nlatency-based encoding methods. The STAL encoder shows superior performance in\npreserving temporal dynamics and adapting to signal characteristics.\nImportantly, our approach (STAL-SRNN) outperforms the best deep learning method\nin terms of MCC, indicating better balanced class prediction. This research\ncontributes to the development of neuromorphic computing for biosignal\nanalysis. It holds promise for energy-efficient, wearable solutions in chronic\npain management.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YlHoxflAtwU4aS2o4iLf-YV4L67ZrqS3yhSxsX2Ys9E","pdfSize":"2712978"}
