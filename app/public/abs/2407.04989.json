We design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme (FPTAS) for\ncounting the number of $b$-matchings in graphs with bounded degrees. Our FPTAS\nalso applies to a broader family of counting problems, namely Holant problems\nwith log-concave signatures. Our algorithm is based on Moitra's linear\nprogramming approach (JACM'19). Using a novel construction called the extended\ncoupling tree, we derandomize the coupling designed by Chen and Gu (SODA'24).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
