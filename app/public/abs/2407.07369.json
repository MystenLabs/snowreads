Assuming that the flow is subject to an external random\nforce, white in time and regular in space, we construct an estimator for the\nviscosity using only observations of the enstrophy. The goal of the paper is to\nprove that the estimator is strongly consistent and asymptotically normal. The\nproof of consistency is based on the explicit formula for the estimator and\nsome bounds for trajectories, while that of asymptotic normality uses in\naddition mixing properties of the Navier-Stokes flow.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
