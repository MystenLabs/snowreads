This paper proposes the use of degenerate parametric\nscattering and measurement of the number of photons in the pump mode to\nconditionally prepare the Schr\\\"odinger cat state. This method ensures the\npreparation of SC in systems with weak parametric non-linear interaction.\nComparison with the existing whispering mode gallery microresonator from\nlithium niobate indicates the possible applicability of this method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
