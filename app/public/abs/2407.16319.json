However, most efforts have been devoted to\nimproving data channel capacity, whereas control-plane capacity bottlenecks are\noften neglected. In this paper, we propose a means of improving the\ncontrol-plane capacity and reliability by shrinking the bit size of a key\nsignaling message - the 5G Downlink Control Information (DCI). In particular, a\ntransformer model is studied as a probability distribution estimator for\nArithmetic coding to achieve lossless compression. Feature engineering, neural\nmodel design, and training technique are comprehensively discussed in this\npaper. Both temporal and spatial correlations among DCI messages are explored\nby the transformer model to achieve reasonable lossless compression\nperformance. Numerical results show that the proposed method achieves 21.7%\nhigher compression ratio than Huffman coding in DCI compression for a\nsingle-cell scheduling scenario.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
