By\nintroducing a suitable stabilizing form, we develop a rigorous interpolation,\nstability, and convergence analysis obtaining optimal error estimates in the\nenergy norm. Finally, we validate the theoretical findings through numerical\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
