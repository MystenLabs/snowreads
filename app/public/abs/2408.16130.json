However, many databases do not\nprovide protected attributes or contain unbalanced representations of\ndemographic groups, complicating the evaluation of model performance across\ndifferent demographics and the application of bias mitigation techniques that\nrely on these attributes. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of\nusing the backbone of Foundation Models as an embedding extractor for creating\ngroups that represent protected attributes, such as gender and age. We propose\nutilizing these groups in different stages of bias mitigation, including\npre-processing, in-processing, and evaluation. Using databases in and\nout-of-distribution scenarios, it is possible to identify that the method can\ncreate groups that represent gender in both databases and reduce in 4.44% the\ndifference between the gender attribute in-distribution and 6.16% in\nout-of-distribution. However, the model lacks robustness in handling age\nattributes, underscoring the need for more fundamentally fair and robust\nFoundation models. These findings suggest a role in promoting fairness\nassessment in scenarios where we lack knowledge of attributes, contributing to\nthe development of more equitable medical diagnostics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
