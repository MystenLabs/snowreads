Inference is carried out using these summaries in place of the\noriginal dataset, resulting in computational gains at the loss of some\ninformation. In likelihood-based SDA, the likelihood function is characterised\nby an integral with a large exponent, which limits the method's utility as for\ntypical models the integral unavailable in closed form. In addition, the\nlikelihood function is known to produce biased parameter estimates in some\ncircumstances. Our article develops a Bayesian framework for SDA methods in\nthese settings that resolves the issues resulting from integral intractability\nand biased parameter estimation using pseudo-marginal Markov chain Monte Carlo\nmethods. We develop an exact but computationally expensive method based on path\nsampling and the block-Poisson estimator, and a much faster, but approximate,\nmethod based on Taylor expansion. Through simulation and real-data examples we\ndemonstrate the performance of the developed methods, showing large reductions\nin computation time compared to the full-data analysis, with only a small loss\nof information.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
