We numerically demonstrate\nsuch enhancement in a patterned slot-waveguide structure using ytterbium-doped\nsilica as the active material. The enhancement arises primarily from the\nincrease of saturation power density and the escape efficiency, and can persist\nin spite of the presence of parasitic absorption in the structure surrounding\nthe active material. Our results point to a new opportunity in photonic\nstructure design for optical refrigeration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
