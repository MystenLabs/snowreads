However, performance in\nthe open world remains underexplored, as current benchmarks cannot capture its\nfull extent. Especially in safety-critical systems, it is crucial that 3D pose\nestimators are audited before deployment, and their sensitivity towards single\nfactors or attributes occurring in the operational domain is thoroughly\nexamined. Nevertheless, we currently lack a benchmark that would enable such\nfine-grained analysis. We thus present STAGE, a GenAI data toolkit for auditing\n3D human pose estimators. We enable a text-to-image model to control the 3D\nhuman body pose in the generated image. This allows us to create customized\nannotated data covering a wide range of open-world attributes. We leverage\nSTAGE and generate a series of benchmarks to audit the sensitivity of popular\npose estimators towards attributes such as gender, ethnicity, age, clothing,\nlocation, and weather. Our results show that the presence of such naturally\noccurring attributes can cause severe degradation in the performance of pose\nestimators and leads us to question if they are ready for open-world\ndeployment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
