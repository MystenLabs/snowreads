In this study, we investigate properties related to\nabsolute separability from the spectrum in qudits-qudits states in the\nbipartite states space $\\mathcal{H}_{mn}=\\mathcal{H}_m \\otimes \\mathcal{H}_n$.\nFirstly, we propose the necessary and sufficient conditions for absolute\nseparable states in the Hilbert space $\\mathcal{H}_{4n}$. These conditions are\nequivalent to the positive semidefiniteness of twelve matrices resulting from\nthe symmetric matricizations of eigenvalues. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\nthis sufficient condition can be extended to the general $\\mathcal{H}_{mn}$\ncase, improving existing conclusions in the literature. These sufficient\nconditions depend only on the first few leading and last few leading\neigenvalues, significantly reducing the complexity of determining absolute\nseparable states. On the other hand, we also introduce additional sufficient\nconditions for determining that states in $\\mathcal{H}_{mn}$ are not absolutely\nseparable. These conditions only depend on $2m-1$ eigenvalues of the mixed\nstates. Our sufficient conditions are not only simple and easy to implement. As\napplications, we derive distance bounds for eigenvalues and purity bounds for\ngeneral absolutely separable states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
