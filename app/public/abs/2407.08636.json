Such results are often useful first steps towards obtaining\nexplicit upper bounds on sets lacking instances of given such progressions. In\nthe companion paper arXiv:2407.08637, we complete this program for sets in\n$[N]^2$ lacking nondegenerate progressions of the form $(x, y), (x + P(z), y),\n(x, y + P(z))$, where $P \\in \\mathbb{Z}[z]$ is any fixed polynomial with an\ninteger root of multiplicity $1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mkQZ24L7TxjlgU8RUH5QoASQmWVEzR1JamePCKhg_OM","pdfSize":"710289"}
