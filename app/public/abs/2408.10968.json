As implied in the title, we have\nincorporated complex analysis (and complex geometry) into this theory in an\nessential way. The roles played by Hermtian symmetric spaces and modern value\ndistribution theory in the theory are clarified. In doing so, many new concepts\nare introduced and many new results are obtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
