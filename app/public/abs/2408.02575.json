In Africa, where health systems frequently\nencounter challenges such as limited resources, inadequate infrastructure,\nfailed health information systems and a shortage of skilled health\nprofessionals, AI offers a transformative opportunity. This paper investigates\nthe applications of AI in public health surveillance across the continent,\npresenting successful case studies and examining the benefits, opportunities,\nand challenges of implementing AI technologies in African healthcare settings.\nOur paper highlights AI's potential to enhance disease monitoring and health\noutcomes, and support effective public health interventions. The findings\npresented in the paper demonstrate that AI can significantly improve the\naccuracy and timeliness of disease detection and prediction, optimize resource\nallocation, and facilitate targeted public health strategies. Additionally, our\npaper identified key barriers to the widespread adoption of AI in African\npublic health systems and proposed actionable recommendations to overcome these\nchallenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1vFw2aQGHgIUpIchIODMt2YQp9p8PcH8kuBIPTlc-g8","pdfSize":"1067145","txDigest":"DNGAiXEwq2cWpuuk5Uw9LyDNQNAVpE6iWZoLkj147mCK","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
