In this iteration of the VIP Cup, we challenged students\nto balance personalization and generalization when performing biomarker\ndetection in 3D optical coherence tomography (OCT) images. Balancing\npersonalization and generalization is an important challenge to tackle, as the\nvariation within OCT scans of patients between visits can be minimal while the\ndifference in manifestation of the same disease across different patients may\nbe substantial. The domain difference between OCT scans can arise due to\npathology manifestation across patients, clinical labels, and the visit along\nthe treatment process when the scan is taken. Hence, we provided a multimodal\nOCT dataset to allow teams to effectively target this challenge. Overall, this\ncompetition gave undergraduates an opportunity to learn about how artificial\nintelligence can be a powerful tool for the medical field, as well as the\nunique challenges one faces when applying machine learning to biomedical data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
