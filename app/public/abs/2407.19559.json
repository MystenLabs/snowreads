We develop a general framework for absorption induced\nby multiple overlapping resonances, based on quasi-normal modes and radiative\nand non-radiative decay rates. Upper bounds on broadband absorption in a slab\nof thickness $d$ take the simple form: $A= 1-\\exp(-F \\alpha d)$, where $\\alpha$\nis the absorption coefficient and $F$ the path enhancement factor. We apply\nthese results to sunlight absorption in photovoltaics and answer the\nlong-standing debate on the best light-trapping strategy in solar cells. For\nangle-independent absorption, we derive the isotropic scattering upper bound $F\n= 4 n^2$ ($n$ the refractive index), extending the well-know Yablonovitch limit\nbeyond the ray optics and weak absorption regimes. For angle-restricted\nillumination, we show that $F$ can be further increased up to $8 \\pi n^2 /\n\\sqrt{3}$ using multi-resonant absorption induced by periodical patterning.\nThese results have a general scope in the field of wave physics and open new\nopportunities to maximize absorption, detection, and attenuation of\nelectromagnetic or mechanical waves in ultrathin devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tLr2k7w-CJfmgmW3X0_bowcsnjfGmui8DHnHN-QRRA8","pdfSize":"7834528","objectId":"0x674b412f8d20e50be60f669f6a612145508902faf03a10f4f54df9dc40b42b46","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
