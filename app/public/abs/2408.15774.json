Power utilities have implemented\npublic safety power shutoffs as a method to mitigate the risk of wildfire by\nproactively de-energizing some power lines, which leaves customers without\npower. System operators have to make a compromise between de-energizing of\npower lines to avoid the wildfire risk and energizing those lines to serve the\ndemand. In this work, with a quantified wildfire ignition risk of each line, a\nresilient operation problem is presented in power systems with a high\npenetration level of renewable generation resources. A two-stage robust\noptimization problem is formulated and solved using column-and-constraint\ngeneration algorithm to find improved balance between the de-energization of\npower lines and the customers served. Different penetration levels of renewable\ngeneration to mitigate the impact of extreme fire hazard situations on the\nenergization of customers is assessed. The validity of the presented robust\noptimization algorithm is demonstrated on various test cases.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
