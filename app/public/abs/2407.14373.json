We give simulation results of benchmark examples that\nillustrate the performance of the proposed adaptive observer.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
