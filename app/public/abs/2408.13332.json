Previous studies\nhave been limited by small volumes with dislocations and/or low dislocation\ndensities in ceramics. Here, we use Brinell ball scratching to create\ncrack-free, large plastic zones, offering a simple and effective method for\ndislocation engineering at room temperature. Using MgO, we tailor high\ndislocation densities up to ~10^15 m^-2. We characterize the plastic zones by\nchemical etching, electron channeling contrast imaging, and scanning\ntransmission electron microscopy, and further demonstrate that crack initiation\nand propagation in the plastic zones with high-density dislocations can be\ncompletely suppressed. The residual stresses in the plastic zones were analyzed\nusing high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction. With the residual\nstress being subsequently relieved via thermal annealing while retaining the\nhigh-density dislocations, we observe the cracks are no longer completely\nsuppressed, but the pure toughening effect of the dislocations remains evident.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
