There are some deviations between the Standard\nModel (SM) predictions of the branching ratios of the leptonic decays of mesons\nand the experimental data. This provides some space for the existence of decay\nchannels where the ALP is one of the products. Three scenarios are considered:\nfirst, the ALP is only coupled to one single charged fermion, namely, the\nquark, the antiquark, or the charged lepton; second, the ALP is only coupled to\nquark and antiquark with the same strength; third, the ALP is coupled to all\nthe charged fermions with the same strength. The constraints of the coupling\nstrength in different scenarios are obtained by comparing the experimental data\nof the branching ratios of leptonic decays of $B^-$, $D^+$, and $D_s^+$ mesons\nwith the theoretical predictions which are achieved by using the Bethe-Salpeter\n(BS) method. These constraints are further applied to predict the upper limits\nof the leptonic decay processes of the $B_c^-$ meson in which the ALP\nparticipates.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
