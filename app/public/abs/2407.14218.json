These scenarios share similarities with maze\nexploration problems in terms of complexity. While several methods have been\nproposed for single-agent systems, ranging from potential fields to flood-fill\nmethods, recent research endeavors have focused on creating methods tailored\nfor multiple agents to enhance the quality and efficiency of maze coverage. The\ncontribution of this paper is the implementation of established maze\nexploration methods and their comparison with a new cost-utility algorithm\ndesigned for multiple agents, which combines the existing methodologies to\noptimize exploration outcomes. Through a comprehensive and comparative\nanalysis, this paper evaluates the performance of the new approach against the\nimplemented baseline methods from the literature, highlighting its efficacy and\npotential advantages in various scenarios.
