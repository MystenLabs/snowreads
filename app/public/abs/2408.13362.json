From an approximation\npoint of view, there are two standard guarantees: an $O(\\log\n\\Delta)$-approximation (where $\\Delta$ is the maximum set size) and an\n$O(f)$-approximation (where $f$ is the maximum number of sets containing any\ngiven element).\n  In this paper, we introduce a new, surprisingly simple, model-independent\napproach to solving SetCover in unweighted graphs. We obtain multiple improved\nalgorithms in the MPC and CRCW PRAM models. First, in the MPC model with\nsublinear space per machine, our algorithms can compute an $O(f)$ approximation\nto SetCover in $\\hat{O}(\\sqrt{\\log \\Delta} + \\log f)$ rounds, where we use the\n$\\hat{O}(x)$ notation to suppress $\\mathrm{poly} \\log x$ and $\\mathrm{poly}\n\\log \\log n$ terms, and a $O(\\log \\Delta)$ approximation in $O(\\log^{3/2} n)$\nrounds. Moreover, in the PRAM model, we give a $O(f)$ approximate algorithm\nusing linear work and $O(\\log n)$ depth. All these bounds improve the existing\nround complexity/depth bounds by a $\\log^{\\Omega(1)} n$ factor.\n  Moreover, our approach leads to many other new algorithms, including improved\nalgorithms for the HypergraphMatching problem in the MPC model, as well as\nsimpler SetCover algorithms that match the existing bounds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"kIkQN0Hg6U_H3NvBX0vuaVnSXWGUyr-iK1jtEhcIveg","pdfSize":"563531"}
