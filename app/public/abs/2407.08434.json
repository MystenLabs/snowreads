In our context,\nachieving precise forecasts of future power consumption is crucial for\noperating flexible energy assets using model predictive control approaches.\nSpecifically, this work focuses on the load profile forecast of a first-year\nenergy community with the common practical challenge of limited historical data\navailability. We propose to pre-train the load prediction models with\nopen-access synthetic load profiles using transfer learning techniques to\ntackle this challenge. Results show that this approach improves both, the\ntraining stability and prediction error. In a test case with 74 households, the\nprediction mean squared error (MSE) decreased from 0.34 to 0.13, showing\ntransfer learning based on synthetic load profiles to be a viable approach to\ncompensate for a lack of historic data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
