We show that almost all minimal\ntheories with conditioning satisfy two quantum no-go theorems: no-information\nwithout disturbance and no-broadcasting. As a relevant example, we construct a\nminimal toy-theory with conditioning where all systems are classical. The\ntheory does not have incompatible measurements nor preparation uncertainty\nrelations, and it is Kochen-Specker noncontextual, and at the same time it\nexhibits irreversibility of measurement disturbance, no-information without\ndisturbance and no-broadcasting. This proves that the latter three properties\ncannot be understood $per se$ as signatures of non-classicality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VeRlI04esrlUVTh1JJ88iByOhLRBCsRWye7M4kyV2xs","pdfSize":"1157319"}
