We give a completely elementary proof for the problem in $\\mathbb{Z}$ and\nsome partial results that contributes to the elementary proof of the problem in\n$\\mathbb{Z}/p\\mathbb{Z}$, avoiding the usage of the powerful polynomial method\nand the Combinatorial Nullstellensatz.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
