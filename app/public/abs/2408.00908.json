For multiple criteria, a Bonferroni correction that partitions\n$\\alpha$ among the criteria produces statistical confidence, at the cost of\nrequiring lower $p$-values for each criterion. The same concept can be applied\nto decisions about early stopping, but that can lead to strict requirements for\n$p$-values. We show how to address that challenge by requiring criteria to be\nsuccessful at multiple decision points.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YbmPA3NF7woPp3EI3XnNmmWLetNaR0IDqTN-rXxgL3Y","pdfSize":"434214","txDigest":"5Hfm6r5GTLz4BgJLwCdJCs88LdrRiDdoG55TmPiYYEoi","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
