Since its proposal, substantial\neffort has been invested in better understanding the problem for physically\nmotivated important families of Hamiltonians. In particular, the\nQMA-completeness of approximating the ground state energy of local Hamiltonians\nhas been extended to the case where the Hamiltonians are geometrically local in\none and two spatial dimensions. Among those physically motivated Hamiltonians,\nstoquastic Hamiltonians play a particularly crucial role, as they constitute\nthe manifestly sign-free Hamiltonians in Monte Carlo approaches. Interestingly,\nfor such Hamiltonians, the problem at hand becomes more ''classical'', being\nhard for the class MA (the randomized version of NP) and its complexity has\ntight connections with derandomization. In this work, we prove that both the\ntwo- and one-dimensional geometrically local analogues remain MA-hard with high\nenough qudit dimension. Moreover, we show that related problems are\nStoqMA-complete.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B3zfP08TeLCX8bchCp85MaiVB-eqPmkZl-GkzhiJclw","pdfSize":"770813"}
