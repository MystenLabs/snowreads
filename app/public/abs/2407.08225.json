Explicitly we consider\nHiggs (neutrino)-portal FIDM in the single-field context, which injects energy\ninto the intergalactic medium via its annihilation (decay). With respect to\nLyman-alpha the baseline ionization history is inferred from low redshift data\nabout astrophysical reionization, whereas for 21-cm signal the baseline values\nof 21-cm power spectrum are obtained through a standard modeling of star\nformation developed. We use numerical tools to derive the FIDM induced\ndeviations from these baseline values in high redshift region. Our results show\nthat (i) current Lyman-alpha data has already constrained the neutrino portal\nFIDM mass to be less than 1.06 MeV, (ii) future Lyman-alpha data about the\nintergalactic medium temperature with a 10(100)% precision at z~9-15 is\nsufficient to exclude the Higgs (neutrino)-portal FIDM, and (iii) future SKA\nsensitivity (1000 hrs) on the 21-cm power spectrum for reference wavenumber\nk*=0.2h /Mpc at z~15-16 is also able to exclude the surviving neutrino-portal\nFIDM mass window.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
