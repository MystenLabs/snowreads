Despite this\npotential, the field of quantum machine learning is still in its early stages,\nand there persists a level of skepticism regarding a possible near-term quantum\nadvantage. This paper aims to provide a classical perspective on current\nquantum algorithms for supervised learning, effectively bridging traditional\nmachine learning principles with advancements in quantum machine learning.\nSpecifically, this study charts a research trajectory that diverges from the\npredominant focus of quantum machine learning literature, originating from the\nprerequisites of classical methodologies and elucidating the potential impact\nof quantum approaches. Through this exploration, our objective is to deepen the\nunderstanding of the convergence between classical and quantum methods, thereby\nlaying the groundwork for future advancements in both domains and fostering the\ninvolvement of classical practitioners in the field of quantum machine\nlearning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"we2FELIevVX3ZPgNLGCN4cvt5n78EPgYLWsymoMBuqM","pdfSize":"741090"}
