The first goal of this\nwork is to propose a new approach to accurately map in-situ data to a\nthree-dimensional (3D) geometry, aiming to reduce the amount of storage. The\nsecond goal of this work is to introduce several new IR features for defect\ndetection or process model calibration, which include laser scan order, local\npreheat temperature, maximum pre-laser scanning temperature, and number of\nspatters generated locally and their landing locations. For completeness,\nprocessing of other common IR features, such as interpass temperature, heat\nintensity, cooling rates, and melt pool area, are also presented with the\nunderlying algorithm and Python implementation. A number of different parts are\nprinted, monitored, and characterized to provide evidence of process defects\nand anomalies that different IR features are capable of detecting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LEorgM1RSr7WsZLUV2udFSaUZhMojIcyh6JcXHaDa4o","pdfSize":"1532021"}
