In contrast to the commonly implemented parametric forms of the\ndark energy equation-of-state (EoS), we test the validity of the cosmological\nconstant on the more fundamental scale factor [$a(t)$] which determines the\nexpansion rate of the Universe. We constrain our extended `general model' for\nthe expansion history using the late-time cosmological observables, namely\nBaryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Supernovae. As a primary inference, we\ncontrast the BAO compilations from the completed SDSS and the more recent DESI.\nWe find that the former deviates from the $\\Lambda$CDM scenario at a mild $\\sim\n2\\sigma$ level while the latter is completely consistent with the standard\npicture when the dark energy properties are inferred. We find that the\nposterior of the dark energy EoS is mainly constrained to be quintessence-like,\nhowever, we demonstrate the rich phenomenology of dark energy behaviour that\ncan be obtained in our general model wrt to the $\\Lambda$CDM.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KDH2txzatKOjYEqp4-OSLgJtJZQU7BPO8lDThY518sg","pdfSize":"2360880"}
