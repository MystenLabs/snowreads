We start by proving that if a Kenmotsu manifold (K-M) obeys an\nalmost $*-$R-B-S, then the manifold is $\\eta$-Einstein. Furthermore, we\nestablish that if a $(\\kappa, -2)'$-nullity distribution, where $\\kappa<-1$,\nhas an almost $*$-Ricci-Bourguignon soliton (almost $*-$R-B-S), then the\nmanifold is Ricci flat. Moreover, we establish that if a K-M has almost\n$*$-Ricci-Bourguignon soliton gradient and the vector field $\\xi$ preserves the\nscalar curvature $r$, then the manifold is an Einstein manifold with a constant\nscalar curvature given by $r=-n(2n-1)$. Finaly, we have given en example of a\nalmost $*-$R-B-S gradient on the Kenmotsu manifold.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
