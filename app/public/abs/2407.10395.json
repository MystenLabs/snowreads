All of them are\nnecessary for the existence of the corresponding $R$-matrix. At the special\nimaginary value of the staggered field, the $R$-matrix is obtained explicitly.\nIt is shown that the corresponding Hamiltonian has purely imaginary spectrum.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
