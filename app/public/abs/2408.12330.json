In the\ntwo-dimensional dS spacetime, the pole-skipping points near the cosmic horizon\n$r=L$ for the scalar field of spin-0 and the fermionic field of\nspin-$\\frac{1}{2}$ correspond one-to-one with those in the infinite temperature\nlimit of double-scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model (DSSYK$_\\infty$). The retarded\nGreen's functions of these two systems also have similar forms at the\npole-skipping positions. This provides a numerical correspondence between the\nstatic patch of dS$_2$ spacetime and the DSSYK$_\\infty$ model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
