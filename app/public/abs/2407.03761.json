These invariants serve as a\ntwo-dimensional analogue and satisfy a similar piecewise polynomial structure.\nMore precisely, they introduced the enumeration of curves in Hirzebruch\nsurfaces satisfying point conditions and tangency conditions on the two\nparallel toric boundaries. These conditions are stored in four partitions and\nthe resulting invariants are piecewise polynomial in their entries. Moreover,\nthey found that these expressions also behave polynomially with respect to the\nparameter determining the underlying Hirzebruch surfaces. Based on work of\nArdila and Block, they proposed that such a polynomiality could also hold while\nchanging between more general toric surfaces corresponding to $h$-transverse\npolygons. In this work, we answer this question affirmatively. Moreover, we\nexpress the resulting invariants for $h$-transverse polygons as matrix elements\nin the two-dimensional bosonic Fock space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
