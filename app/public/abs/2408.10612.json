We have\nanalyzed the asymptotic properties of the one-sample OVL-2 test statistic and\nenabled the calculation of asymptotic p-values for the test statistic. We\nfurther conducted numerical experiments and demonstrated that the one-sample\nOVL-2 test can sometimes exceed the detection power of conventional\ngoodness-of-fit tests.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
