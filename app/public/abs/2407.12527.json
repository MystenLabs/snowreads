The ray\neffect stands as a long-standing drawback of DOM. In benchmark tests displaying\nthe ray effect, we observe low regularity in velocity within the solution. To\naddress this issue, we propose a random ordinate method (ROM) to mitigate the\nray effect. Compared with other strategies proposed in the literature for\nmitigating the ray effect, ROM offers several advantages: 1) the computational\ncost is comparable to DOM; 2) it is simple and requires minimal changes to\nexisting code based on DOM; 3) it is easily parallelizable and independent of\nthe problem setup. Analytical results are presented for the convergence orders\nof the error and bias, and numerical tests demonstrate its effectiveness in\nmitigating the ray effect.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
