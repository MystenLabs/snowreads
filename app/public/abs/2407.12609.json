State of the art methods increasingly rely on deep\nlearning models, known to incorrectly estimate uncertainty and being\noverconfident in predictions, especially in data not seen during training. This\nis particularly problematic in semantic segmentation due to inherent class\nimbalance. Popular uncertainty quantification approaches are task-agnostic and\nfail to leverage spatial pixel correlations in uncertainty estimates, crucial\nin this task. In this work, a novel training methodology specifically designed\nfor semantic segmentation is presented. Training samples are weighted by\ninstance-wise uncertainty masks computed by an ensemble. This is shown to\nincrease performance on minority classes, boost model generalization and\nrobustness to domain-shift when compared to using the inverse of class\nproportions or no class weights at all. This method addresses the challenges of\nclass imbalance and uncertainty estimation in semantic segmentation,\npotentially enhancing model performance and reliability across various\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MDtfcnDJwWTKfCrMjO40uArUWiMauIkN-8KXEPklL2E","pdfSize":"747214"}
