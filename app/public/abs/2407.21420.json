Whitney introduced in 1934 the problem of extending a function on a set of\npoints in $\\mathbb{R}^n$ to an analytic function on the ambient space. In this\narticle we prove Whitney type extension theorems for data on some homogeneous\nspaces. We use harmonic analysis on the homogeneous spaces and representation\ntheory of compact as well as noncompact reductive groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
