The aim\nis to identify the unique best arm across environmental change given a fixed\ntotal budget. While this setting can be regarded as a special case of\nAdversarial Bandits or Corrupted Bandits, we demonstrate that existing\nsolutions tailored to those settings do not fully utilise the nature of this\nglobal influence, and thus, do not work well in practice (despite their\ntheoretical guarantees). To overcome this issue, in this paper we develop a\nnovel selection policy that is consistent and robust in dealing with global\nenvironmental shifts. We then propose an allocation policy, LinLUCB, which\nexploits information about global shifts across all arms in each environment.\nEmpirical tests depict a significant improvement in our policies against other\nexisting methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xXuC9lOmXxQYLbVfskci6tz-eC51NqsCZ3inmhQJ654","pdfSize":"1844564"}
