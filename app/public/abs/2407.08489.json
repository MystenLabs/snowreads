The point-axis representation decouples location\nand rotation, addressing the loss discontinuity issues commonly encountered in\ntraditional bounding box-based approaches. For effective optimization without\nintroducing additional annotations, we propose the max-projection loss to\nsupervise point set learning and the cross-axis loss for robust axis\nrepresentation learning. Further, leveraging this representation, we present\nthe Oriented DETR model, seamlessly integrating the DETR framework for precise\npoint-axis prediction and end-to-end detection. Experimental results\ndemonstrate significant performance improvements in oriented object detection\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
