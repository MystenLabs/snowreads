Prominent examples of such dynamic wireless environments include\nfactory floors or offices, where the geometry of the environment undergoes\nchanges over time. These changes affect the distribution of wireless\nfingerprints, demonstrating some similarity between the distributions before\nand after the change. Consequently, the performance of a location estimator\ninitially designed for a specific environment may degrade significantly when\napplied after changes have occurred in that environment. To address this\nlimitation, we propose a domain adaptation framework that utilizes neural\nnetworks to align the distributions of wireless fingerprints collected both\nbefore and after environmental changes. By aligning these distributions, we\ndesign an estimator capable of predicting UE locations from their wireless\nfingerprints in the new environment. Experiments validate the effectiveness of\nthe proposed methods in localizing UEs in dynamic wireless environments.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
