The information radiation field (IRF) is\nproposed and defined to characterize the scattered light carrying complete\ninformation about the center-of-mass (c.m.) motion of the particle. Based on\nthe IRF, we suggest an optimal detection scheme for the position of arbitrary\nparticles. We calculate both the information losses of objective collection and\nmode-matching in levitated optomechanical experiments. Our results conclude\nthat the backward detection scheme, using an incident Gaussian beam focused by\na high numerical aperture lens, provides sufficient information to achieve the\nquantum ground state through cooling of the three-dimensional c.m. motion of\nthe Mie particle.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DybrNvcL7ljp-RHLj5411TGfxaqsthQAoa1cIxcI-u0","pdfSize":"15510390"}
