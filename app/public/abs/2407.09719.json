Material selection is usually carried out after\nseveral cycles of conceptual design, during which designers iteratively refine\nthe design solution and the intended manufacturing approach. In design\nresearch, material selection is typically treated as an optimization problem\nwith a single correct answer. Moreover, it is also often restricted to specific\ntypes of objects or design functions, which can make the selection process\ncomputationally expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we introduce\nMSEval, a novel dataset which is comprised of expert material evaluations\nacross a variety of design briefs and criteria. This data is designed to serve\nas a benchmark to facilitate the evaluation and modification of machine\nlearning models in the context of material selection for conceptual design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
