We find that the peak of a second power law\ncharacterizes the $\\sim 30-35~ M_\\odot$ bump, such that the data marginally\nprefers a mixture of two power laws for the mass distribution of binary\ncomponents over a Powerlaw + Peak model with a Bayes Factor\n$\\log_{10}\\mathcal{B}$ of 0.1. This result may imply that the $\\sim 30-35~\nM_\\odot$ feature represents the onset of a second population of BBH mergers\n(e.g. from a dynamical formation channel) rather than a specific mass feature\nover a broader distribution. When an additional Gaussian bump is allowed within\nour power law mixture model, we find a new feature in the BH mass spectrum at\n$\\sim65-70~M_\\odot$. This new feature may be consistent with hierarchical\nmergers, and constitute $\\sim2\\%$ of the BBH population. This model also\nrecovers a maximum mass of $58^{+30}_{-14}~M_\\odot$ for the second power law,\nconsistent with the onset of a pair-instability supernova mass gap.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
