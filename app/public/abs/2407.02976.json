Unfortunately, experimental constraints do not always\nallow optimising the characterisation conditions. This dictates the need for\nrefined analysis methods. Here we show that neutral networks can provide a\nviable characterisation when applied to data from SPIDER. We have adopted a\ncascade of convolutional networks, addressing the multiparameter structure of\nthe interferogram with a reasonable computing power. In particular, the\nnecessity of precalibration is reduced, thus pointing towards the introduction\nof neural networks in more generic arrangements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
