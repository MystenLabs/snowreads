When describing the\npump from a moving reference frame, transported and existing charges transform,\nthough not independently. This transformation is inherent to Galilean space and\ntime, but it is underpinned by a transformation of vector bundles. Different\nformalisms can be used to describe this transformation, including one based on\nBloch theory. Depending on the chosen formalism, the two types of charges will\nbe realized as indices of either the same or different kinds. Finally, we apply\nthe bulk-edge correspondence principle, so as to implement the transformation\nlaw within B\\\"uttiker's scattering theory of quantum pumps.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
