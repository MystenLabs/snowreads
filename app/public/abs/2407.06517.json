Besides cooling\nand trapping advancements, few effective methods exist to mitigate this error.\nIn the present work, we introduce an error-erasing strategy that utilizes a\npair of off-resonant fields to continuously dress the protected Rydberg state\nwith an auxiliary state, which induces an opposite but enhanced sensitivity to\nthe same source of Doppler dephasing error. Combining with an optimal control\nof laser pulses, we realize a family of Rydberg two-qubit controlled-NOT gates\nin Rb and Cs atoms that are fully robust to the Doppler dephasing error. We\nbenchmark this gate operation with fidelity $F\\approx0.9906$ at ${\\it any}$\ntemperature for a lower-excited auxiliary state, and a higher fidelity of\n$F\\approx0.9965$ can be attained for a ground-state auxiliary state at a\ntemperature of 50 $\\mu$K. Our results significantly reduce atomic temperature\nrequirements for high-fidelity quantum gates, and may provide fundamental\nguidance to practical error-tolerant quantum computing with neutral atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
