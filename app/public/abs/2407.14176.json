We also characterize their\nboundedness and local boundedness. We focus on composition operators acting to\nor from the space $bv_p(E)$ of all sequences of $p$-bounded variation; here\n$p\\geq 1$ and $E$ is a normed space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"LvQsL59rXOmYIIaJHmUfFF9DHQ5OPGL7IMHgJNHcme4","pdfSize":"349649","objectId":"0x9dc423f8ad1b42a4cdcf00993f63318a3ba80758a3e917836418f49724468241","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
