It consisted of two spherical\nmirrors, which acted as independent pendulumsindividually suspended by strings.\nTwo identical field masses weremoved along the axis of the resonator\nsymmetrically and periodically betweena near and a far position. Their\ngravitational interaction altered the distance between the mirrors, changing\nthe resonance frequency, which was measured and found consistent with Newton's\nlaw of gravity.\n  The acceleration of a single mirror caused by the two field masses at the\nclosest position varied from $5.4 \\cdot 10^{-12} m/s^2$ to $259 \\cdot 10^{-12}\\\nm/s^2$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
