Fewer studies have looked\nat the how these reductions at ground level translate into variations in the\nwhole atmosphere. In this study, we examine the columnar values of aerosols at\n51 mainland European stations of the Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). We show\nthat when considered in the context of the long-term trend over the last\ndecade, the columnar aerosol levels for 2020, at the regional level, do not\nappear exceptional. Both the yearly means and the number of episodes with\nextreme values for this period are within the one standard deviation of the\nlong-term trends. We conclude that the spatially and temporally very localized\nreductions do not add up to statistically significant reductions in the global\nlevels of aerosols. Furthermore, considering that pandemic lockdowns can be\nthought of as a simulation of a climate change mitigation scenario, we conclude\nthat such lifestyle-based changes present a very low potential as a global\nclimate change mitigation strategy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Wlj1awPbsuBO-hd0_NxsQtBFCZ0HdF3d8FbMv0p14pI","pdfSize":"1130627"}
