It considers not only the pixel intensities of the images but also the\nspatial relationships between the pixels. In this project, we apply the mutual\ninformation formula to image matching, where image A is the moving object and\nimage B is the target object and calculate the mutual information between them\nto evaluate the similarity between the images. For comparison, we also used\nentropy and information-gain methods to test the dependency of the images. We\nalso investigated the effect of different environments on the mutual\ninformation of the same image and used experiments and plots to demonstrate.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
