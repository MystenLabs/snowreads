Then, we transform the resultant\nall-at-once linear system and introduce a novel one-sided preconditioner, which\ncan be fast implemented in a parallel-in-time way. By introducing an auxiliary\ntwo-sided preconditioned system, we provide theoretical insights into the\nrelationship between the residuals of the generalized minimal residual (GMRES)\nmethod when applied to both one-sided and two-sided preconditioned systems.\nMoreover, we show that the condition number of the two-sided preconditioned\nmatrix is uniformly bounded by a constant that is independent of the matrix\nsize, which in turn implies that the convergence behavior of the GMRES method\nfor the one-sided preconditioned system is guaranteed. Numerical experiments\nconfirm the efficiency and robustness of the proposed preconditioning approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
