We\nalso review the results about uniqueness of enhancements of triangulated\ncategories, with the aim of showing the fruitful interplay. In particular, we\nshow how this leads to a vast generalization of a result by Rickard about\nderived invariance for schemes and rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
