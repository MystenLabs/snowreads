The rotational symmetry allows\na circularly polarized pump to be converted into a circularly polarized\nnonlinear signal. Meanwhile, our bilayered metasurface can be engineered to\nrespond solely to one selected circular polarization. Consequently, integrating\nresonant chiral response and rotational symmetry endows a unique category of\nmetasurfaces to upconvert any linear or unpolarized pump into a circularly\npolarized nonlinear signal. Our results reveal that when such a metasurface is\nsubjected to a linearly polarized pump, the intensity ratio of the resultant\ncircularly polarized signals varies with the order of the nonlinear process.\nCounterintuitively, this ratio scales as the fourth power of the local field\nenhancement in the second harmonic process and the second power in the third\nharmonic process. Our work offers a comprehensive theoretical description of\nthe nonlinear processes in chiral structures with rotation and provides\nuniversal guidelines for designing nonlinear all-dielectric metasurfaces with a\nstrong chiral response.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
