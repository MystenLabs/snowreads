This paper\nintroduces a novel embedded system designed to autonomously label sensor data\ndirectly on IoT devices, thereby enhancing the efficiency of data collection\nmethods. We present an integrated hardware and software solution equipped with\nspecialized labeling sensors that streamline the capture and labeling of\ndiverse types of sensor data. By implementing local processing with lightweight\nlabeling methods, our system minimizes the need for extensive data transmission\nand reduces dependence on external resources. Experimental validation with\ncollected data and a Convolutional Neural Network model achieved a high\nclassification accuracy of up to 91.67%, as confirmed through 4-fold\ncross-validation. These results demonstrate the system's robust capability to\ncollect audio and vibration data with correct labels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
