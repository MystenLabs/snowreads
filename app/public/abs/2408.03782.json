The study highlights the critical role of demagnetizing fields and\nexchange energy in determining the FMR responses of 3D nanosystems, especially\nthe strongly asymmetric distribution of the spin-wave mode over the system\nheight. Importantly, the top-bottom dynamic switching of the surface mode\nlocalization across the structures in response to changes in magnetic field\norientation provides a new method for controlling magnetization dynamics. The\nresults demonstrate the critical role of the geometric features in dictating\nthe dynamic magnetic behavior of three-dimensional nanostructures, paving the\nway for both experimental exploration and practical advances in 3D magnonics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
