The technique consists of a coherent beam that is\nscanned across an object in a series of overlapping positions, leading to\nreliable and improved reconstructions. Ptychographic microscopes allow for\nlarge fields to be imaged at high resolution at additional computational\nexpense. In this work, we explore the use of the fast Partial Fourier\nTransforms (PFTs), which efficiently compute Fourier coefficients corresponding\nto low frequencies. The core idea is to use the PFT in a plug-and-play manner\nto warm-start existing ptychography algorithms such as the ptychographic\niterative engine (PIE). This approach reduces the computational budget required\nto solve the ptychography problem. Our numerical results show that our scheme\naccelerates the convergence of traditional solvers without sacrificing quality\nof reconstruction.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
