We use Banach's fixed point theorem and the a\npriori energy estimates uniformly in time to get the global existence of\nsolutions around the steady state. Compared with the deterministic case, due to\nthe stochastic forces, the momentum does not have the temporal derivative,\nwhich causes troubles to the energy estimates. We establish the asymptotic\nstability about the spatial derivatives by the weighted energy estimates for\nthe estimates of stochastic integrals, employing a technique distinct from the\ndeterministic case. The existence of invariant measure generated by the\nsolutions to the evolving semiconductor equations is shown from the a priori\nenergy estimates. Furthermore, the invariant measure is exactly the Dirac\nmeasure generated by the steady state, in which the exponential decay of\nperturbed solutions around the steady state plays an essential role.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
