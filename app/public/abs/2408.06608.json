Despite recent algorithmic advancements, achieving\nreal-time performance on today's resource-constrained devices remains\nchallenging. In this paper, we identify the primary bottlenecks in current NeRF\nalgorithms and introduce a unified algorithm-architecture co-design, Potamoi,\ndesigned to accommodate various NeRF algorithms. Specifically, we introduce a\nruntime system featuring a plug-and-play algorithm, SpaRW, which significantly\nreduces the per-frame computational workload and alleviates compute\ninefficiencies. Furthermore, our unified streaming pipeline coupled with\ncustomized hardware support effectively tames both SRAM and DRAM inefficiencies\nby minimizing repetitive DRAM access and completely eliminating SRAM bank\nconflicts. When evaluated against a baseline utilizing a dedicated DNN\naccelerator, our framework demonstrates a speed-up and energy reduction of\n53.1$\\times$ and 67.7$\\times$, respectively, all while maintaining high visual\nquality with less than a 1.0 dB reduction in peak signal-to-noise ratio.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
