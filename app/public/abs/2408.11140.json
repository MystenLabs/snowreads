However, the extensive navigation and cognitive\noverhead required of users of grid displays can negatively impact users'\nability to actively participate in social interactions, which is an important\nfactor of their language development. We present a novel interaction technique\nfor grid displays, Predictive Anchoring, based on user interaction theory and\nlanguage development theory. Our design is informed by existing literature in\nAAC research, presented in the form of a set of design goals and a preliminary\ndesign sketch. Future work in user studies and interaction design are also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
