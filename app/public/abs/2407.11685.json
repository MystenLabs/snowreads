In general convolution with a box is\nnot invertible. However, we can obtain perfect reconstructions of sparse\nsignals using convex optimization. We give a direct proof that improves on the\nreconstruction bound that follows from previous results. We also show our bound\nis tight and matches an information theoretic limit.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dgwrXydk5rygmYOFwnf479LqWZFRJW4JsNEGXelbsYg","pdfSize":"334273"}
