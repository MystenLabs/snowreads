We show how the\nasymptotic symmetries of the AdS$_3$ spacetime, which generate the boundary\n(super) Virasoro currents, are captured by the one-loop partition sum. We use\nthis to argue that the recent understanding of near-extremal black hole\nthermodynamics based on the gravitational path integral continues to hold for\nfinite string length. Along the way we clarify some aspects of the\nAdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ duality and, in particular, deduce which bulk gauge fields lead\nto boundary currents. We also explain how one can interpolate between\nsupersymmetric and thermal (Atick-Witten) fermion boundary conditions in the\ntarget space by suitably tuning rotational chemical potentials in the string\npartition function.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kh6ixxXT5qKeZKPjXt3Ov1oXsUWv2HMeJTgjW2-J054","pdfSize":"1097164"}
