Nonetheless, extended operational periods cause a decline in\ntheir absolute positioning accuracy, preventing them from meeting high\nprecision. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel robot algorithm\nthat combines an adaptive and momental bound algorithm with decoupled weight\ndecay (AdaModW), which has three-fold ideas: a) adopting an adaptive moment\nestimation (Adam) algorithm to achieve a high convergence rate, b) introducing\na hyperparameter into the Adam algorithm to define the length of memory,\neffectively addressing the issue of the abnormal learning rate, and c)\ninterpolating a weight decay coefficient to improve its generalization.\nNumerous experiments on an HRS-JR680 industrial robot show that the presented\nalgorithm significantly outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms in robot\ncalibration performance. Thus, in light of its reliability, this algorithm\nprovides an efficient way to address robot calibration concerns.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
