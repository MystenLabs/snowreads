All reviews were collected from Tripadvisor, covering a diverse\nselection of restaurants, including regional and international cuisine with\nvarious culinary styles. The annotations encompass both implicit and explicit\naspects, including all aspect terms, their corresponding aspect categories, and\nthe sentiments expressed towards them. Furthermore, we provide baseline scores\nfor the four ABSA tasks Aspect Category Detection, Aspect Category Sentiment\nAnalysis, End-to-End ABSA and Target Aspect Sentiment Detection as a reference\npoint for future advances. The dataset fills a gap in German language resources\nand facilitates exploration of ABSA in the restaurant domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
