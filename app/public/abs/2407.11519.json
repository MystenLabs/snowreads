It is also known\nthat prototype $W$ state is not useful for standard teleportation. Agrawal and\nPati\\cite{pati2006} have successfully executed perfect (standard) teleportation\nwith non-prototype $W$ state. Aligned with Pati's protocol\\cite{pati2006} we\nhave considered here $Star$ type tripartite states and have shown that perfect\nteleportation is suitable with such states. Moreover, we have taken the linear\nsuperposition of non-prototype $W$ state and its spin-flipped version and shown\nthat it belongs to $Star$ class. Also, standard teleportation is possible with\nthese states. It is observed that genuine tripartite entanglement is not\nnecessary requirement for a state to be used as a channel for successful\nstandard teleportation. We have also shown that these $Star$ class states are\n$P_{max}=\\frac{1}{4}$ states and their Groverian entanglement is\n$\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}$, thus concluding that Jung conjecture is not a necessary\ncondition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
