Sharp lower and upper bounds are proved for\nthe outer and the dual general position number of strong products and several\nexact values are obtained. For the lexicographic product, the outer general\nposition number is determined in all the cases, and the dual general position\nnumber in many cases. The total general position number is determined for both\nproducts. Along the way some results on outer general position sets are also\nderived.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"K_9SVRai0t74SLh4YJm5y_7KFUBo0ex5VjQ2Av1I_Rk","pdfSize":"193525"}
