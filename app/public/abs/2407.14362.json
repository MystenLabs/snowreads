The very low-mass stars (VLMS) are known\nto have a high occurrence rate of the terrestrial planets around them.\nExploring the chemical composition of the gas in these inner regions of the\ndisks can aid a better understanding of the connection between planet-forming\ndisks and planets. The MIRI mid-Infrared Disk Survey (MINDS) project is a large\nJWST Guaranteed Time program to characterize the chemistry and physical state\nof planet-forming and debris disks. We use the JWST-MIRI/MRS spectrum to\ninvestigate the gas and dust composition of the planet-forming disk around the\nvery low-mass star Sz28 (M5.5, 0.12\\,M$_{\\odot}$). We use the dust-fitting tool\n(DuCK) to determine the dust continuum and to get constraints on the dust\ncomposition and grain sizes. We use 0D slab models to identify and fit the\nmolecular spectral features, yielding estimates on the temperature, column\ndensity and the emitting area. To test our understanding of the chemistry in\nthe disks around VLMS, we employ the thermo-chemical disk model {P{\\tiny\nRO}D{\\tiny I}M{\\tiny O}} and investigate the reservoirs of the detected\nhydrocarbons. We explore how the C/O ratio affects the inner disk chemistry.\nJWST reveals a plethora of hydrocarbons, including \\ce{CH3}, \\ce{CH4},\n\\ce{C2H2}, \\ce{^{13}CCH2}, \\ce{C2H6}, \\ce{C3H4}, \\ce{C4H2} and \\ce{C6H6}\nsuggesting a disk with a gaseous C/O\\,>\\,1. Additionally, we detect \\ce{CO2},\n\\ce{^{13}CO2}, \\ce{HCN}, and \\ce{HC3N}. \\ce{H2O} and OH are absent in the\nspectrum. We do not detect PAHs. Photospheric stellar absorption lines of\n\\ce{H2O} and \\ce{CO} are identified. Notably, our radiation thermo-chemical\ndisk models are able to produce these detected hydrocarbons in the surface\nlayers of the disk when the ...\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rHUoEnuqfhNocXcYrcl4RVrTEYg1WQWk7Uk5j6ASwqk","pdfSize":"8209398"}
