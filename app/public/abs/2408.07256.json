It is an open question in the literature under which\nconditions such a minimization problem admits a local nonglobal minimizer,\n\\lngmp. We prove that all second order stationary points are global minimizers\nwhenever $n \\leq d + 1$. For $n > d+1$, we numerically find a local nonglobal\nminimum and show analytically that there indeed exists a nearby \\lngm for the\nunderlying quartic minimization problem. Thus, we answer in the affirmative the\npreviously open question about their existence. Our approach to finding the\n\\lngm is novel in that we first exploit the translation and rotation invariance\nto reduce the size of the problem from $nd$ variables in $P$ to $(n-1)d -\nd(d-1)/2 = d(2n-d-1)/2$ variables. This allows for finding examples that\nsatisfy the strict second order sufficient optimality conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
