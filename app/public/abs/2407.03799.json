To answer this\nquestion, we first formulate the survivable and performant LSN design (SPLD)\nproblem, which aims to find the minimum number of needed satellites to\nconstruct an LSN that can provide sufficient amount of redundant paths,\nrequired link capacity and acceptable latency for traffic carried by the LSN.\nSecond, to efficiently solve the tricky SPLD problem, we propose MEGAREDUCE, a\nrequirement-driven constellation optimization mechanism, which can calculate\nfeasible solutions for SPLD in polynomial time. Finally, we conduct extensive\ntrace-driven simulations to verify MEGAREDUCE's cost-effectiveness in\nconstructing survivable and performant LSNs on demand, and showcase how\nMEGAREDUCE can help optimize the incremental deployment and long-term\nmaintenance of future satellite Internet.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
