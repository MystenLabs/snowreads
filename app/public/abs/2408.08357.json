This model exhibits additional phases, as well as two different\ntemperature scales related by a factor $N\\!/\\!\\ln N$. The paramagnetic phase\nsplits into a \"dense\" and a \"dilute\" phase, separated by a third-order\ntransition and leading to a triple critical point in the scale parameter\n$n/N^2$ and the temperature, while the ferromagnetic phase exhibits additional\nstructure, and a new paramagnetic-ferromagnetic metastable phase appears at the\nlarger temperature scale. These phases can coexist, becoming stable or\nmetastable as temperature varies. A generalized model in which the number of\n$SU(N)$-equivalent states enters the partition function with a nontrivial\nweight, relevant, e.g., when there is gauge invariance in the system, is also\nstudied and shown to manifest similar phases, with the dense-dilute phase\ntransition becoming second-order in the fully gauge invariant case.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
