However, they require additional\noperations, such as erasure checks, that may add extra noise and increase\nruntime of QEC protocols. To assess the benefits provided by erasure qubits, we\nfocus on the performance of the surface code as a quantum memory. In\nparticular, we analyze various erasure check schedules, find the correctable\nregions in the phase space of error parameters and probe the subthreshold\nscaling of the logical error rate. We then consider a realization of erasure\nqubits in the superconducting hardware architectures via dual-rail qubits. We\nuse the standard transmon-based implementation of the surface code as the\nperformance benchmark. Our results indicate that QEC protocols with erasure\nqubits can outperform the ones with state-of-the-art transmons, even in the\nabsence of precise information about the locations of erasure errors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
