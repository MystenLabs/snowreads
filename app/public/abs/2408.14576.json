Tutorials are typically designed for a single audience, but our\nstudy aims to uncover how they function in contexts where learners have diverse\nbackgrounds. With the rise of interdisciplinary learning, the importance of\nlearning materials that accommodate diverse learner needs has become evident.\nWe chose bioinformatics as our context because it involves at least two\ndistinct user groups: those with computational backgrounds and those with\nbiological backgrounds. The goal of our research is to better understand\ncurrent bioinformatics software tutorial designs and assess them in the\nconceptual framework of interdisciplinarity. We conducted a content analysis of\n22 representative bioinformatics software tutorials to identify design patterns\nand understand their strengths and limitations. We found common codes in the\nrepresentative tutorials and synthesized them into ten themes. Our assessment\nshows degrees to which current bioinformatics software tutorials fulfill\ninterdisciplinarity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
