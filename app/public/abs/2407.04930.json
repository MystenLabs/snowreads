Inspired by thermodynamics, we develop a self-adaptive\nnetwork utilizing only macroscopic information to achieve desired landscape\nthrough reconfiguring itself in unknown environments. By continuously\nestimating environment entropy, our designed self-adaptive network can\nadaptively realize desired landscape represented by topological measures. The\nadaptability of this network is achieved under several scenarios, including\nconfinement on phase space and geographic constraint. The adaptation process is\ndescribed by relative entropy corresponding to the Boltzmann H function, which\ndecreases with time following unique power law distinguishing our self-adaptive\nnetwork from memoryless systems. Moreover, we demonstrate the transformability\nof our self-adaptive network, as a critical mechanism of complex system\nresilience, allowing for transitions from one target landscape to another.\nCompared to data-driven methods, our self-adaptive network is understandable\nwithout careful choice of learning architecture and parameters. Our designed\nself-adaptive network could help to understand system intelligence through the\nlens of thermodynamics.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
