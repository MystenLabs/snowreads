While such scenarios are forbidden in general\nrelativity!(GR), alternative theories (such as certain quantum gravity\nscenarios obeying the weak gravity conjecture, white holes, and Hawking\nradiation) may allow them. By leveraging the phenomenology of black hole\nemission and absorption signals, we introduce straightforward modifications to\nexisting gravitational waveform models to mimic gravitational radiation\nassociated with these exotic events. We anticipate that these (incomplete but)\ninitial simulations, coupled with the adjusted waveform models, will aid in the\ndevelopment of null tests for GR using GWs.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
