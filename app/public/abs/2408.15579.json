If\n$h_X$ is a distance in $X$ (respectively, a pseudo metric in $X$), then the\npair $(X,h_X)$ is called a distance (respectively, a pseudo metric) space. If\n$(T,h_T)$ and $(X,h_X)$ are pseudo metric spaces, $(Y,h_Y)$ is a distance\nspace, and $H(T,X)$ is a class of Lipschitz mappings $f\\colon T\\to X$, for a\nbroad family of mappings $\\Lambda\\colon H (T,X)\\to Y$, we obtain a sharp\ninequality that estimates the deviation $h_Y(\\Lambda f(\\cdot),\\Lambda f(t))$ in\nterms of the function $h_T(\\cdot, t)$. We also show that many known estimates\nof such kind are contained in our general result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
