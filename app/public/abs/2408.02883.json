In this study, we investigate how BeReal, a social media\nplatform designed to counter some of these pressures, influences adolescents'\nself-presentation behaviors. We interviewed 29 users aged 13-18 to understand\ntheir experiences with BeReal. We found that BeReal's design focuses on\nspontaneous sharing, including randomly timed daily notifications and\nreciprocal posting, discourages staged posts, encourages careful curation of\nthe audience, and reduces pressure on self-presentation. The space created by\nBeReal offers benefits such as validating an unfiltered life and reframing\nsocial comparison, but its approach to self-presentation is sometimes perceived\nas limited or unappealing and, at times, even toxic. Drawing on this empirical\ndata, we propose design guidelines for platforms that support authentic\nself-presentation while fostering reciprocity and expanding beyond spontaneous\nphoto-sharing. These guidelines aim to enable users to portray themselves more\ncomprehensively and accurately, ultimately supporting teens' developmental\nneeds, particularly in building authentic relationships.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"St0kr-YymV5hpRBpQc6wh2mMYDl3D4zl4VzlZbO3ih4","pdfSize":"2190811"}
