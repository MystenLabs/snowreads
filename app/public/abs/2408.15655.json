Relative survival analysis\naddresses this scenario, outside of standard (competing risks) survival\nanalysis, to nevertheless estimate survival with respect to a specific cause.\nIt separates the impact of the disease itself on mortality from other factors,\nsuch as age, sex, and general population trends. Different methods were created\nwith the aim to construct consistent and efficient estimators for this purpose.\nThe R package relsurv is the most commonly used today in application. With\nJulia continuously proving itself to be an efficient and powerful programming\nlanguage, we felt the need to code a pure Julia take, thus NetSurvival.jl, of\nthe standard routines and estimators in the field. The proposed implementation\nis clean, future-proof, well tested, and the package is correctly documented\ninside the rising JuliaSurv GitHub organization, ensuring trustability of the\nresults. Through a comprehensive comparison in terms of performance and\ninterface to relsurv, we highlight the benefits of the Julia developing\nenvironment.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g0nmGvnrhZhY7yAAh6oeQUVm2RQTbMSdmh7l4s_V2X0","pdfSize":"1069825"}
