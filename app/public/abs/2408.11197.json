The Newton-Raphson flow tracking controller is a\nrecently proposed integrator-type controller that aims to drive to zero the\nerror between a future predicted system output and the reference trajectory.\nThis controller is computationally lightweight, requiring only an imprecise\npredictor, and achieves guaranteed asymptotic error bounds under certain\nconditions. We show that these theoretical advantages are realizable on a\nquadrotor hardware platform. Our experiments are conducted on a Holybrox x500v2\nquadrotor using a Pixhawk 6x flight controller and a Rasbperry Pi 4 companion\ncomputer which receives location information from an OptiTrack motion capture\nsystem and sends input commands through the ROS2 API for the PX4 software\nstack.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"b5JQ6EvbTSSW7owSVnHAuajN57ZVjhNaaCxljJG9Tes","pdfSize":"1539112"}
