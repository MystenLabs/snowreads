In this letter, an effort to\nunravel the underlying charge transport mechanism in these SCO complexes, via a\ngeneral theory, is made. The theory presented herein is aimed at providing a\nunifying picture that explains the widely different trends observed in the\nspin-crossover-dependent carrier transport properties in the SCO molecular thin\nfilm systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
