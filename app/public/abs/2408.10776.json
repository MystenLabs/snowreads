Our approach combines the Heisenberg picture\ninput-output formalism with the Ikeda mapping from classical nonlinear optics.\nIn doing so, we address the high-gain regime by incorporating non-perturbative\neffects, including self-phase modulation, cross-phase modulation, and\ntime-ordering, which are roots for significantly different behaviors in the\nlow-gain regime. We also account for optical losses by introducing an auxiliary\nwaveguide, allowing for a more accurate representation of experimentally viable\nscenarios. Numerical simulations reveal that non-perturbative effects\nsignificantly distort transfer functions, making desirable operations\nchallenging without careful optimization. We show that appropriate detuning of\nthe pump frequency can mitigate these issues, leading to enhanced brightness\nand higher spectral purity in the high-gain regime. We further investigate the\nperformance of a single ring resonator as a two-mode squeezer by analyzing\nvarious performance metrics under experimentally relevant optical loss\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
