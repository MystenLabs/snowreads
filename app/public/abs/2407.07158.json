In this work, we develop\na method useful in reducing the number of complex phases in scenarios with one\nand two VLQs. We show that these VLQ-models can be described with just one or\ntwo physical complex phases respectively and present an explicit alternative\nparametrization for the quark mixing matrix. Making use of this Reduction of\nComplex Phases in the case of the Bento-Branco-Parada (BBP) model, i.e. the\nsimplest implementation of the Nelson-Barr solution to the strong CP problem,\none also recovers the single phase formulation of BBP model. We comment on how\nthis specific scenario can be distinguished from the general VLQ case with\nweak-basis invariants\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
