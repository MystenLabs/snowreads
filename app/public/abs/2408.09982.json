Through meticulously designed prompt\nengineering, we guided ChatGLM to generate a series of simulated questions and\nconducted a comprehensive comparison with questions recollected from past\nexaminees. To ensure the objectivity and professionalism of the evaluation, we\ninvited experts in the field of education to assess these questions and their\nscoring criteria. The research results indicate that the questions generated by\nChatGLM exhibit a high level of rationality, scientificity, and practicality\nsimilar to those of the real exam questions across most evaluation criteria,\ndemonstrating the model's accuracy and reliability in question generation.\nNevertheless, the study also reveals limitations in the model's consideration\nof various rating criteria when generating questions, suggesting the need for\nfurther optimization and adjustment. This research not only validates the\napplication potential of ChatGLM in the field of educational assessment but\nalso provides crucial empirical support for the development of more efficient\nand intelligent educational automated generation systems in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
