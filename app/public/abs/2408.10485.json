In this work, we utilize a\nmetasurface to generate polarization-hologram hybrid entanglement between a\nsignal-idler photon pair to construct a quantum hologram. The properties of the\nquantum hologram can be revealed by collapsing the polarization degree of\nfreedom of the idler photon, inducing interference between two holographic\nstates of the signal photon, as a meaningful and selective erasure of the\nholographic content. In contrary, interference disappears when the idler photon\nis detected without observing polarization. This process can be further\ninterpreted as a quantum holographic eraser, where the erasing action is\nvisualized with erased contents in holograms. Our construction of\npolarization-hologram hybrid entangled state with metasurfaces will be useful\nfor quantum communication with enhanced robustness, anti-counterfeiting\napplications through the additional quantum degrees of freedom, and as an\nemerging platform for exploring fundamental quantum concepts for entanglement\nand non-locality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
