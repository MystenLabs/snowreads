Kyber) has been drafted to be standardized as the only\nkey encapsulation mechanism (KEM) scheme by the national institute of standards\nand technology (NIST) to withstand attacks by large-scale quantum computers.\nHowever, the side-channel attack (SCA) on its implementation is still needed to\nbe well considered for the upcoming migration. In this brief, we propose a\nsecure and efficient hardware implementation for Kyber by incorporating a novel\ncompact shuffling architecture. First of all, we modify the Fisher-Yates\nshuffle to make it more hardware-friendly. We then design an optimized\nshuffling architecture for the well-known open-source Kyber hardware\nimplementation to enhance the security of all the potential side-channel\nleakage points. Finally, we implement the modified Kyber design on FPGA and\nevaluate its security and performance. The security is verified by conducting\nthe correlation power analysis (CPA) attacks on the hardware. Meanwhile, FPGA\nplace-and-route results show that the proposed design reports only 8.7%\ndegradation on the hardware efficiency compared with the original unprotected\nversion, much better than existing hiding schemes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
