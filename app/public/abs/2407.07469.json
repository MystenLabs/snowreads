Among them, OpenAI's ChatGPT excels at natural language processing\ntasks and can also generate source code. However, the generated code often has\nproblems with consistency and program rules. Therefore, in this research, we\ndeveloped a system that tests the code generated by ChatGPT, automatically\ncorrects it if it is inappropriate, and presents the appropriate code to the\nuser. This study aims to address the challenge of reducing the manual effort\nrequired for the human feedback and modification process for generated code.\nWhen we ran the system, we were able to automatically modify the code as\nintended.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NORfgZCE8H9AdjSR65AYu636I0rYnDkw85FYyiENt-s","pdfSize":"443277"}
