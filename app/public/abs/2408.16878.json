We present a comprehensive\nanalysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph.\nOur main goal is to provide a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry\nof a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing\nhomogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be\nexplored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory. We found that the\naverage geometry at each node in the dipole graph does not match that of a flat\ntetrahedron. Instead, the expected values of the geometric observables satisfy\nrelations that are characteristic of spherical tetrahedra. The mean geometry is\naccompanied by fluctuations with considerable relative dispersion for the\ndihedral angle, and perfectly correlated for the two nodes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
