The ground states of $^{124}$Ag\nand $^{125}$Ag were found to be 30(250) keV and 250(430) keV less bound but 36\nand 110 times more precise than in the Atomic Mass Evaluation 2020,\nrespectively. The excitation energy of $^{124}$Ag$^{m}$, ${E_x = 188.2(25)}$\nkeV, was determined for the first time. The new precise mass values have been\nutilised to study the evolution of nuclear structure via two-neutron separation\nenergies. The impact on the astrophysical rapid neutron capture process has\nbeen investigated via neutron-capture reaction rate calculations. The precision\nmeasurements indicate a more linear trend in two-neutron separation energies\nand reduce the mass-related uncertainties for the neutron-capture rate of\n$^{124}$Ag$(n,\\gamma)^{125}$Ag by a factor of around 100. The new mass values\nalso improve the mass of $^{123}$Pd, previously measured using $^{124}$Ag as a\nreference.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
