Utilizing\ndatasets from IRAS, 2MASS, AllWISE, Gaia DR3, and the SIMBAD object database,\nwe perform an in-depth comparison between observational data and theoretical\nmodels. For this comparison, we present various color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs)\nin visual and IR bands, as well as IR two-color diagrams (2CDs). Our results\ndemonstrate that the CMDs, incorporating the latest distance and extinction\ndata from Gaia DR3 for a majority of sample stars, are effective in\ndistinguishing different classes of stars. To improve the precision of our\nanalysis, we apply theoretical radiative transfer models for dust shells around\nAGB and PAGB stars. A thorough comparison of the theoretical models with\nobservations across various IR 2CDs and CMDs shows a significant agreement. We\nfind that AGB and PAGB stars are among the brightest classes in visual and IR\nbands. Furthermore, most YSOs are clearly distinguishable from AGB stars on\nvarious IR CMDs, exhibiting fainter absolute magnitudes in IR bands.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
