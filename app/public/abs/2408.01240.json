In this paper, we present an\nalternative approach to tunable magnonic systems. We studied a magnonic crystal\ninduced within a uniform magnetic layer by a periodic magnetic field pattern\ncreated by the array of superconducting strips. We showed that the spin-wave\nspectrum can be tuned by the inhomogeneous stray field of the superconductor in\nresponse to a small uniform external magnetic field. Additionally, we\ndemonstrated that modifying the width of superconducting strips and separation\nbetween them leads to the changes in the internal field which are unprecedented\nin conventional magnonic structures. The paper presents the results of\nsemi-analytical calculations for realistic structures, which are verified by\nnumerical calculations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A4RYdtQxUJ2pUAeaLNqlEHBOV_KLxvQziODYOGyLNKk","pdfSize":"12888827","txDigest":"3GxT9bpaZJhCQFWbd68EqEAq6C3QanBSWNdaYkqKFhGc","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
