To tackle this challenge,\nwe propose an all-optical scheme using non-resonant bichromatic optical fields,\nwhich allow for the control of sub-cycle electron dynamics. The combined effect\nof the helical and asymmetric waveforms of the optical fields leads to the\nvalley-polarization and displacement of the excited electrons concurrently,\nthereby inducing the valleypolarized currents, on the sub-optical-cycle\ntimescale. This scheme inherently possesses remarkable resilience to\ndecoherence, making it particularly suitable for materials with short\ndecoherence times. Moreover, the direction of the currents can be precisely\ncontrolled by adjusting the relative phase of the bichromatic components. Our\nscheme offers a promising avenue for generating and modulating valley-polarized\ncurrents at the femtosecond timescale, opening the door to the realm of\npetahertz valleytronics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
