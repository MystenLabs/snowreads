Like in the case of plane curves previously treated by the second-named\nauthor, we find the answer is given by the $r$-spin mapping class group\nassociated to the maximal root of the adjoint line bundle. Our main innovation\nis a suite of tools for studying the monodromy of sections of a tensor product\nof very ample line bundles in terms of the monodromy of sections of the\nfactors, allowing for an induction on (multi-)degree.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
