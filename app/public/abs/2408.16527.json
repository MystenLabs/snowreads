An offshore wind (OW) farm could\nbe considered as a population of nominally-identical wind-turbine structures.\nHowever, benign variations exist among members, such as geometry, sea-bed\nconditions and temperature differences. These factors could influence\nstructural properties and therefore the dynamic response, making it more\ndifficult to detect structural problems via traditional SHM techniques.\n  This paper explores the use of a Bayesian hierarchical model as a means of\nmultitask learning, to infer foundation stiffness distribution parameters at\nboth population and local levels. To do this, observations of natural frequency\nfrom populations of structures were first generated from both numerical and\nexperimental models. These observations were then used in a partially-pooled\nBayesian hierarchical model in tandem with surrogate FE models of the\nstructures to infer foundation stiffness parameters. Finally, it is\ndemonstrated how the learned parameters may be used as a basis to perform more\nrobust anomaly detection (as compared to a no-pooling approach) e.g. as a\nresult of scour.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
