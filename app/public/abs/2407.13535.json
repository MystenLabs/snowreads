Distinct from\nsearch, navigating to specific areas known to be valuable entails its own\nparticularities. How space is understood through vision and parsed for\nnavigation is often examined experimentally, with limited ability to manipulate\nsensory inputs and probe into the algorithmic level of decision-making.\n  As a generalizable, minimal alternative to empirical means, we evolve and\nstudy embodied neural networks to explore information processing algorithms an\norganism may use for visual spatial navigation. Surprisingly, three distinct\nclasses of algorithms emerged, each with its own set of rules and tradeoffs,\nand each appear to be highly relevant to observable biological navigation\nbehaviors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
