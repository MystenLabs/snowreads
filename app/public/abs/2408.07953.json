In\nparticular, we construct sheaves on the Witt vector affine Grassmannian which\ngeometrize the Fourier coefficients of spherical Hecke operators, and compute\ntheir cohomology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
