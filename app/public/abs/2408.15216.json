The calculated specific heat is\nfound to show quantum oscillations, which appear soon after the inversion\ntransition and become prominent with decreasing Kondo coupling. Interestingly,\nit is noted that the field derivative of specific heat closely resembles the\nmagnetic quantum oscillations, and exhibits more pronounced oscillations at\nfinite temperatures than the magnetization itself. An empirical\nLifshitz-Kosevich fit with two frequencies given by the theory describes these\nquantum oscillations reasonably well, where the frequencies correspond to the\nextremal areas on the surface of charge gap, a remnant of the Fermi surface in\nthe insulating case.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
