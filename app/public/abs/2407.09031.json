We establish the global existence and a\nconstructive asymptotic decay of solutions in a close-to-equilibrium regime.\nThis is the first existence result for a Maxwell reflection condition on the\nboundary and that generalizes the similar results established for the Landau\nequation for other geometries in \\cite{GuoLandau1,GS1,GS2,MR3625186,MR4076068}.\nWe also answer to Villani's program \\cite{MR2116276,MR2407976} about\nconstructive accurate rate of convergence to the equilibrium {(quantitative\nH-Theorem)} for solutions to collisional kinetic equations satisfying a priori\nuniform bounds. The proofs rely on the study of a suitably linear problem for\nwhich we prove that the associated operator is hypocoercive, the associated\nsemigroup is ultracontractive, and finally that it is asymptotically stable in\nmany weighted $L^\\infty$ spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
