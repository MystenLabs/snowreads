The algorithm relies on the correspondence between\nclosed signal flow graphs and weighted finite automata on a singleton alphabet.\nWe demonstrate that this procedure results in a genuine reduction of\ncomplexity: our algorithm fares better than existing learning algorithms for\nweighted automata restricted to the case of a singleton alphabet.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Br6zn7EkFL7S_BqPd8uYN1cUTN_dbuzlvTxVWjgRNjs","pdfSize":"193947"}
