We solve this apparent contradiction by\ndemonstrating that both non-universal amplitudes and universal exponents of\nleading critical singularities in large deviation functions are determined by\nthe PDF tails, whose form is argued on extensivity. This unexplored scenario\nimplies a universal form of central limit theorem at criticality and is\nconfirmed by exact calculations for mean field Ising models in equilibrium and\nfor anomalous diffusion models.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
