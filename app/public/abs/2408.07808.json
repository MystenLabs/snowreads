In this way, we can identify the\ngeneric infinite four-volume limit of the lattice theory in the so-called de\nSitter phase with the Gaussian fixed-point limit or the IR fixed-point limit\nobtained by FRG. We also show how to identify a putative UV lattice gravity\nfixed point. Our Monte Carlo simulations of CDT allow for the existence of such\na UV fixed point, although the data precision does not yet provide a proof of\nits existence. The concept of a correlation length relevant for the lattice\ngravity fixed points is argued to be different from the concept of correlation\nlengths encountered in field theories in a fixed spacetime background.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
