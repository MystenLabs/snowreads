If the cycle is written in standard form with 1 appearing at\nthe beginning of the cycle and the standard form avoids a pattern of length 3,\nwe find answers in terms of continued fraction generating functions. We also\nconsider the case that every cyclic rotation of the cycle form of the\npermutation avoids a pattern of length 4 and enumerate two such cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
