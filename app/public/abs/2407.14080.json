Diverging from the traditional definition of distance, where a\ndistance $t$ implies that there exist $t$ edges that can be added to ensure a\ngraph possesses a certain property (such as $k$-edge-connectivity), our new\nnotion implies that there is a high probability that adding $t$ random edges\nwill endow the graph with the desired property. While formulating testers based\non this new distance proves challenging in a sequential environment, it is much\neasier in a distributed setting. Taking $k$-edge-connectivity as a case study,\nwe design ultra-fast testing algorithms in the CONGEST model. Our introduction\nof stochastic distance offers a more natural fit for the distributed setting,\nproviding a promising avenue for future research in emerging models of\ncomputation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
