In this work, we investigate the potential of LLMs for producing\nhierarchical organizations of scientific studies to assist researchers with\nliterature review. We define hierarchical organizations as tree structures\nwhere nodes refer to topical categories and every node is linked to the studies\nassigned to that category. Our naive LLM-based pipeline for hierarchy\ngeneration from a set of studies produces promising yet imperfect hierarchies,\nmotivating us to collect CHIME, an expert-curated dataset for this task focused\non biomedicine. Given the challenging and time-consuming nature of building\nhierarchies from scratch, we use a human-in-the-loop process in which experts\ncorrect errors (both links between categories and study assignment) in\nLLM-generated hierarchies. CHIME contains 2,174 LLM-generated hierarchies\ncovering 472 topics, and expert-corrected hierarchies for a subset of 100\ntopics. Expert corrections allow us to quantify LLM performance, and we find\nthat while they are quite good at generating and organizing categories, their\nassignment of studies to categories could be improved. We attempt to train a\ncorrector model with human feedback which improves study assignment by 12.6 F1\npoints. We release our dataset and models to encourage research on developing\nbetter assistive tools for literature review.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"n2v5V0gNqtjakC-Co9MfJ8SmelF8KPrTuCEbP6uglMs","pdfSize":"496955"}
