The ability to tune key pulse\nparameters such as time-dependent amplitude, phase, and frequency is essential\nto achieve maximal gate fidelity and mitigate errors. As systems scale, a\nlarger fraction of the control electronic processing will move closer to the\nqubits, to enhance integration and minimise latency in operations requiring\nfast feedback. This will constrain the space available in the memory of the\ncontrol electronics to load time-resolved pulse parameters at high sampling\nrates. Cubic spline interpolation is a powerful and widespread technique that\ndivides the pulse into segments of cubic polynomials. We show an optimised\nimplementation of this strategy, using a two-stage curve fitting process and\nadditional symmetry operations to load a high-sampling pulse output on an FPGA.\nThis results in a favourable accuracy versus memory footprint trade-off. By\nsimulating single-qubit population transfer and atom transport on a neutral\natom device, we show that we can achieve high fidelities with low memory\nrequirements. This is instrumental for scaling up the number of qubits and gate\noperations in environments where memory is a limited resource.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
