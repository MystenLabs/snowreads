Our main\nresults and innovations can be stated as follows: Under the assumption that the\ndensity $\\rho({\\bf{x}}, t)$ verifies $\\rho({\\bf{x}},0)\\geq c>0$ and\n$\\sup_{t\\geq 0}\\|\\rho(\\cdot,t)\\|_{L^\\infty}\\leq M$, we establish the optimal\ndecay rates of the solutions. This greatly improves the previous result (Arch.\nRation. Mech. Anal. 234 (2019), 1167--1222), where the authors require an extra\nhypothesis $\\sup_{t\\geq 0}\\|\\rho(\\cdot,t)\\|_{C^\\alpha}\\leq M$ with $\\alpha$\narbitrarily small. We prove that the vacuum state will persist for any time\nprovided that the initial density contains vacuum and the far-field density is\naway from vacuum, which extends the torus case obtained in (SIAM J. Math. Anal.\n55 (2023), 882--899) to the whole space. We derive the decay properties of the\nsolutions with vacuum as far-field density. This in particular gives the first\nresult concerning the $L^\\infty$-decay with a rate $(1+t)^{-1}$ for the\npressure to the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes equations in the presence of\nvacuum. The main ingredient of the proof relies on the techniques involving\nblow-up criterion, a key time-independent positive upper and lower bounds of\nthe density, and a regularity interpolation trick.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bKyXPGAjY2Aotx6joMb12bXBl3X6hLfBjv9tszy57BA","pdfSize":"325751"}
