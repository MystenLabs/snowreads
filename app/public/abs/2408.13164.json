Among our results, we show that if $R$ is a semi-nil clean\nNI ring, then $R$ is periodic. Additionally, we demonstrate that every group\nring $RG$ of a nilpotent group $G$ over a weakly 2-primal ring $R$ is semi-nil\nclean if, and only if, $R$ is periodic and $G$ is locally finite.\n  Moreover, we also study those rings in which every unit is a sum of a\nperiodic and a nilpotent element, calling them \\textit{unit semi-nil clean}\nrings. As a remarkable result, we show that if $R$ is an algebraic algebra over\na field, then $R$ is unit semi-nil clean if, and only if, $R$ is periodic.\n  Besides, we explore those rings in which non-zero elements are a sum of a\ntorsion element and a nilpotent element, naming them \\textit{t-fine} rings,\nwhich constitute a proper subclass of the class of all fine rings. One of the\nmain results is that matrix rings over t-fine rings are again t-fine rings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BwwfFTHq7EwtF9U441Ylr7lBcm71Ty_xIxExsAAP2sw","pdfSize":"223107"}
