In this context, we introduce AdapShare,\nan ORAN-compatible solution leveraging Reinforcement Learning (RL) for\nintent-based spectrum management, with the primary goal of minimizing resource\nsurpluses or deficits in RANs. By employing RL agents, AdapShare intelligently\nlearns network demand patterns and uses them to allocate resources. We\ndemonstrate the efficacy of AdapShare in the spectrum sharing scenario between\nLTE and NR networks, incorporating real-world LTE resource usage data and\nsynthetic NR usage data to demonstrate its practical use. We use the average\nsurplus or deficit and fairness index to measure the system's performance in\nvarious scenarios. AdapShare outperforms a quasi-static resource allocation\nscheme based on long-term network demand statistics, particularly when\navailable resources are scarce or exceed the aggregate demand from the\nnetworks. Lastly, we present a high-level O-RAN compatible architecture using\nRL agents, which demonstrates the seamless integration of AdapShare into\nreal-world deployment scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DU38WIV4jSl7687_JPmZB3qeyfofk-iXVUgoWe2buaM","pdfSize":"1017612"}
