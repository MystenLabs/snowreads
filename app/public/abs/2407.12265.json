The strength of the\ncubic interaction is found to vary inversely with the displacement of the\ncoherent state and the strongest interactions were one order of magnitude\ngreater than previous observations. The interaction is non-perturbative.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
