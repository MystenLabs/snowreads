Such control-based methods thus allow the\nexperimenter to directly and exhaustively explore the dynamics of the system\nwithout the need for a good mathematical model. The objective of this paper is\ntwofold, namely (i) to review and present the state-of-the-art methods in a\nunified manner and (ii) to introduce a novel experimental derivative-free\narclength continuation procedure, termed arclength control-based continuation.\nThese methods are also demonstrated and compared on an electronic Duffing\noscillator and a clamped thin plate featuring geometrical nonlinearity.\nFinally, the current state of the art is reflected upon, and the challenges\nlying ahead for this growing field are discussed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
