The scalar field potential is designed with a triple-well shape,\nengendering kink solutions with asymmetric square-well linearized potentials.\nThus, the localized and delocalized modes in this model can be obtained\nanalytically in terms of transcendental equations. This allows us to explore\nkink-antikink and antikink-kink collisions with any desired number of localized\nand delocalized modes. We obtain new scenarios of resonance windows\nsuppression, shedding light on the role of higher excited modes in kink\nscattering.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
