Initiatives like Easy to Read and Plain Language guidelines aim to\nsimplify complex texts; however, standardizing these guidelines remains\nchallenging and often involves manual processes. This work presents an\nexploratory investigation into leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) approaches to systematically simplify Spanish\ntexts into Easy to Read formats, with a focus on utilizing Large Language\nModels (LLMs) for simplifying texts, especially in generating Easy to Read\ncontent. The study contributes a parallel corpus of Spanish adapted for Easy To\nRead format, which serves as a valuable resource for training and testing text\nsimplification systems. Additionally, several text simplification experiments\nusing LLMs and the collected corpus are conducted, involving fine-tuning and\ntesting a Llama2 model to generate Easy to Read content. A qualitative\nevaluation, guided by an expert in text adaptation for Easy to Read content, is\ncarried out to assess the automatically simplified texts. This research\ncontributes to advancing text accessibility for individuals with cognitive\nimpairments, highlighting promising strategies for leveraging LLMs while\nresponsibly managing energy usage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"koeSkTBEGMqAfosJ339fgqbcOfeWJvvE2wZKHpjWZsw","pdfSize":"364665","objectId":"0x756e74ddf39eb932b6ecca54df77436e4aa50e0f0b23bf3a3c80c4ac06cb192c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
