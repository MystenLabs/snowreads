This contribution explores the influence of noise\nand reverberation on the trade-off between privacy and utility for low-cost\nprivacy-preserving methods feasible for edge computing. These methods\ncompromise spectral and temporal smoothing, speaker anonymization using the\nMcAdams coefficient, sampling with a very low sampling rate, and combinations.\nPrivacy is assessed by automatic speech and speaker recognition, while our\nutility considers voice activity detection and speaker diarization. Overall,\nour evaluation shows that additional noise degrades the performance of all\nmodels more than reverberation. This degradation corresponds to enhanced speech\nprivacy, while utility is less deteriorated for some methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5A9OMJd5p0Asdd1H9dA9wxhNtdIRGfxHNuvttAqdFjo","pdfSize":"1368318"}
