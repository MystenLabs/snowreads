{"id":"2408.13469","title":"A simple model of the radio-infrared correlation depending on gas\n  surface density and redshift","authors":"Ilsang Yoon","authorsParsed":[["Yoon","Ilsang",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 24 Aug 2024 05:11:33 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-27","timestamp":1724476293000,"abstract":"  We introduce a simple parametric model of the radio-infrared correlation\n(i.e., the ratio between the IR luminosity and the 1.4 GHz radio luminosity,\n$q_{\\mbox{\\tiny IR}}$) by considering the energy loss rate of high-energy\ncosmic ray (CR) electron governed by the radiative cooling (synchrotron,\nbremsstrahlung, inverse Compton scattering), ionization, and adiabatic\nexpansion. Each process of CR electron energy loss is explicitly computed and\ncompared to each other. We rewrite the energy loss rate of each process to be\ndependent on the gas surface density and redshift using the relevant scaling\nrelations. By combining each energy loss rate, the fraction of the synchrotron\nenergy loss rate is computed as a function of gas surface density and redshift,\nand used to extrapolate the well-established `local' radio-infrared correlation\nto the high-redshift universe. The locally established $q_{\\mbox{\\tiny IR}}$ is\nreformulated to be dependent upon the redshift and the gas surface density and\napplied for understanding the observed distribution of the radio-infrared\ncorrelation of high-redshift galaxies in \\cite{delvecchio_etal_2021}. Our model\npredicts that $q_{\\mbox{\\tiny IR}}$ value is anti-correlated with gas surface\ndensity and the redshift dependency of $q_{\\mbox{\\tiny IR}}$ value changes by\ngas surface density of galaxies, which captures the observed trend of\n$q_{\\mbox{\\tiny IR}}$ values for stellar mass selected star forming galaxies\nwith a minimal impact of radio-infrared selection bias.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
