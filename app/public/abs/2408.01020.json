We establish a\nconnection between linearization and maximally symmetric spacetimes, focusing\non the Noether symmetries admitted by the constraint Hamiltonian systems.\nSpecifically, for systems derived from the singular Lagrangian $$ L\\left(\nN,q^{k},\\dot{q}^{k}\\right) =\\frac{1}{2N}g_{ij}\\dot{q}^{i}\\dot{q}^{j}-NV(q^{k}),\n$$ where $N$ and $q^{i}$ are dependent variables and $\\dim g_{ij}=n$, the\nexistence of $\\frac{n\\left( n+1\\right) }{2}$ Noether symmetries is shown to be\nequivalent to the linearization of the equations of motion. The application of\nthese results is demonstrated through various examples of special interest.\nThis approach opens new directions in the study of differential equation\nlinearization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xbhkzGD4uP_afrbtQzhD1HVPjTSuWMV7Fnic52FPOPw","pdfSize":"272110","txDigest":"3Vn71MPgtFGjYSb2PoRLBEbWTZkBkhTktDZbSMjg3L61","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
