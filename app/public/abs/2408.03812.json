The two models of\nEoSs are derived from the nucleon-quark mixed matter (NQMM): The NQMM-A EoSs\nare based on the simple assumption that nucleons and free quarks occupy their\nrespective Fermi levels and their Fermi spheres overlap from each other. In\nNQMM-B EoSs, the quark Fermi repulsion effect is incorporated on the basis of\nquakyonic matter, meaning that the nucleon Fermi levels are pushed up from the\nquark Fermi sphere by the Pauli exclusion principle. For the NQMM-A EoSs, the\nneutron-star mass-radius ($MR$) curves are pushed up above the region of $M\n\\sim 2.1M_\\odot$ and $R_{2.1M_\\odot}\\sim$ 12.5 km indicated by the recent\nobservations, as the $qN$ repulsions increase. For the NQMM-B EoSs, the similar\nresults are obtained by the combined contributions from the $qN$ repulsion and\nthe quark Fermi repulsion. In both models of EoSs, the important roles of the\n$qN$ di-quark exchange repulsions are demonstrated to reproduce reasonable\nvalues of $M_{max}$ and $R_{2.1M_\\odot}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
