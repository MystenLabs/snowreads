Our inequality is sharp for subsets of many different\nsizes in every product graph. In particular, it implies that the $2^d$-element\nsets with smallest edge-boundary in the hypercube are subcubes and is only\nmarginally weaker than the Bollob\\'as$\\unicode{x2013}$Leader edge-isoperimetric\ninequalities for grids and tori. Additionally, it improves two\nedge-isoperimetric inequalities for products of regular graphs proved by Erde,\nKang, Krivelevich, and the first author and answers two questions about\nedge-isoperimetry in powers of regular graphs raised in their work.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
