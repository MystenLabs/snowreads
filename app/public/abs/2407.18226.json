The\ntheoretical model based on the local density approximation, previously employed\nto derive the spectral function from a combination of accurate theoretical\ncalculations and experimental data, has been developed further by including\nadditional information obtained from measurements performed with high missing\nenergy resolution. The implications for the analysis of $\\gamma$-ray emission\nassociated with nuclear deexcitation are considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
