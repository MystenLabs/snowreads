Existing literature has predominantly focused on the relationship\nbetween import competition and firms' global production networks, with less\nattention given to domestic. We first develop a Nash-bargaining model to guide\nour empirical analysis, then utilize tariff changes as an exogenous shock to\ntest our theoretical hypotheses using a database of Chinese listed firms from\n2000 to 2023. Our findings indicate that a decrease in downstream tariffs lead\nto an increase in vertical integration. In our mechanism tests, we discover\nthat a reduction in upstream tariffs also enhances this effect. Moreover, the\nimpact of tariff reductions on vertical integration is primarily observed in\nindustries with high asset specificity, indicating that asset-specificity is a\ncrucial mechanism. We further explore whether import competition encourages\nvertical integration for technological acquisition purpose, the effect is found\nonly among high-tech firms, while it's absent in non-high-tech firms. Our\nresearch provides new perspectives and evidence on how firms optimize their\nproduction organization in the process of globalization.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
