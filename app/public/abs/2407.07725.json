Our approach, by construction,\ncreates a manifold, watertight, and self-intersection-free offset surface\nstrictly enclosing the input, while doing a best effort to move it to a\nprescribed distance from the input. Differently from existing approaches, we\nembed the input in a volumetric mesh, and insert a topological offset around\nthe mesh with purely combinatorial operations. The topological offset is then\ninflated/deflated to match the user-prescribed distance, while enforcing that\nno intersections or non-manifold configurations are introduced. We evaluate the\neffectiveness and robustness of our approach on the non-intersecting subset of\nThingi10k, and show that topological offsets are beneficial in multiple\ngraphics applications, including (1) converting non-manifold surfaces to\nmanifold ones, (2) creation of nested cages/layered offsets, and (3) reliably\ncomputing finite offsets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
