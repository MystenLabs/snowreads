Our paper\nintroduces TokenVerse, a single Transducer-based model designed to handle\nmultiple tasks. This is achieved by integrating task-specific tokens into the\nreference text during ASR model training, streamlining the inference and\neliminating the need for separate NLP models. In addition to ASR, we conduct\nexperiments on 3 different tasks: speaker change detection, endpointing, and\nNER. Our experiments on a public and a private dataset show that the proposed\nmethod improves ASR by up to 7.7% in relative WER while outperforming the\ncascaded pipeline approach in individual task performance. Additionally, we\npresent task transfer learning to a new task within an existing TokenVerse.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
