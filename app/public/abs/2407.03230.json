The thermomechanical behavior of this process is modeled with a\nset of thermoelasticity equations resulting in a nonlinear, nonsymmetric saddle\npoint system. Newton's method is used to solve the nonlinearity and suitable\ndomain decomposition preconditioners are applied to accelerate the convergence\nof the iterative method used to solve all linearized systems. Since a onelevel\nSchwarz preconditioner is in general not scalable, a second level has to be\nadded. Therefore, the construction and numerical analysis of a monolithic,\ntwolevel overlapping Schwarz approach with the GDSW (Generalized\nDryja-Smith-Widlund) coarse space and an economic variant thereof are presented\nhere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
