This paper proposes an optimal\nbreakpoint selection method, rotational adjusting method (RAM), to minimize the\napproximation error between the original function and the piecewise linear\nfunction with limited number of pieces, applicable to both convex or concave\nfunction. RAM rotationally adjusts the location of breakpoints based on its\nadjacent breakpoints, and the optimal positions would be reached after several\niterations. The optimality of the method is proved. Numerical experiments are\nconducted on the logarithmic function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
