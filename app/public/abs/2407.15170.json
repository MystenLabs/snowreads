Industry standards typically do not\nrequire time-interval annotations, even though they are more informative than\ntime-point annotations for defect localization, resulting in additional\nannotation costs when fully supervised methods are used. Additionally,\ndifferences in scene types and camera motion patterns between pipe inspections\nand Temporal Action Localization (TAL) hinder the effective transfer of\npoint-supervised TAL methods. Therefore, this study introduces a\nSemi-supervised multi-Prototype-based method incorporating visual Odometry for\nenhanced attention guidance (PipeSPO). PipeSPO fully leverages unlabeled data\nthrough unsupervised pretext tasks and utilizes time-point annotated data with\na weakly supervised multi-prototype-based method, relying on visual odometry\nfeatures to capture camera pose information. Experiments on real-world datasets\ndemonstrate that PipeSPO achieves 41.89% average precision across Intersection\nover Union (IoU) thresholds of 0.1-0.7, improving by 8.14% over current\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
