Clothes manipulation\nrequires sequential actions, making it challenging to generalize to unseen\ntasks. Besides, a general clothes state representation method is crucial. In\nthis paper, we adopt language instructions to specify and decompose clothes\nmanipulation tasks, and propose a large language model based hierarchical\nlearning method to enhance generalization. For state representation, we use\nsemantic keypoints to capture the geometry of clothes and outline their\nmanipulation methods. Simulation experiments show that the proposed method\noutperforms the baseline method in terms of success rate and generalization for\nclothes manipulation tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
