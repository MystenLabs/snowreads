Here, we show that a fractional calculus approach can restore or\ninclude complexity in any physical systems that can be described by partial\ndifferential equations. We argue that the dispersion relation contains the\nrequired information relating the energy and momentum space of the system and\nthus fully describes their dynamics. The approach is demonstrated by two\nexamples: the Landau-Lifshitz equation in a 1D ferromagnetic chain, an example\nof a periodic crystal system with a bounded dispersion relation; and a modified\nKdV equation supporting surface gravity waves or Euler dispersion, an example\nof an unbounded system in momentum space. The presented approach is applicable\nto fluids, soft matter, and solid-state matter and can be readily generalized\nto higher dimensions and more complex systems. While numerical calculations are\nneeded to determine the fractional operator, the approach is analytical and can\nbe utilized to determine analytical solutions and investigate nonlinear\nproblems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GXAg68WxhBg07zFs-gBo6FmPHaKpAJ4tT0Dp4kIupfM","pdfSize":"311179"}
