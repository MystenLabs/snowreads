Existing methods require pre-constructed 3D\nscenes and face scalability issues due to per-point feature vector learning,\nlimiting their efficacy with complex queries. Our method overcomes these\nlimitations by incrementally building instance-level 3D scene representations\nusing 2D foundation models, efficiently aggregating instance-level details such\nas masks, feature vectors, names, and captions. We introduce fusion schemes for\nfeature vectors to enhance their contextual knowledge and performance on\ncomplex queries. Additionally, we explore large language models for robust\nautomatic annotation and spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluate our proposed\napproach on multiple scenes from ScanNet and Replica datasets demonstrating\nzero-shot generalization capabilities, exceeding current state-of-the-art\nmethods in open world 3D scene understanding.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
