In this study, we implemented\nthe joint inversion of DC resistivity with MT data using the Multi-Objective\nGrey Wolf Optimization (MOGWO) algorithm. As an extension of the widely-used\nGrey Wolf Optimization algorithm, MOGWO offers a suite of pareto optimal\nnon-dominated solutions, eliminating the need for weighting parameters in the\nobjective functions. This set of non-dominated predictions also facilitates the\nunderstanding of uncertainty in the predicted model parameters. Through a field\ncase study in the region around Broken Hill in South Central Australia, the\npaper showcases MOGWO's capabilities in joint inversion, providing confident\nestimates of the model parameters (resistivity profiles), as indicated by a\nnarrow spread in the suite of solutions. The obtained results are comparable to\nwell established methodologies and highlight the efficacy of MOGWO as a\nreliable tool in geophysical exploration.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gnuId3wouLaTk6iqhZJ8NlcWPYIdsxfBld_pGctZKzw","pdfSize":"486587"}
