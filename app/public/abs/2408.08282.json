This involves robots being able to plan their actions\nand behaviors in long-horizon tasks while using multi-modality to perceive\ndeviations between task execution and high-level planning. Recently, large\nlanguage models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful planning and reasoning\ncapabilities for comprehension and processing of semantic information through\nrobot control tasks, as well as the usability of analytical judgment and\ndecision-making for multi-modal inputs. To leverage the power of LLMs towards\nhumanoid loco-manipulation, we propose a novel language-model based framework\nthat enables robots to autonomously plan behaviors and low-level execution\nunder given textual instructions, while observing and correcting failures that\nmay occur during task execution. To systematically evaluate this framework in\ngrounding LLMs, we created the robot 'action' and 'sensing' behavior library\nfor task planning, and conducted mobile manipulation tasks and experiments in\nboth simulated and real environments using the CENTAURO robot, and verified the\neffectiveness and application of this approach in robotic tasks with autonomous\nbehavioral planning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
