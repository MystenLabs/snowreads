This\nstudy aims to extract information from the issue tracking system Jira and\nproposes a methodology to estimate resolution time for new bugs. The\nmethodology is applied to network project ONAP, addressing concerns of network\noperators and manufacturers. This research provides insights into bug\nresolution times and related aspects in network softwarization projects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4OM50rl9qcun9uXqI8hos7wKlNKiwmKULxzsLh0BOFk","pdfSize":"451299"}
