These\nmodels are built on Llama3 architecture and fine-tuned using specialized\nclinical data. They underwent multi-stage preference alignment to effectively\nrespond to natural prompts. While generic models are often preference-aligned\nto avoid answering clinical queries as a precaution, Med42-v2 is specifically\ntrained to overcome this limitation, enabling its use in clinical settings.\nMed42-v2 models demonstrate superior performance compared to the original\nLlama3 models in both 8B and 70B parameter configurations and GPT-4 across\nvarious medical benchmarks. These LLMs are developed to understand clinical\nqueries, perform reasoning tasks, and provide valuable assistance in clinical\nenvironments. The models are now publicly available at\n\\href{https://huggingface.co/m42-health}{https://huggingface.co/m42-health}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
