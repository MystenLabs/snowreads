Both can couple to conserved currents. In\nthis paper we show that when the particles have spin one or greater, there\nexists a universal feature associated to the particle becoming massive: the\ncurrents possess a non-vanishing boundary flux.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
