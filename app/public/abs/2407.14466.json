Our Monte Carlo simulations\nincorporate accurate two-body elastic and inelastic scattering cross sections,\nrealistic modeling of the optical dipole trap, and the influence of Pauli\nblocking at low temperatures. The simulations are benchmarked against data from\nevaporation studies performed with ultracold NaK molecules, showing excellent\nagreement. We further explore the prospects for optimizing the evaporation\nefficiency by varying the ramp rate and duration of the evaporation trajectory.\nOur simulation shows that it is possible to reach $< 10\\%$ of the Fermi\ntemperature under optimal conditions even in the presence of two-body molecular\nlosses.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
