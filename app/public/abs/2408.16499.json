However, the experimental\nconfirmation of the presence of Majorana edge states and unconventional pairing\ncurrently poses a major challenge. Here we consider a two-dimensional lattice\nmodel for a superconductor with spin-orbit coupling and exchange coupling to\nrandomly distributed magnetic impurities. Depending on parameters of the model,\nthis system may display topologically trivial or nontrivial edge states. We map\nout the phase diagram by computing the Bott index, a topological invariant\ndefined in real space. We then use machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict\nthe Bott index from the local density of states (LDOS) at zero energy,\nobtaining high-accuracy results. We also train ML models to predict the\namplitude of odd-frequency pairing in the anomalous Green's function at zero\nenergy. Once the ML models are trained using the LDOS, which is experimentally\naccessible via scanning tunneling spectroscopy, our method could be applied to\npredict the number of Majorana edge states and to estimate the magnitude of\nodd-frequency pairing in real materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
