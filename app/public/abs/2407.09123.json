Introducing the squared momentum\nterm results in a generalized uncertainty principle, which limits the minimum\nuncertainty in particle position to the Planck length. However, such a\ndeformation of the commutator significantly changes the formalism, making it\nseparate from the canonical formalism of quantum mechanics. In this study, it\nis shown that the deformed algebra of position and momentum operators can be\nincorporated into the framework of ordinary quantum mechanics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
