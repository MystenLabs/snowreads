A primary component of cold gas, neutral\natomic hydrogen (HI), can be traced by its 21-cm emission line. However, the\nfaintness of this emission typically limits individual detections to low\nredshifts ($z\\lesssim 0.2$). To address this limitation, we investigate the\npotential of targeting gravitationally lensed systems. Building on our prior\ngalaxy-galaxy simulations, we have developed a ray-tracing code to simulate\nlensed HI images for known galaxies situated behind the massive Hubble Frontier\nField galaxy clusters. Our findings reveal the existence of high HI mass, high\nHI magnification systems in these cluster lensing scenarios. Through\nsimulations of hundreds of sources, we have identified compelling targets\nwithin the redshift range $z\\approx 0.7 - 1.5$. The most promising candidate\nfrom our simulations is the Great Arc at z=0.725 in Abell~370, which should be\ndetectable by MeerKAT in approximately 50 hours. Importantly, the derived HI\nmass is predicted to be relatively insensitive to systematic uncertainties in\nthe lensing model, and should be constrained within a factor of $\\sim 2.5$ for\na 95 per cent confidence interval.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
