The construction is based on a Legendre expansion of the\nstandard Brownian motion and of the L{\\'e}vy area. We deduce sharp estimates\nfor the decay in total variation distance between the laws of the Brownian\nmotions. Using a change of probability method, we also obtain the log-Harnack\ninequality, a Bismut type integration by part formula and reverse Poincar\\'e\ninequalities for the associated semi-group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
