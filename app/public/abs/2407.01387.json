The latter arise\nnaturally when studying so-called ask zeta functions of direct sums of modules\nof matrices or class- and orbit-counting zeta functions of direct products of\nnilpotent groups. Our method relies on shuffle compatibility of coloured\npermutation statistics and coloured quasisymmetric functions, extending recent\nwork of Gessel and Zhuang.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
