{"id":"2408.02445","title":"On Interstellar Quantum Communication and the Fermi Paradox","authors":"Latham Boyle","authorsParsed":[["Boyle","Latham",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 5 Aug 2024 13:11:39 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-06","timestamp":1722863499000,"abstract":"  Since it began \\cite{CocconiMorrison}, the search for extraterrestrial\nintelligence (SETI) has focused on interstellar \\emph{classical} communication.\nRecently, Berera \\cite{Berera:2020rpl} pointed out that, at certain\nfrequencies, photon qubits can retain their quantum coherence over interstellar\n(and even intergalactic) distances, raising the prospect of interstellar\n\\emph{quantum} communication. This is an intriguing possibility, since quantum\ncommunication permits certain tasks that would be impossible with classical\ncommunication, and allow exponential speed-ups for others. (We suggest some\nmotivations in the interstellar context.) But quantum coherence alone is not\nsufficient for quantum communication: here, for the first time, we analyze the\n\\emph{quantum capacity} $Q$ of an interstellar channel. We point out that, to\nhave non-zero quantum capacity $Q>0$, interstellar communication over a\ndistance $L$ must use wavelengths $\\lambda < 26.5\\,cm$ (to avoid depolarization\nby the cosmic microwave background), and \\emph{enormous} telescopes of\neffective diameter $D>0.78\\sqrt{\\lambda L}$ (to satisfy quantum erasure\nconstraints). For example, for two telescopes of diameter $D$ on Earth and\nProxima Centauri, this implies $D>100\\,km$! This is a technological threshold\nthat remains to be crossed in order for reliable one-way quantum communication\nto become possible, and suggests a fundamental new resolution of the Fermi\nparadox.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
