Meeting this demand requires approaches that can handle bigger data to\nyield forecasts that capture the variability and underlying uncertainty of\necological systems. Bayesian models are especially adept at this and are\ngrowing in use in ecology. Yet many ecologists today are not trained to take\nadvantage of the bigger ecological data needed to generate more flexible robust\nmodels. Here we describe a broadly generalizable workflow for statistical\nanalyses and show how it can enhance training in ecology. Building on the\nincreasingly computational toolkit of many ecologists, this approach leverages\nsimulation to integrate model building and testing for empirical data more\nfully with ecological theory. In turn this workflow can fit models that are\nmore robust and well-suited to provide new ecological insights -- allowing us\nto refine where to put resources for better estimates, better models, and\nbetter forecasts.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
