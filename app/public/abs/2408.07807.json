These trade-offs are\ncharacterized in the form of inequalities involving the information\ntransmission rate, energy transmission rate, decoding error probability (DEP)\nand energy outage probability (EOP) for a given finite block-length code. The\nfirst set of results identify the set of necessary conditions that a given code\nmust satisfy for simultaneous information and energy transmission. Following\nthis, a novel method for constructing a family of codes that can satisfy a\ntarget information rate, energy rate, DEP and EOP is proposed. Finally, the\nachievability results identify the set of tuples of information rate, energy\nrate, DEP and EOP that can be simultaneously achieved by the constructed family\nof codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6yLroY8nnANpg8z9qHtg9W9h8Juo604EL7HrGBvfmF8","pdfSize":"581939"}
