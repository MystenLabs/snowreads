For simplicial spheres $K$ of\narbitrary dimension, we obtain a sufficient condition for the ring isomorphism\n$H^*(\\mathcal Z_K)\\cong H^*(M)$ where $M$ is a connected sum of products of\nspheres.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
