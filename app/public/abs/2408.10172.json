Due to a reduction from [Peng-Song, STOC '22],\nthis yields an $\\breve{O}(m\\log^3 n + n\\log^6 n)$-time algorithm for solving\n$n$-vertex $m$-edge Eulerian Laplacian systems with polynomially-bounded\nweights with high probability, improving upon the previous state-of-the-art\nruntime of $\\Omega(m\\log^8 n + n\\log^{23} n)$. We also give a polynomial-time\nalgorithm that computes $O(\\min(n\\log n \\cdot \\varepsilon^{-2} + n\\log^{5/3} n\n\\cdot \\varepsilon^{-4/3}, n\\log^{3/2} n \\cdot \\varepsilon^{-2}))$-edge\nsparsifiers, improving the best such sparsity bound of $O(n\\log^2 n \\cdot\n\\varepsilon^{-2} + n\\log^{8/3} n \\cdot \\varepsilon^{-4/3})$\n[Sachdeva-Thudi-Zhao, ICALP '24]. Finally, we show that our techniques extend\nto yield the first $O(m\\cdot\\text{polylog}(n))$ time algorithm for computing\n$O(n\\varepsilon^{-1}\\cdot\\text{polylog}(n))$-edge graphical spectral sketches,\nas well as a natural Eulerian generalization we introduce.\n  In contrast to prior Eulerian graph sparsification algorithms which used\neither short cycle or expander decompositions, our algorithms use a simple\nefficient effective resistance decomposition scheme we introduce. Our\nalgorithms apply a natural sampling scheme and electrical routing (to achieve\ndegree balance) to such decompositions. Our analysis leverages new asymmetric\nvariance bounds specialized to Eulerian Laplacians and tools from discrepancy\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
