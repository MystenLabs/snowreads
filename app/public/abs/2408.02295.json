Such oversimplification can lead to inaccurate\nerror representations and compromised uncertainty estimation. In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel framework for generalized Gaussian error modeling in deep\nreinforcement learning, applicable to both discrete and continuous control\nsettings. Our framework enhances the flexibility of error distribution modeling\nby incorporating higher-order moments, particularly kurtosis, thereby improving\nthe estimation and mitigation of data-dependent noise, i.e., aleatoric\nuncertainty. We examine the influence of the shape parameter of the generalized\nGaussian distribution (GGD) on aleatoric uncertainty and provide a closed-form\nexpression that demonstrates an inverse relationship between uncertainty and\nthe shape parameter. Additionally, we propose a theoretically grounded\nweighting scheme to fully leverage the GGD. To address epistemic uncertainty,\nwe enhance the batch inverse variance weighting by incorporating bias reduction\nand kurtosis considerations, resulting in improved robustness. Extensive\nexperimental evaluations using policy gradient algorithms demonstrate the\nconsistent efficacy of our method, showcasing significant performance\nimprovements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Probability","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DG1OjuEVr6gSnulZqXyzC4dkz7GT-Vyrg-2qUM_NA18","pdfSize":"42471104","txDigest":"33BbJ2AHXe7eqnFQmFDwsqbLBxMmijNEruRM8iDkFp4a","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
