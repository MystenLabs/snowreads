Also, by using the representation of the solution operator,\nwe solve the inverse abstract Cauchy problem for recovering the time-variable\ncoefficient. As a complement, we also study similar problems by using almost\nsectorial operators that depend on a time-variable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
