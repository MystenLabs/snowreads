This article explains how an industrial company in the\nnuclear and defense sectors adopted such an approach, adapted to its \"TA KM\"\norganizational context and falls within the ISO30401 framework, to build a\ncomplete system with a \"SARBACANES\" application to support its business\nprocesses and perpetuate its know-how and expertise in a knowledge base. Over\nand above the classic transfer of knowledge between experts and business\nspecialists, SARBACANES also reveals the ability of this type of engineering to\ndeliver multi-functional operation. Modeling was accelerated by the use of a\ntool adapted to this type of operation: the Ardans Knowledge Maker platform.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
