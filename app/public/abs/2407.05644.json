In addition to that, a general\n$U(1)_X$ scenario involves an SM-singlet scalar field and due to the $U(1)_X$\nsymmetry breaking the mass of a neutral beyond the SM (BSM) gauge boson\n$Z^\\prime$ is evolved. The RHNs, being charged under $U(1)_X$ scenario, can\nexplain the origin of observed baryon asymmetry through the resonant\nleptogenesis process. Applying observed neutrino oscillation data we study\n$Z^\\prime$ and BSM scalar induced processes to reproduce the observed baryon\nasymmetry. Hence we estimate bounds on the $U(1)_X$ gauge coupling $(g_X)$ and\nthe mass of the $Z^\\prime$ $(M_{Z^\\prime})$ for different $U(1)_X$ charges and\nbenchmark masses of RHN and SM-singlet scalar. Finally we compare our results\nwith limits obtained from the existing limits from LEP-II and LHC. We find that\ndepending on the $U(1)_X$ charges, the masses of RHNs and SM-singlet scalar\nresonant leptogenesis could provide stronger limit on $g_X$ for $M_{Z^\\prime} >\n5.8$ TeV which could be probed by high energy scattering experiment in future.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
