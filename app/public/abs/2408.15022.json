We present a comprehensive analysis of glitches\nin four gamma-ray pulsars by combining the timing observation data of\n\\textit{Fermi} Large Area Telescope (\\textit{Fermi}-LAT) and Parkes 64 m radio\ntelescope. The timing data of five pulsars, namely PSRs J1028$-$5819,\nJ1420$-$6048, J1509$-$5850, J1709$-$4429 (B1706$-$44) and J1718$-$3825,\nspanning over 14 years of observations for each, are examined. A total of 12\nglitches are identified in four pulsars, including a previously unreported\nglitch. That is, a new small glitch is identified for PSR J1718$-$3825 in MJD\n$\\sim$ 59121(8), and the fractional glitch size was $\\Delta \\nu/\\nu \\sim 1.9(2)\n\\times 10^{-9}$. For PSR J1420$-$6048, our investigation confirms the existence\nof two linear recovery terms during the evolution of $\\dot{\\nu}$ subsequent to\nglitches 4, 6 and 8, and identified an exponential recovery process in glitch\n8, with $Q = 0.0131(5)$, $\\tau_{\\rm d} = 100(6)$ d. Regarding the fourth glitch\nof PSR J1709$-$4429, our analysis reveals the presence of two exponential\nrecovery terms with healing parameters and decay time-scales $Q$1=0.0104(5),\n$\\tau_{\\rm d1}=72(4)$ d and $Q$2 = 0.006(1), $\\tau_{\\rm d2}=4.2(6)$ d,\nrespectively. For the remaining previously reported glitches, we refine the\nglitch epochs and glitch observables through precise fitting of the timing\nresidual data. We extensively discuss how multi-band data of glitches can help\nbetter characterize the glitch recoveries and constrain the underlying physics\nof glitch events. We demonstrate that the accumulation of observational data\nreveals the rich complexity of the glitch phenomenon, aiding in the search for\na well-established interpretation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
