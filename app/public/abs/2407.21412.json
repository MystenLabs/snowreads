It is designed to run\nalongside a given experimental protocol with minimal interactions and\nintegration effort. From the genomic flow, it extracts and displays species'\nboundaries and dynamics. Starting with a light introduction to the core idea of\nthis classification we discuss the requirements on the genomes and the\nunderlying processes of building species' identities and managing hybridism.\nThough stemming from an ALife experimental setting, APOGeT ought not be limited\nto this field but could be used by (and benefit from) a broader audience.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BCylrConCYcdcq2yz4glInc8H1flncMkglVjEo3WwjM","pdfSize":"842539","objectId":"0xd5a480a78bab5a8f49025de740eb359d518c8e5bf86a35718969eab59ab58a70","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
