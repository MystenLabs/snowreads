Since only some of\nthe four spin/valley flavors available to the electrons in each Landau level\nmanifold are filled, they also exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking the in\nspin/valley sector, a phenomenon known as quantum Hall ferromagnetism. In this\nwork, we study quantum Hall ferromagnets in the higher Landau level manifolds\nof monolayer graphene and show that there is an even richer set of\nsymmetry-broken phases than in the lowest Landau level manifold. Specifically,\nboth valley polarized and valley equatorial (where the occupied Landau levels\nare in an equal superposition of both valleys) ferromagnets, antiferromagnets,\nand canted antiferromagnets are found. Several types of spin valley entangled\nphases are found, all of which manifest the simultaneous spontaneous symmetry\nbreaking of both magnetic and lattice symmetries.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
