In\nthis work, we demonstrate that einselection and the associated envariance are\nactually artifacts resulting from neglecting the non-equilibrium dynamics of\nthe apparatus. We propose a new formalism of operator dressing, which we call\nthe stochastic matrix integral (SMI), inspired by recent developments in\nquantum gravity algebras. This approach naturally arises from a modified\nPage-Wootters (PW) formula and describes decoherence as an interacting\nnon-equilibrium process. It leads to the reduction of the Hilbert space and the\nemergence of an intrinsic non-unitary process as well as Born's rule. These\noutcomes are achieved without relying on the assumptions of einselection and\npointer basis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
