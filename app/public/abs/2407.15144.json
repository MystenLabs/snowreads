We\nexplore the dual operator spectrum and the fate of Liouvillian\nnon-integrability both in the presence and the absence of the flavour degrees\nof freedom. We also comment about the factorised scattering and the associated\nintegrability or non-integrability of the sigma model. Our analysis reveals the\nmutual compatibility between two seemingly different approaches that has\nexisted in the literature for a long time.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
