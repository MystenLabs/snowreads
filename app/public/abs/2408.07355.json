We discover instead a new class\nof non-Hermitian quantum fractals (NHQFs) emerging in coupled Hatano-Nelson\nmodels on a tree lattice in absence of any fields. Based on analytic solutions,\nwe are able to rigorously identify the self-similar recursive structures in\nenergy spectrum and wave functions. We prove that the complex spectrum of NHQFs\nbears a resemblance to the Mandelbrot set in fractal theory. The\nself-similarity of NHQFs is rooted in the interplay between the iterative\nlattice configuration and non-Hermiticity. Moreover, we show that NHQFs exist\nin generalized non-Hermitian systems with iterative lattice structures. Our\nfindings open a new avenue for investigating quantum fractals in non-Hermitian\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
