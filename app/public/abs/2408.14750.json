Unlike typical data, internet-sourced lyrics are frequently protected\nunder copyright law, necessitating alternative approaches. Our study introduces\na novel method for generating copyright-free lyrics from publicly available\nBag-of-Words (BoW) datasets, which contain the vocabulary of lyrics but not the\nlyrics themselves. Utilizing metadata associated with BoW datasets and large\nlanguage models, we successfully reconstructed lyrics. We have compiled and\nmade available a dataset of reconstructed lyrics, LyCon, aligned with metadata\nfrom renowned sources including the Million Song Dataset, Deezer Mood Detection\nDataset, and AllMusic Genre Dataset, available for public access. We believe\nthat the integration of metadata such as mood annotations or genres enables a\nvariety of academic experiments on lyrics, such as conditional lyric\ngeneration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e0phuwfdADV4Cy_ghOeRf5b7lhFdlU_V_3UE8YCvB6I","pdfSize":"337195"}
