Diffusion models have recently\nemerged as a powerful approach, excelling at unconditional sample generation\nand, with data-driven guidance, conditional generation within their training\ndomain. Reliably sampling from high-value regions beyond the training data,\nhowever, remains an open challenge -- with current methods predominantly\nfocusing on modifying the diffusion process itself. In this paper, we develop\ncontext-guided diffusion (CGD), a simple plug-and-play method that leverages\nunlabeled data and smoothness constraints to improve the out-of-distribution\ngeneralization of guided diffusion models. We demonstrate that this approach\nleads to substantial performance gains across various settings, including\ncontinuous, discrete, and graph-structured diffusion processes with\napplications across drug discovery, materials science, and protein design.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
