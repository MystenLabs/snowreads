The equations we obtain this way are the Hopf\n(inviscid Burgers) equation, the Camassa-Holm equation, the Hunter-Saxton\nequation and the Korteweg-De Vries equation. We then study the symmetry groups\nof the equations themselves and show that one can improve the behaviour of the\nHopf equation by metric and topological corrections. The symmetry groups of\nthese equations can aid the benchmarking and testing of numerical methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
