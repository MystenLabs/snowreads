Differing from the traditional six-layer IT2FNN, a nine-layer\nnetwork is developed to improve prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and\nmodel interpretability. First, a new co-antecedent layer and a modified\nconsequent layer are devised to improve the interpretability of the fuzzy model\nfor multi-step predictions. Second, a new transformation layer is designed to\naddress the potential issues in the vanished rule firing strength caused by\nhighdimensional inputs. Third, a new link layer is proposed to build temporal\nconnections between multi-step predictions. Furthermore, a two-stage\nself-organizing mechanism is developed to automatically generate the fuzzy\nrules, in which the first stage is used to create the rule base from empty and\nperform the initial optimization, while the second stage is to fine-tune all\nnetwork parameters. Finally, various simulations are carried out on chaotic and\nmicrogrid time series prediction problems, demonstrating the superiority of our\napproach in terms of prediction accuracy, uncertainty handling and model\ninterpretability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
