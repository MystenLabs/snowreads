GALI can provide directional information about GRBs with\nhigh angular accuracy from angle-dependent mutual obstruction between its\nscintillators. Here, we demonstrate GALI's laboratory experiments with an\n$^{241}$Am source, which achieved directional reconstruction of $<$3$^\\circ$\naccuracy, in agreement with our Monte-Carlo simulations. GALI has a wide field\nview of the unobstructed sky. With its current cubic configuration, GALI's\neffective area varies between 97 cm$^2$ (face on) and 138 cm$^2$ (from the\ncorners at 45$^\\circ$), which is verified in the current experiment.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aSTL6wVKKPj7PZ1t_SKe6Is2TzpkR1u_yZBI3D0nzfw","pdfSize":"6786033"}
