However, current AR headsets face limitations in processing power,\nwhich has prevented researchers from performing real-time, complex image\nrecognition tasks using CNNs in AR headsets. This paper presents a method to\ndeploy CNN models on AR headsets by training them on computers and transferring\nthe optimized weight matrices to the headset. The approach transforms the image\ndata and CNN layers into a one-dimensional format suitable for the AR platform.\nWe demonstrate this method by training the LeNet-5 CNN model on the MNIST\ndataset using PyTorch and deploying it on a HoloLens AR headset. The results\nshow that the model maintains an accuracy of approximately 98%, similar to its\nperformance on a computer. This integration of CNN and AR enables real-time\nimage processing on AR headsets, allowing for the incorporation of human input\ninto AI models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Cztaa5X2O_-Miin6UeMIjOwrJkSx1yL73WK2wUguHY0","pdfSize":"1743250"}
