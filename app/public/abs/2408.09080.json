Referring to the duality of, say, points and lines in projective\ngeometry, he named the binary relations as polarities.\n  Researchers since then have used polarities (also known as formal contexts)\nas a convenient technical way to build complete lattices from ``found'' data.\nAnd so, various proposals for suitable morphisms between polarities have tended\nto have a particular application in mind.\n  In this work, we develop the structure of a category of polarities and\ncompatible relations, adopting Birkhoff's original simple idea that the\nstructure of a polarity is its the Galois connection. Hence, morphisms must be\nrelations that, in a reasonable sense, preserve Galois connections. In\nparticular, the dual equivalence of the category to the category of complete\nmeet semilattices, completeness of the category, characterization of\nepimorphisms and monomorphisms, an epi/mono factorization system, as well as\nthe star-autonomous structure of the category, all arise by extending\nBirkhoff's original observation to morphisms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
