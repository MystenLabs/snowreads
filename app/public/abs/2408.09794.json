However,\nrecent approaches to dense text representations (embeddings) do not efficiently\nexploit these resources. Dense and robust representations of documents are\nessential for effectively solving downstream classification and retrieval\ntasks. This work demonstrates that injecting embedded information from\nknowledge bases can augment the performance of contemporary Large Language\nModel (LLM)-based representations for the task of text classification. Further,\nby considering automated machine learning (AutoML) with the fused\nrepresentation space, we demonstrate it is possible to improve classification\naccuracy even if we use low-dimensional projections of the original\nrepresentation space obtained via efficient matrix factorization. This result\nshows that significantly faster classifiers can be achieved with minimal or no\nloss in predictive performance, as demonstrated using five strong LLM baselines\non six diverse real-life datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IKZLZqri9pRg0ZzNUqsB6AC3Y1M2pUL3NVRi9e0QWU0","pdfSize":"1857463"}
