As far as we know this gives the\nfirst example for the validity of the Springer theorem for projective\nhomogeneous varieties of type $^2E_6$ different from varieties of Borel\nsubgroups. The proof combines several topics, notably the Rost invariant, a\nTits construction, Cartan's symmetric spaces and indirectly the structure of\nthe Chow motives of projective homogeneous varieties of exceptional type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
