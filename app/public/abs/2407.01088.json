Specifically, we consider the case of plane linear\nelasticity and, by leveraging the Kolosov-Muskhelishvili representation of the\nsolution in terms of holomorphic potentials, we train a complex-valued neural\nnetwork to fulfill stress and displacement boundary conditions while\nautomatically satisfying the governing equations. This is achieved by designing\nthe network to return only approximations that inherently satisfy the\nCauchy-Riemann conditions through specific choices of layers and activation\nfunctions. To ensure generality, we provide a universal approximation theorem\nguaranteeing that, under basic assumptions, the proposed holomorphic neural\nnetworks can approximate any holomorphic function. Furthermore, we suggest a\nnew tailored weight initialization technique to mitigate the issue of\nvanishing/exploding gradients. Compared to the standard PINN approach,\nnoteworthy benefits of the proposed method for the linear elasticity problem\ninclude a more efficient training, as evaluations are needed solely on the\nboundary of the domain, lower memory requirements, due to the reduced number of\ntraining points, and $C^\\infty$ regularity of the learned solution. Several\nbenchmark examples are used to verify the correctness of the obtained PIHNN\napproximations, the substantial benefits over traditional PINNs, and the\npossibility to deal with non-trivial, multiply-connected geometries via a\ndomain-decomposition strategy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
