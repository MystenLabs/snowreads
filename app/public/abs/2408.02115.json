The study evaluates the network's\ndecentralization, scalability, and security features, including its Nakamoto\ncoefficient, validator participation, and client distribution. Additionally, it\nexamines the developer ecosystem, including GitHub metrics, and business\naspects such as transaction costs and predictability. The findings of this\nresearch will provide valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of\nthe XDC Network, informing stakeholders and decision-makers about its\nsuitability for various use cases, particularly in trade finance, asset\ntokenization, and enterprise blockchain solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
