The first class consists of diagrams defined in terms\nof extremal spheres in the space of Lie spheres, and the second class includes\nminimization diagrams for functions that can be expressed in terms of affine\nfunctions on a higher-dimensional space. These results unify and generalize\nprevious descriptions of generalized Voronoi diagrams as convex hull problems.\nSpecial cases include classical Voronoi diagrams, power diagrams, order $k$ and\nfarthest point diagrams, Apollonius diagrams, medial axes, and generalized\nVoronoi diagrams whose sites are combinations of points, spheres and\nhalf-spaces. We describe the application of these results to algorithms for\ncomputing generalized Voronoi diagrams and find the complexity of these\nalgorithms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"d4P11YH3r9N2aY8U8hTlUQDcDpKvHxE3D15k5vYvd8o","pdfSize":"655890"}
