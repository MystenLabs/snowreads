Since the future scenario\nis unknown and the probabilities of individual prospective scenarios are\nambiguous, we adopt the smooth model of decision making under ambiguity\naversion of Klibanoff et al (2005), framing the optimal divestment decision as\nan optimal stopping problem with learning under ambiguity aversion. We then\nprove a minimax result reducing this problem to a series of standard optimal\nstopping problems with learning. The theory is illustrated with two examples:\nthe problem of optimally selling a stock with ambigous drift, and the problem\nof optimal divestment from a coal-fired power plant under transition scenario\nambiguity.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
