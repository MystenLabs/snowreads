It is well-established in\nthe research literature, and in practice, as an important problem in\ninformation security. A natural objective that has been explored in prior work\nis for the set of roles to be of minimum size. We address this problem for\npractical inputs while reconciling foundations, specifically, that the problem\nis \\cnph. We first observe that an approach from prior work that exploits a\nsufficient condition for an efficient algorithm, while a useful first step,\ndoes not scale to more recently proposed benchmark inputs. We propose a new\ntechnique: the enumeration of maximal bicliques. We point out that the number\nof maximal bicliques provides a natural measure of the hardness of an input. We\nleverage the enumeration of maximal bicliques in two different ways. Our first\napproach addresses more than half the benchmark inputs to yield exact results.\nThe other approach is needed for hard instances; in it, we identify and adopt\nas roles those that correspond to large maximal bicliques. We have implemented\nall our algorithms and carried out an extensive empirical assessment, which\nsuggests that our approaches are promising. Our code is available publicly as\nopen-source.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
