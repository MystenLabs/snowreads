It represents a first-order\nformulation possessing manifest diffeomorphism- and gauge-invariance. We make\nuse of an unfolding method that was recently put forward and used to unfold\nscalar electrodynamics. We also discuss features of various unfolding maps\ndefined by the unfolded equations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wDczeWvTjo80_EtREQ_KgRE59NcpVkJJbUliW-LLOEA","pdfSize":"173438"}
