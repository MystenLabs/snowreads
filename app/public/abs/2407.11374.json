We introduce a new method based on \\emph{splitting},\ntogether with a new combinatorial interpretation of some of the main tools from\nour earlier work. We also use splitting to prove the Coven-Meyerowitz\nconjecture for a new class of tilings $A\\oplus B=\\mathbb{Z}_M$. This includes\ntilings of period $M=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}p_3^{n_3}$ with\n$p_1>p_2^{n_2-1}p_3^{n_3-1}$, and tilings of period\n$M=p_1^{n_1}p_2^2p_3^2p_4^2$ with $p_1>p_2p_3p_4$, where $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$ are\ndistinct primes and $n_1,n_2,n_3\\in\\mathbb{N}$.\n  This is the second one of the two papers replacing version 1 of\narXiv:2207.11809 (the first one is available as arXiv:2207.11809 v2). The main\nresults of this paper (Theorem 1.2, Corollaries 1.4 and 1.5) and the\nintermediate results in Section 4.2 are all new and did not appear previously\nin arXiv:2207.11809 v1 or anywhere else. The material in Sections 3, 4.1, and 5\n(splitting and the splitting formulation of the slab reduction) did appear in\narXiv:2207.11809 v1 and has been removed from arXiv:2207.11809 v2. The results\nin Section 7 were included in arXiv:2207.11809 v1 and have been removed from\narXiv:2207.11809 v2; the proofs are shorter and (we hope) more readable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
