This is simply obtained by allowing for negative\ncoefficients in the classical variational characterization of Wasserstein\nbarycenters. We show that this problem admits two equivalent convex\nformulations: the first can be seen as a particular instance of Toland duality\nand the second is a barycentric optimal transport problem. We propose an\nefficient numerical scheme to solve this latter formulation based on entropic\nregularization and a variant of Sinkhorn algorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
