We show that R-continuity has some advantages in\nthe convergence rate analysis of algorithms solving optimization problems. We\nalso present some properties of R-continuity and study the explicit convergence\nrate of the Proximal Point Algorithm (PPA) under the R-continuity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
