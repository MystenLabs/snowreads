While the nanoparticles' motional\ntemperatures can be reduced to near absolute zero, their uncontrolled internal\ndegrees of freedom remain much hotter, inevitably leading to the emission of\nheat radiation. The decoherence and motional heating caused by this thermal\nemission process is still poorly understood beyond the case of the\ncenter-of-mass motion of point particles. Here, we present the master equation\ndescribing the impact of heat radiation on the motional quantum state of\narbitrarily sized and shaped dielectric rigid rotors. It predicts the\nlocalization of spatio-orientational superpositions only based on the bulk\nmaterial properties and the particle geometry. A counter-intuitive and\nexperimentally relevant implication of the presented theory is that\norientational superpositions of optically isotropic bodies are not protected by\ntheir symmetry, even in the small-particle limit.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
