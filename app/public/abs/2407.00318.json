It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate\nof dense chromomagnetic vortices representing a dual analog of the Cooper pairs\ncondensate in a superconductor. The solutions represent exact non-perturbative\nsolutions of the YM equation in the background chromomagnetic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
