More precisely, when a given Sturm-Liouville eigenvalue\nproblem with the unknown integrable potential interacts with $\\delta$-function\npotentials, we obtain a family of perturbation problems, called point\ninteraction models in quantum mechanics. Then, only depending on the first\neigenvalues of these perturbed problems, we define and study the first\neigenvalue function, by which the desired potential can be expressed explicitly\nand uniquely. As by-products, using the analytic function theoretic tools, we\nalso generalize several fundamental theorems of classical Sturm-Liouville\nproblems to measure differential equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
