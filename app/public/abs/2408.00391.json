This\nprovides a concrete realization, to first order in the deformation parameter\n$\\hbar$, of the abstract deformation quantization results in derived algebraic\ngeometry due to Calaque, Pantev, To\\\"en, Vaqui\\'e and Vezzosi. Of particular\ninterest is the case when $A$ is the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a higher\nLie algebra, where the braided monoidal deformations developed in this paper\nmay be interpreted as candidates for representation categories of `higher\nquantum groups'.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
