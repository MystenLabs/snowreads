Due to\nthis need, local filesystems are getting close attention to understand their\ninner workings, performance, and more importantly their limitations. This study\nanalyzes few popular Linux filesystems: EXT4, XFS, BtrFS, ZFS, and F2FS by\ncreating, storing, and then reading back one billion files from the local\nfilesystem. The study also captured and analyzed read/write throughput, storage\nblocks usage, disk space utilization and overheads, and other metrics useful\nfor system designers and integrators. Furthermore, the study explored other\nside effects such as filesystem performance degradation during and after these\nlarge numbers of files and folders are created.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"t9_4KOeOzEY-9_-ZLZlknh0iasMG0hAp_oa0pJy252s","pdfSize":"2433992"}
