We exploit the existence of a van Hove\nsingularity enforced by the nonsymmorphic symmetry to conduct a renormalization\ngroup analysis. When Fermi-surface nesting is strong, we find two\nclosely-competing superconducting states with opposite parities, as well as an\ninstability towards specific spin-density wave states, consistent with key\nfeatures of the phase diagram of CeRh$_2$As$_2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
