They may also exhibit\ncapabilities that may be applied defensively in a wide set of domains,\nincluding (but not limited to) developing societal resilience against AI\nthreats. We propose Coordinated Disclosure of Dual-Use Capabilities (CDDC) as a\nprocess to guide early information-sharing between advanced AI developers, US\ngovernment agencies, and other private sector actors about these capabilities.\nThe process centers around an information clearinghouse (the \"coordinator\")\nwhich receives evidence of dual-use capabilities from finders via mandatory\nand/or voluntary reporting pathways, and passes noteworthy reports to defenders\nfor follow-up (i.e., further analysis and response). This aims to provide the\nUS government, dual-use foundation model developers, and other actors with an\noverview of AI capabilities that could significantly impact public safety and\nsecurity, as well as maximal time to respond.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nfgc6G317L5Fe6tjgXqLWsqS2tTRn70Yi8X9GIA1tew","pdfSize":"4494729","objectId":"0x87c3ae86491e9ec135d7659a6ceaf7174bd07db73fb901bac11e1c5d0bae1773","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
