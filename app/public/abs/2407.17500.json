We obtain analytic relations for the spectrum, Fock space\nstates, and matrix elements of the coordinate, which are then used to\nnumerically calculate the OTOC. We observe that, after the scrambling, the OTOC\nsaturates to a constant value at later times, which is associated with quantum\nchaotic behavior in systems that exhibit chaos. We analyze the early-time\nproperties of OTOC and find that the exponential growth, which indicates chaos,\nis evident in the third-order perturbation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
