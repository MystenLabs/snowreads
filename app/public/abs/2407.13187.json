These tissue sheets can bend and buckle in the\nthird dimension. In this work, we investigated the growth of suspended and\nsupported tissue sheets using particle-based simulations. We combine\nparticle-based tissue growth and meshless membrane models to simulate the\ngrowth of tissue sheets with mechanical feedback. Free suspended growing\ntissues exhibit wrinkling when growth is sufficiently fast. Conversely, tissues\non a substrate form buds when the adhesion to the substrate is weak and/or when\nthe friction with the substrate is strong. These buds undergo a\nmembrane-mediated attraction and subsequently fuse. The complete detachment of\ntissues from the substrate and straight buckled bump formation are also\nobtained at very weak adhesion and/or fast growth rates. Tissue pores grow via\nOstwald ripening and coalescence. The reported dynamics can also be applied in\nresearch on the detachment dynamics of different tissues with weakened\nadhesion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qsb9p9NVXJhD9sbg2cEjinAOzw3Rpe6pupB8HvCct7w","pdfSize":"2360104"}
