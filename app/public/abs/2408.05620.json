Motivated by the fact that differential deep\nlearning can efficiently approximate the labels and their derivatives with\nrespect to inputs, we transform the BSDE problem into a differential deep\nlearning problem. This is done by leveraging Malliavin calculus, resulting in a\nsystem of BSDEs. The unknown solution of the BSDE system is a triple of\nprocesses $(Y, Z, \\Gamma)$, representing the solution, its gradient, and the\nHessian matrix. The main idea of our algorithm is to discretize the integrals\nusing the Euler-Maruyama method and approximate the unknown discrete solution\ntriple using three deep neural networks. The parameters of these networks are\nthen optimized by globally minimizing a differential learning loss function,\nwhich is novelty defined as a weighted sum of the dynamics of the discretized\nsystem of BSDEs. Through various high-dimensional examples, we demonstrate that\nour proposed scheme is more efficient in terms of accuracy and computation time\ncompared to other contemporary forward deep learning-based methodologies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
