We use this quantity to formulate\nan exact upper bound ${\\cal O}(L^{-5/2})$ on the gap of the Fredkin and Motzkin\nspin chains. Our results establish that transport in kinetically constrained\ndynamical systems with Fredkin or Motzkin constraints is subdiffusive, with\ndynamical exponent $z \\geq 5/2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
