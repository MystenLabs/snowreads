In this work, we propose a neurosymbolic\narchitecture for generating SQL queries that builds and explores a solution\ntree using Best-First Search, with the possibility of backtracking. For this\npurpose, it integrates a Language Model (LM) with symbolic modules that help\ncatch and correct errors made by the LM on SQL queries, as well as guiding the\nexploration of the solution tree. We focus on improving the performance of\nsmaller open-source LMs, and we find that our tool, Xander, increases accuracy\nby an average of 10.9% and reduces runtime by an average of 28% compared to the\nLM without Xander, enabling a smaller LM (with Xander) to outperform its\nfour-times larger counterpart (without Xander).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"p5BvqyY2BlePvjaAHLm-qmVU6UnkJ9X5AvfbWWFTdzs","pdfSize":"1588348"}
