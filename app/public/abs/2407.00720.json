A number of\nstrong restrictions are imposed such as flow-orthogonality of the spacetime\nfoliation, vanishing spatial Ricci tensor, dimensionally reduced and\ncoordinate-dependent velocity fields, to mention the main restrictions. We here\nprovide a brief summary of our proposal of a general and covariant description\nof spatial motions within General Relativity, then discuss the restrictions\nthat are employed in the majority of the current literature. That current warp\ndrive models are discussed to be unphysical may not be surprising; they lack\nimportant ingredients such as covariantly non-vanishing spatial velocity,\nacceleration, vorticity, together with curved space, and a warp mechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YWwRY22upKp3UHiUf51kJhHZMnVLWjpSnn3UvuQvs-s","pdfSize":"223094","objectId":"0x9bb4659535276170d74f72075e8a8bf610d1b0b1d790e837c3d95aded0b33bec","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
