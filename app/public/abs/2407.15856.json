They were found in 2001 by David Borwein and Jonathan\nBorwein and consist of a simple family of integrals involving the cardinal sine\nfunction ``sinc'', so that the first integrals are equal to $\\pi$ until,\nsuddenly, that pattern breaks. The classical explanation for this fact involves\nFourier Analysis techniques. In this paper, we show that it is possible to\nderive an explanation for this result by means of undergraduate Complex\nAnalysis tools; namely, residue theory. Besides, we show that this Complex\nAnalysis scope allows to go a beyond the classical result when studying these\nkind of integrals. Concretely, we show a new generalization for the classical\nBorwein result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dVfBsZrvAsDXCdl47koFXRw2l7CnxC3Qtt4ZOvP2qGo","pdfSize":"172643","objectId":"0x0424c4d2fd7a5ce9bb8a9bc35073b14813df92b6e047b0981559a449e37b1fa3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
