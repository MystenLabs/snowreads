But, similar with the\nBergman space $L^2_a(\\textbf{B}, dv)$ of the unit ball in $\\mathbb{C}^n$, we\nshow that the norm closure of $\\{T_f : f\\in L^{\\infty}(\\mathbb{D}, dv)\\}$ on\nBergman space $L^2_a(\\mathbb{D}, dv)$ of the ploydisk $\\mathbb{D}$ in\n$\\mathbb{C}^n$ actually coincides with the Toeplitz algebra\n$\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{D})$. A key ingredient in the proof is the class of\noperators $\\mathcal{D}$ recently introduced by Yi Wang and Jingbo Xia. In fact,\nas a by-product, we simultaneously proved that $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{D})$ also\ncoincides with $\\mathcal{D}$. Based on these results, we further proved that\nthe essential commutant of Toeplitz algebra $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{D})$ equals to\n$\\{T_g: g\\in VO_{bdd}\\} + \\mathcal{K}$ where $VO_{bdd}$ is the collection of\nfunctions of vanishing oscillation on polydisk $\\mathbb{D}$ and $\\mathcal{K}$\ndenotes the collection of compact operators on $L^2_a(\\mathbb{D}, dv)$. On the\nother hand, we also prove that the essential commutant of $\\{T_g: g\\in\nVO_{bdd}\\}$ is $\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{D})$, which implies that image of\n$\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{D})$ in the Calkin algebra satisfies the double commutant\nrelation: $\\pi(\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{D}))=\\pi(\\mathcal{T}(\\mathbb{D}))''$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
