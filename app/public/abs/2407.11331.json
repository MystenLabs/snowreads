Finally, we\nconfirm the conjectured equality cases of the Illumination Conjecture within\nthe subclass of 1-unconditional bodies which, just like the cube $[-1,1]^n$,\nhave no extreme points on coordinate subspaces.\n  Our methods are combinatorial, and the illuminating sets that we use consist\nprimarily of small perturbations of the standard basis vectors. In particular,\nwe build on ideas and constructions from [Sun-Vritsiou, \"On the illumination of\n1-symmetric convex bodies\", preprint available at arXiv:2407.10314], and mainly\non the notion of 'deep illumination' introduced there.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4Z5Zxu8DP7PBfOtgWo5ZVtv9zlGRz5xA5kMtdx2C6Gk","pdfSize":"601589","objectId":"0xbd5ac604c82a4587f9f14249590d919f7e0d32928b5244dd29b0fcd13a8bde72","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
