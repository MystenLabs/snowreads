Using a dataset of sarcastic\nutterances compiled from television shows, we analyze the prosodic features\nwithin utterances and key phrases belonging to three distinct sarcasm\ncategories (embedded, propositional, and illocutionary), which vary in the\ndegree of semantic cues present, and compare them to neutral expressions.\nResults show that in phrases where the sarcastic meaning is salient from the\nsemantics, the prosodic cues are less relevant than when the sarcastic meaning\nis not evident from the semantics, suggesting a trade-off between prosodic and\nsemantic cues of sarcasm at the phrase level. These findings highlight a\nlessened reliance on prosodic modulation in semantically dense sarcastic\nexpressions and a nuanced interaction that shapes the communication of\nsarcastic intent.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LO1T4ffphXNt2xU9LQHHGlV9S6hkqHGyLhQgZImOxwo","pdfSize":"288435"}
