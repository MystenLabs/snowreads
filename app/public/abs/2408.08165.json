Doignon (2023) presented a complete characterization of the\nbest-worst-choice polytope on four alternatives. Moreover, using polytope\nmethods he showed that the Block-Marschak inequalities for best-worst choices\nare not sufficient for a random utility representation of best-worst choices\nfor sets of four or more alternatives. Following the approach of Falmagne\n(1978), we construct a probability measure on the set of rankings for a set of\nfour alternatives implying a random utility representation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
