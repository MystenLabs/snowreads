One\nimportant such example is results depending on the Baire Category Theorem\n(BCT). We use the BCT to explore Lions problem for a quasi-Banach couple $(A_0,\nA_1)$. Lions problem, posed in 1960's, is to prove that different parameters\n$(\\theta,p)$ produce different interpolation spaces $(A_0, A_1)_{\\theta, p}$.\nWe first establish conditions on $A_0$ and $A_1$ so that interpolation spaces\nof this couple are strictly intermediate spaces between $A_0+A_1$ and $A_0\\cap\nA_1$. This result, together with a reiteration theorem, gives a partial\nsolution to Lions problem for quasi-Banach couples. We then apply our\ninterpolation result to (partially) answer a question posed by Pietsch. More\nprecisely, we show that if $p\\neq p^*$ the operator ideals\n$\\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$, $\\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p^*,q^*}(X,Y)$ generated by\napproximation numbers are distinct. Moreover, for any fixed $p$, either all\noperator ideals $\\mathcal{L}^{(a)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$ collapse into a unique space or\nthey are pairwise distinct. We cite counterexamples which show that using\ninterpolation spaces is not appropriate to solve Pietsch's problem for operator\nideals based on general $s$-numbers. However, the BCT can be used to prove a\nlethargy result for arbitrary $s$-numbers which guarantees that, under very\nminimal conditions on $X,Y$, the space $\\mathcal{L}^{(s)}_{p,q}(X,Y)$ is\nstrictly embedded into $\\mathcal{L}^{\\mathcal{A}}(X,Y)$. The paper is dedicated\nto the memory of Prof. A. Pietsch, who passed away recently.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
