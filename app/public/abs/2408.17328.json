The model uses a parameterisation of the charge excess emission\nto isolate the geomagnetic component. By fitting a one-dimensional lateral\ndistribution function to the geomagnetic energy fluence of a shower, we\nreconstruct its radiation energy. This work details the signal model and the\nintrinsic event reconstruction of our method, as well as the adaptations to the\nnew frequency band. This work is part of the NUTRIG project.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
