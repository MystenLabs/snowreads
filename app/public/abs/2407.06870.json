We exploit that the\nexponential decay rate $\\lambda_\\rho$ of that quantity, called the persistence\nexponent, is given by the leading eigenvalue of a concrete integral operator.\nThis makes it possible to study the problem with purely functional analytic\nmethods. In particular, using methods from perturbation theory, we show that\nthe persistence exponent $\\lambda_\\rho$ can be expressed as a power series in\n$\\rho$. Finally, we consider the persistence problem for the Slepian process,\ntransform it into the moving average setup, and show that our perturbation\nresults are applicable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
