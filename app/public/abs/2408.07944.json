Considering a data deficiency and constrained computational resource\nscenario, this paper proposes a novel parameter-efficient transfer learning\nframework for vision recognition models in the black-box setting. Our framework\nincorporates two novel training techniques. First, we align the input space\n(i.e., image) of PTMs to the target data distribution by generating visual\nprompts of spatial and frequency domain. Along with the novel spatial-frequency\nhybrid visual prompter, we design a novel training technique based on\nprobabilistic clusters, which can enhance class separation in the output space\n(i.e., prediction probabilities). In experiments, our model demonstrates\nsuperior performance in a few-shot transfer learning setting across extensive\nvisual recognition datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art baselines.\nAdditionally, we show that the proposed method efficiently reduces\ncomputational costs for training and inference phases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
