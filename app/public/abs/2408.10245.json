In this\npaper, we consider the maximal commutator of fractional maximal function\n$M_{b,\\alpha}$ and the nonlinear commutator of fractional maximal function $[b,\nM_{\\alpha}]$ on Lorentz spaces. We give some necessary and sufficient\nconditions for the boundedness of the commutators $M_{b,\\alpha}$ and $[b,\nM_{\\alpha}]$ on Lorentz spaces when the function $b$ belongs to BMO spaces, by\nwhich some new characterizations of certain subclasses of BMO spaces are\nobtained.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
