One of these areas is\nML-based near-real-time network management applications (xApps) in Open-Radio\nAccess Network (O-RAN). Normally, xApps are designed solely for the desired\nobjectives, and fine-tuned for deployment. However, telecommunication companies\ncan employ multiple xApps and deploy them in overlapping areas. Consider the\ndifferent design objectives of xApps, the deployment might cause conflicts. To\nprevent such conflicts, we proposed the xApp distillation method that distills\nknowledge from multiple xApps, then uses this knowledge to train a single model\nthat has retained the capabilities of Previous xApps. Performance evaluations\nshow that compared conflict mitigation schemes can cause up to six times more\nnetwork outages than xApp distillation in some cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
