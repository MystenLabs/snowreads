In ZIMS-VFD, the transceiver\ninserts a zero-interval for each symbol in the transmit signal and provides\nself-interference (SI)-free intervals for itself. Meanwhile, it samples the\nreceive signal in the provided SI-free intervals and restores the desired\nsymbols. Based on orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), we\nformulate the system model and show the transmit signal structure. Then, we\ngive the transceiver design for single input single output (SISO) ZIMS-VFD and\nextend it to multiple input multiple output (MIMO) communications. Numerical\nresults verify our theoretical analyses and show that ZIMS-VFD can effectively\nincrease the capacity and approach the FD without SI.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
