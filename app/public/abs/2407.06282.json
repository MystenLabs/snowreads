Specifically, efficiently solving the spectrum of\nthe Liouvillian superoperator governing such dynamics remains a critical open\nchallenge. Here, we put forward a method for solving the many-body Liouvillian\nspectrum and dynamics based on the non-Hermitian kernel polynomial method and\ntensor-network techniques. We demonstrate the faithfulness of our method by\ncomputing the dynamics of the dephasing quantum compass model with a gradient\nmagnetic field and comparing it with exact results. In particular, we show that\nour method allows us to characterize the quantum Zeno crossover and the\nreduction of relaxation rate due to Stark localization in this model. We\nfurther demonstrate the ability of our method to go beyond exact results by\nexploring nearest-neighbor interaction effects on the Liouvillian dynamics,\nelucidating the interplay between Stark localization and many-body\ninteractions. Our method provides an efficient solution to many-body\nLiouvillian spectrum and dynamics, establishing a methodology to explore large\nopen quantum many-body systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
