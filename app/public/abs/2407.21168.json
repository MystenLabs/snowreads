Concrete evidence of this prediction remains\nelusive, as Kuiper belt objects (KBOs) and Jupiter Trojans appear to have\ndifferent surface compositions. We address the long-standing question of Trojan\norigin by finding a dynamical sub-population in the Kuiper belt with\nTrojan-like colors. Combining existing photometric data with our own surveys on\nKeck I and Palomar P200, we find that the low-perihelion ($q<30 $AU, $a>30 $AU)\ncomponent of the Kuiper belt has colors that bifurcate similarly to the Jupiter\nTrojans, unlike Centaurs ($a<30 $AU) which have redder, Kuiper belt-like\ncolors. To connect the Jupiter Trojans to the Kuiper belt, we test whether the\ndistinct Trojan-like colors of low-perihelion KBOs result from surface\nprocessing, or are sourced from a specific population in the Kuiper belt. By\nsimulating the evolution of the Canada-France Ecliptic Plane Survey synthetic\npopulation of KBOs for four billion years, we find that differences in heating\ntimescales cannot result in a significant depletion of Very Red low-perihelion\nKBOs as compared to the Centaurs. We find that the neutrally-colored scattered\ndisk objects ($e>0.6$ KBOs) contribute more to the low-perihelion KBO\npopulation rather than Centaurs, resulting in their different colors.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
