We fit HI profiles with multi-component Gaussian functions and\ncalculate the redshift, width, flux density, optical depth, and HI column\ndensities for each source. Through spectral stacking, the mean peak optical\npath, mean velocity-integrated optical path $\\langle \\tau\\rangle$, mean FWHM\nand mean HI column density $\\langle$ N$_{HI}\\rangle$ are measured to be 0.46\nand 0.34; 25.85 km/s and 4.62 km/s; 39.80 km/s and 8.95 km/s; 0.470 and 0.085\nT$_{s} \\times$ 10$^{20}$cm$^{-2}$K$^{-1}$, for the associated and intervening\nsamples, respectively. Statistical analysis also reveals that associated\nsystems tend to be hosted by red (g$-$r$>$0.7) galaxies at lower redshifts,\nwhereas galaxies hosting intervening HI absorption are typically found at\nhigher redshifts and are of a bluer (g$-$r$\\leq$0.7) type. Additionally, it has\nbeen demonstrated that associated HI 21-cm absorptions connected to compact\nradio sources display higher N$_{HI}$ values compared to those linked with\nextended radio sources.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
