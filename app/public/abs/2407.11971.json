We carefully quantize simple two-derivative Carrollian\ntheories, revealing a strong sensitivity to the ultraviolet. They can be\nregulated upon being placed on a spatial lattice and working at finite inverse\ntemperature. Unlike in conventional field theories, the details of the\nlattice-regulated Carrollian theories remain important at long distances even\nin the limit that the lattice spacing is sent to zero. We use that limit to\ndefine interacting continuum models with a tractable perturbative expansion.\nThe ensuing theories are those of generalized free fields, with non-Gaussian\ncorrelations suppressed by positive powers of the lattice spacing, and an\nunbroken supertranslation symmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
