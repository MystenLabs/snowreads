In\nparticular, given a point $\\xi\\in \\partial D$ with finite dilation we show that\nthe $K$-limit of $f$ at $\\xi$ exists and is a point $\\eta\\in \\partial D'$, and\nwe obtain asymptotic estimates for all entries of the Jacobian matrix of the\ndifferential $df_z$ in terms of the multitypes at the points $\\xi$ and at\n$\\eta$. We introduce a generalization of Bracci-Patrizio-Trapani's pluricomplex\nPoisson kernel which, together with the dilation at $\\xi$, gives a formula for\nthe restricted $K$-limit of the normal component of the normal derivative\n$\\langle df_z(n_\\xi),n_\\eta\\rangle$. Our principal tools are methods from\nGromov hyperbolicity theory, a scaling in the normal direction, and the strong\nasymptoticity of complex geodesics. To obtain our main result we prove a\nconjecture by Abate on the Kobayashi type of a vector $v$, proving that it is\nequal to the reciprocal of the line type of $v$, and we give new extrinsic\ncharacterizations of both $K$-convergence and restricted convergence to a point\n$\\xi\\in \\partial D$ in terms of the multitype at $\\xi$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xxPpgvr36QEqxUQlVodBIhG0w_ghVtLwI40RqTXxBxA","pdfSize":"541587"}
