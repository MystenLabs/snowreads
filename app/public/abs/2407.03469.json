We propose a methodology to tackle the\nscalability challenges associated with the development of data-driven models\nfor BMS by using Large Language Models (LLMs). LLMs' code generation\nadaptability can enable broader adoption of BMS by \"automating the automation,\"\nparticularly the data handling and data-driven modeling processes. In this\npaper, we use LLMs to generate code that processes structured data from BMS and\nbuild data-driven models for BMS's specific requirements. This eliminates the\nneed for manual data and model development, reducing the time, effort, and cost\nassociated with this process. Our hypothesis is that LLMs can incorporate\ndomain knowledge about data science and BMS into data processing and modeling,\nensuring that the data-driven modeling is automated for specific requirements\nof different building types and control objectives, which also improves\naccuracy and scalability. We generate a prompt template following the framework\nof Machine Learning Operations so that the prompts are designed to\nsystematically generate Python code for data-driven modeling. Our case study\nindicates that bi-sequential prompting under the prompt template can achieve a\nhigh success rate of code generation and code accuracy, and significantly\nreduce human labor costs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
