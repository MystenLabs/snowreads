This is a natural extension to countable arities\nof Post's 1941 classification of all clones of finitary Boolean functions.\nEvery Borel clone restricts to a finitary clone, yielding a \"projection\" from\nthe lattice of all Borel clones to Post's lattice. It is well-known that each\nfinitary clone of affine mod 2 functions admits a unique extension to a Borel\nclone. We show that over each finitary clone containing either both $\\wedge,\n\\vee$, or the 2-out-of-3 median operation, there lie at least 2 but only\nfinitely many Borel clones. Over the remaining clones in Post's lattice, we\ngive only a partial classification of the Borel extensions, and present some\nevidence that the full structure may be quite complicated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
