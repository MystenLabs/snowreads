The search for the model substances has been continued for a\nlong time, and many candidate substances have been reported. Most of them are\nhydroxide minerals. Here, I review the static and dynamic properties of\nnon-mineral kagome-lattice antiferromagnets Cs$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$ and\nRb$_2$Cu$_3$SnF$_{12}$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
