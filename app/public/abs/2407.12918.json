In contrast, the Weyl superconductor (WSC) may display\nDirac-Landau levels in the presence of a vortex lattice. Here, we investigate\nthe Landau level (LL) structure and optical conductivity in the mixed state of\na generic WSC using a heterostructure model, where the tilt of the\nBogoliubov-Weyl (BW) cones can be tuned, yielding either type-I (undertilted)\nor type-II (overtilted) cones. We find that, in a magnetic field, the tilted\ntype-I BW cone in the mixed state may exhibit squeezed LLs with reduced\nspacings. On the other hand, the spectrum of type-II cones shows a dependence\non the angle between the magnetic field and the tilt direction; LL quantization\nis only possible if the angle is below a critical value. For zero tilt, the\noptical conductivity in the mixed state of the WSC shows peaks only at photon\nfrequencies $\\omega_n \\propto \\sqrt{n}+\\sqrt{n+1}$, with a linear background.\nHowever, the tilt of BW cones results in the emergence of optical transitions\nbeyond the usual dipolar ones. For type-II BW cones, unique intraband\ntransition conductivity peaks emerge at low frequency, which can serve as an\nindicator to distinguish between type-I and type-II BW cones in WSCs.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
