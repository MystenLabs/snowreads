Existing models includesuperposition of single drops, numerical\nmodels, and graphic-based model. They are either too complicated or over\nsimplified.Graphic model intends to find a sweet spot in between, however,\naccuracy is marginally improved from superposition modelwhile it demands more\ncomputation. The proposed model aimsto achieve the same as graphic model by\nintroducing volumeand area propagation matrices to reflect the localized ink\nflowfrom higher location to the lower, while avoiding the detailedphysics\nbehind it. This model assumes a constant volume andarea propagation of\nsubsequent drop due to height profile difference. It is validated with\nexperiments on single drop, 2-drop and 3-drop line printing. Stability of this\nmodel is analyzed.. Usingroot mean square (RMS) error as benchmark, proposed\nmodelachieves 6.6% along the center row and 7.4% overall, better thanexisting\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
