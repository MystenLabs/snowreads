In this work, a study of CP violation\nis carried out analysing the phenomenology of charm decays. The study of such\ntopic is guided by the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix and the process\nof flavour changing decays caused by the weak interaction (focusing on charm\ndecays). The symmetries attributed to physical conservation laws were\nrecognized, allowing for the possibilities of CP violation predicted by the SM\nto be examined more closely. Such theoretical studies are then compared to the\nresults obtained by the LHCb Collaboration. Furthermore, a comparison between\nCPV in charm decays and in neutrino oscillations is made, analysing the CP\nviolating phase in both the CKM and the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)\nmatrices.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"biSZl8Vu2pUDNYreRzXkw4hgdR_Hm98OZwLhMwzXOzo","pdfSize":"767346"}
