The object of our study is the positivity of Lebesgue measure\nand the existence of interior points in these random sets and in particular the\nexistence of an interesting parameter interval where the attractor has positive\nLebesgue measure, but empty interior almost surely conditioned on the attractor\nnot being empty. We give a sharp bound on the critical probability for the case\nof positivity Lebesgue measure using the theory of multitype branching\nprocesses in random environments and in some special cases on the critical\nprobability for the existence of interior points. Using a recent result of Tom\nRush, we provide a family of such random sets where there exists a parameter\ninterval for which the corresponding attractor has a positive Lebesgue measure,\nbut empty interior almost surely conditioned on the attractor not being empty.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
