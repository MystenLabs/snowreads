Such modulation can come from different sources\nand can impact qubit stability. We show that the modulation leads to very sharp\npeaks in the power spectrum of outcomes of periodically repeated Ramsey\nmeasurements. The positions and shapes of the peaks allow finding both the\nfrequency and the amplitude of the modulation. We also explore how additional\nslow fluctuations of the qubit frequency and fluctuations of the modulation\nfrequency affect the spectrum. The analytical results are in excellent\nagreement with extensive simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
