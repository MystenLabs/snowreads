All subclasses of such spacetimes are\nanalyzed. It is shown that the scalar field solutions generically divide into\ntwo branches, of which one has a strikingly different behavior from that of the\nstandard conformal case. The scalar field contributes to the equation satisfied\nby the wave profile function by adding new singular terms. Closed form and mode\nsolutions for the wave profile function are found for different scenarios. The\nresulting energy-momentum tensor has a null eigenvector, but is more general\nthan the pure radiation type usually coupled with this kind of spacetimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
