There are\nnumerous techniques of the command-line obfuscation, all designed to alter the\ncommand-line syntax without affecting its original functionality. This\nvariability forces most security solutions to create an exhaustive enumeration\nof signatures for even a single pattern. In contrast to using signatures, we\nhave implemented a scalable NLP-based detection method that leverages a\ncustom-trained, small transformer language model that can be applied to any\nsource of execution logs. The evaluation on top of real-world telemetry\ndemonstrates that our approach yields high-precision detections even on\nhigh-volume telemetry from a diverse set of environments spanning from\nuniversities and businesses to healthcare or finance. The practical value is\ndemonstrated in a case study of real-world samples detected by our model. We\nshow the model's superiority to signatures on established malware known to\nemploy obfuscation and showcase previously unseen obfuscated samples detected\nby our model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GVjnP-snds2pc_Gbfa1ChP4oowZJMJ_v1QbC4QVjfCM","pdfSize":"718528","txDigest":"3UfBN6j2LjhqiSXtPP5mvoysJPY4gHjVKFQZfPxrDgSV","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
