This question\nis related with limit theorems for non-stationary Birkhoff integrals. We\ndistinguish two settings with different behaviour: the integrable setting (no\naveraging phenomenon) and the case of an additive \"centered\" perturbation term\n(averaging phenomenon). The paper is motivated by the case where the\nperturbation comes from the Z-periodic Lorentz gas flow or from the geodesic\nflow over a Z-cover of a negatively curved compact surface. We establish limit\ntheorems in more general contexts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
