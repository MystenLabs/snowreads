In this paper, we propose a novel integrated\napproach to solve both the DA problem and the batch SLAM problem\nsimultaneously, combining random finite set (RFS) theory and the graph-based\nSLAM approach. A sampling method based on the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture\n(PMBM) density is designed for dealing with the DA uncertainty, and a\ngraph-based SLAM solver is applied for the conditional SLAM problem. In the\nend, a post-processing approach is applied to merge SLAM results from different\niterations. Using synthetic data, it is demonstrated that the proposed SLAM\napproach achieves performance close to the posterior Cram\\'er-Rao bound, and\noutperforms state-of-the-art RFS-based SLAM filters in high clutter and high\nprocess noise scenarios.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dFoQk_G7tYfp9TNAHpY7DO2LvydRxDY9xXC0I4ZuF68","pdfSize":"1065854"}
