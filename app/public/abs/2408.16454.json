We show that the minimizer $\\rho_{c}$ of\nChandrasekhar energy $E_c(N)$ converges strongly to the minimizer\n$\\rho_{\\infty}$ of limit energy $E_{\\infty}(N)$ in $L^1\\cap\nL^{\\frac{5}{3}}(\\mathbb{R}^3)$ as the speed of light $c\\rightarrow\\infty$, this\nis a limit between two free boundary problems. We develop a novel approach to\nobtain the convergence rates. For the radius $R_c$ of the compact support of\n$\\rho_c(x)$ and the radius $R_\\infty$ of the compact support of\n$\\rho_\\infty(x)$, we prove that $|R_c-R_\\infty|\\leq O(\\frac{1}{c^2})$ as\n$c\\rightarrow\\infty$. Moreover, we show that the $L^\\infty$-convergence rate of\n$|\\rho_c-\\rho_\\infty|$ is not bigger than $O(\\frac{1}{c^3})$ in the corner\nlayer $B(R_\\infty +\\frac{K_1}{c^2})\\setminus B(R_\\infty -\\frac{K_1}{c^2})\\,\n(K_1>0)$, while $L^\\infty$-convergence rate of $|\\rho_c-\\rho_\\infty|$ is not\nbigger than $O(\\frac{1}{c^2})$ inside the corner layer $B(R_\\infty\n-\\frac{K_1}{c^2})$ for $N$ large enough.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
