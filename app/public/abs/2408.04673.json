The FAIR principles emerge as a guiding\nstandard, aiming to enhance the findability, accessibility, interoperability,\nand reusability of data. However, current efforts primarily focus on manual\ndata FAIRification, which can only handle targeted data and lack efficiency. To\naddress this issue, we propose AutoFAIR, an architecture designed to enhance\ndata FAIRness automately. Firstly, We align each data and metadata operation\nwith specific FAIR indicators to guide machine-executable actions. Then, We\nutilize Web Reader to automatically extract metadata based on language models,\neven in the absence of structured data webpage schemas. Subsequently, FAIR\nAlignment is employed to make metadata comply with FAIR principles by ontology\nguidance and semantic matching. Finally, by applying AutoFAIR to various data,\nespecially in the field of mountain hazards, we observe significant\nimprovements in findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability\nof data. The FAIRness scores before and after applying AutoFAIR indicate\nenhanced data value.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lfNy3pZP7SKusAUv6yipR8uULjdbowexeSzYEdcJtRU","pdfSize":"2015301"}
