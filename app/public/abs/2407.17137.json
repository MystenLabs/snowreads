This study elucidates the properties of\nelectrostatic and electromagnetic instabilities, exploring their role over the\ntransrelativistic range. Notably, the growth of oblique Buneman waves and\npreviously overlooked, secondary small-scale ion-electron instabilities is\nobserved to be particularly promoted in the relativistic regime. Furthermore,\nthe growth of large-scale electromagnetic modes encounters severe limitations\nin any cold, baryon-loaded precursor. It is argued that electron pre-heating in\nelectrostatic modes may alleviate these constraints, facilitating the\nsubsequent growth of large-scale filamentation modes in the precursor of\ntransrelativistic shocks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xURbtUloy3PZjSJkzVMPPt84P5MmXwZHfzsajy7o0yc","pdfSize":"1973236","objectId":"0xc843c8332644d26a3fb2e7f069ce0fee2f3c715d8eaebcfeaad3760adcc09444","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
