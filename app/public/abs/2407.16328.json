However, conventional MP methods\ntypically employ generic quality metrics, neglecting individual user\npreferences. This study proposes a new framework that tailors MP techniques\nbased on user-specific quality criteria, enhancing projection interpretability.\n  Our approach combines three visual quality metrics, stress, neighborhood\npreservation, and silhouette score, to create a composite metric for a precise\nMP evaluation. We then optimize the projection scale by maximizing the\ncomposite metric value. We conducted an experiment involving two users with\ndifferent projection preferences, generating projections using t-SNE, UMAP, and\nLAMP. Users rate projections according to their criteria, producing two\ntraining sets. We derive optimal weights for each set and apply them to other\ndatasets to determine the best projections per user.\n  Our findings demonstrate that personalized projections effectively capture\nuser preferences, fostering better data exploration and enabling more informed\ndecision-making. This user-centric approach promotes advancements in\nmultidimensional projection techniques that accommodate diverse user\npreferences and enhance interpretability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
