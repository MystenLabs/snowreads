Although more shots improve the accuracy of the\nexpected ground state, it also increases the simulation cost. Hence, we propose\nmodifications to the standard Bayesian optimization algorithm to leverage\nfew-shot circuit observations to solve VQEs with fewer quantum resources. We\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach, Bayesian optimization\nwith priors on surface topology (BOPT), by comparing optimizers for molecular\nsystems and demonstrate how current quantum hardware can aid in finding ground\nstate energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
