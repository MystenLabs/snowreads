In this\npaper, we focus on assessing the role of lexical semantics in cross-lingual\ntransfer, as we compare its impact to that of other language properties.\nExamining each language property individually, we systematically analyze how\ndifferences between English and a target language influence the capacity to\nalign the language with an English pretrained representation space. We do so by\nartificially manipulating the English sentences in ways that mimic specific\ncharacteristics of the target language, and reporting the effect of each\nmanipulation on the quality of alignment with the representation space. We show\nthat while properties such as the script or word order only have a limited\nimpact on alignment quality, the degree of lexical matching between the two\nlanguages, which we define using a measure of translation entropy, greatly\naffects it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
