In\nprinciple, this formulation generalizes to orthogonal groups and preserves\nequivariance regardless of the metric signature. However, previous works have\nrestricted internal network representations to Euclidean or Minkowski\n(pseudo-)metrics, handpicked depending on the problem at hand. In this work, we\npropose an alternative method that enables the metric to be learned in a\ndata-driven fashion, allowing the CGENN network to learn more flexible\nrepresentations. Specifically, we populate metric matrices fully, ensuring they\nare symmetric by construction, and leverage eigenvalue decomposition to\nintegrate this additional learnable component into the original CGENN\nformulation in a principled manner. Additionally, we motivate our method using\ninsights from category theory, which enables us to explain Clifford algebras as\na categorical construction and guarantee the mathematical soundness of our\napproach. We validate our method in various tasks and showcase the advantages\nof learning more flexible latent metric representations.
