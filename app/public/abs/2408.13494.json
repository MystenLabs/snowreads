The \\emph{$\\gp $-chromatic number} is the smallest number of colours\nneeded to colour $V(G)$ such that each colour class has the no-three-in-line\nproperty. We determine bounds on this colouring number in terms of the\ndiameter, general position number, size, chromatic number, cochromatic number\nand total domination number and prove realisation results. We also determine it\nfor several graph classes, including Kneser graphs $K(n,2)$, line graphs of\ncomplete graphs, complete multipartite graphs, block graphs and Cartesian\nproducts. We also show that the $\\gp $-colouring problem is NP-complete.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
