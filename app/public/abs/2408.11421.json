Those sources include blazars, start-forming galaxies and radio\ngalaxies. Also, ultra-high-energy cosmic rays interacting with the infrared\nbackground, contribute to the isotropic background. Using information from\nFermi's gamma-ray sources catalog and the results of dedicated studies of these\nclasses of sources, from observations at the infrared and radio, we model their\ncontribution to the IGRB. In addition to conventional astrophysical sources,\ndark matter may be a component of the IGRB. We combine our model of\nconventional astrophysical sources and of dark matter annihilation in distant\ngalaxies, marginalizing over relevant uncertainties, to derive constraints on\nthe dark matter annihilation cross section, from the measured IGRB. In\ncalculating the contribution from dark matter we include the flux from\nextragalactic halos and their substructure and also the subdominant\ncontribution from Milky Way's halo at high galactic latitudes. The resulting\nconstraints are competitive with the strongest current constraints from the\ndwarf spheroidal galaxies. Under certain dark matter assumptions, we also find\nan indication for a small excess flux in the isotropic background. Our results\nare consistent with the gamma-ray excess at GeV energies toward the galactic\ncenter.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
