Two common approaches to adaptation are per-title encoding and\nper-shot encoding. The former involves encoding each program, movie, or other\ncontent in a manner that is perceptually- and bandwidth-optimized for that\ncontent but is otherwise fixed. The latter is a more granular approach that\noptimizes the encoding parameters for each scene or shot (however defined) of a\nvideo content. Per-shot video encoding, as pioneered by Netflix, encodes on a\nper-shot basis using the Dynamic Optimizer (DO). Under the control of the VMAF\nperceptual video quality prediction engine, the DO delivers high-quality videos\nto millions of viewers at considerably reduced bitrates than per-title or fixed\nbitrate ladder encoding. A variety of per-title and per-shot encoding\ntechniques have been recently proposed that seek to reduce computational\noverhead and to construct optimal bitrate ladders more efficiently using\nlow-level features extracted from source videos. Here we develop a perceptually\noptimized method of constructing optimal per-shot bitrate and quality ladders,\nusing an ensemble of low-level features and Visual Information Fidelity (VIF)\nfeatures extracted from different scales and subbands. We compare the\nperformance of our model, which we call VIF-ladder, against other\ncontent-adaptive bitrate ladder prediction methods, counterparts of them that\nwe designed to construct quality ladders, a fixed bitrate ladder, and bitrate\nladders constructed via exhaustive encoding using Bjontegaard delta metrics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2on9U-Qdz5a4QOzEx6rQcSFuQSs2JwgNxvV0tAAVTow","pdfSize":"23773676","txDigest":"AXN2MPPU73SKjg8RtjHSeerizp3NURGgcv6JoE5myFDv","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
