Instead\nof taking a normative approach, which guides all situations, the paper proposes\na risk-driven questions-and-answer approach. The paper takes the position that\nthis is a pragmatic method, that is transparent about beneficial intentions,\nforeseeable risks, and mitigations. Given the uncertainty in AI and autonomous\nagent capabilities, we believe that such pragmatic methods offer a plausibly\nsafe path, without sacrificing flexibility in domain and technology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OfIAGL6Zs4ymVP9RgoUmRYJ1UijQTNZNLLrBUUG5epk","pdfSize":"200529"}
