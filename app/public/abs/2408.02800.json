I. Goldberg and K. Yano in 1970, presents a compelling area with\nwide-ranging applications. The exploration of golden Riemannian manifolds was\ninitiated by C. E. Hretcanu and M. Crasmareanu in 2008, following the\nprinciples of the golden structure. Subsequently, numerous researchers have\ncontributed significant insights into golden Riemannian manifolds. The purpose\nof this paper is to provide a comprehensive survey on golden Riemannian\nmanifold done over the past decade.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GoYKP7ihnD3kDM4Stg8rUKAeJS26l0qhPac9kbIMk5E","pdfSize":"612414"}
