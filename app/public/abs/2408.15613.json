For each system, we\nestablish duality relations through an analytical approach. As an application,\nwe provide a new expression of the correlation functions for the steady state\nof the finite volume DCP and GDCP in contact with boundary reservoirs. We\nexplicitly compute the one point correlation function of the steady state of a\nsmall sized DCP, and for arbitrary size in a particular setting of the GDCP.\nFor the infinite SIR model, the duality relation obtained yields an explicit\nexpression of the time evolution of some specific correlation functions,\ndescribing the time decay of the sizes of chains of susceptible individuals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
