In the interstellar medium (ISM), ethylene\nglycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$) is the simplest sugar alcohol molecule, and it is\nthe reduced alcohol of the simplest sugar-like molecule, glycolaldehyde\n(CH$_{2}$OHCHO). We present the first detection of the rotational emission\nlines of $aGg^{\\prime}$ conformer of ethylene glycol ((CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$)\ntowards the hot molecular core G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 using the Atacama Large\nMillimeter/Submillimeter Array (ALMA). The estimated column density of\n$aGg^{\\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the G358.93$-$0.03 MM1 is\n(4.5$\\pm$0.1)$\\times$10$^{16}$ cm$^{-2}$ with an excitation temperature of\n155$\\pm$35 K. The abundance of $aGg^{\\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect\nto H$_{2}$ is (1.4$\\pm$0.5)$\\times$10$^{-8}$. Similarly, the abundances of\n$aGg^{\\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with respect to CH$_{2}$OHCHO and CH$_{3}$OH\nare 3.1$\\pm$0.5 and (6.1$\\pm$0.3)$\\times$10$^{-3}$. We compare the estimated\nabundance of $aGg^{\\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ with the existing three-phase\nwarm-up chemical model abundance of (CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$, and we notice the\nobserved abundance and modelled abundance are nearly similar. We discuss the\npossible formation pathways of $aGg^{\\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ towards the\nhot molecular cores, and we find that $aGg^{\\prime}$-(CH$_{2}$OH)$_{2}$ is\nprobably created via the recombination of two CH$_{2}$OH radicals on the grain\nsurface of G358.93$-$0.03 MM1.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
