Here we provide a full quantum\nmechanical evaluation of the orbital current, including all matrix elements of\nthe position operator. We recover previous results and find an additional\nquantum correction due to the non-commutativity of the position and velocity\noperators. We evaluate the full OHE for the topological antiferromagnet CuMnAs\nshowing that the quantum correction dominates the response and changes its\nsign. We discuss implications for experiment.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
