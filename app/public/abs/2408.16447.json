Several mechanisms are proposed to understand this\nphenomenon. New measurements by the LHCb and ALICE experiments show a similar\nenhancement in the beauty sector. We explore this enhancement in terms of event\nactivity using the color-reconnection beyond leading order approximation model.\nWe propose sensitive probes relying on the event shape that will allow for the\ndifferentiation between the proposed beauty-production scenarios using freshly\ncollected LHC Run-3 data, and we also compare these to predictions for charm.\nOur results will contribute to a deeper theoretical understanding of the\nheavy-flavor baryon enhancement and its relation to baryon enhancement in\ngeneral.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
