In this paper, we propose an approach to\nthe design of the transmitter and the receiver of a coherent FDA (C-FDA) radar,\nthat enables it to perform the demodulation with spectral overlapping, due to\nthe small frequency offset. To this purpose, we derive the generalized\nspace-time-range signal model and we prove that the proposed C-FDA radar has a\nhigher coherent array gain than a PA radar, and at the same time, it\neffectively resolves the secondary range-ambiguous (SRA) problem of FDA-MIMO\nradar, allowing for mainlobe interference suppression and range-ambiguous\nclutter suppression. Numerical analysis results prove the effectiveness of the\nproposed C-FDA radar in terms on anti-interference and anti-clutter\ncapabilities over conventional radars.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
