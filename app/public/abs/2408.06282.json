Let\n$\\mathcal{C}_{(q, n, \\delta, h)}$ be a class of BCH codes of length $n$ and\ndesigned $\\delta$. A linear code $\\mathcal{C}$ is said to be maximum distance\nseparable (MDS) if the minimum distance $d=n-k+1$. If $d=n-k$, then\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is called an almost MDS (AMDS) code. Moreover, if both of\n$\\mathcal{C}$ and its dual code $\\mathcal{C}^{\\bot}$ are AMDS, then\n$\\mathcal{C}$ is called a near MDS (NMDS) code. In [A class of almost MDS\ncodes, {\\it Finite Fields Appl.} {\\bf 79} (2022), \\#101996], Geng, Yang, Zhang\nand Zhou proved that the BCH code $\\mathcal{C}_{(q, q+1,3,4)}$ is an almost MDS\ncode, where $q=3^m$ and $m$ is an odd integer, and they also showed that its\nparameters is $[q+1, q-3, 4]$. Furthermore, they proposed a conjecture stating\nthat the dual code $\\mathcal{C}^{\\bot}_{(q, q+1, 3, 4)}$ is also an AMDS code\nwith parameters $[q+1, 4, q-3]$. In this paper, we first present a\ncharacterization for the dual code of an almost MDS code to be an almost MDS\ncode. Then we use this result to show that the Geng-Yang-Zhang-Zhou conjecture\nis true. Our result together with the Geng-Yang-Zhang-Zhou theorem implies that\nthe BCH code $\\mathcal{C}_{(q, q+1,3,4)}$ is a near MDS code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
