We\nintroduce the MPDMP matrix associated with $A$ and by means of it, some\nproperties and equivalent conditions of core-EP matrices can be obtained. Also,\nproperties of MPD, DMP, and CMP inverses are studied and we prove that in the\nclass of core-EP matrices, DMP, MPD, and Drazin inverses are the same.\nMoreover, DMP and MPD binary relation orders are introduced and the\nrelationship between these orders and other binary relation orders are\nconsidered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HuRoFapElIXDFXFiKlltUdjKiAsoPgnHmWJAqFG17aE","pdfSize":"219798"}
