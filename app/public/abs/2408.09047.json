Our goal of this paper is to extend this\nclassical result to nonzero sum games, which typically have multiple Nash\nequilibria and multiple values. Our object is the set value of the game, which\nroughly speaking is the set of values over all equilibria and thus is by nature\nunique. We shall introduce set valued Hamiltonians and characterize the set\nvalue of the game through backward SDEs driven by appropriate selectors of the\nset valued Hamiltonians, where the selectors are typically path dependent. When\nthe set valued Hamiltonian is a singleton, our result covers the standard\ncontrol problem and two person zero sum game problem under Isaacs condition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
