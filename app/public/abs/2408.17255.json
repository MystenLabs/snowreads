However, for many properties of interest, the number of materials for\nwhich a specific property has been determined is much smaller than the number\nof known materials. To overcome this disparity, we propose a novel\nself-supervised learning (SSL) strategy for material property prediction. Our\napproach, crystal denoising self-supervised learning (CDSSL), pretrains\npredictive models (e.g., graph networks) with a pretext task based on\nrecovering valid material structures when given perturbed versions of these\nstructures. We demonstrate that CDSSL models out-perform models trained without\nSSL, across material types, properties, and dataset sizes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
