But can they perform emotional reasoning by concatenating\n`Let's think step-by-step' to the input prompt? In this paper we investigate\nthis question along with introducing a novel approach to zero-shot emotion\ndetection and emotional reasoning using LLMs. Existing state of the art\nzero-shot approaches rely on textual entailment models to choose the most\nappropriate emotion label for an input text. We argue that this strongly\nrestricts the model to a fixed set of labels which may not be suitable or\nsufficient for many applications where emotion analysis is required. Instead,\nwe propose framing the problem of emotion analysis as a generative\nquestion-answering (QA) task. Our approach uses a two step methodology of\ngenerating relevant context or background knowledge to answer the emotion\ndetection question step-by-step. Our paper is the first work on using a\ngenerative approach to jointly address the tasks of emotion detection and\nemotional reasoning for texts. We evaluate our approach on two popular emotion\ndetection datasets and also release the fine-grained emotion labels and\nexplanations for further training and fine-tuning of emotional reasoning\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"soZ8b_VIMisV7j0VWa4ay1RCBvM5YllKJ5j5HghjVEc","pdfSize":"734484"}
