Traditional quantum compilation optimizes circuits for a single\ntarget. However, many quantum systems require simultaneous optimization of\nmultiple targets, such as simulating systems with varying parameters and\npreparing multi-component quantum states. To address this, we develop a\nmulti-target quantum compilation algorithm to enhance the performance and\nflexibility of simulating multiple quantum systems. Through our benchmarks and\ncase studies, we demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness, highlighting the\nsignificance of multi-target optimization in the advancement of quantum\ncomputing. This work establishes the groundwork for further development,\nimplementation, and evaluation of multi-target quantum compilation algorithms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mP1Knu3x_XPL1UXIqDuQk6w63fJQqahIyUJ9n6ba6aM","pdfSize":"1899123"}
