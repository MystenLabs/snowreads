This oscillator measures the\ntrending behavior of a fixed market instrument based on its past history. It is\nshown in an empirical analysis of the German DAX and the Forex EUR/USD exchange\nrate that a simple trading strategy based on this oscillator and fixed\nthreshold leads to consistent positive monthly returns of average magnitude of\n2% or more. The oscillator is derived from a broader understanding of the\ngeometric behavior of prices throughout a fixed period, which we term financial\nmarket geometry. The remarkable profit results of the presented technique show\nthat 1) prices of financial market instruments have a strong underlying\ndeterministic component which can be detected and quantified with a matching\napproach and 2) financial market geometry is capable of providing such\ndetectors.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Trading and Market Microstructure"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
