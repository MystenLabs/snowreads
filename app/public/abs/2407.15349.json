In this\npaper, we present RoadPainter, an innovative approach for detecting and\nreasoning the topology of lane centerlines using multi-view images. The core\nconcept behind RoadPainter is to extract a set of points from each centerline\nmask to improve the accuracy of centerline prediction. We start by implementing\na transformer decoder that integrates a hybrid attention mechanism and a\nreal-virtual separation strategy to predict coarse lane centerlines and\nestablish topological associations. Then, we generate centerline instance masks\nguided by the centerline points from the transformer decoder. Moreover, we\nderive an additional set of points from each mask and combine them with\npreviously detected centerline points for further refinement. Additionally, we\nintroduce an optional module that incorporates a Standard Definition (SD) map\nto further optimize centerline detection and enhance topological reasoning\nperformance. Experimental evaluations on the OpenLane-V2 dataset demonstrate\nthe state-of-the-art performance of RoadPainter.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
