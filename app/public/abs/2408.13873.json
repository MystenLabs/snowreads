Every sub-Riemannian manifold possesses a Hamiltonian\nfunction governing the sub-Riemannian geodesic flow. Two natural questions are:\nWhat are the necessary conditions for periodic sub-Riemannian geodesics? What\ngeodesics are the metric lines in SE(2)? We answer both questions, and our\nmethod for the second is an alternative proof using the Hamilton-Jacobi theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
