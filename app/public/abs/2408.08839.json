In particular, no\nspinors are allowed for the complex case. When a spin$^{h}$ structure is\nimplemented on principal bundles in complex spacetime, one is naturally led to\nan algebraic structure analogous to the one of the standard model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zlHnURnm0ye2-2qeql8Nij2nlf0_LPLvpQOl24flGsY","pdfSize":"107164"}
