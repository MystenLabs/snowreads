{"id":"2407.10452","title":"GraphPrint: Extracting Features from 3D Protein Structure for Drug\n  Target Affinity Prediction","authors":"Amritpal Singh","authorsParsed":[["Singh","Amritpal",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 15 Jul 2024 05:45:09 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-16","timestamp":1721022309000,"abstract":"  Accurate drug target affinity prediction can improve drug candidate\nselection, accelerate the drug discovery process, and reduce drug production\ncosts. Previous work focused on traditional fingerprints or used features\nextracted based on the amino acid sequence in the protein, ignoring its 3D\nstructure which affects its binding affinity. In this work, we propose\nGraphPrint: a framework for incorporating 3D protein structure features for\ndrug target affinity prediction. We generate graph representations for protein\n3D structures using amino acid residue location coordinates and combine them\nwith drug graph representation and traditional features to jointly learn drug\ntarget affinity. Our model achieves a mean square error of 0.1378 and a\nconcordance index of 0.8929 on the KIBA dataset and improves over using\ntraditional protein features alone. Our ablation study shows that the 3D\nprotein structure-based features provide information complementary to\ntraditional features.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
