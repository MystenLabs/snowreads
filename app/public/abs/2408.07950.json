In this work, we extend this result to domains with curved\nboundaries.\n  Under mild geometric assumptions, we prove that the edge conductance of a\ntopological insulator sample is an integer multiple of its Hall conductance.\nThis integer counts the algebraic number of times that the interface (suitably\noriented) enters the measurement set. This result provides a rigorous proof of\na well-known experimental observation: arbitrarily truncated topological\ninsulators support edge currents, regardless of the shape of their boundary.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
