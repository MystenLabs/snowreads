And we give\nthe proof of the Kastler-Kalau-Walze type theorem for the rescaled Dirac\noperator fDh on 6-dimensional compact manifolds with boundary. We also give\nsome important special cases which can be solved by our calculation methods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
