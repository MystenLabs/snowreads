The result follows from a version of\nEckmann-Hilton argument that takes into account both connectivity and arity of\n$\\infty$-operads. Along the way, we prove a technical Blakers-Massey type\nstatement for algebras of coherent $\\infty$-operads.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
