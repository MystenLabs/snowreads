With the increasing complexity and diversity of\napplications, the need for efficient and scalable data collection and labeling\ntechniques has become paramount. This paper provides a review of the\nstate-of-the-art methods in data collection, data labeling, and the improvement\nof existing data and models. By integrating perspectives from both the machine\nlearning and data management communities, we aim to provide a holistic view of\nthe current landscape and identify future research directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
