We show that\na rapid judiciously-designed temporal modulation of the refractive index in a\nspatially homogenous medium gives rise to a bound state in time embedded in a\ncontinuum of wavenumbers. Mathematically, these bound states in the continuum\n(BIC) are analytic solutions of the Maxwell equations in time and\none-dimensional space. Our results show the potential to extend known wave\nphenomena in space to the temporal domain, providing new avenues for\nlight-matter interactions in time-varying media.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
