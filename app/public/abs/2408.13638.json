Utilizing Wald's formalism within the\nframework of $f(R)$ modified theories of gravity, we evaluate the entropy on\nthe black hole horizon for constant curvature solutions to the spherically\nsymmetric vacuum field equations. In so doing, we demonstrate that the Tsallis\nentropy can be effectively derived from a generalization of the Lagrangian\n$\\mathcal{L}\\propto R^{1+\\epsilon}$, where $\\epsilon=\\delta-1$ quantifies small\ndeviations from general relativity. In conclusion, we examine the physical\nimplications of our findings in light of cosmological observations and\nelaborate on the possibility of solving the thermodynamic instability of\nSchwarzschild black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
