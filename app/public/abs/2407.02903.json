One such task is data\nanalysis, which is notoriously challenging for non-expert end-users due to its\nexpertise requirements, and where AI holds much potential, such as finding\nrelevant data sources, proposing analysis strategies, and writing analysis\ncode. To understand how data analysis workflows can be assisted or impaired by\ngenerative AI, we conducted a study (n=15) using Bing Chat via participatory\nprompting. Participatory prompting is a recently developed methodology in which\nusers and researchers reflect together on tasks through co-engagement with\ngenerative AI. In this paper we demonstrate the value of the participatory\nprompting method. We found that generative AI benefits the information foraging\nand sensemaking loops of data analysis in specific ways, but also introduces\nits own barriers and challenges, arising from the difficulties of query\nformulation, specifying context, and verifying results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
