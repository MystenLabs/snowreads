Here, we examine the behavior\nof these instabilities as the plasma becomes more optically thick. To do this,\nwe extend a recently-developed Fokker-Planck operator for synchrotron emission\nand absorption in mildly relativistic plasmas to fully relativistic plasmas.\nFor a given set of plasma parameters, photons emitted by higher-energy\nelectrons tend to be higher frequency, and thus more easily escape the plasma.\nAs a result, the ratio of the photon emission rate (radiative drag) to\nabsorption rate (radiative diffusion) for a given electron is extremely\nenergy-dependent. Given this behavior, we determine the critical parameters\nthat control the opacity, and show how the plasma gradually transitions to\nbecome more isotropic and stable at higher opacity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"uzuIlR829z0ZE4AuRFc7Dc5_YtwxYN9ggyvbEL6WDio","pdfSize":"1619515"}
