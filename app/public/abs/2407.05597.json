However, point cloud registration methods\nstruggle to achieve precise global pose estimation, whereas previous pose-free\nNeRFs overlook geometric consistency in global reconstruction. In light of\nthis, we explore the geometric insights of point clouds, which provide explicit\nregistration priors for reconstruction. Based on this, we propose Geometry\nguided Neural LiDAR Fields(GeoNLF), a hybrid framework performing alternately\nglobal neural reconstruction and pure geometric pose optimization. Furthermore,\nNeRFs tend to overfit individual frames and easily get stuck in local minima\nunder sparse-view inputs. To tackle this issue, we develop a\nselective-reweighting strategy and introduce geometric constraints for robust\noptimization. Extensive experiments on NuScenes and KITTI-360 datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of GeoNLF in both novel view synthesis and\nmulti-view registration of low-frequency large-scale point clouds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
