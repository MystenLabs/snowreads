The dataset's extensive coverage spans 15 years from\n2007 to 2023 with temporal information, offering a rich, global perspective\nwith 160,000 records on financial market news. Our study leverages causally\nvalidated sentiment scores and LSTM models to enhance market forecast accuracy\nand reliability. Utilizing the FinSen dataset, we introduce an innovative Focal\nCalibration Loss, reducing Expected Calibration Error (ECE) to 3.34 percent\nwith the DAN 3 model. This not only improves prediction accuracy but also\naligns probabilistic forecasts closely with real outcomes, crucial for the\nfinancial sector where predicted probability is paramount. Our approach\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of combining sentiment analysis with precise\ncalibration techniques for trustworthy financial forecasting where the cost of\nmisinterpretation can be high.
