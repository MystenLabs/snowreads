We\nthereby identify the valuation-theoretic functional analogues of the difference\nbody map and show that there does not exist a generalization of the projection\nbody map in this setting. This non-existence result is shown to also hold true\nfor valuations with values in the space of convex functions that are finite in\na neighborhood of the origin.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
