GMagAO-X's broad wavelength range and the large 25-meter aperture of the\nGMT creates new challenges: control of all 21.000 actuators; phasing GMT's\nsegmented primary mirror to nm levels; active control of atmospheric dispersion\nto sub milli-arcsecond residuals; no chromatic pupil shear to minimize\nchromatic compensation errors; integrated focal plane wavefront sensing and\ncontrol (WFSC). GMagAO-X will have simultaneous visible and infra-red WFS\nchannels to control the 21.000 actuator DM. The infra-red arm will be flexible\nby incorporating switchable sensors such as the pyramid or Zernike WFS. One\ninnovation that we developed for GMagAO-X is the Holographic Dispersed Fringe\nSensor that measures differential piston. We have also developed several\nintegrated coronagraphic wavefront sensors to control non-common path\naberrations exactly where we need to sense them. We will discuss the key\ncomponents of the WFSC strategies for GMagAO-X that address the challenges\nposed by the first high-contrast imaging system on the ELTs.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
