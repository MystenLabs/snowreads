In order to well\ndescribe the interplay between band structure and superfluidity, periodicity of\nthe lattice is taken into account using Bloch boundary conditions. A relative\nflow between the rods and the surrounding neutron gas is introduced in a\ntime-independent way. This induces a non-trivial phase of the complex order\nparameter, leading to a counterflow between neutrons inside and outside the\nrods. With the resulting current, we compute the actual neutron superfluid\nfraction. For the latter our results are significantly larger than previous\nones obtained in normal band theory, indicating that the normal band theory\noverestimates the entrainment effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
