Although many methods have\nbeen developed from diverse perspectives, to our knowledge, none can provide\nfine-grained higher-order fuzzy community information. This study presents a\nnovel concept of higher-order fuzzy memberships that quantify the membership\ngrades of motifs to crisp higher-order communities, thereby revealing the\npartial community affiliations. Furthermore, we employ higher-order fuzzy\nmemberships to enhance HCD via a general framework called fuzzy memberships\nassisted motif-based evolutionary modularity (FMMEM). In FFMEM, on the one\nhand, a fuzzy membership-based neighbor community modification (FM-NCM)\nstrategy is designed to correct misassigned bridge nodes, thereby improving\npartition quality. On the other hand, a fuzzy membership-based local community\nmerging (FM-LCM) strategy is also proposed to combine excessively fragmented\ncommunities for enhancing local search ability. Experimental results indicate\nthat the FMMEM framework outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both synthetic\nand real-world datasets, particularly in the networks with ambiguous and\ncomplex structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
