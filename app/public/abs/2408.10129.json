In this year, LSVOS Challenge\nRVOS Track replaced the origin YouTube-RVOS benchmark with MeViS. MeViS focuses\non referring the target object in a video through its motion descriptions\ninstead of static attributes, posing a greater challenge to RVOS task. In this\nwork, we integrate strengths of that leading RVOS and VOS models to build up a\nsimple and effective pipeline for RVOS. Firstly, We finetune the\nstate-of-the-art RVOS model to obtain mask sequences that are correlated with\nlanguage descriptions. Secondly, based on a reliable and high-quality key\nframes, we leverage VOS model to enhance the quality and temporal consistency\nof the mask results. Finally, we further improve the performance of the RVOS\nmodel using semi-supervised learning. Our solution achieved 62.57 J&F on the\nMeViS test set and ranked 1st place for 6th LSVOS Challenge RVOS Track.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
