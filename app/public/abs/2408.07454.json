As a bi-product of our\nproof we show that whenever the isomorphism class of $\\mathcal{N}$ admits a\nquasi-invariant measure, then it admits one with continuous Radon--Nikodym\ncocycles.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OR6B7Mqj4UthpJbINHButO6uR_Fsmo6cD7a1PjYZpxo","pdfSize":"182704"}
