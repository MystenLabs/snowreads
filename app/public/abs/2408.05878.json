However, booming demands for high\nefficiency single photon detector incorporated with avionic platforms arise\nwith the development of remote imaging and sensing or long-haul quantum\ncommunication without topographical constraints. We herein designed and\nmanufactured the first drone based SSPD system with a SDE as high as 91.8%.\nThis drone based SSPD system is established with high performance NbTiN SSPDs,\nself-developed miniature liquid helium dewar, and homemade integrated electric\nsetups, which is able to be launched in complex topographical conditions. Such\na drone based SSPD system may open the use of SSPDs for applications that\ndemand high-SDE in complex environments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
