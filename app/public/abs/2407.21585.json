Namely, the main results of the paper are:\n  -If $X^*$ has the WODP, then $X\\widehat{\\otimes}_\\varepsilon Y$ has the DD2P\nfor any Banach space $Y$.\n  -If $X$ has the WODP, then $X\\widehat{\\otimes}_\\pi Y$ has the DD2P for any\nBanach space $Y$.\n  -If $X^*$ and $Y^*$ have the WODP then $X\\widehat{\\otimes}_\\varepsilon Y$ has\nthe Daugavet property.\n  The above improve many results in the literature and establish progresses on\nsome open questions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
