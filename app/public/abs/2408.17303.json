Such solutions necessarily support an SU(3)-structure on the\ninternal 8-manifold M$_8$, in terms of which we phrase the conditions for\nsupersymmetry preservation. We use this to derive the local form of all ${\\cal\nN}=(4,4)$ supersymmetric AdS$_3$ solutions in $d=11$, for which M$_8$\ndecomposes as a foliation of a 3-sphere over a 5 dimensional base. There are 3\nindependent classes, 2 of which preserve the small superconformal algebra and\none preserving its large counterpart for which M$_5$ contains a second\n3-sphere. We show that for each solution with large (4,4) supersymmetry there\nare two corresponding solutions with small $(4,4)$, one for which M$_5$\nmaintains its 3-sphere, one where this blows up to $\\mathbb{R}^3$ which can be\ncompactified to $\\mathbb{T}^3$. We use our results to construct several new\nsolutions that lie within our derived classes as well as recovering some\nexisting solutions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
