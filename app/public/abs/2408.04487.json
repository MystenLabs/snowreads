Here we use machine learning-based simulations with\nfirst-principles accuracy to unravel the behavior of the hydroxide and\nhydronium ions at the graphene-water interface. Our findings reveal that the\ngraphene-water interface is acidic, with the hydronium ion predominantly\nresiding in the first contact layer of water. In contrast, the hydroxide ion\nexhibits a bimodal distribution, found both near the surface and towards the\ninterior layers. Analysis of the underlying electronic structure reveals strong\npolarization effects, resulting in counterintuitive charge rearrangement.\nProton propensity to the graphene-water interface challenges the interpretation\nof surface experiments and is expected to have far-reaching consequences for\nion conductivity, interfacial reactivity, and proton-mediated processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
