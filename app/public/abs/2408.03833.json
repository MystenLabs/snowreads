For\nhigh-dimensional nonlinear systems, the problem is extremely difficult to\nsolve. It scales poorly too. Current literature poses combinatorial submodular\nset optimization problems via maximizing observability performance metrics\nsubject to matroid constraints. Such an approach is typically solved using\ngreedy algorithms that require lower computational effort yet often yield\nsub-optimal solutions. In this letter, we address the sensing node selection\nproblem for nonlinear dynamical networks using a variational form of the system\ndynamics, that basically perturb the system physics. As a result, we show that\nthe observability performance metrics under such system representation are\nindeed submodular. The optimal problem is then solved using the multilinear\ncontinuous extension. This extension offers a computationally scalable and\napproximate continuous relaxation with a performance guarantee. The\neffectiveness of the extended submodular program is studied and compared to\ngreedy algorithms. We demonstrate the proposed set optimization formulation for\nsensing node selection on nonlinear natural gas combustion networks.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
