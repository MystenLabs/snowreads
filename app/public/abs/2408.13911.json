It describes the integral with respect to a\nmeasure defined on the coframe of all $\\sigma$-sublocales, moving beyond the\nconstraints of Boolean algebras. It also extends the notion of integrable\nfunction, usually reserved for measurable functions, to localic general\nfunctions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
