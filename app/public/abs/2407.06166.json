{"id":"2407.06166","title":"Inevitable Endgame of Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS (C/2023 A3)","authors":"Zdenek Sekanina","authorsParsed":[["Sekanina","Zdenek",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 8 Jul 2024 17:42:38 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-09","timestamp":1720460558000,"abstract":"  Hopes are being widely expressed that C/2023 A3 could become a naked-eye\nobject about the time of its perihelion passage in late 2024. However, based on\nits past and current performance, the comet is expected to disintegrate before\nreaching perihelion. Independent lines of evidence point to its forthcoming\ninevitable collapse. The first issue, which was recently called attention to by\nI. Ferrin, is this Oort cloud comet's failure to brighten at a heliocentric\ndistance exceeding 2 AU, about 160 days preperihelion, accompanied by a sharp\ndrop in the production of dust (Af\\rho). Apparent over a longer period of time,\nbut largely ignored, has been the barycentric original semimajor axis inching\ntoward negative numbers and the mean residual increasing after the light-curve\nanomaly, suggesting a fragmented nucleus whose motion is being affected a\nnongravitational acceleration; and an unusually narrow, teardrop dust tail with\nits peculiar orientation, implying copious emission of large grains far from\nthe Sun but no microscopic material recently. This evidence suggests that the\ncomet has entered an advanced phase of fragmentation, in which increasing\nnumbers of dry, fractured refractory solids stay assembled in dark, porous\nblobs of exotic shape, becoming undetectable as they gradually disperse in\nspace.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
