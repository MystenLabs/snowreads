The method solves for the level set indicator\nfunction in a narrow band around the interface. An extension procedure, which\nis essential for a narrow band level set method, is introduced based on a\nfinite element $L^2$- or $H^1$-projection combined with the ghost-penalty\nmethod. This procedure is formulated as a linear variational problem in a\nnarrow band around the surface, making it computationally efficient and\nsuitable for rigorous error analysis. The extension method is combined with a\ndiscontinuous Galerkin space discretization and a BDF time-stepping scheme. The\npaper analyzes the stability and accuracy of the extension procedure and\nevaluates the performance of the resulting narrow band finite element method\nfor the level set equation through numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
