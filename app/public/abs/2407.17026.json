In the case of a compact\nbinary close to merger involving at least one neutron star, this can happen\nthrough tidal interactions causing resonant excitations that shatter the\nneutron star crust. We present the first numerical study that elucidates the\ndynamics of Alfven waves launched in a compact binary magnetosphere. We seed a\nmagnetic field perturbation on the neutron star crust, which we then evolve in\nfully general-relativistic force-free electrodynamics using a GPU-based\nimplementation. We show that Alfven waves steepen nonlinearly before reaching\nthe orbital light cylinder, form flares, and dissipate energy in a transient\ncurrent sheet. Our results predict radio and X-ray precursor emission from this\nprocess.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
