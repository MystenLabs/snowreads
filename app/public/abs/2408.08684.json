Vision Transformer captures global information by\nsplitting images into small pieces and leveraging Transformer's multi-head\nattention mechanism, but its high reference count and compute overhead limit\ndeployment on mobile devices. At the same time, the rapid development of LLM\nhas revolutionized natural language processing, but it also faces huge\ndeployment challenges. To address these issues, we investigate model pruning\ntechniques, with a particular focus on how to reduce redundant parameters\nwithout losing accuracy to accommodate personalized data and\nresource-constrained environments. In this paper, a new layered pruning\nstrategy is proposed to distinguish the personalized layer from the common\nlayer by compressed sensing and random sampling, thus significantly reducing\nthe model parameters. Our experimental results show that the introduced step\nbuffering mechanism further improves the accuracy of the model after pruning,\nproviding new directions and possibilities for the deployment of efficient and\npersonalized AI models on mobile devices in the future.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
