This is\nmade possible by extending the theory of mixed-monotone systems to incorporate\nstochastic orders, and a concentration inequality result that lower-bounds the\nprobability the state resides within an interval through a monotone mapping.\nThen, we present an algorithm to compute the overapproximations of forward\nreachable set and the probability the state resides within it. We present our\napproach on two aerospace examples to show its efficacy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
