Utilizing an unmanned aerial\nvehicle (UAV) equipped with a suspended metal sphere introduces an efficient\ncalibration method by allowing dynamic adjustment of the UAV's position,\neffectively acting as a mobile calibration platform. However, external factors\nsuch as wind can introduce bias in reflectivity measurements by causing the\nsphere to deviate from its intended position. This study develops a theoretical\nmodel to assess the impact of the metal sphere's one-dimensional oscillation on\nreflectivity. The findings offer valuable insights for UAV based radar\ncalibration efforts.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
