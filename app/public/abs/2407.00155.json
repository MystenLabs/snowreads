We analyze the Lanczos\ncoefficients derived from the correlation function, revealing their linear\ngrowth even in this integrable system. This growth suggests a link to chaotic\nbehavior, typically unexpected in integrable systems. Our findings in both\nground and thermal states of 1-MQM provide new insights into the nature of\ncomplexity in quantum mechanical models and lay the groundwork for further\nstudies in more complex holographic theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
