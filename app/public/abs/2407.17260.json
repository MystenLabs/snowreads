This provides a strong counterexample to the\nBeauville--Bogomolov decomposition in the log canonical setting. This\nconstruction can also be adapted to construct a smooth quasi-projective variety\nof logarithmic Kodaira dimension 0 whose quasi-Albanese morphism has maximal\nvariation. On the positive side, we show that the Albanese morphism for log\ncanonical pairs with nef anti-canonical class is a locally stable family of\npairs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
