This trend empowers applications to opt\nfor memory types aligning with developer's desired behavior. As a result,\ndevelopers gain flexibility to tailor their applications to specific needs,\nfactoring in attributes like latency, bandwidth, and power consumption. Our\nresearch centers on the aspect of power consumption within memory systems. We\nintroduce an approach that equips developers with comprehensive insights into\nthe power consumption of individual memory types. Additionally, we propose an\nordered hierarchy of memory types. Through this methodology, developers can\nmake informed decisions for efficient memory usage aligned with their unique\nrequirements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Performance","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
