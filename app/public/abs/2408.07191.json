Both contain noisy information about\nthe labels. Here we propose joint denoising and rewiring (JDR)--an algorithm to\njointly denoise the graph structure and features, which can improve the\nperformance of any downstream algorithm. We do this by defining and maximizing\nthe alignment between the leading eigenspaces of graph and feature matrices. To\napproximately solve this computationally hard problem, we propose a heuristic\nthat efficiently handles real-world graph datasets with many classes and\ndifferent levels of homophily or heterophily. We experimentally verify the\neffectiveness of our approach on synthetic data and real-world graph datasets.\nThe results show that JDR consistently outperforms existing rewiring methods on\nnode classification tasks using GNNs as downstream models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5Qs45AoE_othytonJFBv27FCQqdd-nKxCYinQ1LDMzA","pdfSize":"3443247"}
