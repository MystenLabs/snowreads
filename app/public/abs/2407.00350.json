Despite progresses being made,\nrecent studies have revealed limitations and inconsistencies in our\nunderstanding across various rivalry contexts. We develop a unified physical\nframework, where perception undergoes a consecutive phase transition process\nencompassing different multi-state competitions. We reveal the underlying\nmechanisms of perceptual rivalry by identifying dominant switching paths among\nperceptual states and quantifying mean perceptual durations, switching\nfrequencies, and proportions of different perceptions. We uncover the\nunderlying nonequilibrium dynamics and thermodynamics by analyzing average\nnonequilibrium flux and entropy production rate, while associated time series\nirreversibility reflects the underlying nonequilibrium mechanism of perceptual\nrivalry and link thermodynamical results with neuro-electrophysiological\nexperiments. Our framework provides a global and physical understanding of\nbrain perception, which may go beyond cognitive science or psychology but\nembodies the connection with wider fields as decision-making.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"sHzBFDjkSpnQ9wO0yh7-sIY5LcHK0wtKd6c1SH4BLQQ","pdfSize":"3554430"}
