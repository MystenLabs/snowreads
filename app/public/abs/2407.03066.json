We use the simple MPI model of PYTHIA 6, on\nwhich JEWEL is based. We find negligible effects on all observables except\njet-hadron and Z-hadron correlations, which show a moderate enhancement at\nlarge distances. More detailed analysis at parton level reveals that, in\nheavy-ion collisions, the MPI contribution to jets is suppressed by quenching\neffects.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
