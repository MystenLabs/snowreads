We\nachieve this by projecting individual data with worst-case sensitivity $R$ onto\na simplex where all data now has a constant norm $R$. In this simplex,\nadditional ``free'' queries can be run that are already covered by the\nprivacy-loss of the original budgeted query, and which algebraically give\nadditional estimates of counts or sums, and can be combined for lower final\nnoise.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
