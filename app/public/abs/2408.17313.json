Unlike traditional BAI, which solely focuses on identifying the optimal\narm with minimal sample complexity, F-BAI also includes a set of fairness\nconstraints. These constraints impose a lower limit on the selection rate of\neach arm and can be either model-agnostic or model-dependent. For this setting,\nwe establish an instance-specific sample complexity lower bound and analyze the\n\\textit{price of fairness}, quantifying how fairness impacts sample complexity.\nBased on the sample complexity lower bound, we propose F-TaS, an algorithm\nprovably matching the sample complexity lower bound, while ensuring that the\nfairness constraints are satisfied. Numerical results, conducted using both a\nsynthetic model and a practical wireless scheduling application, show the\nefficiency of F-TaS in minimizing the sample complexity while achieving low\nfairness violations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
