In this framework, outcomes of\ncounterfactual treatments are assumed to be well-defined. This metaphysical\nassumption is often thought to be problematic yet indispensable. The\nconventional approach relies not only on counterfactuals but also on abstract\nnotions of distributions and assumptions of independence that are not directly\ntestable. In this paper, we construe causal inference as treatment-wise\npredictions for finite populations where all assumptions are testable; this\nmeans that one can not only test predictions themselves (without any\nfundamental problem) but also investigate sources of error when they fail. The\nnew framework highlights the model-dependence of causal claims as well as the\ndifference between statistical and scientific inference.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
