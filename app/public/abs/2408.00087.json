We compute the\nasymptotic behaviour of its (graded) star-codimension sequence. It turns out\nthat the asymptotic growth of the sequence is independent of the grading and\nthe involution under consideration, depending solely on the size of the matrix\nalgebra. This independence of the group grading also applies to the graded\ncodimension sequence of the associative algebra of upper triangular matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
