In this work, we will elaborate on its proper\ndefinition in general dimensions. We use the vielbein field on the unit sphere\nto define the fundamental field with non-vanishing helicity in the local\nCartesian frame which is the building block of the Carrollian amplitude. In\ngeneral dimensions, the Carrollian amplitude is related to the momentum space\nscattering matrix by a modified Fourier transform. The Poincar\\'e\ntransformation law of the Carrollian amplitude in this definition has been\ndiscussed. We also find an isomorphism between the local rotation of the\nvielbein field and the superduality transformation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
