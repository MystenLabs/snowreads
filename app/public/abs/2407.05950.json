We review the\nAlicki-Fannes-Winter technique to obtain a uniform continuity bound for the von\nNeumann entropy in states that are a mix of pure states with bounded energy,\nusing this bound we conclude that for a Hamiltonian satisfying the Gibb's\nhypothesis such states cannot exist.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
