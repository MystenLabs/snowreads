We also quantify multiple qualitatively distinct aspects of\nastrometric variability seen in the data, using a variety of metrics. Average\nposition offsets, statistical dispersion measures, and coherent trends over\ntime as explored by smoothing the data are combined to characterize the most\nand least positionally stable ICRF3 sources. We find a notable dependence of\nthe excess variance and statistical variability measures on declination, as is\nexpected for unmodeled ionospheric delay errors and the northern hemisphere\ndominated network geometries of most astrometric and geodetic observing\ncampaigns.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
