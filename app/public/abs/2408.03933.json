Both\nthe edge-disjoint and vertex-disjoint versions in undirected graphs are\nfamously known to be FPT (parameterized by $k$) due to the Graph Minor Theory\nof Robertson and Seymour. Eilam-Tzoreff [DAM `98] introduced a variant, known\nas the $k$-disjoint-shortest-paths problem, where each individual path is\nfurther required to be a shortest path connecting its pair. They showed that\nthe $k$-disjoint-shortest-paths problem is NP-complete on both directed and\nundirected graphs; this holds even if the graphs are planar and have unit edge\nlengths. We focus on four versions of the problem, corresponding to considering\nedge/vertex disjointness, and to considering directed/undirected graphs.\nBuilding on the reduction of Chitnis [SIDMA `23] for $k$-edge-disjoint-paths on\nplanar DAGs, we obtain the following inapproximability lower bound for each of\nthe four versions of $k$-disjoint-shortest-paths on $n$-vertex graphs: - Under\nGap-ETH, there exists a constant $\\delta>0$ such that for any constant\n$0<\\epsilon\\leq \\frac{1}{2}$ and any computable function $f$, there is no\n$(\\frac{1}{2}+\\epsilon)$-approx in $f(k)\\cdot n^{\\delta\\cdot k}$ time. We\nfurther strengthen our results as follows: Directed: Inapprox lower bound for\nedge-disjoint (resp. vertex-disjoint) paths holds even if the input graph is a\nplanar (resp. 1-planar) DAG with max in-degree and max out-degree at most $2$.\nUndirected: Inapprox lower bound for edge-disjoint (resp. vertex-disjoint)\npaths hold even if the input graph is planar (resp. 1-planar) and has max\ndegree $4$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Fe1aTSGVW3kW_slDYvyqYOhl2hbYe_SY1OIxjuvLhWA","pdfSize":"690709"}
