We applied this method to two metal\nchalcogenides: $\\text{Li}_3\\text{PS}_4$ and\n$\\text{Na}_6\\text{Ge}_2\\text{Se}_6$, treating $\\text{PS}_4$ as a tetrahedral\nrigid body and $\\text{Ge}_2\\text{Se}_6$ as an ethane-like dimer rigid body.\nInitial trials not only identified the experimentally observed structures of\nthese compounds but also uncovered several novel phases, including a new\nstannite-type $\\text{Li}_3\\text{PS}_4$ structure and a potential metastable\nstructure for $\\text{Na}_6\\text{Ge}_2\\text{Se}_6$ that exhibits significantly\nlower energy than the observed phase, as evaluated by density functional theory\n(DFT) calculations. We compared our results with those obtained using USPEX, a\npopular CSP package leveraging genetic algorithms. Both methods predicted the\nsame lowest energy structures in both compounds. However, our method\ndemonstrated better performance in predicting metastable structures. The method\nis implemented with Python code which is available at\nhttps://github.com/ColdSnaap/sgrcsp.git.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
