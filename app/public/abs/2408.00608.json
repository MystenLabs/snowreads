During a 10-day-long coverage of the February 2024 outburst\nof SRGA J144459.2-604207, the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE)\ndetected an average polarization degree of the 2-8 keV emission of 2.3% +/-\n0.4% at an angle of 59{\\deg} +/- 6{\\deg} (East of North; uncertainties quoted\nat the 1${\\sigma}$ confidence level). The polarized signal shows a significant\nenergy dependence with a degree of 4.0% +/- 0.5% between 3 and 6 keV and < 2%\n(90% c.l.) in the 2-3 keV range. We used NICER, XMM-Newton, and NuSTAR\nobservations to obtain an accurate pulse timing solution and perform a\nphase-resolved polarimetric analysis of IXPE data. We did not detect any\nsignificant variability of the Stokes parameters Q and U with the spin and the\norbital phases. We used the relativistic rotating vector model to show that a\nmoderately fan-beam emission from two point-like spots at a small magnetic\nobliquity ($\\simeq$ 10{\\deg}) is compatible with the observed pulse profile and\npolarization properties. IXPE also detected 52 type-I X-ray bursts, with a\nrecurrence time $\\Delta t_{rec}$ increasing from 2 to 8 h as a function of the\nobserved count rate $C$ as as $\\Delta t_{rec} \\simeq C^{-0.8}$ We stacked the\nemission observed during all the bursts and obtained an upper limit on the\npolarization degree of 8.5% (90% c.l.).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
