First, we first\nprovide a conceptual shrinking-horizon framework that utilizes general\nprobabilistic reachable sets and minimizes the expected cost. Then, we provide\na tractable receding-horizon formulation that uses a nominal state and a simple\nconstraint tightening. Both formulations ensure recursive feasibility,\nsatisfaction of chance constraints, and bounds on the expected cost for the\nresulting closed-loop system. We provide a constructive design for\nprobabilistic reachable sets of nonlinear systems using stochastic contraction\nmetrics. We demonstrate the practicality of the proposed method through a\nsimulation of a chain of mass-spring-dampers with nonlinear Coulomb friction.\nOverall, this paper provides a framework for computationally tractable\nstochastic predictive control approaches with closed-loop guaranteed for\nnonlinear systems with unbounded noise.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
