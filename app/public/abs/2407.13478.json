A possible way to achieve this is to use existing communication\nreference signals for sensing, such as the 5G Positioning Reference Signal\n(PRS). Existing works have demonstrated promising results by using the PRS with\nclassical signal processing techniques. However, this approach suffers from a\nloss of SNR due to the sparse resource allocation. In this work, we improve\nupon existing results by combining the 5G PRS with compressed sensing methods.\nWe demonstrate that our method achieves better noise robustness compared to the\nexisting works and has superresolution properties, making it an ideal choice\nfor range-Doppler map generation and target detection even in noisy\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
