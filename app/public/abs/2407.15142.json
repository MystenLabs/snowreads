The pioneering van\nder Waals (vdW) ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ has extended the way for spintronic\napplications by achieving a record-high Curie temperature among its analogues.\nHowever, the physical mechanism of increasing Cuire temperature still needs to\nbe explored. Here, we propose a practical approach to discovering\nhigh-temperature ferromagnetic materials for spintronic applications through\nflat band engineering. We simulate the magnetic transition directly from\nstrongly correlated calculations, reconciling the dual nature of $d$-electrons\nwith both localization and itinerant characters. Significantly, our systematic\nstudies unveil the emergence of quasi-particle flat bands arising from\ncollective many-body excitations preceding the ferromagnetic phase transition,\nreinforcing magnetic stability through a positive feedback mechanism. This\nresearch provides a promising pathway for exploring next-generation spintronic\ndevices utilizing low-dimensional vdW flat band systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yzxvLl662PeK109udhA1GoC9oIejyCEQL_zkDuPKvPA","pdfSize":"12808583"}
