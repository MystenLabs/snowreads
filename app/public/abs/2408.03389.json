We obtain formal solutions written\nin terms of series expansions close to spatial and null infinity and use them\nto compute non-trivial asymptotic spin-$0$ charges. It is shown that if one\nconsiders the most general initial data within the class considered in this\npaper, the expansion is poly-homogeneous and hence of restricted regularity at\nnull infinity. Furthermore, we derive the conditions on the initial data needed\nto obtain regular solutions and well-defined limits for the asymptotic charges\nat the critical sets where null infinity and spatial infinity meet. In four\ndimensions, we find that there are infinitely many well-defined asymptotic\ncharges at the critical sets, while for higher dimensions there is only a\nfinite number of non-trivial asymptotic charges that remain regular at the\ncritical sets.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EMgpENI_4lPukjL_DEVqsod3QFI1DnBRPgLk7f2ihck","pdfSize":"645985"}
