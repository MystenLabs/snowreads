Assuming a prolate spheroid nucleus, this allows\nto quantify the sensitivity of the nuclear transition frequency to variations\nof the fine-structure constant $\\alpha$ to $K=5900(2300)$, with the uncertainty\ndominated by the experimentally measured charge radius difference $\\Delta\n\\langle r^2 \\rangle$ between the ground and isomeric state. This result\nindicates a three orders of magnitude enhancement over atomic clock schemes\nbased on electron shell transitions. We find that $\\Delta Q_0$ is highly\nsensitive to tiny changes in the nuclear volume, thus the constant volume\napproximation cannot be used to accurately relate changes in $\\langle r^2\n\\rangle$ and $Q_0$. The difference between the experimental and estimated\nvalues in $\\Delta Q_0/Q_0$ raises a further question on the octupole\ncontribution to the alpha-sensitivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
