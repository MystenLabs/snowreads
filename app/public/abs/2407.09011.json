Training a high-performance QA system has become\nstraightforward with pre-trained language models, requiring only a small amount\nof data and simple fine-tuning. However, despite recent advances, existing QA\nsystems still exhibit significant deficiencies in functionality and training\nefficiency. We address the functionality issue by defining four key tasks: user\ninput intent classification, out-of-domain input detection, new intent\ndiscovery, and continual learning. We then leverage a unified SCL-based\nrepresentation learning method to efficiently build an intra-class compact and\ninter-class scattered feature space, facilitating both known intent\nclassification and unknown intent detection and discovery. Consequently, with\nminimal additional tuning on downstream tasks, our approach significantly\nimproves model efficiency and achieves new state-of-the-art performance across\nall tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
