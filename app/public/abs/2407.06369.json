We propose an experiment to\ndemonstrate IFM in the single x-ray photon regime. The proposed scheme relies\non the triple-Laue (LLL) symmetric x-ray interferometer, where each Laue\ndiffraction acts as a lossy beamsplitter. In contrast to many quantum effects\nwhich are highly vulnerable to loss, we show that an experimental demonstration\nof this effect in the x-ray regime is feasible and can achieve high IFM\nefficiency even in the presence of substantial loss in the system. The latter\naspect is claimed to be a general property of IFM based on our theoretical\nanalysis. We scrutinize two suitable detection schemes that offer efficiencies\nof up to $\\eta\\sim \\frac{1}{2}$. The successful demonstration of IFM with\nx-rays promises intriguing possibilities for measurements with reduced dose,\nmainly advantageous for biological samples, where radiation damage is a\nsignificant limitation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
