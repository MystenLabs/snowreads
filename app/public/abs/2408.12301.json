The mass-radius relation of the compact stars in the\nNIP model predicts large deviations from those in the general relativity in the\nlow-mass region, potentially allowing us to test the NIP model by future\nastrophysical observations. We also study the nonvanishing scalar hair\nsurrounding the compact star and demonstrate that the chameleon mechanism works\nefficiently. They result in distinct scalar profiles inside and outside the\nstar, which implies screening the fifth force mediated by the scalar field.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
