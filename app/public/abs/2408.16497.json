Static, spherically symmetric solutions are considered, with\nthe equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting\nmultidimensional Fermi gas. To model the strong force between baryons, a\nrepulsive potential is introduced, which is linear in the particle number\ndensity. The maximal mass of compact stars is calculated for different model\nparameters, and with a physical parameter choice, it satisfies observational\ndata, meaning that it is possible to model simple, realistic objects within\nthis framework. Based on this comparison, a limiting size for the observational\nregime of extra dimensions in compact stars is provided, with $r_c \\gtrsim\n0.2$~fm.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
