The matrix\nconsidered depends on a positive parameter, as such we consider the\nimplications in different regimes of such a parameter, perturbative and beyond.\nOur main goal is to relate spectral properties to the graph's configuration, or\nto basic properties of the Laplacian and adjacency matrices. We explain the\nconnections with dynamic networks and their stability properties, which lead us\nto state a conjecture for the signature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ozVq91PU0_D2eCPwVnzDGa4BFC47XfBd9qFDbryci9I","pdfSize":"615309","txDigest":"EVE4YGHw1v1XuyqKGM2M8ZPuaYbVtNm3vC2CYz5ULeDS","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
