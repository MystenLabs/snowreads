An approach to\nevaluate adiabaticity in the experiment by applying spectroscopic techniques\nhas recently been suggested. However, this method requires temporal oscillation\nof interaction strength during QA, posing challenges for experimental\ndemonstration. Here, we propose an experimental method for evaluating\nadiabaticity when performing QA with a parametric oscillator with Kerr\nnonlinearity (KPO). Importantly, our proposal offers a significant advantage by\neliminating the need for temporal oscillation of interactions during QA. We\ninvestigate its performance through numerical simulations, and we show the\nfeasibility of our method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
