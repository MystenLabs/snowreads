Key features of this voltage divider include minimal voltage dependence,\nexcellent stability, and resistance to external temperature variations. The\ninnovative approach involves its fabrication using 3D printing technology,\nallowing easy replication by project partners. This precision voltage divider\nleverages commercially available precision resistors, drawing upon successful\noutcomes from the FutureEnergy 19ENG02 and HVDC ENG07 Projects. In these\nexperiments, which involve ion acceleration and laser probing of electronic\ntransitions, voltage dividers are integrated into setups such as COALA (TU\nDarmstadt), BECOLA (Michigan State University), COLLAPS (CERN/ISOLDE), and\nATLANTIS (Argonne National Laboratory). Monitoring the applied acceleration\npotential, these dividers allow one to consider and counteract long-term drifts\nand thereby improving measurement accuracy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
