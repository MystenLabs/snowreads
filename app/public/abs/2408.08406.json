In this\npaper, we also discuss the possible origins of large-scale magnetic field\nproduction around black holes (BHs). For example, the origin of this strong\nlarge-scale magnetic field could be the interstellar medium or a companion star\noutside the accretion disk, which is drawn in by the accretion plasma and grows\nover time. The findings show that the uniform magnetic field of a subsonic\nflow, which is weak at infinity, increases with time and evolves into a\nquasi-radial field. This is true for both types of flows. We have also observed\nthat the growth of the radial component of the magnetic field is more\npronounced in the sub-Keplerian flow than in the Keplerian flow. However, it is\nworth noting that, for both types of flows, the magnetic field does not reach\nits saturation value in the regions $r> r_{c}$; instead, the process of\nstrengthening and growing the magnetic field progresses to a point where the\ndisk evolves from its initial condition to a state close to the magnetically\narrested disk (MAD) state, forming a sub-MAD state.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
