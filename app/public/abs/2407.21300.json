However, it also has many problems, it consumes a\nlot of memory because of the enormous database, and it cannot update the\nestablished index database in time when confronted with massive streaming data.\nTo reduce the memory required for building the database and maintain accuracy\nsimultaneously, we proposed a new approach integrating a streaming algorithm\nwith k-means clustering into RAG. Our approach applied a streaming algorithm to\nupdate the index dynamically and reduce memory consumption. Additionally, the\nk-means algorithm clusters highly similar documents, and the query time would\nbe shortened. We conducted comparative experiments on four methods, and the\nresults indicated that RAG with streaming algorithm and k-means clusters\noutperforms traditional RAG in accuracy and memory, particularly when dealing\nwith large-scale streaming data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
