Previous\nstudies have primarily focused on enhancing various abilities by attaching\nrobotic tails that function solely as tails on quadruped robots. While these\ntails improve the performance of the robots, they come with several\ndisadvantages, such as increased overall weight and higher costs. To mitigate\nthese limitations, we propose the use of a 6-DoF manipulator as a tail,\nallowing it to serve both as a tail and as a manipulator. To control this\nhighly complex robot, we developed a controller based on reinforcement learning\nfor the robot equipped with the manipulator. Our experimental results\ndemonstrate that robots equipped with a manipulator outperform those without a\nmanipulator in tasks such as rapid turning, aerial reorientation, and\nbalancing. These results indicate that the manipulator can improve the agility\nand stability of quadruped robots, similar to a tail, in addition to its\nmanipulation capabilities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
