We perform a semi-classical analysis\nof the dynamics of an impurity allowed to freely move through a subwavelength\narray of atoms in different parameter regimes. We numerically solve the coupled\nset of equations between motional and spin degrees of freedom to elucidate the\npossible impurity trajectories realizable in this system. We find that the\nimpurity can maintain quasi-stable orbits within the plaquette for long times.\nThe regions through which these orbits pass are strongly dependent on the\nchosen atomic transition dipole moment. We further provide intuition for our\nfindings based on a simplified model, where the lattice dynamics is\nadiabatically eliminated. As a final point of analysis, we also take the\nmotional degrees of freedom of the lattice atoms into account, and study the\npolaron-like excitation induced in the kinetic state of the lattice by the\nimpurity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
