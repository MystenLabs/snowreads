By choosing different surrogate\nfunctions, the generic method reduces to some existing descent methods with and\nwithout line search, respectively. The unified convergence analysis shows that\nthe slow convergence of the steepest descent method is mainly due to the large\ngap between surrogate and objective functions. As a result, the performance of\ndescent methods can be improved by narrowing the surrogate gap. Interestingly,\nwe observe that selecting a tighter surrogate function is equivalent to using\nan appropriate base of the dual cone in the direction-finding subproblem.\nFurthermore, we use Barzilai-Borwein method to narrow the surrogate gap and\ndevise a Barzilai-Borwein descent method for VOPs with polyhedral cone. By\nreformulating the subproblem, we provide a new insight into the\nBarzilai-Borwein descent method and bridge it to the steepest descent method.\nFinally, several numerical experiments confirm the efficiency of the proposed\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
