These lecture notes in geometric mechanics are meant to convey\ninsight through clear definitions and workable examples. The lecture format\nadopted here is intended to convey the immediacy of the taught course and to be\nuseful as a basis for other courses. The lecture notes comprise:\n  AP = Applications of Pure maths, e.g., Noether's theorem: Lie group symmetry\nof Hamilton's variational principle implies conservation laws for its equations\nof motion.\\smallskip\n  PA = Purifications of Applied maths, e.g., Euler fluid dynamics describes\ngeodesic flow on the manifold of smooth invertible maps acting on the domain of\nflow. \\smallskip\n  Both AP and PA appear here, though the difference is not mentioned. It is\nleft to the reader to decide whether it was AP or PA in each of the lectures\ncontaining well over sixty solved exercises.\n  An aspect of modern applications emphasised here is the use of the\ncomposition of evolutionary maps for multi-physics, multi-timescale\ninteractions including waves interacting with flows in the Euler--Poincar\\'e\nframework in geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) for ocean and atmosphere\ndynamics, and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) for applications in plasma physics\nsuch as magnetic confinement fusion (MFC) and astrophysical processes such as\nAlfv\\'en waves and gravity waves propagating on the Solar tachocline. The\ntopics covered in each lecture can also be gleaned from its table of contents\nlisted at the onset of each lecture.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
