The scheme builds on\nprevious protocols that entangle the system to be measured with ancillary\nsystems. In the idealised situation of perfect entangling operations and no\ndecoherence, it gives an exact space-time trade-off meaning the readout speed\nincreases linearly with the number of ancilla. We verify this scheme is robust\nagainst experimental imperfections through numerical modelling of gate noise\nand readout errors, and under certain circumstances our scheme can even lead to\nbetter than linear improvement in the speed of measurement with the number of\nsystems measured. This hardware-agnostic approach is broadly applicable to a\nrange of quantum technology platforms and offers a route to accelerate\nmid-circuit measurement as required for effective quantum error correction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
