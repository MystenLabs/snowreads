We calculate the\namplitude square using two component spinor formalism and four component spinor\nformalism and show the equivalence of the results using the two formalisms. We\nalso establish the relations between the couplings of $Z^{'}$ boson to fermions\nin the two component spinor formalism and four component spinor formalism.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
