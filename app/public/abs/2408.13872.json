To capture these variations,\ntime-since-infection dependent recovery and death rates offer a detailed\ndescription of the epidemic. However, obtaining individual-level data to\nestimate these rates is challenging, while aggregate epidemiological data (such\nas the number of new infections, number of active cases, number of new\nrecoveries, and number of new deaths) are more readily available. In this\narticle, a new methodology is proposed to estimate time-since-infection\ndependent recovery and death rates using easily available data sources,\naccommodating irregular data collection timings reflective of real-world\nreporting practices. The Nadaraya-Watson estimator is utilized to derive the\nnumber of new infections. This model improves the accuracy of epidemic\nprogression descriptions and provides clear insights into recovery and death\ndistributions. The proposed methodology is validated using COVID-19 data and\nits general applicability is demonstrated by applying it to some other diseases\nlike measles and typhoid.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QsunbrZlTo3X_z9SaAW7HkIYi7Q_WL15_o4qb6DyeqY","pdfSize":"1133010"}
