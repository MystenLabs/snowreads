In this regard, many\ntheoretical studies focus on the behavior of elongating straight objects. They\nrepel each other through volume exclusion and divide into two halves when\nreaching a certain threshold length. However, in reality, hardly any object of\na certain elongation is perfectly straight. Therefore, we here study the\nconsequences of curvature on the growth of colonies and thin active films. A\ngiven amount of curvature is prescribed to each growing individual.\nParticularly, we analyze how this individual curvature affects the size of\norientationally ordered domains in the colony and find a significant decrease.\nInstead, strings of stacked curved cells emerge that show branched structures.\nFurthermore, we identify a significant spatio-orientational coupling that is\nnot observed in colonies of straight cells. Our results are important for a\nfundamental understanding of the interaction and spreading of microorganisms on\nsurfaces, with implications for medical applications and bioengineering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
