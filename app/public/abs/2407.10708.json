Let\n$\\mathbf{L}$ be a uniform random $q$-dimensional totally geodesic submanifold\n(called $q$-flat) in $\\mathbb{M}_K^d$ passing through $o$ and, independently of\n$\\mathbf{L}$, let $\\mathbf{E}$ be a random $(d-q+\\gamma)$-flat in\n$\\mathbb{M}_K^d$ which is uniformly distributed in the set of all\n$(d-q+\\gamma)$-flats intersecting a hyperbolic ball of radius $u>0$ around $o$.\nWe are interested in the distribution of the random $\\gamma$-flat arising as\nthe intersection of $\\mathbf{E}$ with $\\mathbf{L}$. In contrast to the\nEuclidean case, the intersection $\\mathbf{E}\\cap \\mathbf{L}$ can be empty with\nstrictly positive probability. We determine this probability and the full\ndistribution of $\\mathbf{E}\\cap \\mathbf{L}$. Thereby, we elucidate crucial\ndifferences to the Euclidean case. Moreover, we study the limiting behaviour as\n$d\\uparrow\\infty$ and also $K\\uparrow 0$. Thereby we obtain a phase transition\nwith three different phases which we completely characterize, including a\ncritical phase with distinctive behavior and a phase recovering the Euclidean\nresults. In the background are methods from hyperbolic integral geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
