While a few commercial\nproducts exist, the question of whether AI-assistance can actually reduce\ngrading effort and time has not yet been carefully considered in published\nliterature. This work introduces an AI-assisted grading pipeline. The pipeline\nfirst uses text detection to automatically detect question regions present in a\nquestion paper PDF. Next, it uses SOTA text detection methods to highlight\nimportant keywords present in the handwritten answer regions of scanned answer\nsheets to assist in the grading process. We then evaluate a prototype\nimplementation of the AI-assisted grading pipeline deployed on an existing\ne-learning management platform. The evaluation involves a total of 5 different\nreal-life examinations across 4 different courses at a reputed institute; it\nconsists of a total of 42 questions, 17 graders, and 468 submissions. We log\nand analyze the grading time for each handwritten answer while using AI\nassistance and without it. Our evaluations have shown that, on average, the\ngraders take 31% less time while grading a single response and 33% less grading\ntime while grading a single answer sheet using AI assistance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
