For\nthese technologies to be effective, they must work reliably for all users while\npreserving individual privacy. Although tradeoffs between privacy and utility,\nas well as fairness and utility, have been extensively researched, the specific\ninterplay between privacy and fairness in speech processing remains\nunderexplored. This review and position paper offers an overview of emerging\nprivacy-fairness tradeoffs throughout the entire machine learning lifecycle for\nspeech processing. By drawing on well-established frameworks on fairness and\nprivacy, we examine existing biases and sources of privacy harm that coexist\nduring the development of speech processing models. We then highlight how\ncorresponding privacy-enhancing technologies have the potential to\ninadvertently increase these biases and how bias mitigation strategies may\nconversely reduce privacy. By raising open questions, we advocate for a\ncomprehensive evaluation of privacy-fairness tradeoffs for speech technology\nand the development of privacy-enhancing and fairness-aware algorithms in this\ndomain.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"C5xog7BE4rEJVbi7IDVPgxxiWSvOFZbcYYNKhbl4YZE","pdfSize":"267646"}
