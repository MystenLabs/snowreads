A special case of\nthese solutions is the truncated Lamb dipole, whose stream function corresponds\nto the second eigenfunction of the Dirichlet Laplacian. The proof is achieved\nby establishing a suitable variational characterization for these solutions via\nconserved quantities of the Euler equation and employing a compactness\nargument.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
