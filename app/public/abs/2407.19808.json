Our proposal offers sentences inside sentences for cases introduced\nby quotation marks and hyphens, and also pays particular attention to\nsituations involving incises introduced by parentheses and lists introduced by\ncolons. We present how the tool works and compare the results obtained with\nthose available in 2019 on the same dataset, together with an evaluation of the\nsystem's performance on a test corpus\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
