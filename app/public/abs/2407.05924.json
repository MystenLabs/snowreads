This\npaper proposes a novel approach to decomposing multiple human bodies into\nsemantic part regions in unconstrained environments. Specifically we propose a\nconvolutional neural network (CNN) architecture which comprises of novel\nsemantic and contour attention mechanisms across feature hierarchy to resolve\nthe semantic ambiguities and boundary localization issues related to semantic\nbody parsing. We further propose to encode estimated pose as higher-level\ncontextual information which is combined with local semantic cues in a novel\ngraphical model in a principled manner. In this proposed model, the lower-level\nsemantic cues can be recursively updated by propagating higher-level contextual\ninformation from estimated pose and vice versa across the graph, so as to\nalleviate erroneous pose information and pixel level predictions. We further\npropose an optimization technique to efficiently derive the solutions. Our\nproposed method achieves the state-of-art results on the challenging Pascal\nPerson-Part dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oY4dFlK8VXqnDR_JDXPie0mEOedV9Qxk3cxk-9wRHFo","pdfSize":"7409898"}
