Additionally, we\nstudy a subfamily of nilpotent matroids, called weak nilpotent matroids, and\ncompute a finite set of defining equations of their associated matroid\nvarieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
