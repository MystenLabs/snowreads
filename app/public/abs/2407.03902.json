Different\nfrom the existing literature, which has commonly focused on IRS beamforming\noptimization, in this paper, we pay special attention to designing effective\nsignal processing approaches to extract sensing information from IRS-reshaped\necho signals. To this end, we investigate an IRS-assisted non-line-of-sight\n(NLOS) target detection and multi-parameter estimation problem in orthogonal\nfrequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. To address this problem, we\nfirst propose a novel detection and direction estimation framework, including a\nlow-overhead hierarchical codebook that allows the IRS to generate\nthree-dimensional beams with adjustable beam direction and width, a delay\nspectrum peak-based beam training scheme for detection and direction\nestimation, and a beam refinement scheme for further enhancing the accuracy of\nthe direction estimation. Then, we propose a target range and velocity\nestimation scheme by extracting the delay-Doppler information from the\nIRS-reshaped echo signals. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed\nschemes can achieve 99.7% target detection rate, a 10^{-3}-rad level direction\nestimation accuracy, and a 10^{-6}-m/10^{-5}-m/s level range/velocity\nestimation accuracy.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
