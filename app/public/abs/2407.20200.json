In this work,\nwe use the structure of Gram matrices to relate the representation theory of\n$SL(2)$ to $SO(2)$. Informally, we prove that if $p$ is a sum of squares and\nlives in some of the invariant subspaces of $SO(2)$, then it has a positive\nsemidefinite Gram matrix that lives in certain invariant subspaces of $SL(2)$.\nThe tools used in the proof construction are of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RUGwP5lh12yzWmYjCDU_4gtyeyYEFY9jwITKiT1D2ck","pdfSize":"185677","objectId":"0xabdbdfaca231f3a54a6ad0a4e337697fc22d4a22d6da7994c80a2160c50f6203","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
