Similar to the counterpart at heterochiral interfaces, the\ninterfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (IDMI) originating from a\nheavy-metal substrate is important for the emergence of SWGHE. More\ninterestingly, the SWGHE can even survive in ferromagnets with biaxial\nanisotropy (either intrinsic or caused by shape anisotropy) in the absence of\nIDMI due to the unique 360DW-induced potentials which are distinct to the\nwell-known P\\\"{o}schl-Teller ones. Numerics shows that these lateral\ndisplacements are generally fractions of the spin-wave wavelength. They can be\nfurther enhanced by an array of well-separated 360DWs thus provide a large\nvariety for spin-wave manipulation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
