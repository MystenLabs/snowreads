We construct a causal\ngraph to address both biases and describe the abstract data generation\nmechanism. Then, we use it as a guide to develop a novel Debiased Contrastive\nLearning framework for Mitigating Dual Biases, called DCLMDB. In DCLMDB, both\npopularity bias and conformity bias are handled in the model training process\nby contrastive learning to ensure that user choices and recommended items are\nnot unduly influenced by conformity and popularity. Extensive experiments on\ntwo real-world datasets, Movielens-10M and Netflix, show that DCLMDB can\neffectively reduce the dual biases, as well as significantly enhance the\naccuracy and diversity of recommendations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"57kAmObPU4zy6q7KMUd_HHpjeJj8gp7OP3ZmD7DipzE","pdfSize":"412594"}
