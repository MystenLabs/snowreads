After surveying the evidence supporting the hypothesis, I\ndiscuss ways in which it can be tested. There are many ways to investigate it,\ntheoretically and experimentally. They include connectome studies,\ncomputational modelling, experimental neuroscience, genomics and proteomics,\nstudies of animal behaviour, and biophysics. If the wave exists, there is a\ncompelling case to identify it as the source of consciousness. This would\nadvance our understanding of one of the greatest scientific challenges of all\ntime, while changing our view of the human mind.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
