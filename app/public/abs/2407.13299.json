Going forward, it will be essential for\nsimulation software to run on this new generation of machines without\nsacrificing scientific fidelity. In this paper, we examine the precision\nrequirements of a representative kernel from quantum chemistry calculations:\ncalculation of the single particle density matrix from a given mean field\nHamiltonian (i.e. Hartree-Fock or Density Functional Theory) represented in an\nLCAO basis. We find that double precision affords an unnecessarily high level\nof precision, leading to optimization opportunities. We show how an\napproximation built from an error-free matrix multiplication transformation can\nbe used to potentially accelerate this kernel on future hardware. Our results\nprovide a road map for adapting quantum chemistry software for the next\ngeneration of High Performance Computing platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
