This leverages on Quantum concepts and algorithms which\nincludes the principle of qubit superposition, entanglement and teleportation,\ncoupled with Grover's Algorithm to enable a more efficient search through the\nrainbow table. The paper also details on the hardware constraints and the work\naround to produce better results in the implementation stages. Through this\nwork we develop a working prototype of quantum rainbow table and demonstrate\nhow quantum computing could significantly improve the speed of cyber tools such\nas password crackers and thus impact the cyber security landscape.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"dnyecouIyfcrYAt-DHkvn3e-cBxfCPte7AkmA2lP_HE","pdfSize":"362735"}
