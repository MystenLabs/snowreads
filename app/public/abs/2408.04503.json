The key ingredient of the entire procedure is the\ncomputation of a subspace which is close to the column space of the target\nmatrix $\\mathbf{A}$ up to a certain probabilistic confidence. In this paper we\npropose a modification to the standard randomized SVD procedure which leads, in\ngeneral, to better approximations to $\\text{Range}(\\mathbf{A})$ at the same\ncomputational cost. To this end, we explicitly construct information from the\nrow space of $\\mathbf{A}$ enhancing the quality of our approximation. We also\nobserve that very few pieces of information from $\\text{Range}(\\mathbf{A}^T)$\nare indeed necessary. We thus design a variant of our algorithm equipped with a\nsubsampling step which largely increases the efficiency of our procedure while\nattaining competitive accuracy records. Our findings are supported by both\ntheoretical analysis and numerical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hpejXTKOmF4ylE3TpN3SP_nvF2lvo61HSmRpYQY1SUU","pdfSize":"1268012"}
