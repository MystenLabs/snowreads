We use this problem as an example to\nstudy the effect of different hyper parameters such as information encoding,\nthe number of hidden units in a fully connected reservoir, the choice of the\nleaky parameter and the reset mechanism in terms of reset-to-zero and\nreset-by-subtraction based on different refractory times. The distributions of\nthe weight matrices give insight into the difficulty, respectively the\nprobability, to find a solution. This leads to the observation that zero\nrefractory time together with graded spikes and an adapted reset mechanism,\nreset-to-mod, makes it possible to realize sparse solutions of a minimal\nconfiguration with only two neurons in the hidden layer to resolve all binary\nlogic gate constellations with XOR as a special case.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
