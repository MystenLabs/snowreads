Then we demonstrate that a conformally flat generalized\nRicci-recurrent spacetime with certain condition is a pseudo quasi-Einstein\nspacetime. Besides, it is proved that a pseudo generalized Ricci-recurrent\ngeneralized Robertson-Walker spacetime represents a perfect fluid spacetime.\nLastly, we study the impact of this spacetime under $f(\\mathcal{R},T^2)$ and\n$f\\left(\\mathcal{R}^{\\ast}\\right)$ gravity scenario and deduce several energy\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
