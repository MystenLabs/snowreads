We show that stochastic gradient\ndescent approaches can be leveraged to offer convergence to a solution that\nreveals the underlying ranking while requiring low-memory operations. We\nintroduce several variations of this approach that offer a tradeoff in speed\nand convergence when the pairwise comparisons are noisy (i.e., some comparisons\ndo not respect the underlying ranking). We prove theoretical results for\nconvergence almost surely and study several regimes including those with full\nobservations, partial observations, and noisy observations. Our empirical\nresults give insights into the number of observations required as well as how\nmuch noise in those measurements can be tolerated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
