Recently, MI has garnered\nsignificant attention for interpreting transformer-based language models (LMs),\nresulting in many novel insights yet introducing new challenges. However, there\nhas not been work that comprehensively reviews these insights and challenges,\nparticularly as a guide for newcomers to this field. To fill this gap, we\npresent a comprehensive survey outlining fundamental objects of study in MI,\ntechniques that have been used for its investigation, approaches for evaluating\nMI results, and significant findings and applications stemming from the use of\nMI to understand LMs. In particular, we present a roadmap for beginners to\nnavigate the field and leverage MI for their benefit. Finally, we also identify\ncurrent gaps in the field and discuss potential future directions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
