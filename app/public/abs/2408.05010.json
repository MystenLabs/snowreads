In this article, we focus on\nthe decays yielding a pair of $\\it{\\Phi}$ mesons to investigate the presence of\nentanglement in the spin correlations of the system and quantify the amount of\nBell inequality violation it entails. Our results show that the present LHCb\ndata allows access to entanglement and to the Bell inequality violation with a\nsignificance exceeding the 5$\\sigma$ threshold in both the cases. This\ndemonstrates that the strong and electroweak interactions responsible for the\n$B$ meson decay act as a source of entanglement and the quantum mechanics\nnature of high-energy phenomena. Particular attention is paid to the assessment\nof loopholes: deficiencies in the experimental setup which could invalidate the\nresults of the Bell test.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
