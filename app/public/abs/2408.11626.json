In SMEFT, this mixing arises\nexclusively from a dimension-6 operator involving the Standard Model Higgs\ndoublet, while the real triplet scalar field introduces an additional\ndimension-5 operator. We derive the modifications to electroweak gauge boson\nproperties and impose constraints using electroweak precision data. In SMEFT,\nwe find that $Z$ pole data at LEP-I imposes a stringent constraint on the\nkinetic mixing parameter, requiring it to be less than $O$($10^{-4}$), which\ncorresponds to a new physics scale of about 10 TeV. In the SMEFT+triplet\nscenario, the constraint can be significantly relaxed with a sizeable triplet\nvacuum expectation value while preserving custodial symmetry in a finely-tuned\nparameter space. Future measurements from the Circular Electron Positron\nCollider could probe the kinetic mixing parameter down to an order of magnitude\nsmaller.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
