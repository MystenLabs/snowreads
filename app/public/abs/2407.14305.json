To evaluate the numerical\nstability, we calculate the constraint amplification factor by the eigenvalue\nanalysis of the evolution of the constraint. We propose a modification to the\ntime evolution equations of the cBSSN formulation for a higher numerical\nstability. Furthermore, we perform numerical simulations using the modified\nformulation to confirm its improved stability.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
