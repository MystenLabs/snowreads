In particular we study in detail the Jacobi\nidentity and the double residue condition for soft insertions, hard momentum\nspace insertions, and hard celestial insertions. In the latter case we\nintroduce the notion of a \"hard current\" in CFT and work through examples in\nthe 2D critical Ising model. The current algebra of hard insertions in pure\nEinstein gravity is a slight conceptual generalization of the familiar\n$w_{1+\\infty}$-wedge current algebra. We also review branch cut terms in the\ncelestial OPE, which indicate new primary content and were previously missed\nuntil recently. We work through an explicit toy example illustrating the\nmechanism by which such branch cut terms can arise. These branch cut terms\nprevent a symmetry interpretation but are fully compatible with a consistent\nOPE.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"p2cZwikXWeyJfNkjk5naF3bAPeunKA9mutoRjGof5e0","pdfSize":"703602","objectId":"0x7d56638bdd2be1617d902c672c5947dc211fd5bbee63b48b6a27e14181d0499e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
