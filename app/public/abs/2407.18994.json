The\ngoal of the tester is to reach some given state, so as to satisfy a coverage\ncriterion, while monitoring the violation of the requirements. We develop an\napproach based on Monte Carlo Tree Search, which is a classical technique in\nreinforcement learning for efficiently selecting promising inputs. Seeing the\nautomata requirements as a game between the implementation and the tester, we\ndevelop a heuristic by biasing the search towards inputs that are promising in\nthis game. We experimentally show that our heuristic accelerates the\nconvergence of the Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm, thus improving the\nperformance of testing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
