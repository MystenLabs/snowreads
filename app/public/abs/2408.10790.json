Yet, this shift brings challenges due\nto mass electric vehicle adoption and the lack of methods to adequately assess\nvarious EV charging algorithms and their ecosystem impacts. This paper\nintroduces a multi-agent based simulation model, validated through a case study\nof a Danish radial distribution network serving 126 households. The study\nreveals that traditional charging leads to grid overload by 2031 at 67% EV\npenetration, while decentralized strategies like Real-Time Pricing could cause\noverloads as early as 2028. The developed multi-agent based simulation\ndemonstrates its ability to offer detailed, hourly analysis of future load\nprofiles in distribution grids, and therefore, can be applied to other\nprospective scenarios in similar energy systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2wEWuH0HAXMlSuyXTpoC3e3lyyg9IP_W5U34lRE4RtA","pdfSize":"815479"}
