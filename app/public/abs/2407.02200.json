In a recent paper, Gluesing-Luerssen et al. (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 89,\n447-470, 2021) showed that the study of the distance distribution of a single\norbit cyclic subspace code is equivalent to the study of its intersection\ndistribution. In this paper we have proved that in the orbit of a subspace $U$\nof $\\mathbb{F}_{q^n}$ that has the stabilizer $\\mathbb{F}_{q^t}^*(t \\neq n)$,\nthe number of codeword pairs $(U,\\alpha U)$ such that $\\dim(U\\cap \\alpha U)=i$\nfor any $i,~ 0\\leq i < \\dim(U)$, is a multiple of $q^t(q^t+1)$, if\n$\\frac{n}{t}$ is an odd number. In the case of even $\\frac{n}{t}$, if $U$\ncontains $\\frac{q^{2tm}-1}{q^{2t}-1}~ (m\\geq 0)$ distinct cyclic shifts of\n$\\mathbb{F}_{q^{2t}}$, then the number of codeword pairs $(U,\\alpha U)$ with\nintersection dimension $2tm$ is equal to $q^t+rq^t(q^t+1)$, for some\nnon-negative integer $r$; and the number of codeword pairs $(U,\\alpha U)$ with\nintersection dimension $i,~(i\\neq 2tm)$ is a multiple of $q^t(q^t+1)$. Some\nexamples have been given to illustrate the results presented in the paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
