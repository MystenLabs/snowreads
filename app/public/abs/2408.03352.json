Here, utilizing dilution-refrigerator-based scanning\ntunneling microscopy (STM) down to 30mK, we observe chiral 2 by 2 pair density\nwaves with residual Fermi arcs in RbV3Sb5. We find a superconducting gap of\n150{\\mu}eV with substantial residual in-gap states. The spatial distribution of\nthis gap exhibits chiral 2 by 2 modulations, signaling a chiral pair density\nwave (PDW). Our quasi-particle interference imaging of the zero-energy residual\nstates further reveals arc-like patterns. We discuss the relation of the gap\nmodulations with the residual Fermi arcs under the space-momentum\ncorrespondence between PDW and Bogoliubov Fermi states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"a1kW6s3qxCEKi5aQp_MXgNRt6lnma66Lpn0OhG8UPMc","pdfSize":"1050375"}
