The resulting invariance of the entropy\n$S$ for quasistatic changes in thermally isolated systems invites a connection\nwith Noether's theorem (only established later). In this quest, we continue an\nidea, first brought up by Wald in black hole thermodynamics and by Sasa\n$\\textit{et al.}$ in various contexts. We follow both Lagrangian and\nHamiltonian frameworks, and emphasize the role of Killing equations for\nderiving a First Law for thermodynamically consistent trajectories, to end up\nwith an expression of ``heat over temperature'' as an exact differential of a\nNoether charge.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
