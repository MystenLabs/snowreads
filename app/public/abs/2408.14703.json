If a household is on a\nprepaid electricity program, it can be automatically and immediately\ndisconnected from service if there is no balance in its prepaid account. Such\nhouseholds need to actively ration the amount of energy they use by deciding\nwhich appliances to use and for how long. We present a tool that helps\nhouseholds extend the availability of their critical appliances by limiting the\nuse of discretionary ones, and prevent disconnections. The proposed method is\nbased on a linear optimization problem that only uses average power demand as\nan input and can be solved to optimality using a simple greedy approach. We\ncompare the model with two mixed-integer linear programming models that require\nmore detailed demand forecasts and optimization solvers for implementation. In\na numerical case study based on real household data, we assess the performance\nof the different models under different accuracy and granularity of demand\nforecasts. Our results show that our proposed linear model is much simpler to\nimplement, while providing similar performance under realistic circumstances.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
