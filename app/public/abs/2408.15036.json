The magnetic layer is\npurposely designed to establish a magnetic easy axis neither along a high\nsymmetry nor mirror axes to promote 3D magnetic helical order on the curved\nsurface. In practice, two types of magnetic textures with in-plane\nmagnetization were found inside the nanostructures' facets: magnetic domains\nwith almost longitudinal or almost perpendicular magnetization with respect to\nthe axis of the tube. We observe that a magnetic field applied perpendicular to\nthe long axis of the nanostructure can add an azimuthal component of the\nmagnetization to the previously almost longitudinal magnetization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
