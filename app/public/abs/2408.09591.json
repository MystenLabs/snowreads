(AAAI 2024) considered the problem of generating instances\nwith a unique minimum vertex cover under certain conditions. The Pre-assignment\nfor Uniquification of Minimum Vertex Cover problem (shortly PAU-VC) is the\nproblem, for given a graph $G$, to find a minimum set $S$ of vertices in $G$\nsuch that there is a unique minimum vertex cover of $G$ containing $S$. We show\nthat PAU-VC is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by clique-width, which\nimproves an exponential algorithm for trees given by Horiyama et al. Among\nnatural graph classes with unbounded clique-width, we show that the problem can\nbe solved in linear time on split graphs and unit interval graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
