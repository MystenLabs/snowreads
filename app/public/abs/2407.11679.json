More precisely, we establish the\nestimate $\\left \\arrowvert\\mathrm{III}(S_a) \\right \\arrowvert = H(S_a)^{1 +\no(1)}$ as $a \\rightarrow \\infty$, where $H(S_a)$ denotes the exponential height\nof $S_a$. Our method is to prove that each $S_a$ satisfies the BSD conjecture,\nanalyse the geometry and arithmetic of its N\\'eron model and give an explicit\nexpression for its $L$-function in terms of Gauss and Kloosterman sums. By\nstudying the relative distribution of the angles associated to these character\nsums, we estimate the size of the central value of $L(S_a, T)$, hence the order\nof $\\mathrm{III}(S_a)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
