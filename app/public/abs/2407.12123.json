We derive the master equations for\ngeneral hypernetworks, and use them to obtain explicit expressions for the\nexpected adoption/infection level on infinite complete hypernetworks, infinite\nErd\\H{o}s-R\\'enyi hypernetworks, and on infinite hyperlines. These expressions\nare exact, as they are derived without making any approximation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
