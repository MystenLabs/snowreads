We assume knowledge of basic quantum mechanics -- the\nSchr\\\"{o}dinger evolution of states in Hilbert space, the Born probability\nrule, the Dirac formalism, and so on -- while explicating such ideas as\nprojectors, density operators, Bell inequalities, entanglement and the Lindblad\nequation. In other words this work is a \\emph{primer} in the simplest sense of\nthat word: without taking a stand on the major questions, it is intended to\nmake an enormous and growing body of research more accessible.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
