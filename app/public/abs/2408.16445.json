However,\nrecent advancements have seen a shift towards learning-based methods. Given the\nrapid pace of research and the frequent introduction of new image matching\nmethods, it is essential to evaluate them. In this paper, we present a\ncomprehensive evaluation of various image matching methods using a\nstructure-from-motion pipeline. We assess the performance of these methods on\nboth in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, identifying key limitations in both\nthe methods and benchmarks. We also investigate the impact of edge detection as\na pre-processing step. Our analysis reveals that image matching for 3D\nreconstruction remains an open challenge, necessitating careful selection and\ntuning of models for specific scenarios, while also highlighting mismatches in\nhow metrics currently represent method performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
