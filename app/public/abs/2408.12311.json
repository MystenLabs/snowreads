Analyzing\nhow investors use DeFi is important for reaching a better understanding of\ntheir usage and for regulation purposes. However, analyzing DeFi transactions\nis challenging due to often incomplete or inaccurate labeled data. This paper\npresents a method to extract ego network motifs from the token transfer\nnetwork, capturing the transfer of tokens between users and smart contracts.\nOur results demonstrate that smart contract methods performing specific DeFi\noperations can be efficiently identified by analyzing these motifs while\nproviding insights into account activities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
