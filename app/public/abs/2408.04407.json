Propagation models including clutter information have been\nshown to significantly increase model accuracy. This paper explores the\napplication of deep learning to satellite imagery to identify environmental\nclutter types automatically. Recognizing these clutter types has numerous uses,\nbut our main application is to use clutter information to enhance propagation\nprediction models. Knowing the type of obstruction (tree, building, and further\nclassifications) can improve the prediction accuracy of key propagation metrics\nsuch as path loss.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
