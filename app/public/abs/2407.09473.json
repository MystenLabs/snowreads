Style transfer can enhance these 3D assets\nwith diverse artistic styles, transforming creative expression. However,\nexisting techniques are often slow or unable to localize style transfer to\nspecific objects. We introduce StyleSplat, a lightweight method for stylizing\n3D objects in scenes represented by 3D Gaussians from reference style images.\nOur approach first learns a photorealistic representation of the scene using 3D\nGaussian splatting while jointly segmenting individual 3D objects. We then use\na nearest-neighbor feature matching loss to finetune the Gaussians of the\nselected objects, aligning their spherical harmonic coefficients with the style\nimage to ensure consistency and visual appeal. StyleSplat allows for quick,\ncustomizable style transfer and localized stylization of multiple objects\nwithin a scene, each with a different style. We demonstrate its effectiveness\nacross various 3D scenes and styles, showcasing enhanced control and\ncustomization in 3D creation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z9AApGKpv7ygTaiiGe6uauskPL-2rctVeOmVDVVhrYI","pdfSize":"29299266"}
