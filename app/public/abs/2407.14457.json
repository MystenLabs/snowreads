We show the mapped solutions\nsatisfy the field equations of the Chern-Simons formulation of AdS Carroll\ngravity and exhibit a Carroll geometry structure. Despite the presence of a\nnegative cosmological constant in the mapped spacetime, the algebra of the\ncanonical generators of the asymptotic symmetries is given by the\n$\\mathfrak{bms}_3$ algebra.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
