We explore using\ndiffusion as a model class for the successor state measure (SSM) of a policy.\nWe find that enforcing the Bellman flow constraints leads to a simple Bellman\nupdate on the diffusion step distribution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
