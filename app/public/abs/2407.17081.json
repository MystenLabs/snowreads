However,\nnovice researchers unfamiliar with a particular field may not significantly\nimprove their efficiency in interacting with Generative AI because they have\nnot developed divergent thinking in that field. This study aims to develop an\nin-depth Survey Forest Diagram that guides novice researchers in divergent\nthinking about the research topic by indicating the citation clues among\nmultiple papers, to help expand the survey perspective for novice researchers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
