This gives a classification of\nall closed proper manifolds locally modelled on such Shilov boundaries, and\nprovides a positive answer, in the case of flag manifolds admitting a\n$\\Theta$-positive structure, to a rigidity question of Limbeek and Zimmer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
