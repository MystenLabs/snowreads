In this work,\nwe propose a novel approach, RandomNet, that employs untrained deep neural\nnetworks to cluster time series. RandomNet uses different sets of random\nweights to extract diverse representations of time series and then ensembles\nthe clustering relationships derived from these different representations to\nbuild the final clustering results. By extracting diverse representations, our\nmodel can effectively handle time series with different characteristics. Since\nall parameters are randomly generated, no training is required during the\nprocess. We provide a theoretical analysis of the effectiveness of the method.\nTo validate its performance, we conduct extensive experiments on all of the 128\ndatasets in the well-known UCR time series archive and perform statistical\nanalysis of the results. These datasets have different sizes, sequence lengths,\nand they are from diverse fields. The experimental results show that the\nproposed method is competitive compared with existing state-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
