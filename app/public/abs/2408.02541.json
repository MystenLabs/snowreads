The (Caputo) fractional time derivative\nrequires the full problem history which is contained within an iterative\nprocedure with the resulting numerical method requiring a static memory at\nacross all time steps without loss of accuracy. The Spatial domain is treated\nby the Fourier k-space method, with derivatives on a uniform grid. Numerically\ncomparisons are made against a model for the same power-law absorption with\nloss described by the fractional- Laplacian operator. One advantage of the\nfractional time derivative over the Fractional Laplacian is the local treatment\nof the power-law, allowing for a spatially varying frequency power-law.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"aZQWZGyisd6wAeYSE5FNVYC-e_50LK3Al2wONEUo23k","pdfSize":"1188018"}
