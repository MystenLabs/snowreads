Finding a shortest $M$-link path from $1$ to $N$ in $G$ for any\ngiven $1<M<N-1$ has many applications. In this paper, we give a\ncontract-and-conquer algorithm for this problem which runs in $O\\left(\n\\sqrt{NM\\left( N-M\\right) \\log\\left( N-M\\right) }\\right) $ time and $O\\left(\nN\\right) $ space. It is the first $o\\left( NM\\right) $-time algorithm with\nlinear space complexity, and its time complexity decreases with $M$ when $M\\geq\nN/2$. In contrast, all previous strongly polynomial algorithms have running\ntime growing with $M$. For both $O\\left( poly\\left( \\log N\\right) \\right) $ and\n$N-O\\left( poly\\left( \\log N\\right) \\right) $ regimes of $M$, our algorithm has\nrunning time $O\\left( N\\cdot poly\\left( \\log N\\right) \\right) $, which\npartially answers an open question rased in \\cite{AST94} affirmatively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
