A significant achievement\nincludes an analogue of Iwasawa class number formula, which describes the\nasymptotic growth of the numbers of spanning trees for $\\mathbb{Z}_p$-coverings\nof graphs. Moreover, an analogue of Kida's formula concerning the behavior of\nthe $\\lambda$- and $\\mu$-invariants is obtained for unramified coverings. In\nthis paper, we establish Kida's formula for possibly ramified coverings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
