However, the DFRC receiver (DFRC-R) is\ntasked with both uplink communication signal detection and simultaneously\ntarget-related parameter estimation from the echoes, leading to issues with\nmutual interference. In this paper, a projection-based scheme is proposed to\nequivalently transform the joint signal detection and target estimation problem\ninto a joint signal detection process across multiple snapshots. Compared with\nconventional successive interference cancellation (SIC) schemes, our proposed\napproach achieves a higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and a higher ergodic\nrate when the radar signal is non-negligible. Nonetheless, it introduces an\nill-conditioned signal detection problem, which is addressed using a non-linear\ndetector. By jointly processing an increased number of snapshots, the proposed\nscheme can achieve high S&C performance simultaneously.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
