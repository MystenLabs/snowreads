This paper provides a new measurement of\nthe amplitude of the matter power spectrum, $\\sigma_8$, using galaxy-galaxy and\ngalaxy-CMB lensing power spectra of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Legacy\nImaging Surveys Emission-Line Galaxies and the $\\textit{Planck}$ 2018 CMB\nlensing map. We create an ELG catalog composed of $27$ million galaxies and\nwith a purity of $85\\%$, covering a redshift range $0 < z < 3$, with $z_{\\rm\nmean} = 1.09$. We implement several novel systematic corrections, such as\njointly modeling the contribution of imaging systematics and photometric\nredshift uncertainties to the covariance matrix. We also study the impacts of\nvarious dust maps on cosmological parameter inference. We measure the\ncross-power spectra over $f_{\\rm sky} = 0.25$ with a signal-to-background ratio\nof up to $ 30\\sigma$. We find that the choice of dust maps to account for\nimaging systematics in estimating the ELG overdensity field has a significant\nimpact on the final estimated values of $\\sigma_8$ and $\\Omega_{\\rm M}$, with\nfar-infrared emission-based dust maps preferring $\\sigma_8$ to be as low as\n$0.702 \\pm 0.030$, and stellar-reddening-based dust maps preferring as high as\n$0.719 \\pm 0.030$. The highest preferred value is at $\\sim 3 \\sigma$ tension\nwith the $\\textit{Planck}$ primary anisotropy results. These findings indicate\na need for tomographic analyses at high redshifts and joint modeling of\nsystematics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
