Through coarse-graining fine-scale observations, our\nmodeling framework simplifies these complex systems to a set of tractable\nmechanistic relationships -- in the form of ordinary differential equations --\nwhile preserving critical system behaviors. This approach allows for expedited\n'what if' studies and sensitivity analyses, essential for informed\npolicy-making. Our findings, from a case study of Baltimore, MD, indicate that\nthis machine learning-augmented coarse-grained model serves as a powerful\ninstrument for deciphering the complex interactions between social factors,\ngeography, and exogenous stressors, offering a valuable asset for system\nforecasting and resilience planning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
