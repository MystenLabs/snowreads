The\nprevious best construction, achieved through the syndrome compression\ntechnique, had a redundancy of at most $7\\log n+O\\left(\\log n/\\log\\log\nn\\right)$ bits. In contrast, our work introduces a novel approach for\nconstructing $q$-ary codes that attain a redundancy of at most $5\\log\nn+O(\\log\\log n)$ bits for all $b>1$ and $q\\ge2$. Additionally, for the case\nwhere $b=1$, we present a new construction of $q$-ary two-deletion correcting\ncodes with a redundancy of $5\\log n+O(\\log\\log n)$ bits, for all $q>2$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
