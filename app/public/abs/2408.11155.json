However, the sensors and communication\nchannels of these robots are often vulnerable to cyberattacks and faults, which\ncan disrupt their individual behavior and the overall objective of the MRS. In\nthis work, we present a multi-robot integrity monitoring framework that\nutilizes inter-robot range measurements to (i) detect the presence of\ncyberattacks or faults affecting the MRS, (ii) identify the affected robot(s),\nand (iii) reconstruct the resulting localization error of these robot(s). The\nproposed iterative algorithm leverages sequential convex programming and\nalternating direction of multipliers method to enable real-time and distributed\nimplementation. Our approach is validated using numerical simulations and\ndemonstrated using PX4-SiTL in Gazebo on an MRS, where certain agents deviate\nfrom their desired position due to a GNSS spoofing attack. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the scalability and interoperability of our algorithm through\nmixed-reality experiments by forming a heterogeneous MRS comprising real\nCrazyflie UAVs and virtual PX4-SiTL UAVs working in tandem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xRVde8PwRjeIBXrF-cLTSbAcJBH9rlV94zeDK51Ditc","pdfSize":"2169846"}
