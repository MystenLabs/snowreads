We show that there are only four classes of scalar\npotentials, merely one more than in two Higgs doublet models (2HDM). In 2HDM\nwith generalized CP symmetries extended to the Yukawa sector, there are only\ntwo possible cases: the usual CP, with 18 real Yukawa couplings; and a minimal\ngeneralized CP model, with 12 real Yukawa parameters. In contrast, with three\nHiggs there is a rich variety of allowed models. We classify all possible\nYukawa textures, showing that there are 40 possibilities, several of which have\nonly 10 real Yukawa couplings.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
