However, this approach has ultimately proved insufficient to properly\ncapture a range of complex behaviours that have been reported in three\ndimensions. To address this, we argue that a finer understanding of topology is\nrequired, in which non-singular but non-trivial topological solitons -\nso-called merons - play a central role in mediating interactions between\ndisclination lines. We present a comprehensive framework for capturing such\nbehaviour that draws heavily on aspects of Morse theory; the key notion being\nthat merons appear singular under projection onto a two-dimensional surface.\nThis permits the use of singularity theory and dividing curves to characterise\nnematic textures via tomography, as well as an understanding of topological\ntransitions via surgery theory. We use our ideas to understand and classify\ncomplex three-dimensional behaviours, such as the linking, rewiring and\ncrossing of disclination lines, as well as to provide a new perspective on\ndefect charge.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
