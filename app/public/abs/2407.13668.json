This partition\nfunction, specified at past and future null infinity in the case of massless\nparticles, generates Carrollian correlation functions that encode the S-matrix.\nWe explore this connection, including the realization of symmetries, soft\ntheorems arising from large gauge transformations, and the correspondence with\nstandard momentum space amplitudes. This framework is also well-suited for\nembedding the Minkowski space S-matrix into the AdS/CFT duality in the large\nradius limit. In particular, we identify the AdS and Carrollian partition\nfunctions through a simple map between their respective asymptotic data,\nestablishing a direct correspondence between the actions of symmetries on both\nsides. Our approach thus provides a coherent framework that ties together\nvarious topics extensively studied in recent and past literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
