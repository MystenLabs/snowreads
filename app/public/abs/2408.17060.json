Our method leverages the advantages of LoRA to\nfine-tune SDXL models, thereby significantly improving image restoration\nquality and efficiency. We collect 2600 high-quality real-world images, each\nwith detailed descriptive text, for training the model. The proposed method is\nevaluated on standard benchmarks and achieves excellent performance,\ndemonstrated by higher peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), lower learned\nperceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS), and higher structural similarity\nindex measurement (SSIM) scores. These results underscore the effectiveness of\ncombining LoRA with SDXL for advanced image restoration tasks, highlighting the\npotential of our approach in generating high-fidelity restored images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
