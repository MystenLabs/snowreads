In 2013, Peled, Samotij, and Yehudayoff showed that random\n$M$-Lipschitz functions on graphs with sufficiently good expansion typically\nexhibit small fluctuations, giving sharp bounds on the typical range of such\nfunctions, assuming $M$ is not too large. We prove that the same conclusion\nholds under a relaxed expansion condition and for larger $M$, (partially)\nanswering questions of Peled et al. Our techniques involve a combination of\nSapozhenko's graph container methods and entropy methods from information\ntheory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
