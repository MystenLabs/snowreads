Localisation can arise due to an interaction\nbetween the polymer and the interface, and can be altered by a preference for\nthe bulk solvent on one side or by the application of a force to manipulate the\npolymer. Different combinations of these three effects give slightly different\nstatistical mechanical behaviours. The canonical lattice model of polymers is\nthe self-avoiding walk which we mainly study with Monte Carlo simulation to\ncalculate the phase diagram and critical phenomena. For comparison, a solvable\ndirected walk version is also defined and the phase diagrams are compared for\neach case. We find broad agreement between the two models, and most minor\ndifferences can be understood as due to the different entropic contributions.\nIn the limit where the bulk solvent on one side is overwhelmingly preferred we\nsee how the localisation transition transforms to the adsorption transition;\nthe permeable interface becomes effectively an impermeable surface.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
