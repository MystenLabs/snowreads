Contrarily,\nmost sound manipulation relies on active transduction in fluid media rather\nthan relying on passive scattering principles, as are often found in nature. In\nthis work, we utilize computational morphogenesis to synthesize complex\nenergy-efficient wavelength-sized single-material scattering structures that\npassively decompose radiated sound into its spatio-spectral components.\nSpecifically, we tailor an acoustic rainbow structure with \"above unity\"\nefficiency and an acoustic wavelength-splitter. Our work paves the way for a\nnew frontier in sound-field engineering, with potential applications in\ntransduction, bionics, energy harvesting, communications and sensing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
