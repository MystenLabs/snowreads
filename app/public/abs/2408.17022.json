Here, we\nconsider streams of regular, rectangular data sets and use spatial ordinal\npatterns (SOPs) as a non-parametric approach to detect spatial dependencies. A\nkey feature of our proposed SOP charts is that they are distribution-free and\ndo not require prior Phase-I analysis. We conduct an extensive simulation\nstudy, demonstrating the superiority and effectiveness of the proposed charts\ncompared to traditional parametric approaches. We apply the SOP-based control\ncharts to detect heavy rainfall in Germany, war-related fires in (eastern)\nUkraine, and manufacturing defects in textile production. The wide range of\napplications and insights illustrate the broad utility of our non-parametric\napproach.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
