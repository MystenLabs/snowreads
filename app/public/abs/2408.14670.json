This\nauxiliary tape is initially filled with arbitrary content. The machine can read\nand write on the auxiliary tape, but it is constrained to restore its initial\ncontent when it halts. Studying such a model and finding its powers and\nlimitations has practical applications.\n  In this paper, we study catalytic Turing machines with O(log n)-sized work\ntape and polynomial-sized auxiliary tape that are allowed to lose at most\nconstant many bits of the auxiliary tape when they halt. We show that such\ncatalytic Turing machines can only decide the same set of languages as standard\ncatalytic Turing machines with the same size work and auxiliary tape.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
