The invariant tori,\nwhich manifest as closed flux surfaces in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF)\nmachines, are the dominant structure influencing the radial transport and,\nconsequently, the overall confinement performance.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
