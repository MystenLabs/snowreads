If improperly designed, the rotating station could end up\ncatastrophically tumbling end-over-end. Active stabilization can address this\nproblem; however, designing the station with passive rotation stability\nprovides a lower-cost solution. This paper presents passive rotational\nstability guidelines for four space station geometries. Station stability is\nfirst analyzed with thin-shell and thick-shell models. Stability is also\nanalyzed with models of the station's major constituent parts, including outer\nshells, spokes, floors, air, and shuttle bays.\n","subjects":["Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"eImGBZ5aGjlqFS08z2oeSNTDzassvrNvnoGy6Pq2czM","pdfSize":"2769969"}
