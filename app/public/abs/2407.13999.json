The recently introduced NeLLCom framework (Lian et al.,\n2023) allows agents to first learn an artificial language and then use it to\ncommunicate, with the aim of studying the emergence of specific linguistics\nproperties. We extend this framework (NeLLCom-X) by introducing more realistic\nrole-alternating agents and group communication in order to investigate the\ninterplay between language learnability, communication pressures, and group\nsize effects. We validate NeLLCom-X by replicating key findings from prior\nresearch simulating the emergence of a word-order/case-marking trade-off. Next,\nwe investigate how interaction affects linguistic convergence and emergence of\nthe trade-off. The novel framework facilitates future simulations of diverse\nlinguistic aspects, emphasizing the importance of interaction and group\ndynamics in language evolution.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XQuF7zykJhNMR3kXVYeb1Iqbx1YiDksx4FxufQ0jEuY","pdfSize":"2332961"}
