In this setting, the\nnudging filter can formally be viewed as an affine perturbation of the 2D NSE.\nThus, in the degenerate limit of zero nudging parameter, the nudging filter\nconverges to the solution of the 2D NSE. However, when the nudging parameter of\nthe nudging filter is large, the perturbation becomes singular. It is shown\nthat in the singular limit of infinite nudging parameter, the nudging filter\nconverges to the synchronization filter. In establishing this result, the\narticle fills a notable gap in the literature surrounding these algorithms.\nNumerical experiments are then presented that confirm the theoretical results\nand probes the issue of selecting a nudging strategy in the presence of\nobservational noise. In this direction, an adaptive nudging strategy is\nproposed that leverages the insight gained from the relationship between the\nsynchronization filter and the nudging filter that produces measurable\nimprovement over the constant nudging strategy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
