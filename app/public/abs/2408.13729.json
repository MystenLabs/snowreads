However, identifying the root cause of a failure in\nmicroservice systems is still a challenging and time-consuming task. In recent\nyears, researchers have introduced various causal inference-based root cause\nanalysis methods to assist engineers in identifying the root causes. To gain a\nbetter understanding of the current status of causal inference-based root cause\nanalysis techniques for microservice systems, we conduct a comprehensive\nevaluation of nine causal discovery methods and twenty-one root cause analysis\nmethods. Our evaluation aims to understand both the effectiveness and\nefficiency of causal inference-based root cause analysis methods, as well as\nother factors that affect their performance. Our experimental results and\nanalyses indicate that no method stands out in all situations; each method\ntends to either fall short in effectiveness, efficiency, or shows sensitivity\nto specific parameters. Notably, the performance of root cause analysis methods\non synthetic datasets may not accurately reflect their performance in real\nsystems. Indeed, there is still a large room for further improvement.\nFurthermore, we also suggest possible future work based on our findings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
