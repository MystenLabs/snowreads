The model\nwas trained and tested on the public dataset of DDSM. The model is capable of\nfast and accurate classification of input images. According to our research\nresults, for binary classification (presence or absence of breast cancer), the\naccuracy reached 98.84%, and for five-class classification, the accuracy\nreached 98.34%. The model also achieved a micro-average recall rate of 94.80%\nand an F1 score of 94.19%. In comparative experiments, we compared the effects\nof different values of bagging_ratio and n_models on the model, as well as\nseveral methods for ensemble bagging models. Furthermore, under the same\nparameter settings, our BSECNN outperformed VGG16 and ResNet-50 in terms of\naccuracy by 8.22% and 6.33% respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"PC058DvOmJF2cu0SURtwxZjVht3WJDAlkDzh755IqS4","pdfSize":"514330","objectId":"0x178d8c015dcbcb37f1d94f4f333903d911ff272e77e015eee8dd7a481cc14e1f","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
