In this paper, we propose an algorithm named ELIMIPL,\ni.e., Exploiting conjugate Label Information for Multi-Instance Partial-Label\nlearning, which exploits the conjugate label information to improve the\ndisambiguation performance. To achieve this, we extract the label information\nembedded in both candidate and non-candidate label sets, incorporating the\nintrinsic properties of the label space. Experimental results obtained from\nbenchmark and real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed\nELIMIPL over existing MIPL algorithms and other well-established partial-label\nlearning algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
