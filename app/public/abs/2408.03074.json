To do\nthis, we first discuss the scope of the field of pragmatics and suggest a\nsubdivision into discourse pragmatics and interactional pragmatics. We give a\nnon-exhaustive overview of the phenomena of those two subdomains and the\nmethods traditionally used to analyze them. We subsequently consider the\nresulting heterogeneous set of phenomena and methods as a starting point for\nour survey of work on discourse pragmatics and interactional pragmatics in the\ncontext of LLMs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"UQNgL2x9v1eH6b2yoNFk77Vo6Ac6cw4GV0kyGWbfN0o","pdfSize":"122506"}
