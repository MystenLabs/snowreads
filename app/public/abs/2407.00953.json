We give an\nestimator of the damping parameter of the $Q$-Wiener process of the SPDE based\non quadratic variations with temporal and spatial increments. We also provide\nsimulation results of the proposed estimator.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
