Several\narticulations of the notion of rational reconstruction are recalled, followed\nby a brief analysis of two standard criticisms of Carnap's claim. The paper\nsuggests that adopting inferentialism overcomes both criticisms, and then\nconsiders the possibility of formulating quantum mechanics as a Carnapian\nlanguage with an inferentialist semantics.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UoZC-Z0hL7mYd40AqPrJTHSHuKzivMLfX-x8lsf3dtA","pdfSize":"91113"}
