We demonstrate that repeated collisions by\nitinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an\nentangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange\nwith either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with\nproper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most\ncollision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for\nthe two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled\nstate. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists\nin the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the\ndecoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using\nsingle-electron sources.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
