To this end, we formulate\nan energy-based model for these systems within the port-Hamiltonian framework.\nThen, we employ Lyapunov theory and the notion of contractive systems to\ndevelop control approaches in the port-Hamiltonian framework. Remarkably, these\ncontrol methods eliminate the need for solving partial differential equations\nor implementing any change of coordinates and are endowed with a physical\ninterpretation. We also investigate the effect of coupled damping on the\ntransient performance and convergence rate of the closed-loop system. Finally,\nthe applicability of the proposed approaches is illustrated in two applications\nof electromechanical systems via simulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
