From this data, which we assume is\ndefined over a fixed land region, the glacier's geometry solves a free-boundary\nproblem which balances the surface velocity from the Stokes flow with the\nsurface mass balance. A surface elevation function for this problem is\nadmissible if it is above the bedrock topography, equivalently if the ice\nthickness is nonnegative. For an implicit time step, this free-boundary problem\ncan be posed in weak form as a variational inequality. After some preparatory\ntheory for the glaciological Stokes problem, we conjecture that the\ncontinuous-space, implicit time step problem for the surface elevation is\nwell-posed. This conjecture is supported both by physical arguments and\nnumerical evidence. We then prove a general theorem which bounds the error made\nby a finite element approximation of a nonlinear variational inequality in a\nBanach space. The bound is a sum of error terms of different types which are\nspecial to variational inequalities. In the case of the implicit-step glacier\nproblem these terms are of three types: errors from discretizing the bed\nelevation, errors from numerically solving for the Stokes velocity, and finally\nan expected quasi-optimal finite element error in the surface elevation itself.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NAofghvkTBkhs_SExx1HRGijbtMkcJ5U1VgdCw1TfRc","pdfSize":"918104"}
