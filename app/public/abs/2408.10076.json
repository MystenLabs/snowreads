Ambrus et al. a new upper bound for the\ndensity of an unit avoiding, periodic set is given as $0.2470$, the first upper\nbound $< 1/4$. A construction of Croft 1967 gave a lower bound $\\delta_C =\n0.22936$ for the density. To this date, no better construction with a higher\nlower bound has been given. In this article I give a construction planar sets\nwith a higher density than Croft's tortoises. No explicit value for this\ndensity is given, it's just shown that Croft's density is a local minima of the\ndensity of a here constructed 1-parameter family of planar sets. So the\ndensities are $> \\delta_C$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
