At present, the digital society is overwhelming many\npeople, a large group of whom are older adults, whose quality of life has been\nundermined in many respects by their difficulties in using digital technology.\nHowever, this silver segment should be kept involved as active users of digital\nservices and contribute to the functioning and development of a\nsuper-intelligent, AI-enabled society. The paper calls for action-oriented\ndesign thinking that considers the challenge to improve the quality of life,\nwith an emphasis on ethical design and ethical impact assessment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PqEZUvHskp_KcfCMfDvgPM8lB31IjhizxH3wHgaDniw","pdfSize":"722017"}
