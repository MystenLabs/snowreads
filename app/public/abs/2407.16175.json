(2017) titled \"Approximation of Functions\nby a New Family of Generalized Bernstein Operators\" (Journal of Mathematical\nAnalysis and Applications, 450(1), 244-261). Since their introduction, these\noperators have served as a source of inspiration for numerous research\nendeavors. In this study, we propose a novel technique, founded on a recursive\nrelation, for constructing Bernstein-like bases. A special case of this new\nrepresentation yields a novel portrayal of Chen's operators. This innovative\nrepresentation enables the discovery of additional properties of\n$\\alpha$-Bernstein operators and facilitates alternative and more\nstraightforward proofs for certain theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
