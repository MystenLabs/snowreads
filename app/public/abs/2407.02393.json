Using the symmetries in a\nfine-tuned limit of the system, we identify the strong-coupling ground states\nand their fate when the perturbations caused by finite bandwidth, displacement\nfield, and the phase of the intralayer potential are taken into account. We\nclassify the superconducting instabilities and, employing a spin-fermion-like\nmodel, study the superconducting instabilities in proximity to these insulating\nparticle-hole orders. This reveals that only a neighboring intervalley coherent\nphase (with zero or finite wave vector) is naturally consistent with the\nobserved superconducting state. Depending on details, the superconductor will\nbe nodal or a chiral gapped state while further including electron-phonon\ncoupling leads to a fully gapped, time-reversal symmetric pairing state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
