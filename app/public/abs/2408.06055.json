We find that the complexity of the deformed theory differs from\nthe renormalized complexity of the original theory by a geometric functional:\nthe bending (Willmore) energy of the time-constant slice of the base manifold.\nWe use this result to propose an unambiguous scheme for calculating holographic\nquantum complexity through the CA proposal.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"vCpmtgyGkT4zk-3TlccoLOSV3mEtVdXUHZuHm14j-uw","pdfSize":"183831"}
