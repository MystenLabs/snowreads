We introduce the notion of a\nsomewhat bounded set and establish a strong connection between this property\nand the existence of fixed points for the generic $f\\in\\mathcal{N}(C)$, in the\nsense of Baire categories. Namely, if $C$ is somewhat bounded, the generic\nnonexpansive mapping on $C$ admits a fixed point, whereas if $C$ is not\nsomewhat bounded, the generic nonexpansive mapping on $C$ does not have any\nfixed points. This results in a topological 0-1 law: the set of all\n$f\\in\\mathcal{N}(C)$ with a fixed point is either meager or residual. We\nfurther prove that, generically, there are no fixed points in the interior of\n$C$ and, under additional geometric assumptions, we show the uniqueness of such\nfixed points for the generic $f\\in\\mathcal{N}(C)$ and the convergence of the\niterates of $f$ to its fixed point.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
