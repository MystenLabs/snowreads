The essence of such architectures\nlies in their reliance on high-fidelity and fast quantum state transfers\nenabled by generating entanglement between chips. In addressing the challenge\nof implementing quantum coherent communication channels to interconnect quantum\nprocessors, various techniques have been proposed to account for qubit\ntechnology specifications and the implemented communication protocol. By\nemploying Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodologies, this work presents a\ncomparative analysis of the cavity-mediated interconnect technologies according\nto a defined figure of merit, and we identify the configurations related to the\ncavity and atomic decay rates as well as the qubit-cavity coupling strength\nthat meet the efficiency thresholds. We therefore contribute to benchmarking\ncontemporary cavity-mediated quantum interconnects and guide the development of\nreliable and scalable chip-to-chip links for modular quantum computers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
