The Brillouin - Mandelstam and Raman light scattering\nspectroscopies were used to measure the acoustic and optical phonon frequencies\nclose to the Brillouin zone center. The optical phonon frequencies reveal\nnon-monotonic changes, reflective of the variations in the thin-film strain and\ndislocation densities with the addition of Si dopant atoms. The acoustic phonon\nvelocity decreases monotonically with increasing Si dopant concentration,\nreducing by ~300 m/s at the doping level of 3 x 10^19 1/cm3. Knowledge of the\nacoustic phonon velocities can be used to optimize ultra-wide bandgap\nsemiconductor heterostructures and minimize the thermal boundary resistance of\nhigh-power devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
