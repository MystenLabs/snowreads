Despite being known for a long time, a\nquantitative understanding of its electronic properties remains challenging due\nto the presence of many concomitant subtle effects. By combining accurate first\nprinciples calculations and $k.p$ modelling, we investigate the topological\nphase diagram of mercury telluride as a function of strain. Our research\ndemonstrates the significance of including the linearly $k$-dependent\nhigher-order $C_4$ strain terms into the usual $k.p$ treatment. In particular,\nwe report a unique $k$-dependence of the sub-band splitting, which arises from\nthe interplay between strain and the standard bulk inversion asymmetry terms\nwithin our $k.p$ model. The impact of this phenomenon is explored in relation\nto the camel's back shape during the tensile strain phase and its implications\nfor the Weyl semimetal state in the compressive strain case are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
