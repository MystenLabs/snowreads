Several attempts have been made to adapt Stable\nDiffusion (SD) to the medical domain. However, the large distribution\ndifference between medical reports and natural texts, as well as high\ncomputational complexity in common stable diffusion limit the authenticity and\nfeasibility of the generated medical images. To solve above problems, we\npropose a novel light-weight transformer-based diffusion model learning\nframework, Chest-Diffusion, for report-to-CXR generation. Chest-Diffusion\nemploys a domain-specific text encoder to obtain accurate and expressive text\nfeatures to guide image generation, improving the authenticity of the generated\nimages. Meanwhile, we introduce a light-weight transformer architecture as the\ndenoising model, reducing the computational complexity of the diffusion model.\nExperiments demonstrate that our Chest-Diffusion achieves the lowest FID score\n24.456, under the computation budget of 118.918 GFLOPs, which is nearly\none-third of the computational complexity of SD.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
