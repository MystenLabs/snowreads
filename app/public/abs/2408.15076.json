In the U.S., cannabis use is more prevalent among emerging\nadults (EAs) (ages 18-25) than any other age group, with legalization in the\nmultiple states contributing to a public perception that cannabis is less risky\nthan in prior decades. To address this growing concern, we developed MiWaves, a\nreinforcement learning (RL) algorithm designed to optimize the delivery of\npersonalized intervention prompts to reduce cannabis use among EAs. MiWaves\nleverages domain expertise and prior data to tailor the likelihood of delivery\nof intervention messages. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of the\nalgorithm's design, including key decisions and experimental outcomes. The\nfinalized MiWaves RL algorithm was deployed in a clinical trial from March to\nMay 2024.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
