We will show that each contractive\nJordan isomorphism $\\Phi\\colon L^1(G)\\to L^1(H)$ is either an isometric\nisomorphism or an isometric anti-isomorphism. We will apply this result to\nstudy isometric two-sided zero product preservers on group algebras and,\nfurther, to study local and approximately local isometric automorphisms of\ngroup algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
