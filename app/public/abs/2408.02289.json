Lyashenko and F. Mercurio in\n\\cite{lyashenkoMercurio:Mar2019} to model the dynamics of the Risk Free Rates\n(RFRs) that are replacing the traditional IBOR rates in the financial industry.\nMoreover, for the numerical solution of the proposed PDEs formulation, we\ndevelop some adaptations of the finite differences methods developed in\n\\cite{LopezPerezVazquez:sisc} that are very suitable to treat the presence of\nspatial mixed derivatives. This work is the first article in the literature\nwhere PDE methods are used to value RFR derivatives. Additionally, Monte\nCarlo-based methods will be designed and the results are compared with those\nobtained by the numerical solution of PDEs.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Pricing of Securities","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
