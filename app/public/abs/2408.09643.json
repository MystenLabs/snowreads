We study Tur\\'an problems for hypergraphs\nwith an additional uniformity condition on the edge distribution. This kind of\nTur\\'an problems was introduced by Erd\\H{o}s and S\\'os in the 1980s but it took\nmore than 30 years until the first non-trivial exact results were obtained when\nGlebov, Kr\\'al' and Volec [Israel J. Math. 211 (2016), 349--366] and Reiher,\nR\\\"odl and Schacht [J. Eur. Math. Soc. 20 (2018), 1139--1159] determined the\nuniform Tur\\'an density of $K_4^{(3)-}$.\n  Subsequent results exploited the powerful hypergraph regularity method,\ndeveloped by Gowers and by Nagle, R\\\"odl and Schacht about two decades ago.\nCentral to the study of the uniform Tur\\'an density of hypergraphs are palette\nconstructions, which were implicitly introduced by R\\\"odl in the 1980s. We\nprove that palette constructions always yield tight lower bounds,\nunconditionally confirming present empirical evidence. This results in new and\nsimpler approaches to determining uniform Tur\\'an densities, which completely\nbypass the use of the hypergraph regularity method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
