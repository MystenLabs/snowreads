Then a famous theorem of Yamamoto (1967) states that $$\\lim _{n\\to\n\\infty}(s^{(n)}_j )^{\\frac{1}{n}}= |\\lambda _j|, ~~\\forall \\,1\\leq j\\leq m.$$\nRecently S. Nayak strengthened this result very significantly by showing that\nthe sequence of matrices $|A^n|^{\\frac{1}{n}}$ itself converges to a positive\nmatrix $B$ whose eigenvalues are $|\\lambda _1|,|\\lambda _2|,$ $\\ldots ,\n|\\lambda _m|.$ Here this theorem has been extended to arbitrary compact\noperators on infinite dimensional complex separable Hilbert spaces. The proof\nmakes use of Nayak's theorem, Stone-Weirstrass theorem, Borel-Caratheodory\ntheorem and some technical results of Anselone and Palmer on collectively\ncompact operators. Simple examples show that the result does not hold for\ngeneral bounded operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
