This trend,\ncoupled with the increasing importance of AI in 6G and beyond cellular\nnetworks, presents opportunities for innovative AI applications and systems at\nthe network edge. While AI models and services are well-managed in cloud\nsystems, achieving similar maturity for serving network needs remains an open\nchallenge. Existing open solutions are emerging and are yet to consider\ndemocratization requirements. In this work, we identify key requirements for\ndemocratization and propose NAOMI, a solution for democratizing AI/ML workflows\nat the network edge designed based on those requirements. Guided by the\nfunctionality and overlap analysis of the O-RAN AI/ML workflow architecture and\nMLOps systems, coupled with the survey of open-source AI/ML tools, we develop a\nmodular, scalable, and distributed hardware architecture-independent solution.\nNAOMI leverages state-of-the-art open-source tools and can be deployed on\ndistributed clusters of heterogeneous devices. The results show that NAOMI\nperforms up to 40% better in deployment time and up to 73% faster in AI/ML\nworkflow execution for larger datasets compared to AI/ML Framework, a\nrepresentative open network access solution, while performing inference and\nutilizing resources on par with its counterpart.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
