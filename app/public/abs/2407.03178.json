Additionally, transformer networks struggle with low-level\ndetails. RCTNet addresses these limitations by introducing \\textbf{(1)} an\nearly fusion backbone to exploit both spatial and temporal features early on,\n\\textbf{(2)} a Cross-Stage Aggregation (CSA) module for enhanced temporal\nrepresentation, \\textbf{(3)} a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSF) module for\nenriched feature extraction in the decoder, and \\textbf{(4)} an Efficient\nSelf-deciphering Attention (ESA) module utilizing transformers to capture\nglobal information and fine-grained details for accurate change detection.\nExtensive experiments demonstrate RCTNet's clear superiority over traditional\nRS image CD methods, showing significant improvement and an optimal balance\nbetween accuracy and computational cost.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
