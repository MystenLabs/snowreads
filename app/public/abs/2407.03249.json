In particular, dynamics\ndriven by quantum fluctuations are important for the formation of exotic\nquantum phases of matter \\cite{altman2023quantum}, fundamental high-energy\nprocesses \\cite{bauer2023highenergy}, quantum metrology \\cite{degen2017sensing,\nli2023scrambling}, and quantum algorithms \\cite{ebadi2022quantum}. Here, we use\na programmable quantum simulator based on Rydberg atom arrays to experimentally\nstudy collective dynamics across a (2+1)D Ising quantum phase transition. After\ncrossing the quantum critical point, we observe a gradual growth of\ncorrelations through coarsening of antiferromagnetically ordered\ndomains~\\cite{Samajdar2024}. By deterministically preparing and following the\nevolution of ordered domains, we show that the coarsening is driven by the\ncurvature of domain boundaries, and find that the dynamics accelerate with\nproximity to the quantum critical point. We quantitatively explore these\nphenomena and further observe long-lived oscillations of the order parameter,\ncorresponding to an amplitude (Higgs) mode \\cite{pekker2015amplitude}. These\nobservations offer a unique viewpoint into emergent collective dynamics in\nstrongly correlated quantum systems and nonequilibrium quantum processes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
