However, this task becomes challenging when we\nobserve matrix-valued time series, where each dimension may have a different\nco-movement structure. We propose reduced-rank regressions with a tensor\nstructure for the coefficient matrix to provide new insights into co-movements\nwithin and between the dimensions of matrix-valued time series. Moreover, we\nrelate the co-movement structures to two commonly used reduced-rank models,\nnamely the serial correlation common feature and the index model. Two empirical\napplications involving U.S.\\ states and economic indicators for the Eurozone\nand North American countries illustrate how our new tools identify\nco-movements.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
