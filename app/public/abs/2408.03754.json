However, the accurate control of SRs\nhas remained a significant challenge to date, mainly due to their nonlinear\ndynamics and viscoelastic material properties. Conventional control design\nmethods often rely on either complex system modeling or time-intensive manual\ntuning, both of which require significant amounts of human expertise and thus\nlimit their practicality. In recent works, the data-driven method, Automatic\nNeural ODE Control (ANODEC) has been successfully used to -- fully\nautomatically and utilizing only input-output data -- design controllers for\nvarious nonlinear systems in silico, and without requiring prior model\nknowledge or extensive manual tuning. In this work, we successfully apply\nANODEC to automatically learn to perform agile, non-repetitive reference\ntracking motion tasks in a real-world SR and within a finite time horizon. To\nthe best of the authors' knowledge, ANODEC achieves, for the first time,\nperformant control of a SR with hysteresis effects from only 30 seconds of\ninput-output data and without any prior model knowledge. We show that for\nmultiple, qualitatively different and even out-of-training-distribution\nreference signals, a single feedback controller designed by ANODEC outperforms\na manually tuned PID baseline consistently. Overall, this contribution not only\nfurther strengthens the validity of ANODEC, but it marks an important step\ntowards more practical, easy-to-use SRs that can automatically learn to perform\nagile motions from minimal experimental interaction time.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
