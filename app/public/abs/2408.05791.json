Our results show that nonlinear focusing mechanisms can lead to tail\nfattening of the probability measure of the sup-norm of the solution to a\nnonlinear dispersive equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
