The Six Stages\nModel, a foundational framework in information science, outlines the sequential\nphases individuals undergo during information seeking: initiation, selection,\nexploration, formulation, collection, and presentation. Integrating LLM\ntechnology into this model significantly optimizes each stage, particularly in\nhealthcare. LLMs enhance query interpretation, streamline information retrieval\nfrom complex medical databases, and provide contextually relevant responses,\nthereby improving the efficiency and accuracy of medical information searches.\nThis fusion not only aids healthcare professionals in accessing critical data\nswiftly but also empowers patients with reliable and personalized health\ninformation, fostering a more informed and effective healthcare environment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
