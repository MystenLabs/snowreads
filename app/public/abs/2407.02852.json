Moreover, the solution enjoys the exponential decay $\\exp \\{- c\nx^\\frac{2}{3 - \\gamma} - c |v|^2 \\}$ for some $c > 0$. We first verify a\nso-called Nondissipative lemma to deal with the nondissipative boundary\ncondition. In order to study the general angular cutoff collision kernel $-3 <\n\\gamma \\leq 1$, we should introduce a $(x,v)$-mixed weight $\\sigma$. Then a\nso-called spatial-velocity indices iteration approach is developed to shift the\nhigher power $x$-polynomial weights to $|v|$-polynomial weights. We also find a\nweak macroscopic damping mechanism to avoid adding an artificial damping.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
