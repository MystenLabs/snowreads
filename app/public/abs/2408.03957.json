As a successful approach for tackling resource management problems\nin wireless networks, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have attracted a lot of\nattention. This article proposes a GNN-based algorithm to address the joint\nresource allocation problem in heterogeneous wireless networks. Concretely, we\nmodel the heterogeneous wireless network as a heterogeneous graph and then\npropose a graph neural network structure intending to allocate the available\nchannels and transmit power to maximise the network throughput. Our proposed\njoint channel and power allocation graph neural network (JCPGNN) comprises a\nshared message computation layer and two task-specific layers, with a dedicated\nfocus on channel and power allocation tasks, respectively. Comprehensive\nexperiments demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfactory\nperformance but with higher computational efficiency compared to traditional\noptimisation algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
