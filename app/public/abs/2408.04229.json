We consider PCs instead computing the cumulative\ndistribution function (CDF). We show that for distributions over binary random\nvariables these representations (PMF and CDF) are essentially equivalent, in\nthe sense that one can be transformed to the other in polynomial time. We then\nshow how a similar equivalence holds for distributions over finite discrete\nvariables using a modification of the standard encoding with binary variables\nthat aligns with the CDF semantics. Finally we show that for continuous\nvariables, smooth, decomposable PCs computing PDFs and CDFs can be efficiently\ntransformed to each other by modifying only the leaves of the circuit.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
