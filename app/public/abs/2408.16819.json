They\nhave a quite complicated modular anomaly expressed as a sum over three\ndifferent types of trees weighted by generalized error functions and their\nderivatives. We show that this anomaly can be significantly simplified, which\nin turn simplfies finding the corresponding mock modular generating functions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
