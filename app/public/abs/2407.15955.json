Gagola, to irreducible\ncharacters of fusion rings whose kernel has maximal rank. These near-integral\nfusion rings include the near-groups which are currently one of the most\nabundant sources of novel examples of fusion categories to date. We generalize\nmany of the known results on near-group fusion categories from the literature\nto near-integral fusion categories and characterize when such categories are\nbraided. In particular, braided near-integral fusion categories describe all\nbraided fusion categories which are almost symmetrically braided. This novel\nresult allows a digestible characterization of the over $300$ braided\nequivalence classes of premodular fusion categories of rank $6$ or less.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
