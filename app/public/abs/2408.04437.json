We focus on the equilibrium Gibbs state of the gas,\nfor which the density has a finite support $[-\\ell_0/2,\\ell_0/2]$. We study the\nfluctuations of the linear statistics ${\\cal L}_N = \\sum_{i=1}^N f(x_i)$ in the\nlarge $N$ limit for smooth functions $f(x)$. We obtain analytic formulae for\nthe cumulants of ${\\cal L}_N$ for general $k>-2$. For long range interactions,\ni.e. $k<1$, which include the log-gas ($k \\to 0$) and the Coulomb gas ($k =-1$)\nthese are obtained for monomials $f(x)= |x|^m$. For short range interactions,\ni.e. $k>1$, which include the Calogero-Moser model, i.e. $k=2$, we compute the\nthird cumulant of ${\\cal L}_N$ for general $f(x)$ and arbitrary cumulants for\nmonomials $f(x)= |x|^m$. We also obtain the large deviation form of the\nprobability distribution of ${\\cal L}_N$, which exhibits an \"evaporation\ntransition\" where the fluctuation of ${\\cal L}_N$ is dominated by the one of\nthe largest $x_i$. In addition, in the short range case, we extend our results\nto a (non-smooth) indicator function $f(x)$, obtaining thereby the higher order\ncumulants for the full counting statistics of the number of particles in an\ninterval $[-L/2,L/2]$. We show in particular that they exhibit an interesting\nscaling form as $L/2$ approaches the edge of the gas $L/\\ell_0 \\to 1$, which we\nrelate to the large deviations of the emptiness probability of the\ncomplementary interval on the real line.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
