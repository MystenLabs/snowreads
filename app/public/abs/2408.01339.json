The\nonly condition is commutativity, a fundamental requirement for simultaneous\nmeasurements in quantum mechanics. Quantum low-density parity check (LDPC)\ncodes show great promise for realising fault-tolerant quantum computing. They\nare particularly significant for early fault-tolerant technologies as they can\nencode many logical qubits using relatively few physical qubits. By achieving\nsimultaneous measurements of logical operators, our approaches enable fully\nparallelised quantum computing, thus minimising computation time. Our schemes\nare applicable to any quantum LDPC codes and maintain the low density of parity\nchecks while measuring multiple logical operators simultaneously. These results\nenhance the feasibility of applying early fault-tolerant technologies to\npractical problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
