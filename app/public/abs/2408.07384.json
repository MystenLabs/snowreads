However, ensuring safety and optimal performance in\ntheir design poses substantial challenges. This study presents the design\nprocess for an underactuated hand exoskeleton (U-HEx), first including a single\nobjective (maximizing force transmission), then expanding into multi objective\n(also minimizing torque variance and actuator displacement). The optimization\nrelies on a Genetic Algorithm, the Big Bang-Big Crunch Algorithm, and their\nversions for multi-objective optimization. Analyses revealed that using Big\nBang-Big Crunch provides high and more consistent results in terms of\noptimality with lower convergence time. In addition, adding more objectives\noffers a variety of trade-off solutions to the designers, who might later set\npriorities for the objectives without repeating the process - at the cost of\ncomplicating the optimization algorithm and computational burden. These\nfindings underline the importance of performing proper optimization while\ndesigning exoskeletons, as well as providing a significant improvement to this\nspecific robotic design.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
