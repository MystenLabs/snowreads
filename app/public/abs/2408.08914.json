It highlights the pivotal role of AI in facilitating scenario\ngeneration, incident prediction, risk assessment, and severity grading, thereby\naddressing the complexities introduced by renewable energy integration and\nadvancements in digital grid technologies. The paper delves into data-driven\ntechniques, with a particular focus on decision trees that effectively bridge\noperational characteristics with security metrics. These methodologies enable\nreal-time, accurate predictions of system behaviors under varied operational\nconditions and support the optimization of control strategies. Through detailed\nanalysis, we demonstrate how AI applications can transform traditional security\nassessment protocols, enhancing both the efficacy and efficiency of power\nsystem operations. The findings advocate for the potential of AI to\nsignificantly enhance the reliability and resilience of electrical grids,\nmarking a paradigm shift towards more adaptive and intelligent power\ninfrastructure.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ruQiqU9_GbDerH864NaSYGJ73ii3Mfagv1ZItidfTWM","pdfSize":"401129"}
