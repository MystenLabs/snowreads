The piezo-induced strain effectively modulates\nthe conductivity of the topological surface state (TSS) by altering the gating\nmagnet's magnetization from out-to-in-plane, facilitating the storage magnet's\nspin-orbit torque (SOT) switching. Through comprehensive coupled stochastic\nLandau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) simulations, we explore the device dynamics,\nanisotropy-stress phase space for switching, and write conditions and\ndemonstrate a significant reduction in energy dissipation compared to\nconventional heavy metal (HM)-based SOT switching. Additionally, we project the\nenergy consumption for in-memory Boolean operations (AND and OR). Our findings\nsuggest the promise of the STI-SOTRAM for low-power, high-performance edge\ncomputing.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Q0qPAV_VvtXRUAGENneTKza3vucAZ4lGnH0MJUgOPUU","pdfSize":"2033921"}
