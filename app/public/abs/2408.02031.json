By refining determinant quantum\nMonte Carlo algorithm, we characterize the parameter dependence of the\nsuperconducting transition temperature within a bilayer Hubbard model, which is\nsign-problem-free at arbitrary filling. A striking feature of this model is its\nsimilarities to the bilayer nickelate-based superconductor\n$\\mathrm{La}_{3}\\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\\mathrm{O}_{7}$, where superconductivity emerge\nfrom the bilayer $\\mathrm{Ni}\\mathrm{O}_{2}$ planes. We find that interlayer\nspin-exchange $J$ is critical to interlayer pairing, ant that on-site\ninteraction $U$ contributes negatively to superconductivity at low doping\nlevels but positively to it at high doping levels. Our findings identify the\nkey parameter dependent superconducting transition temperature in\nnickelate-based superconductors and provide a new understanding of the high\ntemperature superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
