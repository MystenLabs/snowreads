Forward\npropagation of parameter variation is key for uncertainty quantification,\nwhilst backpropagation has found application for emerging inverse problems such\nas fine-tuning or targeted design. Here, the implicit derivative of functions\ndefined as a fixed point is used to Taylor expand the energy and structure of\natomic minima in potential parameters, evaluating terms via automatic\ndifferentiation, dense linear algebra or a novel sparse operator approach. The\nlatter allows efficient forward and backpropagation through relaxed structures\nof arbitrarily large systems. The implicit expansion accurately predicts\nlattice distortion and defect formation energies and volumes with classical and\nmachine-learning potentials, enabling high-dimensional uncertainty propagation\nwithout prohibitive overhead. We then show how the implicit derivative can be\nused to solve challenging inverse problems, minimizing an implicit loss to\nfine-tune potentials and stabilize solute-induced structural rearrangements at\ndislocations in tungsten.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
