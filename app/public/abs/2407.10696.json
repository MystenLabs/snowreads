Our proposed methodology leverages the\nstrengths of both paradigms, presenting a framework for both unsupervised and\none-shot approaches for image segmentation. It is capable of capturing complex\nobject boundaries without the need for extensive labeled training data. This is\nparticularly required in histology, a field facing a significant shortage of\nannotations due to the challenging and time-consuming nature of the annotation\nprocess. We illustrate and compare our results to state of the art methods on a\nhistology dataset and show significant improvements.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rPypM4kv-jBarLIiNsr5OzgA1JOz8qG0hfbn17mSvmA","pdfSize":"25505036"}
