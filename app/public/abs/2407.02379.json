However, the overactuated locomotion modality employed\nby snake robots allows for a unique blend of object manipulation through\nlocomotion, referred to as loco-manipulation. The following work presents an\noptimization approach to solving the loco-manipulation problem based on\nnon-impulsive implicit contact path planning for our snake robot COBRA. This\nthesis presents the mathematical framework and show high-fidelity simulation\nresults and experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
