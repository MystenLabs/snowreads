While energy conditions in quantum field theory can partly answer\nthis problem, in this paper we find evidence that classical general relativity\nabhors negative masses, without the need for quantum theory or energy\nconditions. This is done by considering many different models of negative-mass\n\"stars\" and showing they are dynamically unstable. A fortiori, we show that any\nbarotropic negative-mass star must be dynamically unstable.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wvvP_f8Oj-iyaAe_dQtaCBq_NsjGFUePNUnw_5oTuDE","pdfSize":"1080262"}
