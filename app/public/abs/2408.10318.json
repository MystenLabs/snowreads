These bounds are relatively straight forward at the tree\nlevel, but would become more obscure when loop effects are important. Using\nscalar theories as examples, we carefully exam the positivity bounds in a case\nwhere the leading contribution to a forward elastic amplitude arises at the\none-loop level, and point out certain subtleties in terms of the implications\nof positivity bounds on the theory parameter space. In particular, the one-loop\ngenerated dimension-8 operator coefficients (that would be positive if\ngenerated at the tree level), as well as their $\\beta$-functions are generally\nnot subject to positivity bounds as they might correspond to interference terms\nof the cross sections under the optical theorem, which could have either sign.\nA strict positivity bound can only be implied when all contributions at the\nsame loop order are considered, including the ones from dim-4 and dim-6\noperator coefficients, which have important effects at the one-loop level. Our\nresults may have important implications on the robustness of experimental tests\nof positivity bounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
