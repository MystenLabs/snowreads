Tree-based\nnetworks, which are one of the more general classes of phylogenetic networks,\nhave recently gained eminence for its ability to represent evolutionary\nhistories with an underlying tree structure. To better understand tree-based\nnetworks, numerous characterizations have been proposed, based on tree\nembeddings, matchings, and arc partitions. Here, we build a bridge between two\narc partition characterizations, namely maximal fence decompositions and cherry\ncovers. Results on cherry covers have been found for general phylogenetic\nnetworks. We first show that the number of cherry covers is the same as the\nnumber of support trees (underlying tree structure of tree-based networks) for\na given semibinary network. Maximal fence decompositions have only been defined\nthus far for binary networks (constraints on vertex degrees). We remedy this by\ngeneralizing fence decompositions to non-binary networks, and using this, we\ncharacterize semi-binary tree-based networks in terms of forbidden structures.\nFurthermore, we give an explicit enumeration of cherry covers of semi-binary\nnetworks, by studying its fence decomposition. Finally, we prove that it is\npossible to characterize semi-binary tree-child networks, a subclass of\ntree-based networks, in terms of the number of their cherry covers.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
