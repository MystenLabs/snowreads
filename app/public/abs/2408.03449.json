To ensure BCI devices are capable of\nproviding practical applications in the real world, brain signal processing\ntechniques must be fast, accurate, and resource-conscious to deliver\nlow-latency neural analytics. This study presents a model that leverages a\npre-trained MobileViT alongside Knowledge Distillation (KD) for EEG regression\ntasks. Our results showcase that this model is capable of performing at a level\ncomparable (only 3% lower) to the previous State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) on the\nEEGEyeNet Absolute Position Task while being 33% faster and 60% smaller. Our\nresearch presents a cost-effective model applicable to resource-constrained\ndevices and contributes to expanding future research on lightweight,\nmobile-friendly models for EEG regression.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
