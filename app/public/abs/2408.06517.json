However, with\nhigh-dimensional mediators, as often encountered in modern genomic data\nsettings, there is a lack of powerful methods that can provide valid\npost-selection inference for the identified marginal mediation effect. To\nresolve this challenge, we develop a post-selection inference procedure for the\nmaximally selected natural indirect effect using a semiparametric efficient\ninfluence function approach. To this end, we establish the asymptotic normality\nof a stabilized one-step estimator that takes the selection of the mediator\ninto account. Simulation studies show that our proposed method has good\nempirical performance. We further apply our proposed approach to a lung cancer\ndataset and find multiple DNA methylation CpG sites that might mediate the\neffect of cigarette smoking on lung cancer survival.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
