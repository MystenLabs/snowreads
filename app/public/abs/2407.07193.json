Then $|\\mathrm{Hom}(\\Gamma,\\mathrm{GL}_n(q))|\\sim c_{q,n}\nq^{(1-\\chi(\\Gamma))n^2}$, where $c_{q,n}$ is periodic in $n$. As a function of\n$q$, $c_{q,n}$ can be expressed as a Puiseux series in $1/q$ whose coefficients\nare periodic in $n$ and $q$. Moreover, this series is essentially the\n$q$-expansion of a meromorphic modular form of half-integral weight.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
