In this\nwork, we explore using audio to enhance 3D shape and motion recovery of horses\nfrom monocular video. We test our approach on two datasets: an indoor treadmill\ndataset for 3D evaluation and an outdoor dataset capturing diverse horse\nmovements, the latter being a contribution to this study. Our results show that\nincorporating sound with visual data leads to more accurate and robust motion\nregression. This study is the first to investigate audio's role in 3D animal\nmotion recovery.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
