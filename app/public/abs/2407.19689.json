Compared to Sinkhorn algorithm or\nclassic LP algorithms, PDOT can achieve high-accuracy solution while\nefficiently taking advantage of modern computing architecture, i.e., GPUs. On\nthe theoretical side, we show that PDOT has a data-independent $\\widetilde\nO(mn(m+n)^{1.5}\\log(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}))$ local flop complexity where\n$\\epsilon$ is the desired accuracy, and $m$ and $n$ are the dimension of the\noriginal and target distribution, respectively. We further present a\ndata-dependent $\\widetilde O(mn(m+n)^{3.5}\\Delta +\nmn(m+n)^{1.5}\\log(\\frac{1}{\\epsilon}))$ global flop complexity of PDOT, where\n$\\Delta$ is the precision of the data. On the numerical side, we present PDOT,\nan open-source GPU solver based on the proposed algorithm. Our extensive\nnumerical experiments consistently demonstrate the well balance of PDOT in\ncomputing efficiency and accuracy of the solution, compared to Gurobi and\nSinkhorn algorithms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
