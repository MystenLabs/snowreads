In particular we\ndeduce the limit shape of the Aztec diamond and the hexagon for quasi-periodic\nweights through purely variational techniques.\n  Putting an M-curve at the center of the construction allows one to define\nweights and algebro-geometric structures describing the behavior of the\ncorresponding dimer model. We extend the quasi-periodic setup of our previous\npaper [7] to include a diffeomorphism from the spectral data to the liquid\nregion of the dimer.\n  Our novel method of proof is purely variational and exploits a duality\nbetween the dimer height function and its dual magnetic tension minimizer and\napplies to dimers with gas regions. We apply this to the Aztec diamond and\nhexagon domains to obtain explicit expressions for the complex structure of the\nliquid region of the dimer as well as the height function and its dual.\n  We compute the weights and the limit shapes numerically using the Schottky\nuniformization technique. Simulations and predicted results match completely.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ETOILpHm8VhDwBHDpaQOENae0ITvmTGC9UGWRyfy8IE","pdfSize":"13286675"}
