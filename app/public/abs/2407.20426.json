Our main\nresults imply that, once free boundaries are $C^{1,\\alpha}$, then they are\n$C^\\infty$. In addition $u/d^{\\frac{2}{2-\\gamma}}$ and $u^{\\frac{2-\\gamma}{2}}$\nare $C^\\infty$ too.\n  In order to achieve this, we need to establish fine regularity estimates for\nsolutions of linear equations with boundary-singular Hardy potentials $-\\Delta\nv = \\kappa v/d^2$ in $\\Omega$, where $d$ is the distance to the boundary and\n$\\kappa\\leq\\frac{1}{4}$. Interestingly, we need to include even the critical\nconstant $\\kappa=\\frac{1}{4}$, which corresponds to $\\gamma=\\frac{2}{3}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D1htSETwrqZ0VZHCCOXvsI6UtHtlF9kC7QVMbGgkXsw","pdfSize":"442637","objectId":"0x05db26c2b0056fe757dbd2f8a97e228a439c37500d995fd87d10f72efdb38c97","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
