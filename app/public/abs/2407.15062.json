In this paper, we introduce a novel binary verification service,\nAGORA, scrupulously designed to overcome the challenge. At the heart of this\napproach lies a strategic insight: certain tasks can be delegated to untrusted\nentities, while the corresponding validators are securely housed within the\ntrusted computing base (TCB). AGORA can validate untrusted assertions generated\nfor versatile policies. Through a novel blockchain-based bounty task manager,\nit also utilizes crowdsourcing to remove trust in theorem provers. These\nsynergistic techniques successfully ameliorate the TCB size burden associated\nwith two procedures: binary analysis and theorem proving. The design of AGORA\nallows untrusted parties to participate in these complex processes. Moreover,\nbased on running the optimized TCB within trusted execution environments and\nrecording the verification process on a blockchain, the public can audit the\ncorrectness of verification results. By implementing verification workflows for\nsoftware-based fault isolation policy and side-channel mitigation, our\nevaluation demonstrates the efficacy of AGORA.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
