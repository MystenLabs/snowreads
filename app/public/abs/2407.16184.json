The equation itself is a fourth order mixed type\nequation of the second kind. The existence and uniqueness theorems for a\ngeneralized solution of the inverse problem in a certain class of integrable\nfunctions are~proved using the methods of Fourier, \"$\\varepsilon\n$-regularization\", a priori estimates, approximating sequences and contracting\nmappings.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
