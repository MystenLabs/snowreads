However, known materials with significant\nphotostriction are limited, and effective guidelines to discover new\nphotostrictive materials are lacking. In this study, we perform a\nhigh-throughput computational search for new photostrictive materials based on\nsimple thermodynamic descriptors, namely the band gap pressure and stress\ncoefficients. Using constrained density functional theory simulations, we\nestablish that these descriptors can accurately predict intrinsic\nphotostriction in a wide range of materials. Subsequently, we screen over 4770\nstable semiconductors with a band gap below 2 eV from the Materials Project\ndatabase to search for strongly photostrictive materials. This search\nidentifies PtS$_2$ and Te$_2$I as the most promising ones, with photostriction\nexceeding 10$^{-4}$ with a moderate photocarrier concentration of 10$^{18}$\ncm$^{-3}$. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of factors contributing\nto strong photostriction, including bulk moduli and band-edge orbital\ninteractions. Our results provide physical insights into photostriction of\nmaterials and demonstrate the effectiveness of using simple descriptors in\nhigh-throughput searches for new functional materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
