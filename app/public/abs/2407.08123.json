J. Kang and T. S. Hahm, Phys. Plasmas 26, 042501\n(2019)]. The eigenmode equation, including the resonant contribution of passing\nfast ions, is derived and solved using the shooting method. Passing fast ions\nsignificantly affect the instability in weak negative shear or moderate\npositive shear plasmas. Eigenstate transitions to non-ground states occur more\nreadily in weak magnetic shear, high safety factor, and long wavelength\nperturbations. Linear gyrokinetic simulations using the GKV code verify the\ntheory, showing good agreement with shooting method results. The estimated\nquasilinear transport indicates that the net energy flux can be inward, without\ncontradicting the second law of thermodynamics. These findings have important\nimplications for heating efficiency and plasma confinement in the heating\nprocess, such as Ion Cyclotron Resonance Heating (ICRH) in future fusion\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kef7SwgGrKZ-BrrVDwI6XToCWMvrbTGrZXRTN33XuSM","pdfSize":"1783322"}
