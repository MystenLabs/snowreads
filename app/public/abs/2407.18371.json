These constraints are derived from\nobservations of the Milky Way Halo, 33 Local Group spheroidal dwarf (dSph)\ngalaxies and separately for the dSph galaxy Ursa Major III/UNIONS 1. The\nconstraints from the Milky Way Halo are the strongest among others and among\nall available in literature for this class of Dark Matter models with particle\nmasses from 4 to 15 keV.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
