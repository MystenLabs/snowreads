Similar to the previously discovered cases in flat and\n(Anti) de Sitter backgrounds, the interactions are characterized by a bracket\nthat encodes a kinematic algebra. We discuss how the color-kinematics duality\nand double copy are realized in these cosmological backgrounds. If we further\nimpose that the Ricci scalar is that of an FLRW spacetime, we find two new\nself-dual metrics corresponding to radiation-dominated and coasting\n(non-accelerating) FLRW backgrounds. Relaxing this requirement, we find an\ninfinite family of solutions given by three different conformal classes of\ncosmological self-dual metrics. These solutions approximate those of FLRW as\nlong as we impose a simple additional constraint on the scalar theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
