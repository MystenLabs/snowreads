Such stability can be achieved with active\nwavefront control (WFC). The next generation of ground- and space-based\ntelescopes will require a robust form of WFC in order to image planets at small\ninner working angles and extreme flux ratios with respect to the host star. WFC\nalgorithms such as implicit Electric Field Conjugation (iEFC) reduce stellar\nleakage by minimizing the electric field within a given region of an image,\ncreating a dark hole. iEFC utilizes an empirical approach to sense and remove\nspeckles in the focal plane. While iEFC is empirically calibrated and can\nhandle optical model errors, there are still model assumptions made during the\ncalibration. The performance of iEFC will degrade if the system changes due to\nslow, optomechanical drifts. In this work, we assess the iEFC performance\nimpacts of pupil misalignments on the deformable mirror and focal plane\nmisalignments on the detector. We base our analysis on the MagAO-X instrument,\nan extreme AO system installed on the Magellan-Clay telescope, to develop iEFC\nmisalignment tolerancing requirements for both ground- and space-based\nmissions. We present end-to-end physical optics simulations of the MagAO-X\ninstrument, demonstrating iEFC alignment tolerance.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
