Here, we propose a method that can\naccommodate unmeasured discrete confounding. Extending recent identifiability\nresults in deep latent variable models, we show theoretically that confounding\ncan be detected and corrected under the assumption that the observed data is a\npiecewise affine transformation of a latent Gaussian mixture model and that the\nidentity of the mixture components is confounded. We provide a flow-based\nalgorithm to estimate this model and perform deconfounding. Experimental\nresults on synthetic and real-world data provide support for the effectiveness\nof our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1wsZoB_rwQUjQkQ6ZW3l2l_FkjWlncg-7KwBKbwETf0","pdfSize":"1077023"}
