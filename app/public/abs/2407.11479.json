Here using colloidal experiments combined with coarse-grained\nmolecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the glass transition in\nmonolayers of rough colloidal ellipsoids. Compared with smooth colloidal\nellipsoids, the surface roughness of ellipsoids is found to significantly\nchange the nature of glass transition. In particular, we find that the surface\nroughness induced by coating only a few small hemispheres on the ellipsoids can\neliminate the existence of orientational glass and the two-step glass\ntransition found in monolayers of smooth ellipsoids. This is due to the surface\nroughness-induced coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of\nfreedom in colloidal ellipsoids, which also destroys the structure-dynamic\ncorrelation found in glass-forming suspensions of colloidal ellipsoids. Our\nresults not only suggest a new way of using surface roughness to manipulate the\nglass transition in colloidal systems, but also highlight the importance of\ndetailed particle shape on the glass transition and structure-dynamics\ncorrelation in suspensions of anisotropic colloids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
