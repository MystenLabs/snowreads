It is important because the GFFs of hadrons have information on the\ninternal stress distribution that may provide insight into the mechanism of how\nQCD forms hadrons. The forward limit value of this GFFs, i.e. the D-term, was\nalso obtained. Furthermore, in this approach, we observe the so-called glueball\ndominance, in which pions have gravitational interactions via infinite glueball\nspectra.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
