For the quintessence scenario, we considered two specific cases of $w$,\nwhich is the ratio of the pressure and energy density, namely $w=-1/3$ and\n$w=-2/3$. For the GUP, we used a modified Schwarzschild metric and employed a\nunique choice of contour integration to compute the tunneling amplitudes. An\nanalysis and comparative study of the respective temperature profiles have been\nmade.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
