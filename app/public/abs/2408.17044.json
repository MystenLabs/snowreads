In this paradigm,\nuser actions change application state, and those changes propagate reactively\nto derived state and to the display, reducing the likelihood that various parts\nof the data model and user-facing view will become out of sync due to\nprogrammer error. In this paper, we explore the application of relational\nprogramming to the specification and synchronized evolution of model and view\nacross time in response to user input. To that end, we present a reactive\nJavascript implementation of miniKanren and an integrated reactive programming\nmodel oriented towards the challenges of front-end web development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
