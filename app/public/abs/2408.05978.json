In this review, I will discuss kDNA from\nthe astonished perspective of a polymer physicist and tell a story of how a\nsingle sub-celluar structure from a blood-dwelling parasite is inspiring\ngenerations of polymer chemists and physicists to create new catenated\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
