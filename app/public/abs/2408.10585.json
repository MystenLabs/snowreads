Our\nanalysis shows that large-scale structure measurements from the SDSS LRG data\noffer a promising approach to probing non-thermally produced gravitinos.\nSpecifically, if gravitinos resulting from neutralino decay constitute a\nfraction $F_\\text{dec}=0.35~(0.1)$ of the dark matter component, the data\nexclude bino-like neutralino with a mass $m_{\\chi_1^0}\\lesssim25~(11)\\text{\nGeV}$. Furthermore, this constraint appears to be largely independent of the\ngravitino mass.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FDx4P8v1ETXiTPeAz9DH0rJ1QRA5Q0TdBQ_DeQcGop4","pdfSize":"627633"}
