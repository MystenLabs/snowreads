Our analysis covers models with two and three fields,\nexamining the behavior of the most important quantities associated with the\nbrane, such as the warp factor and the stability of the corresponding gravity\nsector. The results show that the brane is stable and supports a hybrid\ncharacter, behaving as a thin and thick configuration.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
