Here, we update our previous model of the limits of\ngalvanotaxis due to stochasticity of sensor movements to account for cell shape\nand orientation. Computing the Fisher information, we find that cells in\nprinciple possess more information about the electric field direction when\ntheir long axis is parallel to the field, but that for weak fields\nmaximum-likelihood estimators of the field direction may actually have lower\nvariability when the cell's long axis is perpendicular to the field. In an\nalternate possibility, we find that if cells instead estimate the field\ndirection by taking the average of all the sensor locations as its directional\ncue (\"vector sum\"), this introduces a bias towards the short axis, an effect\nnot present for isotropic cells. We also explore the possibility that cell\nelongation arises downstream of sensor redistribution. We argue that if sensors\nmigrate to the cell's rear, the cell will expand perpendicular the field - as\nis more commonly observed - but if sensors migrate to the front, the cell will\nelongate parallel to the field.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Cell Behavior","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
