Here, we consider the task of constructing a\n$(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanner for $P$, where every edge might fail (independently)\nwith probability $1-\\psi$. For example, for $\\psi=0.1$, about $90\\%$ of the\nedges of the graph fail. Nevertheless, we show how to construct a spanner that\nsurvives such a catastrophe with near linear number of edges.\n  The measure of reliability of the graph constructed is how many pairs of\nvertices lose $(1+\\varepsilon)$-connectivity. Surprisingly, despite the spanner\nconstructed being of near linear size, the number of failed pairs is close to\nthe number of failed pairs if the underlying graph was a clique.\n  Specifically, we show how to construct such an exact dependable spanner in\none dimension of size $O(\\tfrac{n}{\\psi} \\log n)$, which is optimal. Next, we\nbuild an $(1+\\varepsilon)$-spanners for a set $P \\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$\npoints, of size $O( C n \\log n )$, where $C \\approx 1/\\bigl(\\varepsilon^{d}\n\\psi^{4/3}\\bigr)$. Surprisingly, these new spanners also have the property that\nalmost all pairs of vertices have a $\\leq 4$-hop paths between them realizing\nthis short path.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
