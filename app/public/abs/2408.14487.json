To address these, we describe a novel approach called\nBoolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging boolean matrices to\nevaluate large logic programs. We introduce a new system, $BMLP_{active}$,\nwhich efficiently explores the genomic hypothesis space by guiding informative\nexperimentation through active learning. In contrast to sub-symbolic methods,\n$BMLP_{active}$ encodes a state-of-the-art GEM of a widely accepted bacterial\nhost in an interpretable and logical representation using datalog logic\nprograms. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ can successfully learn the interaction\nbetween a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation,\novercoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables\nrapid optimisation of metabolic models and offers a realistic approach to a\nself-driving lab for microbial engineering.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
