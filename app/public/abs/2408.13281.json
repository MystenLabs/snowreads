This paper examines the current landscape of NFT metadata storage,\nrevealing a significant reliance on centralized platforms, which poses risks to\nthe integrity, security, and decentralization of these digital assets. Through\na detailed analysis of top-selling NFTs on the OpenSea marketplace, it was\nfound that a substantial portion of metadata is hosted on centralized servers,\nmaking them susceptible to censorship, data breaches, and administrative\nalterations. Conversely, decentralized storage solutions, particularly the\nInterPlanetary File System (IPFS), were identified as a more secure and\nresilient alternative, offering enhanced transparency, resistance to tampering,\nand greater control for creators and collectors. This study advocates for the\nwidespread adoption of decentralized storage architectures, incorporating\ndigital signatures to verify ownership, as a means to preserve the value and\ntrustworthiness of NFTs in an increasingly digital world. The findings\nunderscore the necessity for NFT platforms to prioritize decentralized\nmethodologies to ensure the long-term sustainability and integrity of the NFT\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GBmmbKId8dLI4dMAGf8zgFQ6PMlvVKd79Fmf2XE8jHs","pdfSize":"139504"}
