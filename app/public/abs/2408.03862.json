The model is obtained from the combination of augmented\nLagrangian techniques proposed earlier by the authors of this paper, with a\nclassical Cattaneo-type relaxation that allows to reformulate diffusion\nequations as augmented first order hyperbolic systems with stiff relaxation\nsource terms. The proposed system is proven to be hyperbolic and to admit a\nLyapunov functional, in accordance with the original equations. A new numerical\nscheme is proposed to solve the original Cahn-Hilliard equations based on\nconservative semi-implicit finite differences, while the hyperbolic system was\nnumerically solved by means of a classical second order MUSCL-Hancock-type\nfinite volume scheme. The proposed approach is validated through a set of\nclassical benchmarks such as spinodal decomposition, Ostwald ripening and exact\nstationary solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
