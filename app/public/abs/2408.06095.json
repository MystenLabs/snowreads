We\nsay that a moduli space satisfies weak Brill-Noether if the general sheaf has\nat most one non-zero cohomology group. Let $(X,H)$ be a polarized abelian\nsurface and let $\\mathbf{v}=(r,\\xi,a)$ be a Mukai vector on $X$ with\n$\\mathbf{v}^2\\ge 0$,$r>0$, and $\\xi\\cdot H>0$. We show that if $\\rho(X)=1$ or\n$\\rho(X)=2$ and $X$ contains an elliptic curve, then all the moduli spaces\n$M_{X,H}(\\mathbf{v})$ satisfy weak Brill-Noether. Conversely, if $\\rho(X)>2$ or\n$\\rho(X)=2$ and $X$ does not contain an elliptic curve, we show that there are\ninfinitely many moduli spaces $M_{X,H}(\\mathbf{v})$ that fail weak\nBrill-Noether. As a consequence, we classify Chern classes of Ulrich bundles on\nabelian surfaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"mP9bNVyn6I32iOxpKvk6wC1t2ZSoVOENdz7gtVA644k","pdfSize":"323084"}
