These changes may involve\nadding or removing attributes, changing data types, and modifying values or\ntheir semantics. Integrating these datasets into a database poses a significant\nchallenge: how to keep track of the evolving database schema while\nincorporating different versions of the data sources? This paper presents a\nstatistical methodology to validate the integration of 12 years of open-access\ndatasets from Brazil's School Census, with a new version of the datasets\nreleased annually by the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC). We employ\nvarious statistical tests to find matching attributes between datasets from a\nspecific year and their potential equivalents in datasets from later years. The\nresults show that by using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test we can successfully\nmatch columns from different dataset versions in about 90% of cases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
