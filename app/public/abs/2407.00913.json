We introduce a defense mechanism, SecureSpectra, addressing DF\nthreats by embedding orthogonal, irreversible signatures within audio.\nSecureSpectra leverages the inability of DF models to replicate high-frequency\ncontent, which we empirically identify across diverse datasets and DF models.\nIntegrating differential privacy into the pipeline protects signatures from\nreverse engineering and strikes a delicate balance between enhanced security\nand minimal performance compromises. Our evaluations on Mozilla Common Voice,\nLibriSpeech, and VoxCeleb datasets showcase SecureSpectra's superior\nperformance, outperforming recent works by up to 71% in detection accuracy. We\nopen-source SecureSpectra to benefit the research community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
