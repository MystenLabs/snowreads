With\nadvancements in machine learning and deep learning, various models have been\napplied to PVPF tasks. However, constructing an optimal predictive architecture\nfor specific PVPF tasks remains challenging, as it requires cross-domain\nknowledge and significant labor costs. To address this challenge, we introduce\nAutoPV, a novel framework for the automated search and construction of PVPF\nmodels based on neural architecture search (NAS) technology. We develop a brand\nnew NAS search space that incorporates various data processing techniques from\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) TSF models and typical PVPF deep learning models. The\neffectiveness of AutoPV is evaluated on diverse PVPF tasks using a dataset from\nthe Daqing Photovoltaic Station in China. Experimental results demonstrate that\nAutoPV can complete the predictive architecture construction process in a\nrelatively short time, and the newly constructed architecture is superior to\nSOTA predefined models. This work bridges the gap in applying NAS to TSF\nproblems, assisting non-experts and industries in automatically designing\neffective PVPF models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
