We\nprove that the metric mean dimensions of a continuous map and its inverse limit\ncoincide, generalizing Bowen's entropy formula. Building upon this result, we\nextend the notion of metric mean dimension to discontinuous maps in terms of\nsuitable subshifts. As an application, we show that the metric mean dimension\nof the Gauss map and that of induced maps of the Manneville-Pomeau family is\nequal to the box dimension of the corresponding set of discontinuity points,\nwhich also coincides with a critical parameter of the pressure operator\nassociated to the geometric potential.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0pgLJL9VCjC7QrG0RnR2hpa_z3UNxbYw4I-QHzD_-oI","pdfSize":"674463","objectId":"0xda43ba7b09f098f14e8aa094f8b912bbf9529028b8f17f96404aef36a3f234db","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
