As one of these fair mechanisms, the uniform\nrank-minimizing mechanism is considered. We focus on the case where agents can\nrefuse their assignment and obtain the outside option instead. Without the\nrefusal option, truth-telling is not strategically dominated by any strategies\nif a fair rank-minimizing mechanism is used. However, if agents have the option\nand the uniform rank-minimizing mechanism is used, then a strategy called an\noutside option demotion strategy strategically dominates truth-telling.\nMoreover, we show that adopting this strategy may lead to inefficient\nassignments. To counter this, we propose a modification of the uniform\nrank-minimizing mechanism, though it may lead agents to strategically reduce\nthe number of acceptable types.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
