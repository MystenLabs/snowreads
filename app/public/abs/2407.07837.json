Conversely,\nknowledge of the EOS allows an improved interpretation of nuclear or\nastrophysical data. In this article, we use several established constraints on\nthe EOS and the new NICER measurement of PSR J0437-4715 to comment on the\nnature of the primary companion in GW230529 and the companion of PSR\nJ0514-4002E. We find that, with a probability of $\\gtrsim 84\\%$ and $\\gtrsim\n68\\%$, respectively, both objects are black holes. These likelihoods increase\nto above $95\\%$ when one uses GW170817's remnant as an upper limit on the TOV\nmass. We also demonstrate that the current knowledge of the EOS substantially\ndisfavors high masses and radii for PSR J0030+0451, inferred recently when\ncombining NICER with XMM-Newton background data and using particular hot-spot\nmodels. Finally, we also use our obtained EOS knowledge to comment on\nmeasurements of the nuclear symmetry energy, finding that the large value\npredicted by the PREX-II measurement displays some mild tension with other\nconstraints on the EOS.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
