The\ntrajectories of ions are calculated using the modified Velocity Verlet\nalgorithm designed for a reliable simulation of the charged particle dynamics\nin arbitrarily strong static homogeneous external magnetic fields. We consider\nthe coupling parameter values characteristic for dusty plasma experiments and\nthe external magnetic field with $B\\leq 1~{\\rm T}$. It has been revealed that\nat some magnetic field values, the ions are trapped around the charged dust\nparticle. The magnetic field strength values in which the ion becomes trapped\naround the dust particle have been obtained for typical argon and helium gas\ndischarge plasma parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
