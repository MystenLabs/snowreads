We employ a passivity-based formalism to establish stability using wave\nvariables and wave scattering techniques, and we enhance the convergence rate\nby combining it with predictor-based approaches. The elevated time delay within\nthe teleoperated communication layer is known to induce an oscillatory\nbehavior, which reduces the convergence rate and increases the settling time in\nthe convergence of power variables. This issue is addressed in this paper by\nutilizing a Smith predictor on the operator end and Minimum Jerk (MJ) predictor\non the remote end. We present experimental and simulation results to\ndemonstrate the improvements, ensuring stable teleoperation under high\ncommunication time delays.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PSMFQJS7qZjEgumM2Gg9Gl4txLDBd217mPa0VtCO62U","pdfSize":"769687"}
