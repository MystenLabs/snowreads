While\nqaoa targets problems in complexity class NP, the classical optimisation\nprocedure required in every iteration is itself known to be NP-hard. Still,\nadvantage over classical approaches is suspected for certain scenarios, but\nnature and origin of its computational power are not yet satisfactorily\nunderstood. By introducing means of efficiently and accurately approximating\nthe qaoa optimisation landscape from solution space structures, we derive a new\nalgorithmic variant: Instead of performing an iterative quantum-classical\ncomputation for each input instance, our non-iterative method is based on a\nquantum circuit that is instance-independent, but problem-specific. It matches\nor outperforms unit-depth qaoa for key combinatorial problems, despite reduced\ncomputational effort. Our approach is based on proving a long-standing\nconjecture regarding instance-independent structures in qaoa. By ensuring\ngenerality, we link existing empirical observations on qaoa parameter\nclustering to established approaches in theoretical computer science, and\nprovide a sound foundation for understanding the link between structural\nproperties of solution spaces and quantum optimisation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
