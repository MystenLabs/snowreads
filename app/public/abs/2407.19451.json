Unlike previous work that jointly\nmodels the global hair shape and local strand details, we propose to\ndisentangle them using a PCA-based strand representation in the frequency\ndomain, thereby allowing more precise editing and output control. Specifically,\nwe leverage our strand representation to fit and decompose hair geometry\ntextures into low- to high-frequency hair structures. These decomposed textures\nare later parameterized with different generative models, emulating common\nstages in the hair modeling process. We conduct extensive experiments to\nvalidate the architecture design of \\textsc{Perm}, and finally deploy the\ntrained model as a generic prior to solve task-agnostic problems, further\nshowcasing its flexibility and superiority in tasks such as 3D hair\nparameterization, hairstyle interpolation, single-view hair reconstruction, and\nhair-conditioned image generation.
