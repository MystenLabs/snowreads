In particular,\ndeterministic, robust, and fast protocols that prepare genuine multipartite\nentangled states are highly desirable. In this article, we propose a fractional\nquantum state transfer, in which the excitation of an emitter is partially\ntransmitted through the quantum communication channel and then absorbed at a\nspatially separated node. This protocol is based on wavepacket shaping allowing\nfor a fast deterministic generation of Bell states among two quantum registers\nand $W$ states for a general setting of $N$ qubits, either in a sequential or\nsimultaneous fashion, depending on the topology of the network. By means of\ndetailed numerical simulations, we show that genuine multipartite entangled\nstates can be faithfully prepared within current experimental platforms and\ndiscuss the role of the main decoherence sources, qubit dephasing and\nrelaxation, depending on the network topology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aqEieQ2c1H-FLlK1OHZg-M4QTsQ_qCF8ae4hpHkfE0I","pdfSize":"930145","txDigest":"C7aReZ2CSo5dJhskjqkQyLALTetQkhLe6xYsryYHRNJW","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
