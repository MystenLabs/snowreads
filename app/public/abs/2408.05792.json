Currently available fusion methods face two major issues: 1) simple\nmethods such as concatenation and summation are generic, but not accurate in\ncapturing feature relationships; 2) task-specific methods like attention\nmechanisms and meta paths may not be suitable for general feature fusion. To\naddress these challenges, we present GraphTransfer, a simple but universal\nfeature fusion framework for GNN-based collaborative filtering. Our method\naccurately fuses different types of features by first extracting graph features\nfrom the user-item interaction graph and auxiliary features from users and\nitems using GCN. The proposed cross fusion module then effectively bridges the\nsemantic gaps between the interaction scores of different features. Theoretical\nanalysis and experiments on public datasets show that GraphTransfer outperforms\nother feature fusion methods in CF tasks. Additionally, we demonstrate the\nuniversality of our framework via empirical studies in three other scenarios,\nshowing that GraphTransfer leads to significant improvements in the performance\nof CF algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
