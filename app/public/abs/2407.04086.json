Watermarking AI-generated content is a key technology\nto address these concerns and has been widely deployed in industry. However,\nwatermarking is vulnerable to removal attacks and forgery attacks. In this\nwork, we propose the first image watermarks with certified robustness\nguarantees against removal and forgery attacks. Our method leverages randomized\nsmoothing, a popular technique to build certifiably robust classifiers and\nregression models. Our major technical contributions include extending\nrandomized smoothing to watermarking by considering its unique characteristics,\nderiving the certified robustness guarantees, and designing algorithms to\nestimate them. Moreover, we extensively evaluate our image watermarks in terms\nof both certified and empirical robustness.
