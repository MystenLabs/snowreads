This study\nfocuses on leveraging QSPR within the framework of vertex and edge weighted\n(VEW) molecular graphs, exploring their significance in drug research. By\nexamining 48 drugs in used in the treatment of various cancers and their\nphysicochemical properties, previous studies serve as a foundation for our\nresearch. Introducing a novel methodology for computing vertex and edge\nweights, exemplified by the drug Busulfan, we highlight the importance of\nconsidering atomic properties and inter-bond dynamics. Statistical analysis,\nemploying linear regression models, reveals enhanced correlations between\ntopological indices and physicochemical properties of drugs. Comparison with\nprevious studies on unweighted molecular graphs highlights the enhancements\nachieved with our approach.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
