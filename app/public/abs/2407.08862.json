We assume a generalized version of the stable unit treatment value\nassumption, but we do not assume any version of strongly ignorable treatment\nassignment. Instead of conducting a sensitivity analysis, we utilize the\nprinciple of maximum entropy to estimate the distribution of causal effects. We\ndevelop a principled middle-way between extreme explanations of the observed\ndata: we do not conclude that an observed association is wholly spurious, and\nwe do not conclude that it is wholly causal. Rather, our conclusions are\ntempered and we conclude that the association is part spurious and part causal.\nIn an example application we apply our methodology to analyze an observed\nassociation between marijuana use and hard drug use.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
