Specifically, we first\nformulate a system model with spatially correlated Rician fading channels and\nintroduce the concept of VRs. Then, we derive a closed-form approximate\nexpression for the achievable rate applicable to any number of BS antennas and\nRIS elements, and analyze the impact of VRs on system performance and\ncomplexity. Next, we solve the problem of maximizing the minimum user rate by\noptimizing the phase shifts of RIS through an algorithm based on accelerated\ngradient ascent. Finally, we present numerical results to demonstrate the\nperformance of the gradient algorithm from different aspects and reveal the low\nsystem complexity of deploying XL-RIS in massive MIMO systems with the help of\nVRs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
