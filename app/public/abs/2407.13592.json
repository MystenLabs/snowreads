In this work,\nwe propose MeshFeat, a parametric feature encoding tailored to meshes, for\nwhich we adapt the idea of multi-resolution feature grids from Euclidean space.\nWe start from the structure provided by the given vertex topology and use a\nmesh simplification algorithm to construct a multi-resolution feature\nrepresentation directly on the mesh. The approach allows the usage of small\nMLPs for neural fields on meshes, and we show a significant speed-up compared\nto previous representations while maintaining comparable reconstruction quality\nfor texture reconstruction and BRDF representation. Given its intrinsic\ncoupling to the vertices, the method is particularly well-suited for\nrepresentations on deforming meshes, making it a good fit for object animation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
