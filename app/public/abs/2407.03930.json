In addition, we provide\ntheoretical evidence demonstrating the algorithm's convergence in optimization\nproblems of signal recovery. Furthermore, our algorithm demonstrates superior\nperformance over traditional optimization methods, such as FISTA, particularly\nby achieving faster early convergence in practical scenarios including signal\ndenoising, seismic wave detection, and computed tomography reconstruction.\nNotably, our algorithm is compatible with neuromorphic chips, such as Loihi,\nfacilitating efficient multitasking within the same chip architecture - a\ncapability not present in existing algorithms. These advancements make our\ngeneralized Spiking LCA a promising solution for real-world applications,\noffering significant improvements in execution speed and flexibility for\nneuromorphic computing systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
