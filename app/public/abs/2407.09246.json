These\nproceedings reflect a presentation given at DIS2024 and provide a snapshot of\nthe current frontier for theoretical predictions at the LHC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NcSZBoB0t1omC5P-_huqqBP6SdsLA4vC9_CQGmwfYx0","pdfSize":"1524676","objectId":"0x8ab8cc39301ab7c9d4f0eafa617fd992738c4858a863df56f4e6a50ee5132f98","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
