This paper introduces\nDebriSense-THz, a novel Terahertz-Enabled Debris Sensing system for LEO\nsatellites that leverages Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC)\ntechnology. We present a comprehensive THz channel model for LEO environments,\nincorporating debris interactions such as reflection, scattering, and\ndiffraction. The DebriSense-THz architecture employs machine learning\ntechniques for debris detection and classification using Channel State\nInformation (CSI) features. Performance evaluation across different frequencies\n(30 GHz-5 THz), MIMO configurations, debris densities, and SNR levels\ndemonstrates significant improvements in debris detection and classification\naccuracy (95-99% at 5 THz compared to 62-81% at 30 GHz). Higher SNR\nconfigurations enhance sensing performance, particularly at higher frequencies.\nThe system shows robust performance across various debris densities and MIMO\nsize in the THz range, with a noted trade-off between communication reliability\nand sensing accuracy at lower frequencies. DebriSense-THz represents a\nsignificant advance in space situational awareness, paving the way for more\neffective debris mitigation strategies in increasingly congested LEO\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
