We achieve this by\nobtaining a quantitative ballistic lower bound for the Abel-averaged time\nevolution of general periodic Schr\\\"odinger operators in terms of the\nbandwidths. A similar result without uniformity, which assumes\n$\\beta(\\alpha)>\\frac{C}{\\delta}\\min_{\\sigma}\\gamma$, was obtained earlier by\nJitomirskaya and Zhang, for an implicit constant $C<\\infty$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
