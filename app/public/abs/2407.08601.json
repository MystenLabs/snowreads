Our calculated Fermi surfaces\nare in good agreement with the angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy\n(ARPES) results. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An\norbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals\nexhibit a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals are metallic\ndue to self-doping. And the ML also shows features of heavy fermions, which\nindicates that there may be Kondo physics in 1313-La327. We also find a large\nstatic local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin\nfluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic\ncorrelation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ (La4310). The $e_g$ orbitals of\nthe outer-layer Ni in TL (TL-outer Ni) show non-Fermi liquid behaviors.\nBesides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni,\nimplying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our\ncalculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a\ntheoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate\nsuperconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
