We extend\ncovariant phase space formalism to the cases in which boundaries are allowed to\nfluctuate. We analyze the symplectic form, the freedoms (ambiguities), and its\nconservation for this case. We show that boundary fluctuations render all the\nsurface charges integrable. We study the algebra of charges and its central\nextensions, charge conservation, and fluxes. We briefly comment on memory\neffects and questions regarding semiclassical aspects of black holes in the\nfluctuating boundary setup.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
