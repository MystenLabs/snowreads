We describe the calculation\nand present analytic results for both the full flavor structure of the SMEFT\nand with the assumption of minimal flavor violation. We present numerical\nresults for the renormalization-group evolution of the coefficients, and study\ntheir impact on fits of the LHC Drell-Yan data. The effects of running on the\ndimension-8 coefficients can reach 50% or more when evolving from 10 TeV scale\ndown to few-GeV energies relevant for the analysis of fixed-target data.\nHowever, the impact of the dimension-8 running on the analysis of Drell-Yan\ndata from the LHC is minimal.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
