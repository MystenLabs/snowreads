On one hand, the empirical results show that ESG rating disagreement\nreduces corporate TFP, a conclusion that is validated through multiple\nrobustness tests. The mechanism analysis reveals an interaction effect between\ngreen innovation and ESG rating disagreement. Specifically, in firms without\nESG rating disagreement, green innovation promotes the improvement of TFP;\nhowever, in firms with disagreement, although ESG rating disagreement may drive\ngreen innovation, this does not lead to an increase in TFP. Furthermore, ESG\nrating disagreement lower corporate TFP by increasing financing constraints.\nThe heterogeneity analysis indicates that this effect is more pronounced in\nnon-state-owned, asset-intensive, and low-pollution enterprises. On the other\nhand, XGBoost regression demonstrates that ESG rating disagreement play a\nsignificant role in predicting TFP, with SHAP values showing that the main\neffects are more evident in firms with larger ESG rating disagreement.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
