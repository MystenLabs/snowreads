In this review article, we attempt to systematically understand\ntheir electronic band structures based on our recent angle-resolved\nphotoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies and first-principles calculations.\nWe underscore the role of the localized molecular-like orbital bonds that form\nthe anomalous flat bands in the momentum space, and demonstrate how they\ninfluence the Fermi surface anisotropy, phase stabilities of crystal\nstructures, and nontrivial topological properties in some cases. We also\nelaborate the future prospects for novel quantum phenomena that can be realized\nin these materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VjrNSyC_K786TfGAMguu4it1eoq7NUWc_AD8vhtKXqY","pdfSize":"3898854","txDigest":"GavvuTtyadzdTP3rsbbsp49ae37tXXC4Jt5v8jUCnZQk","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
