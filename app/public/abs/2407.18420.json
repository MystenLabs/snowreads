It enables deciding sentences of such theories with arbitrary\nexistential quantification, conjunction and a fixed number of negation symbols\nin polynomial time. It was recently shown by Nguyen and Pak [SIAM J. Comput.\n51(2): 1--31 (2022)] that an even more restricted such fragment of Presburger\narithmetic (the first-order theory of the integers with addition and order) is\nNP-hard. In contrast, by application of our framework, we show that the fixed\nnegation fragment of weak Presburger arithmetic, which drops the order relation\nfrom Presburger arithmetic in favour of equality, is decidable in polynomial\ntime.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
