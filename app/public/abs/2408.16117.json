Such counts in low-photon settings are\noften modeled using a Poisson distribution. However, this model assumes that\nthe mean and variance of the signal's noise distribution are equal. For\noverdispersed data where the variance is greater than the mean, the negative\nbinomial distribution is a more appropriate statistical model. In this paper,\nwe propose an optimization approach for recovering images corrupted by\noverdispersed Poisson noise. In particular, we incorporate a weighted\nanisotropic-isotropic total variation regularizer, which avoids staircasing\nartifacts that are introduced by a regular total variation penalty. We use an\nalternating direction method of multipliers, where each subproblem has a\nclosed-form solution. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of\nour proposed approach, especially in very photon-limited settings.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
