This paper explores the\nsecurity risks associated with smart light systems, focusing on covert\ncommunication channels. Drawing upon previous re-search highlighting\nvulnerabilities in communication protocols and en-cryption flaws, the study\ninvestigates the potential for exploiting smart light systems for covert data\ntransmission. Specifically, the paper repli-cates and analyzes an attack method\nintroduced by Ronen and Shamir, which utilizes the Philips Hue White lighting\nsystem to create a covert channel through visible light communication (VLC).\nExperimental re-sults demonstrate the feasibility of transmitting data covertly\nthrough subtle variations in brightness levels, leveraging the inherent\nfunctional-ity of smart light bulbs. Despite limit. ations imposed by device\nconstraints and communication protocols, the study underscores the need for\nheightened awareness and security measures in IoT environment. Ultimately, the\nfindings emphasize the importance of implementing robust security practices and\nexercising caution when deploying networked IoT devices in sensitive\nenvironment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
