We\nintroduce a symplectic version of quiver Grassmannians studied in our previous\npapers and prove a number of results on these projective algebraic varieties.\nFirst, we construct a cellular decomposition of the symplectic quiver\nGrassmannians in question and develop combinatorics needed to compute Euler\ncharacteristics and Poincar\\'e polynomials. Second, we show that the number of\nirreducible components of our varieties coincides with the Euler characteristic\nof the classical symplectic Grassmannians. Third, we describe the automorphism\ngroups of the underlying symplectic quiver representations and show that the\ncells are the orbits of this group. Lastly, we provide an embedding into the\naffine flag varieties for the affine symplectic group.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
