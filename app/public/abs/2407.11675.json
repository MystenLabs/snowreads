We describe quantum circuits\nand convey an understanding of their inherent combinatorial nature and the\nexponential blow-up that makes them hard to analyze. Then, we show how weighted\nmodel counting (\\#SAT) can be used to solve hard analysis tasks for quantum\ncircuits.\n  This tutorial is aimed at everyone in the formal methods community with an\ninterest in quantum computing. Familiarity with quantum computing is not\nrequired, but basic linear algebra knowledge (particularly matrix\nmultiplication and basis vectors) is a prerequisite. The goal of the tutorial\nis to inspire the community to advance the development of quantum computing\nwith formal methods.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
