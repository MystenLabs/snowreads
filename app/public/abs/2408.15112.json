The DBs were charged in a scanning\ntunneling microscope (STM) and then exposed to PBr3 directly in the STM\nchamber. Uncharged DBs rarely react with molecules. On the contrary, almost all\npositively charged DBs were filled with molecule fragments. As a result of the\nPBr3 interaction with the positively charged DB, the molecule dissociated into\nPBr2 and Br with the formation of a Si-Br bond and PBr2 desorption. These\nfindings show that charged DBs significantly modify the reactivity of the\nsurface towards PBr3. Additionally, we calculated PH3 adsorption on a\nSi(100)-2x1-H surface with DBs and found that the DB charge also has a\nsignificant impact. As a result, we demonstrated that the positively charged DB\nwith a doubly unoccupied state enhances the adsorption of molecules with a lone\npair of electrons.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jT10TG2cl36jv00nqGQZl960EPF40DN6jYt1FxwL_Jc","pdfSize":"1482597"}
