It\nalso concerns Hewitt's theorem stating that a Tychonoff space is realcompact if\nand only if every $z$-ultrafilter with the countable intersection property in\nthis space is fixed. The axiom of choice was involved in the original proofs of\nthese theorems. The aim of this article is to show that the Herrlich-Chew\ntheorem is valid in $\\mathbf{ZF}$, but it is an open problem if Hewitt's\ntheorem can be false in a model of $\\mathbf{ZF}$. It is proved that Hewitt's\ntheorem is true in every model of $\\mathbf{ZF}$ in which the countable axiom of\nmultiple choice is satisfied. A modification of Hewitt's theorem is given and\nproved true in $\\mathbf{ZF}$. Several applications of the results obtained are\nshown.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fTR76TpXE2JCLouYhp-3noVZ0vOpz-0KheazjN24cDQ","pdfSize":"336635"}
