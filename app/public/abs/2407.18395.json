It states that if the number of particles $N$ is large and the\ndiscrete interaction energy is low, then the particle distribution is\nnecessarily close to the uniform distribution (i.e., the continuous energy\nminimizer) in the Wasserstein-infinity distance. As a consequence, we obtain a\nquantitative mean field limit of interaction energy minimizers in the\nWasserstein-infinity distance. The proof is based on the application of the\nauthor's previous joint work with J. Wang on the stability of continuous energy\nminimizer, together with a new mollification trick for the empirical measure in\nthe case of singular interaction potentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
