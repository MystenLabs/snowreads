Let\n$q$ be a prime power. In this paper, by using the simplicial complexes of\n${\\mathbb F}_{q}^m$ with one single maximal element, we construct four families\nof linear codes over the ring ${\\mathbb F}_{q}+u{\\mathbb F}_{q}$ ($u^2=0$),\nwhich generalizes the results of [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 66(6):3657-3663,\n2020]. The parameters and Lee weight distributions of these four families of\ncodes are completely determined. Most notably, via the Gray map, we obtain\nseveral classes of optimal linear codes over ${\\mathbb F}_{q}$, including\n(near) Griesmer codes and distance-optimal codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
