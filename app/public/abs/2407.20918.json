We observe that AGM revision and AGM\ncontraction operators for epistemic spaces are only realizable in precisely\ndetermined epistemic spaces. We define the class of linear change operators, a\nspecial kind of maxichoice operator. When AGM revision, respectively, AGM\ncontraction, is realizable, linear change operators are a canonical\nrealization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
