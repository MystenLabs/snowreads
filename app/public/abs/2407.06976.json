Achieving this goal requires, as a first step, the\ndevelopment of a metadata model that, on the one hand, complies with existing\nstandards, on the other hand, allows interoperability with other systems, and\non the third, captures all the elements of description established by the\ncurators of the collections. In this paper, we present a report on the current\nstatus of the work, in which we outline the most important requirements for the\ndata model under development and then make a detailed comparison with the two\nstandards that are the most relevant from the point of view of collections:\nEuropeana Data Model used in Europeana and Encoded Archival Description used in\nKalliope.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
