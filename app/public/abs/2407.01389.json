To demonstrate the\nutility of this approach we study the Bethe lattice and evaluate the second\norder self-energy for which reliable benchmarks exist. We show that, when\nevaluating diagrams on the Matsubara axis, the analytic sums of pole\nrepresentations are extremely precise. We point out the absence of a numerical\nsign problem in the evaluation, and explore the application of the same\nprocedure for real-frequency evaluation of diagrams. We find that\nreal-frequency results are subject to noise that is controlled at low\ntemperatures and can be mitigated at additional computational expense. We\nfurther demonstrate the utility of this approach by evaluating dynamical\nmean-field and bold diagrammatic self-consistency schemes at both second and\nfourth order and compare to benchmarks where available.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
