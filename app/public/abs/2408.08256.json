Alon and Assadi\nextended this work proving a similar result for $O(\\Delta/\\log\n\\Delta)$-coloring triangle-free graphs. Apart from being interesting results\nfrom a combinatorial standpoint, their results have various applications to the\ndesign of graph coloring algorithms in different models of computation.\n  In this work, we focus on graphs with sparse neighborhoods. We say a graph $G\n= (V,E)$ is $k$-locally-sparse if for each vertex $v \\in V$, the subgraph\n$G[N(v)]$ contains at most $k$ edges. A celebrated result of Alon, Krivelevich,\nand Sudakov shows that such graphs are $O(\\Delta/\\log\n(\\Delta/\\sqrt{k}))$-colorable. For any $\\alpha\\in(0,1)$ and\n$k\\ll\\Delta^{2\\alpha}$, let $G$ be a $k$-locally-sparse graph. We show the\nfollowing for\n$q=\\Theta\\left(\\Delta/\\log\\left(\\Delta^\\alpha/\\sqrt{k}\\right)\\right)$:\n  1. Sampling $O(\\Delta^\\alpha+\\sqrt{\\log n})$ colors per vertex is sufficient\nto obtain a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ from the sampled colors.\n  2. There exists a single-pass streaming algorithm which computes a proper\n$q$-coloring of $G$ with high probability using $\\tilde O(n\\Delta^{2\\alpha})$\nspace.\n  3. There exists a randomized non-adaptive sublinear-time algorithm which\ncomputes a proper $q$-coloring of $G$ with high probability using at most\n$\\tilde O\\left(n^{\\frac32+\\frac{\\alpha}{2-2\\alpha}}\\right)$ queries.\n  Our results recover and improve upon earlier work of Alon and Assadi. A key\nelement in our proof is a proposition regarding correspondence coloring in the\nso-called color-degree setting, which improves upon recent work of Anderson,\nKuchukova, and the author and is of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
