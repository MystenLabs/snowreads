Our work builds on an extensive analysis of\nvarious study programs at the University of Potsdam. The conceptualization of\nthe underlying principles provides us with a formal account of study\nregulations. In particular, the formalization reveals the properties of\nadmissible study plans. With these at end, we propose an encoding of study\nregulations in Answer Set Programming that produces corresponding study plans.\nFinally, we show how this approach can be extended to a generic user interface\nfor exploring study plans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
