Halo mass is crucial for understanding the halo-galaxy connection.\nThe abundance matching (AM) technique has been widely used to derive the halo\nmasses of galaxy groups. However, quenching of the central galaxy can decouple\nthe coevolution of its stellar mass and DM halo mass. Different halo assembly\nhistories can also result in significantly different final stellar mass of the\ncentral galaxies. These processes can introduce substantial uncertainties in\nthe halo masses derived from the AM method, particularly leading to a\nsystematic bias between groups with star-forming centrals (blue groups) and\npassive centrals (red groups). To improve, we developed a new machine learning\n(ML) algorithm that accounts for these effects and is trained on simulations.\nOur results show that the ML method eliminates the systematic bias in the\nderived halo masses for blue and red groups and is, on average, $\\sim1/3$ more\naccurate than the AM method. With careful calibration of observable quantities\nfrom simulations and observations from SDSS, we apply our ML model to the SDSS\nYang et al. groups to derive their halo masses down to\n$10^{11.5}\\mathrm{M_\\odot}$ or even lower. The derived SDSS group halo mass\nfunction agrees well with the theoretical predictions, and the derived\nstellar-to-halo mass relations for both red and blue groups matches well with\nthose obtained from direct weak lensing measurements. These new halo mass\nestimates enable more accurate investigation of the galaxy-halo connection and\nthe role of the halos in galaxy evolution.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
