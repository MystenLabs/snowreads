Here, we propose several\nnew ways of decreasing the weight of the Pauli measurements and their\nassociated \\textsc{cnot} complexity; we also demonstrate how to reduce this\nmodel's computational depth. Inspired by known state-transfer methods, we\nintroduce incPBC, a universal model for quantum computation requiring a larger\nnumber of (now incompatible) Pauli measurements of weight at most 2. For usual\nPBC, we prove new upper bounds on the required weights and computational depth,\nobtained via a pre-compilation step. We also propose a heuristic algorithm that\ncan contribute reductions of over 30\\% to the average weight of Pauli\nmeasurements (and associated \\textsc{cnot} count) when simulating and compiling\nClifford-dominated random quantum circuits with up to 22 $T$ gates and over\n20\\% for instances with larger $T$ counts.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
