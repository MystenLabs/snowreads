In recent studies of \"metric domain theory\" and Stone-type\ndualities, the more general notion of a (separated) metric compact Hausdorff\nspace emerged as a metric counterpart of Nachbin's compact ordered spaces.\nRoughly speaking, a metric compact Hausdorff space is a metric space equipped\nwith a \\emph{compatible} compact Hausdorff topology (which does not need to be\nthe induced topology). These spaces maintain many important features of compact\nmetric spaces, and, notably, the resulting category is much better behaved.\nMoreover, one can use inspiration from the theory of Nachbin's compact ordered\nspaces to solve problems for metric structures.\n  In this paper we continue this line of research: in the category of separated\nmetric compact Hausdorff spaces we characterise the regular monomorphisms as\nthe embeddings and the epimorphisms as the surjective morphisms. Moreover, we\nshow that epimorphisms out of an object $X$ can be encoded internally on $X$ by\ntheir kernel metrics, which are characterised as the continuous metrics below\nthe metric on $X$; this gives a convenient way to represent quotient objects.\nFinally, as the main result, we prove that its dual category has an algebraic\nflavour: it is Barr-exact. While we show that it cannot be a variety of\nfinitary algebras, it remains open whether it is an infinitary variety.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1g_ccvJjxQUOalBwkFWsg3Z5JQUHdTh1EQhAYbCHsdA","pdfSize":"379535"}
