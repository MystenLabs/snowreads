The article demonstrates the convergence of $AT$\nalgorithm towards fixed points of weak contractions. Notably, it establishes\nthe algorithm's strong convergence properties, highlighting its faster\nconvergence compared to established iterative methods such as $S$, normal-$S$,\nVarat, Mann, Ishikawa, $F^{*} $, and Picard algorithms. Additionally, the study\nexplores the $AT$ algorithm's almost stable behavior for weak contractions.\nEmphasizing practical applicability, the paper offers data-dependent results\nthrough the $AT$ algorithm and substantiates findings with illustrative\nnumerical examples\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
