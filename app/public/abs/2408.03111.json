Each stratum has the structure of a\npseudo-quotient, which is a relaxed GIT notion capturing the topology of the\nquotient and, therefore, behaving well for motivic computations of invariants\nof the character varieties. These stratifications are constructed by analyzing\nthe root datum of $G$ to encode parabolic classes. Finally, detailed and\nexplicit motivic formulae are provided for cases with Dynkin diagram of types\n$A$, $B$, $C$ and $D$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
