Here, we report a detailed study of magnetic and\nelectrical transport properties of Co$_{0.28}$TaS$_2$. The temperature\ndependent resistivity measurements display anomalous upturn below 11 K, which\npersists in presence of magnetic field even up to 14 T. In the low temperature\nregion, the resistivity upturn exhibits a unique $T^{1/2}$ scaling behavior,\nwhich remains unchanged when an external magnetic field is applied. The\n$T^{1/2}$ dependence of resistivity upturn is the hallmark of non-Fermi liquid\nstate in orbital two-channel Kondo effect(2CK). This anomalous resistivity\nupturn in Co$_{0.28}$TaS$_2$ can be attributed to the orbital two-channel Kondo\nmechanism.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
