Existing FCIL methods call for high communication\ncosts and exemplars from previous classes. We propose a novel rehearsal-free\nmethod for FCIL named prototypes-injected prompt (PIP) that involves 3 main\nideas: a) prototype injection on prompt learning, b) prototype augmentation,\nand c) weighted Gaussian aggregation on the server side. Our experiment result\nshows that the proposed method outperforms the current state of the arts\n(SOTAs) with a significant improvement (up to 33%) in CIFAR100, MiniImageNet\nand TinyImageNet datasets. Our extensive analysis demonstrates the robustness\nof PIP in different task sizes, and the advantage of requiring smaller\nparticipating local clients, and smaller global rounds.
