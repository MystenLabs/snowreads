Characteristic multi-TeV\nphotons up to 13 TeV were observed in the afterglow phase. The observed very\nhigh-energy (VHE) gamma-ray spectra by WCDA and KM2A during different time\nintervals and in different energy ranges can be explained very well in the\ncontext of the photohadronic model with the inclusion of extragalactic\nbackground light models. In the photohadronic scenario, interaction of\nhigh-energy protons with the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) photons in the\nforward shock region of the jet is assumed to be the source of these VHE\nphotons. The observed VHE spectra from the afterglow of GRB 221009A are similar\nto the VHE gamma-ray spectra observed from the temporary extreme high-energy\npeaked BL Lac (EHBL), 1ES 2344+514 {\\it only} during the 11th and the 12th of\nAugust, 2016. Such spectra are new and have been observed for the first time in\na GRB.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0nkkulKKVD1aD26P3G61LEFjC1gZ0kVNntCsqLmwZ8U","pdfSize":"744932","objectId":"0xdf394b10c65d514738bbeaf965f1ed46e24141fb60574c642570c3df7a720d12","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
