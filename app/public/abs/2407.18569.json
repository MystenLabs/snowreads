The challenge arises from the expensive and limited nature of user\ndata, coupled with the scene state space tending towards infinity. These\nfactors contribute to overfitting and poor generalization problems during model\ntraining. Henceforth, we propose an instance-based transfer imitation learning\napproach. This method facilitates knowledge transfer from extensive expert\ndomain data to the user domain, presenting a fundamental resolution to these\nissues. We initially train a pre-trained model using large-scale expert data.\nSubsequently, during the fine-tuning phase, we feed the batch data, which\ncomprises expert and user data. Employing the inverse reinforcement learning\ntechnique, we extract the style feature distribution from user demonstrations,\nconstructing the regularization term for the approximation of user style. In\nour experiments, we conducted extensive evaluations of the proposed method.\nCompared to the baseline methods, our approach mitigates the overfitting issue\ncaused by sparse user data. Furthermore, we discovered that integrating the\ndriving model with a differentiable nonlinear optimizer as a safety protection\nlayer for end-to-end personalized fine-tuning results in superior planning\nperformance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
