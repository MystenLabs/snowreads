We completely classify all\nportraits of $K$-rational preperiodic points for such $\\phi$ for all\nsufficiently large degrees $d$. More precisely, we prove that, up to accounting\nfor the natural action of $d$th roots of unity on the preperiodic points for\n$\\phi$, there are exactly thirteen such portraits up to isomorphism. In\nparticular, for all such global fields $K$, it follows from our results\ntogether with earlier work of Doyle-Poonen and Looper that the number of\n$K$-rational preperiodic points for $\\phi$ is uniformly bounded, independent of\n$d$. That is, there is a constant $B(K)$ depending only on $K$ such that\n$$\\big|\\text{PrePer}(x^d+c,K)\\big|\\leq B(K)$$ for all $d\\geq2$ and all $c\\in\nK$. Moreover, we apply this work to construct many irreducible polynomials with\nlarge dynamical Galois groups in semigroups generated by sets of unicritical\npolynomials under composition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
