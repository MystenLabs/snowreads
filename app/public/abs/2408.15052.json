It\nrepresents the first package providing a comprehensive modelling framework for\nspatio-temporal Poisson point processes. While many specialized models exist in\nthe scientific literature for analyzing complex spatio-temporal point patterns,\nwe address the lack of general software for comparing simpler alternative\nmodels and their goodness of fit. The package's main functionalities include\nmodelling and diagnostics, together with exploratory analysis tools and the\nsimulation of point processes. A particular focus is given to local first-order\nand second-order characteristics. The package aggregates existing methods\nwithin one coherent framework, including those we proposed in recent papers,\nand it aims to welcome many further proposals and extensions from the R\ncommunity.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
