They are invariant under isometries, changing bases, and\nindeed changing lattices. In addition, we prove stability under perturbations\nand provide an algorithm that under mild geometric conditions typically\nsatisfied by crystalline materials takes $\\mathcal{O}({(n+m) \\log n})$ time, in\nwhich $n$ and $m$ are the numbers of vertices and edges in the quotient\ncomplex, respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
