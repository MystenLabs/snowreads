However, existing classification methods often face challenges\nsuch as vulnerability to noise, imbalanced datasets, overfitting, and\ngeneralization issues. In this paper, we propose GCF, a novel approach that\nutilizes Graph Convolutional Networks for FER. GCF integrates Convolutional\nNeural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction, using either custom\narchitectures or pretrained models. The extracted visual features are then\nrepresented on a graph, enhancing local CNN features with global features via a\nGraph Convolutional Neural Network layer. We evaluate GCF on benchmark datasets\nincluding CK+, JAFFE, and FERG. The results show that GCF significantly\nimproves performance over state-of-the-art methods. For example, GCF enhances\nthe accuracy of ResNet18 from 92% to 98% on CK+, from 66% to 89% on JAFFE, and\nfrom 94% to 100% on FERG. Similarly, GCF improves the accuracy of VGG16 from\n89% to 97% on CK+, from 72% to 92% on JAFFE, and from 96% to 99.49% on FERG. We\nprovide a comprehensive analysis of our approach, demonstrating its\neffectiveness in capturing nuanced facial expressions. By integrating graph\nconvolutions with CNNs, GCF significantly advances FER, offering improved\naccuracy and robustness in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"oQ_ZlDKlYbpdQyXDa7XKwkA-n-Bo2Pbt9Zi1mulzRTg","pdfSize":"984656"}
