Recently, it was found\nthat OTOCs display exponential growth for the inverted quantum harmonic\noscillator, mirroring the fact that this system is classically and quantum\nmechanically unstable. In this work, I study OTOCs for the inverted anharmonic\n(pure quartic) oscillator in quantum mechanics, finding only oscillatory\nbehavior despite the classically unstable nature of the system. For higher\ntemperature, OTOCs seem to exhibit saturation consistent with a value of $-2\n\\langle x^2 \\rangle_T \\langle p^2 \\rangle_T$ at late times. I provide analytic\nevidence from the spectral zeta-function and the WKB method as well as direct\nnumerical solutions of the Schr\\\"odinger equation that the inverted quartic\noscillator possesses a real and positive energy eigenspectrum, and normalizable\nwave-functions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
