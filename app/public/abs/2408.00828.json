Upon\nbosonization, this sublattice dependence directly translates to a non-standard\nsine-Gordon-type term responsible for the non-Hermitian matrix structure of the\nsingle-particle Green Function (GF). As the structure in the lifetime of\nexcitations does not commute with the underlying free Bloch Hamiltonian,\nnon-Hermitian topological properties of the single-particle GF emerge --\ndespite our Hermitian model Hamiltonian. Both finite temperature and a\nnon-trivial Luttinger parameter $K\\neq 1$ are required for the formation of\nEPs, and their topological stability in one spatial dimension is guaranteed by\nthe chiral symmetry of our model. In the presence of the aforementioned\nsine-Gordon-term, we resort to leading order Perturbation Theory (PT) to\ncompute the single-particle GF. All qualitative findings derived within LL\ntheory are corroborated by comparison to both numerical simulations within the\nconserving second Born approximation, and, for weak interactions and high\ntemperatures, by fermionic plain PT. In certain parameter regimes, quantitative\nagreement can be reached by a suitable parameter choice in the effective\nbosonized model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
