Weinberger. The generalization of Weinberger's result takes\nthe form $$ \\sum_{s=1}^{m} (-1)^{s-1}f(a_s) \\geq f\\left( \\sum_{s=1}^{m}\n(-1)^{s-1}a_s\\right), $$ where $f$ is a convex function satisfying the\ncondition $f(0)\\leq 0 $. The condition $f(0)\\geq 0 $ in the generalization\nproposed by Bellman was corrected by Olkin as $f(0) \\leq 0 $. Bellman gave only\na graphical proof for differentiable convex functions. In this paper, we give a\nmathematical proof for the generalized inequality including the importance of\nthe condition $f(0)\\leq 0$. We introduce a set $\\mathcal{W}$ of functions so\nthat functions in the intersection of $\\mathcal{W}$ and the set of all convex\nfunctions are the ones that are desirable in the generalization. In addition,\nwe give a proof of Szeg\\\"{o}'s inequality which applies to sums with odd number\nof terms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
