In particular, a long line of work\nrecently culminated in constructing a Gomory-Hu tree in almost linear time\n[Abboud, Li, Panigrahi and Saranurak, FOCS 2023].\n  We design a differentially private (DP) algorithm that computes an\napproximate Gomory-Hu tree. Our algorithm is $\\varepsilon$-DP, runs in\npolynomial time, and can be used to compute $s$-$t$ cuts that are\n$\\tilde{O}(n/\\varepsilon)$-additive approximations of the Min-$s$-$t$-Cuts in\n$G$ for all distinct $s, t \\in V$ with high probability. Our error bound is\nessentially optimal, as [Dalirrooyfard, Mitrovi\\'c and Nevmyvaka, NeurIPS 2023]\nshowed that privately outputting a single Min-$s$-$t$-Cut requires $\\Omega(n)$\nadditive error even with $(1, 0.1)$-DP and allowing for a multiplicative error\nterm. Prior to our work, the best additive error bounds for approximate\nall-pairs Min-$s$-$t$-Cuts were $O(n^{3/2}/\\varepsilon)$ for $\\varepsilon$-DP\n[Gupta, Roth and Ullman, TCC 2012] and $O(\\sqrt{mn} \\cdot\n\\text{polylog}(n/\\delta) / \\varepsilon)$ for $(\\varepsilon, \\delta)$-DP [Liu,\nUpadhyay and Zou, SODA 2024], both of which are implied by differential private\nalgorithms that preserve all cuts in the graph. An important technical\ningredient of our main result is an $\\varepsilon$-DP algorithm for computing\nminimum Isolating Cuts with $\\tilde{O}(n / \\varepsilon)$ additive error, which\nmay be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
