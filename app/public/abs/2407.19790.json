Traditional VS methods, such as docking, are often too time-consuming\nfor screening large-scale molecular databases. Recent advances in deep learning\nhave demonstrated that learning vector representations for both proteins and\nmolecules using contrastive learning can outperform traditional docking\nmethods. However, given that target databases often contain billions of\nmolecules, real-valued vector representations adopted by existing methods can\nstill incur significant memory and time costs in VS. To address this problem,\nin this paper we propose a hashing-based contrastive learning method, called\nDrugHash, for VS. DrugHash treats VS as a retrieval task that uses efficient\nbinary hash codes for retrieval. In particular, DrugHash designs a simple yet\neffective hashing strategy to enable end-to-end learning of binary hash codes\nfor both protein and molecule modalities, which can dramatically reduce the\nmemory and time costs with higher accuracy compared with existing methods.\nExperimental results show that DrugHash can outperform existing methods to\nachieve state-of-the-art accuracy, with a memory saving of 32$\\times$ and a\nspeed improvement of 3.5$\\times$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
