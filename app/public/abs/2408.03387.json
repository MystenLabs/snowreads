We obtain solutions for non-Schwarzschild black holes with r0 = 1,\nr0 = 2, and r0 = 3. Further analysis of spacetime trajectories reveals\nproperties similar to Schwarzschild black holes, while the r0 = 2 black hole\nexhibits significant differences. The results reveal the presence of a\nrepulsive potential barrier for the black hole, allowing only particles with\nenergies exceeding a certain threshold to approach it, providing a unique\ngravitational scenario for non-Schwarzschild black holes. Additionally, the\noptical images are derived through numerical simulations by discussing the\ntrajectories of photons intheblackholespacetime.The distribution of radiation\nflux and the effects of gravitational redshift and Doppler shift on the\nobserved radiation flux are considered. Interestingly, previous analyses of the\noptical appearance of black holes were conducted within the framework of\nanalytic solutions, whereas the analysis of numerical black hole solutions\nfirst appears in our analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
