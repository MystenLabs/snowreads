However, phenomena like the Josephson\neffect predominantly depend on frameworks exhibiting macroscopic interference.\nAt the microscopic level, phase interference effects within momentum space are\nabsent due to the intrinsic challenge of extracting phase information from\nspecific momentum points. By incorporating the hybridization effect between a\nprimary band and its replica bands generated by density wave orders or other\ninteractions, we introduce a superconducting phase interference effect at the\nintersection points on the Fermi surfaces of these two bands. This effect\nclarifies the extraordinary behavior observed in the single-particle spectral\nfunction in recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES)\nmeasurements in the $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+\\delta}$ (Bi2212) superconductor. It\nalso offers a new insight into the non-zero Josephson current observed in a\n$45^\\circ$-twisted Josephson junction of cuprate superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
