The symmetry of\nthe azimuthal\n  distribution of CD for different spin directions is discussed in terms of the\nspin structure\n  of the initial states. Both normal and off-normal light incidence are\nconsidered. Strong\n  photon energy dependence of photoemission in the ultraviolet range is\nobserved. The principal\n  difference between the initial state spin polarization and the spin\nphotocurrent is emphasized\n  and problems with revealing the orbital angular moment with photoemission are\npointed to.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VJ5llVuq5QDTok3mLvc-zdUyxtK3NwBlkffzJ1MfEsE","pdfSize":"21136494"}
