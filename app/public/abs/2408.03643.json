Specifically, we focus on scenarios where two\noperators being $1/3$-BPS and the entire correlation function is considered\nwithin the twisted-translated frame. The correlator can be expressed as the\noverlap between a boundary state and a Bethe state. It is found that the\nboundary state formed by the two $1/3$-BPS operators is integrable only when\nthe number of Wick contractions between the non-BPS operator and one of the\n$1/3$-BPS operators is 0 or 1. We compute the overlaps for the integrable cases\nutilizing the symmetries preserved by the correlators.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yoFw_UYacgE9-gW2h6mjLYuAYSPg3-12H00AbQC0jkA","pdfSize":"246220"}
