In this\npaper, we investigate the verification of diagnosability for cyber-physical\nsystems with continuous state sets. We develop an abstraction-free and\nautomata-based framework to verify (the lack of) diagnosability, leveraging a\nnotion of hybrid barrier certificates. To this end, we first construct a\n(delta,K)-deterministic finite automaton that captures the occurrence of faults\ntargeted for diagnosis. Then, the verification of diagnosability property is\nconverted into a safety verification problem over a product system between the\nautomaton and the augmented version of the dynamical system. We demonstrate\nthat this verification problem can be addressed by computing hybrid barrier\ncertificates for the product system. To this end, we introduce two systematic\nmethods, leveraging sum-of-squares programming and counter-example guided\ninductive synthesis to search for such certificates. Additionally, if the\nsystem is found to be diagnosable, we propose methodologies to construct a\ndiagnoser to identify fault occurrences online. Finally, we showcase the\neffectiveness of our methods through a case study.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
