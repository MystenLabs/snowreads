Unlike\nprior research on moderate to severe aphasia, we investigated latent aphasia,\nwhich can seem to have very similar speech production with neurotypical speech.\nWe analysed the f0, intensity and duration of utterance-initial and\nutterance-final words of ten speakers with latent aphasia and ten matching\ncontrols. Regression models were fitted to improve our understanding of this\nunderstudied type of very mild aphasia. The results highlighted varying degrees\nof differences in all three prosodic measures between groups. We also\ninvestigated the diagnostic classification of latent aphasia versus\nneurotypical control using random forest, aiming to build a fast and reliable\ntool to assist with the identification of latent aphasia. The random forest\nanalysis also reinforced the significance of prosodic features in\ndistinguishing latent aphasia.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"h7lOT7lQZffIB4epoVebLvYBxQefPlni3l0jfuRTEXY","pdfSize":"293506"}
