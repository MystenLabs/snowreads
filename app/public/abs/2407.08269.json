This work aims to shed\nlight on the issue by evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs in a task of\nmorphological analysis of complex Finnish noun forms. We generate the forms\nusing an FST tool, and they are unlikely to have occurred in the training sets\nof the LLMs, therefore requiring morphological generalisation capacity. We find\nthat GPT-4-turbo has some difficulties in the task while GPT-3.5-turbo\nstruggles and smaller models Llama2-70B and Poro-34B fail nearly completely.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
