A\nnewly-discovered class of magnets ${-}$ termed as altermagnets (AMs) ${-}$ are\ncharacterized by a net zero magnetization as well as spin-split bands. In this\nstudy, we propose the emergence of non-Hermitian physics at AM-ferromagnet (FM)\njunctions. We discover that such a junction hosts tunable EPs. We demonstrate\nthat the positions of these emergent EPs can be tuned using an external applied\nmagnetic field and show that for a critical value of the applied magnetic field\nthe EPs can annihilate. Notably, the number and position of the EPs crucially\ndepends on the type of AM and its orientation with respect to the FM. Our work\nputs forth a promising platform of exploration of non-Hermitian physics in an\nemerging class of magnetic materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
