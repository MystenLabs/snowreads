Contemporary\ntechniques often require extensive annotated training data, yet obtaining\npoint-wise annotations for point clouds is time-consuming and laborious. Recent\ndevelopments in semi-supervised methods seek to mitigate this problem by\nemploying a teacher-student framework to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled\npoint clouds. However, these pseudo-labels frequently suffer from insufficient\ndiversity and inferior quality. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce an\nAgent-based Diffusion Model for Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection\n(Diff3DETR). Specifically, an agent-based object query generator is designed to\nproduce object queries that effectively adapt to dynamic scenes while striking\na balance between sampling locations and content embedding. Additionally, a\nbox-aware denoising module utilizes the DDIM denoising process and the\nlong-range attention in the transformer decoder to refine bounding boxes\nincrementally. Extensive experiments on ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets\ndemonstrate that Diff3DETR outperforms state-of-the-art semi-supervised 3D\nobject detection methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
