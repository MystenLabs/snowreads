If $s_\\ell$ denotes the number of nodes of eccentricity\nat most $\\ell$, then for $\\ell \\ge 2$, $$\\lambda_{2} \\ge \\frac{ 4 \\, s_\\ell }{\n(\\ell-2+\\frac{4}{n}) \\, n^2 }.$$ As a corollary, if $d$ denotes the diameter of\n$G$, then $$\\lambda_{2} \\ge \\frac{ 4 }{ (d-2+\\frac{4}{n}) \\, n }.$$ It is also\nshown that $$\\lambda_{2} \\ge \\frac{ s_\\ell }{ 1+ \\ell\n\\left(e(G^{\\ell})-m\\right) },$$ where $m$ and $e(G^\\ell)$ denote the number of\nedges in $G$ and in the $\\ell$-th power of $ G $, respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
