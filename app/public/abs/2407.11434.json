By using chain projection ordered categories, we\nobtain a structure theorem for DRC-restriction semigroups. More specifically,\nwe prove that the category of DRC-restriction semigroups together with\n(2,1,1)-homomorphisms is isomorphic to the category of chain projection ordered\ncategories together with chain projection ordered functors. Moreover, some\nspecial cases are also considered. As applications of the main theorem, we\ndemonstrate that the existence of free projection-generated DRC-restriction\nsemigroups associated to any strong two-sided projection algebra and reobtain\nthe structures of projection-fundamental DRC-restriction semigroups. Our work\nmay be regarded as an answer for the fourth problem proposed by East and Azeef\nMuhammed in [Advances in Mathematics, 437 (2024) 109447].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
