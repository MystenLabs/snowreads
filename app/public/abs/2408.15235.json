It plays\nan essential role in various applications such as Augmented/Virtual Reality\n(AR/VR), autonomous driving and robotics. Leveraging multiple views of a scene\ncaptured from different viewpoints, Multi-View Stereo (MVS) algorithms\nsynthesize a comprehensive 3D representation, enabling precise reconstruction\nin complex environments. Due to its efficiency and effectiveness, MVS has\nbecome a pivotal method for image-based 3D reconstruction. Recently, with the\nsuccess of deep learning, many learning-based MVS methods have been proposed,\nachieving impressive performance against traditional methods. We categorize\nthese learning-based methods as: depth map-based, voxel-based, NeRF-based, 3D\nGaussian Splatting-based, and large feed-forward methods. Among these, we focus\nsignificantly on depth map-based methods, which are the main family of MVS due\nto their conciseness, flexibility and scalability. In this survey, we provide a\ncomprehensive review of the literature at the time of this writing. We\ninvestigate these learning-based methods, summarize their performances on\npopular benchmarks, and discuss promising future research directions in this\narea.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
