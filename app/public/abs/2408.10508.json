Recently, Bu, Choi,\nand Xu made the bound exact: all games with $|\\sigma|< |E|$ chips or $|\\sigma|>\n3|E|-|V|$ chips stabilize. Meanwhile, Levine found a \"devil's staircase''\npattern in the plot of the activity of parallel chip-firing games against their\ndensity of chips. The stabilizing bound of Bu, Choi, and Xu corresponds to the\ntop and bottom stairs of this staircase, in which the activity is 1 and 0,\nrespectively. In this paper, we analyze the middle stair of the staircase,\ncorresponding to activity $\\frac{1}{2}$. We prove that all parallel chip-firing\ngames with $2|E|-|V|< |\\sigma|< 2|E|$ have period $T\\neq 3,\\,4$. In fact, this\nis exactly the range of $|\\sigma|$ for which all games are non-stabilizing. We\nconjecture that all parallel chip-firing games with $2|E|-|V|< |\\sigma|<2|E|$\nhave $T=2$ and thus activity $\\frac{1}{2}$. This conjecture has been proven for\ntrees by Bu, Choi, and Xu, cycles by Dall'asta, and complete graphs by Levine.\nWe extend Levine's method of conjugate configurations to prove the conjecture\non complete bipartite graphs $K_{a,a}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
