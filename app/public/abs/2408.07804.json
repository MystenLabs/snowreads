Achieving\na robust conductance quantization, however, has proven challenging for helical\nedge states. Here we show wide resistance plateaus in kink states - a\nmanifestation of the quantum valley Hall effect in Bernal bilayer graphene -\nquantized to the predicted value at zero magnetic field. The plateau resistance\nhas a very weak temperature dependence up to 50 Kelvin and is flat within a dc\nbias window of tens of mV. We demonstrate the electrical operation of a\ntopology-controlled switch with an on/off ratio of 200. These results\ndemonstrate the robustness and tunability of the kink states and its promise in\nconstructing electron quantum optics devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
