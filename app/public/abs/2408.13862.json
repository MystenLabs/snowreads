Focusing on bubble\nstructures of $^{36}$Ar, the characterizations of bubble nuclei were explored\nwith the framework of the extended quantum molecular dynamics model. Three\ndensity distribution modes were uncovered for the first time, i.e.\nmicro-bubble, bubble, and cluster resonances, which show unique spectral\nsignature compared to the monopole resonance spectrum as the excitation\nintensity was increased in bubbles. Of pivotal importance is the revelation\nthat the bubble mode's oscillation frequency closely resembles macroscopic\nbubble dynamics, building a connection between classical macroscopic phenomena\nand the quantum complexity of the nuclear structure. The discovery marks a\ncrucial step forward in deciphering the relationship between classical and\nquantum domains within the enigmatic world of atomic nuclei.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y_1_XZNs8izardMZn0P8qbObh6PshNXQ0w1PxY1IwGc","pdfSize":"1554082"}
