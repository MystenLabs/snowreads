This technique requires some care regarding, among other things,\nthe choice of observables, the range of applicability, and the appearance and\ndisappearance of solutions of the equations of motion (EOM). Many of these\nissues can already be studied at the classical level, which is the focus of\nthis work. We highlight the importance of selecting appropriate observables and\ninitial/boundary conditions to ensure the physical invariance of solutions. A\nclassical analogue to the Lehmann-Symanzik-Zimmermann (LSZ) formula is\npresented, confirming that some observables remain independent of field\nvariables without tracking redefinitions. Additionally, we address, with an\nexample, the limitations of non-invertible field redefinitions, particularly\nwith non-perturbative objects like solitons, and discuss their implications for\nclassical and quantum field theories.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
