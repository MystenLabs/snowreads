Using the basic idea of the alpha-factors of the\nFirst Order Reliability Method, this approach was developed to analyze\ncorrelated input variables as well as arbitrary marginal parameter\ndistributions. Based on an efficient transformation scheme using the importance\nsampling principle, only a single analysis run by a plain or variance-reduced\nMonte Carlo method is required to give a sufficient estimate of the introduced\nparameter sensitivities. Several application examples are presented and\ndiscussed in the paper.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"nXMU6dZNkJtMVKi3eNr9Dj9F3LrVHLNrmci4X2xELrQ","pdfSize":"2971113"}
