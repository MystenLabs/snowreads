Computational homogenization is useful for predicting\nmacroscopic properties from the microscopic material constitution. It involves\ndefining a representative volume element (RVE), solving governing equations,\nand evaluating its properties such as conductivity and elasticity. Despite its\neffectiveness, the approach can be computationally expensive. This study\nproposes a tensor-train (TT)-based asymptotic homogenization method to address\nthese challenges. By deriving boundary value problems at the microscale and\nexpressing them in the TT format, the proposed method estimates material\nproperties efficiently. We demonstrate its validity and effectiveness through\nnumerical experiments applying the proposed method for homogenization of\nthermal conductivity and elasticity in two- and three-dimensional materials,\noffering a promising solution for handling the multiscale nature of\nheterogeneous systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
