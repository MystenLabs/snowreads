Despite the widespread use of framing\nin disinformation, framing properties and detection methods remain\nunderexplored outside the English-speaking world. We explore how multilingual\nframing of the same issue differs systematically. We use eight years of\nRussia-backed disinformation campaigns, spanning 8k news articles in 4\nlanguages targeting 15 countries. We find that disinformation campaigns\nconsistently and intentionally favor specific framing, depending on the target\nlanguage of the audience. We further discover how Russian-language articles\nconsistently highlight selected frames depending on the region of the media\ncoverage. We find that the two most prominent models for automatic frame\nanalysis underperform and show high disagreement, highlighting the need for\nfurther research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
