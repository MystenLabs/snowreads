By categorizing these approaches\ninto Abstractionism, the Similarity Approach, the Functional Approach, and the\nInvariance Approach, the study highlights how each framework provides a\ndistinct mathematical perspective for modeling concepts. The synthesis of these\napproaches bridges philosophical theories and contemporary machine learning\nmodels, providing a comprehensive framework for future research. This work\nemphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary dialogue, aiming to enrich our\nunderstanding of the complex relationship between human cognition and\nartificial intelligence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
