Combined with the well-distribution measure, a\nsequence possesses good pseudorandomness properties if both measures are\nrelatively small. In combinatorics on words, the famous $b$-automatic sequences\nare quite far from being pseudorandom, as they have small factor complexity on\nthe one hand and large well-distribution and correlation measures on the other.\nThis paper investigates the pseudorandomness of a specific family of morphic\nsequences, including classical $b$-automatic sequences. In particular, we show\nthat such sequences have large even-order correlation measures; hence, they are\nnot pseudorandom. We also show that even- and odd-order correlation measures\nbehave differently when considering some simple morphic sequences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
