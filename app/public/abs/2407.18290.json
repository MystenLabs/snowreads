The core of these problems lies in how to decompose visual\nsignals, with all other issues being closely related to this central problem\nand stemming from unsuitable approaches to signal decomposition. This paper\naims to draw researchers' attention to the significance of Visual Signal\nDecomposition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
