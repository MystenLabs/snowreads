Popular platforms like Google\nScholar and Web of Science rely on numerical indicators that are too abstract\nto convey the context and content of scientific impact, while most existing\nvisualization approaches on mapping science do not consider the presentation of\nindividual scholars' impact evolution using curated self-citation data. This\npaper builds on our previous work and proposes an integrated pipeline to\nvisualize a scholar's impact evolution from multiple topic facets. A novel 3D\nprism-shaped visual metaphor is introduced as the overview of a scholar's\nimpact, whilst their scientific evolution on each topic is displayed in a more\nstructured manner. Additional designs by topic chord diagram, streamgraph\nvisualization, and inter-topic flow map, optimized by an elaborate layout\nalgorithm, assist in perceiving the scholar's scientific evolution across\ntopics. A new six-degree-impact glyph metaphor highlights key interdisciplinary\nworks driving the evolution. The proposed visualization methods are evaluated\nthrough case studies analyzing the careers of prestigious Turing award\nlaureates and a major visualization venue.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
