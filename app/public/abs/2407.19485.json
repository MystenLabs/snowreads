The trained models,\nhowever, often exhibit limited generalizability to real-recorded mixtures. To\ndeal with this, this paper investigates training enhancement models directly on\nreal mixtures. However, a major difficulty challenging this approach is that,\nsince the clean speech of real mixtures is unavailable, there lacks a good\nsupervision for real mixtures. In this context, assuming that a training set\nconsisting of real-recorded pairs of close-talk and far-field mixtures is\navailable, we propose to address this difficulty via close-talk speech\nenhancement, where an enhancement model is first trained on simulated mixtures\nto enhance real-recorded close-talk mixtures and the estimated close-talk\nspeech can then be utilized as a supervision (i.e., pseudo-label) for training\nfar-field speech enhancement models directly on the paired real-recorded\nfar-field mixtures. We name the proposed system $\\textit{ctPuLSE}$. Evaluation\nresults on the CHiME-4 dataset show that ctPuLSE can derive high-quality\npseudo-labels and yield far-field speech enhancement models with strong\ngeneralizability to real data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
