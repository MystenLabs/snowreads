Here, we show that\nultrathin transition ferromagnet-heavy metal bilayers exhibit anomalous\ntemperature- and electric bias-dependent behaviors in the vicinity of the Curie\ntemperature, inconsistent with the usual Weiss magnetism. Characterization by\nseveral complementary techniques and analysis of the dependence on composition\nreveal that these effects originate from interfacial spin-orbit interaction,\nwhich results in the emergence of a state with distinct magnetic and\nmagnetoelectronic properties that can be described as Rashba magnetism. Our\nfindings open a new route for the characterization and control of spin-orbit\nphenomena in heterostructures enabling the development of efficient\nspin-orbitronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
