Recently, it was\nshown that perfect measurement based on spatial mode demultiplexing (SPADE) in\nHermite-Gauss modes allows one to reach the quantum limit of precision for\nestimation of separation between two weak incoherent stationary sources. Since\nthen, different imperfections such as misalignment or crosstalk between modes\nhave been studied to check how this result translates into more realistic\nexperimental setups. In this paper, we consider another deviation from the\nperfect setup by discarding the assumption about the stationarity of the\nsources. This is relevant for example for astrophysical applications where\nplanets necessarily orbit around the star. We analyze two examples of dynamics:\nrotations and oscillations, showing the robustness of the SPADE-based\nmeasurement against them. The analysis is based on Fisher information, which\nallows one to obtain the precision limit through Cram\\'er-Rao bound.\nFurthermore, we formulate a measurement algorithm that allows for the reduction\nof one parameter for estimation (system orientation angle) in the stationary\nsources scenario, maintaining the measurement precision despite the lack of\nknowledge about this parameter.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
