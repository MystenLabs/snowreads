We present\nan analysis of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect across the transit of\nTOI-2533 $b$, a brown dwarf on a moderately eccentric ($e_b = 0.2476\\pm0.0090$)\nand wide-separation ($a_b/R_\\star = 13.34\\pm0.30$) orbit around an F8-type\nstar, using data from the NEID/WIYN spectrograph in combination with archival\nphotometry and radial velocity observations. Spin-orbit analyses of brown\ndwarfs are relatively rare, and TOI-2533 stands out as the fifth brown dwarf\nsystem with a measured spin-orbit constraint. We derive a sky-projected stellar\nobliquity of $\\lambda = -7\\pm14^{\\circ}$ for TOI-2533 $b$, finding that the\nbrown dwarf is consistent with spin-orbit alignment. Our joint model also\nindicates that TOI-2533 $b$ falls near the lower bound of the hydrogen-burning\nminimum mass range (M$_b$ = $74.9\\pm5.3$ M$_{\\rm \\tiny Jup}$). Ultimately, we\nfind that TOI-2533 $b$ is consistent with formation from disc fragmentation in\na primordially spin-orbit aligned orientation, although we cannot rule out the\npossibility that the system has been tidally realigned during its lifetime.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
