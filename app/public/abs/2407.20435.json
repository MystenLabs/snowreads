{"id":"2407.20435","title":"Discrete-outcome sensor networks: Multiple detection events and grouping\n  detectors","authors":"Nada Ali and Mark Hillery","authorsParsed":[["Ali","Nada",""],["Hillery","Mark",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Mon, 29 Jul 2024 21:59:04 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-31","timestamp":1722290344000,"abstract":"  Quantum sensor networks have often been studied in order to determine how\naccurately they can determine a parameter, such as the strength of a magnetic\nfield, at one of the detectors. A more coarse-grained approach is to try to\nsimply determine whether a detector has interacted with a signal or not, and\nwhich detector it was. Such discrete-outcome quantum sensor networks, discrete\nin the sense that we are seeking answers to yes-no questions, are what we study\nhere. One issue is what is a good initial state for the network, and, in\nparticular, should it be entangled or not. Earlier we looked at the case when\nonly one detector interacted, and here we extend that study in two ways. First,\nwe allow more that one detector to interact, and second, we examine the effect\nof grouping the detectors. When the detectors are grouped we are only\ninterested in which group contained interacting detectors and not in which\nindividual detectors within a group interacted. We find that in the case of\ngrouping detectors, entangled initial states can be helpful.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
