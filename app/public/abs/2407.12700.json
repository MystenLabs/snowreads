Stan implementations\nof these models provide new estimates of interrater and intrarater reliability.\nWe also derive formulas for calculating marginal correlations under each of the\nthree models. Comparisons of the kappa estimates and marginal correlations\nacross the different models are presented from two real-world datasets.\nSimulations demonstrate properties of the different measures of agreement under\ndifferent model assumptions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
