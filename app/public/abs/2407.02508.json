However, the full potential of such\nmethods in complex dynamic environments remain to be discovered. In autonomous\ndriving domain, learning-based agents face significant challenges when\ntransferring knowledge from simulated to real-world settings and the\nperformance is also significantly impacted by data distribution shift. To\naddress these issue, we propose Sample-efficient Imitative Multi-token Decision\nTransformer (SimDT). SimDT introduces multi-token prediction, imitative online\nlearning and prioritized experience replay to Decision Transformer. The\nperformance is evaluated through empirical experiments and results exceed\npopular imitation and reinforcement learning algorithms on Waymax benchmark.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
