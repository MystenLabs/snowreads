A heavy nucleus can split into hundreds of\ncombinations of two complementary fragments in the fission process. The\nentanglement of fragment wave functions is persistent even after separation and\nimpacts the partition of particles and energies between fragments. Based on\nmicroscopic dynamical calculations of the fission of $^{240}$Pu, this work\nfinds that quantum entanglement is indispensable in the appearance of sawtooth\ndistributions of average excitation energies of fragments and thus neutron\nmultiplicities, but not in average neuron excess of fragments. Both sawtooth\nslopes from particle-number projections are found to be steep -- a feature\nwhich can be alleviated by random fluctuations. These findings may impact the\nunderstanding of quantum entanglement more broadly in mesoscopic systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9mvFCVj2ohXfb2JiUysqT-vWafbSHRswkRp6_se8VmY","pdfSize":"6103886"}
