This star hosts three transiting planets\ndiscovered by TESS, with orbital periods ~10, 21, and 35 days. BD+40 2790 shows\nan activity-induced scatter larger than 30 m/s in the radial velocities. We\nemployed different methods to measure the stellar radial velocities and several\nmodels to filter out the dominant stellar activity signal, in order to bring to\nlight the planet-induced signals which are expected to have semi-amplitudes one\norder of magnitude lower. We evaluated the mass loss rate of the planetary\natmospheres using photoionization hydrodynamic modeling. The dynamical analysis\nconfirms that the three sub-Neptune-sized companions (our radius measurements\nare $R_b$=2.54$\\pm$0.04, $R_c$=3.35$\\pm$0.05, and $R_d$=3.29$\\pm$0.06 $R_{\\rm\nEarth}$) have masses in the planetary regime. We derive 3$\\sigma$ upper limits\nbelow or close to the mass of Neptune for all the planets: 11--12, 12--13.5,\nand 14--19 $M_{\\rm Earth}$ for planet $b$, $c$, and $d$ respectively. In the\ncase of planet $d$, we found promising clues that the mass could be between ~7\nand 8 $M_{\\rm Earth}$, with a significance level between 2.3--2.5$\\sigma$ (at\nbest). This result must be further investigated using other analysis methods or\nusing high-precision near-IR spectrographs to collect new radial velocities,\nwhich could be less affected by stellar activity. Atmospheric photo-evaporation\nsimulations predict that BD+40~2790 b is currently losing its H-He gaseous\nenvelope, which will be completely lost at an age within 0.5--3 Gyr if its\ncurrent mass is lower than 12 $M_{\\rm Earth}$. BD+40 2790 c could have a lower\nbulk density than $b$, and it could retain its atmosphere up to an age of 5\nGyr. For the outermost planet $d$, we predict almost negligible evolution of\nits mass and radius induced by photo-evaporation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
