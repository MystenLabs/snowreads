Our analysis indicates that the\nstacking dependent Kondo interaction can lead to a variety of new phases. In\nparticular, we show that magnetic order and heavy quasiparticles can nucleate\nat different regions in the moir\\'e unit cell leading to a macroscopic real\nspace phase separation. We observe that these factors can lead to a metal to\nKondo insulator percolation transition in two dimensions. Our results highlight\nthe rich physics that can arise in moir\\'e superlattices that are composed of\ninherently strongly correlated layers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fVl7cocmFr1BLweM9wzYfNjTK5BuxGCfqxzZqoEMe2Y","pdfSize":"574152"}
