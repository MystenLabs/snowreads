This issue is well appreciated in\npractice, with different versions of F-statistics routinely reported as\nmeasures of instument strength. Less transparently, however, these F-statistics\nare sometimes used to guide instrument selection, and even to decide whether to\nreport empirical results. Rather than discarding findings with low\nF-statistics, weak instrument-robust methods can provide valid inference under\nweak instruments. For multivariable Mendelian randomization with two-sample\nsummary data, we encourage use of the inference strategy of Andrews (2018) that\nreports both robust and non-robust confidence sets, along with a statistic that\nmeasures how reliable the non-robust confidence set is in terms of coverage. We\nalso propose a novel adjusted-Kleibergen statistic that corrects for\noverdispersion heterogeneity in genetic associations with the outcome.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
