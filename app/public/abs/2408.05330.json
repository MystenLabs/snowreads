Many of the\nmainstream task- or model-agnostic approaches for machine unlearning were\ndesigned for classification tasks. First, we demonstrate that these methods\nperform poorly on NuMuR tasks due to the unique challenges posed by neural\ninformation retrieval. Then, we develop a methodology for NuMuR named\nContrastive and Consistent Loss (CoCoL), which effectively balances the\nobjectives of data forgetting and model performance retention. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that CoCoL facilitates more effective and controllable data\nremoval than existing techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
