It has been\ndemonstrated that such a structure is useful for investigating topological edge\nsolitons, and more specifically, for mimicking the Kline tunneling. However, it\nis still not clear what the interplay between type-II Dirac cones and the\nnon-Hermiticity mechanism will result in. Here, this question is addressed; in\nparticular, we report the $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric photonic lattices with\ntype-II Dirac cones for the first time. We identify a slope-exceptional ring\nand name it the type-II exceptional ring. We display the restoration of the\n$\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry of the lattice by reducing the separation between the\nsites in the unit cell. Curiously, the amplitude of the beam during propagation\nin the non-Hermitian lattice with $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry only decays because\nof diffraction, whereas in the $\\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry-broken lattice it will\nbe amplified, even though the beam still diffracts. This work establishes the\nlink between the non-Hermiticity mechanism and the violation of Lorentz\ninvariance in these physical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"5_7upqpFNRF-sZesAK08C0ktTSpuaeQ1MZ8lclZRuMs","pdfSize":"2562360"}
