Furthermore, smart inverters, interfaced via communication\nnetworks, pose a potential vulnerability to cyber threats if not diligently\nmanaged. To proactively fortify the power grid against sophisticated cyber\nattacks, we propose to employ reinforcement learning (RL) to identify potential\nthreats and system vulnerabilities. This study concentrates on analyzing\nadversarial strategies for false data injection, specifically targeting smart\ninverters involved in primary frequency control. Our findings demonstrate that\nan RL agent can adeptly discern optimal false data injection methods to\nmanipulate inverter settings, potentially causing catastrophic consequences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x4-zAI5GHuRCDh1YN9oCpZFLNeALwmFAjJuNLcDbHR4","pdfSize":"979506"}
