To this end, we\nderive the Wigner characteristic function for the family of photon subtracted\nand photon added TMSC states, which is then utilized to calculate the fidelity\nof teleporting a single mode coherent state and a squeezed vacuum state. The\nanalysis shows that while symmetric PS enhances the fidelity of QT in an\nextensive range of squeezing, asymmetric PS enhances the performance marginally\nand only in the low squeezing regime. The addition operations on the other hand\nare less useful, symmetric three-PA leads to a marginal improvement while the\nother addition operations are useless. We have considered the actual\nexperimental setup for PS and PA operations and computed their success\nprobabilities which should be kept in mind while advocating the use of these\noperations. We could compute the fidelity of QT for a broad range of states\nbecause we analytically derived the Wigner characteristic function for these\nfamily of states which we think will be useful for various other applications\nof these families of states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
