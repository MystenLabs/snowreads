Subsequently, by using the torsional\nanalogues of Friedmann equations for the new equation from Einstein-Cartan\ngravity theory, we obtain the equation of state for dark energy in this model.\nWe find that the extended holographic dark energy from the particle horizon as\nthe infrared (IR) cut-off does not give the accelerating expansion of the\nuniverse. Also, employing the future event horizon as IR cut-off still achieves\nthe accelerating expansion of the universe. In contrast, there is a possibility\nthat the Hubble radius as IR cut-off achieves to the accelerating expansion of\nthe universe in superluminal region for axial torsion. More precisely, the\ncurrent value of ratio for torsion to the matter density, $\\gamma^{0}=0.5$\ngives the equation of state of dark energy $\\omega_{\\Lambda}\\cong-1$.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Syymkyb-BT1HHSeuj9YBBMPX1LhwD72JG-ghbxStjsw","pdfSize":"152304"}
