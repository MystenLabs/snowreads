We\nprovide a characterization of Capital as a historical agential system and\npropose a model of Capital using tools from computer science. Our model\nconsists of propositions which, if satisfied by a specific grounding,\nconstitute a valid model of Capital. We clarify the manners in which Capital\ncan evolve. We claim that, when its evolution is driven by quantitative\noptimization processes, Capital can possess qualities of Artificial\nIntelligence. We find that Capital may not uniquely represent meaning, in the\nsame way that optimization is not intentionally meaningful. We find that\nArtificial Intelligences like modern day Large Language Models are a part of\nCapital. We link our readers to a web-interface where they can interact with a\npart of Capital.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XqccsUvD5FA83tWKZJ9KAAwN5AZbjFuQtWL1fdjR50M","pdfSize":"353274","objectId":"0x57ee7db51a99a97469ea990f929bf06c975fd0fc24c4a3367c43831c351eb309","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
