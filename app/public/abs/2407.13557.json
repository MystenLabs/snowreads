The\nscalarized black hole solutions are asymptotically flat, and they are studied\nunder their thermodynamics, and we show that they are meta-stable solutions\nwithout phase transitions of first and second order. Also, we demonstrate the\nexistence of distinct branches of solutions classified by the number of nodes\nof the scalar field. For the branches analysed, the scalarized solutions have\nlower free energy than the Schwarzschild black hole; therefore, they are always\nthermodinamically preferred. Also, we show that the scalarized black holes are\nentropically favoured compared to the Schwarzschild solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
