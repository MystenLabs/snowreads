Our\nresults demonstrate a monotonic decrease in the physical accessibility of both\nQD and QO as the dilation parameter increases within the region-I of the second\nqubit. Conversely, in the anti-particle region, the accessibility of QD and QO\nstabilizes at finite values of the dilation parameter owing to the influence of\nthe Pauli exclusion principle and Fermi-Dirac statistics, subsequently\nincreasing gradually. Notably, the QSE in the region-I expands as the Dirac\nfield frequency rises and the dilation parameter diminishes, while the opposite\ntrend is observed in the anti-particle region.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mHP3lBp76Pg_3oWoNP42bLH0TmHVPvOXud4CppQoGMA","pdfSize":"3714827"}
