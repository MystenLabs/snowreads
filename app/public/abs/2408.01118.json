Lab \"Task 1:\nCheck-Worthiness Estimation\". The task involves the automated detection of\ncheck-worthy claims in English, Dutch, and Arabic political debates and Twitter\ndata. We utilized various pre-trained generative decoder and encoder\ntransformer models, employing methods such as few-shot chain-of-thought\nreasoning, fine-tuning, data augmentation, and transfer learning from one\nlanguage to another. Despite variable success in terms of performance, our\nmodels achieved notable placements on the organizer's leaderboard: ninth-best\nin English, third-best in Dutch, and the top placement in Arabic, utilizing\nmultilingual datasets for enhancing the generalizability of check-worthiness\ndetection. Despite a significant drop in performance on the unlabeled test\ndataset compared to the development test dataset, our findings contribute to\nthe ongoing efforts in claim detection research, highlighting the challenges\nand potential of language-specific adaptations in claim verification systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
