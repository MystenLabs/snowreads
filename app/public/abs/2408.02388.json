A line of work has explored preservation theorems\nrelativised to combinatorially tame classes of sparse structures [Atserias et\nal., JACM 2006; Atserias et al., SiCOMP 2008; Dawar, JCSS 2010; Dawar and\nEleftheriadis, 2024]. In this article we initiate the study of preservation\ntheorems for dense graph classes. In contrast to the sparse setting, we show\nthat extension preservation fails on most natural dense classes of low\ncomplexity. Nonetheless, we isolate a technical condition which is sufficient\nfor extension preservation to hold, providing a dense analogue to a result of\n[Atserias et al., SiCOMP 2008].\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
