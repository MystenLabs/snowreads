We derive a closed-form formula and its\nasymptotic forms for a two-band model with a Kane dispersion. These formulas\nexhibit characteristically different behaviors from their bulk counterparts\nwhich are attributed to the scaling of the 2D density of states. We validate\nour formulas by comparing them to recent strong-field ionization experiments in\nmonolayer MoS2 with good agreement. Our work is expected to find a wide range\nof applications in intense light - 2D material interaction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
