Previous investigations of this quantum search algorithm on graphs\nwith cliques have shown that the edges between the cliques can be weighted to\nenhance the movement of probability between the cliques to reach the marked\nvertex. In this paper, we explore the most restrictive form of this by\nanalyzing search on a weighted barbell graph that consists of two cliques of\nthe same size joined by a single weighted edge/bridge. This graph is generally\nirregular, so quantum walks governed by the graph Laplacian or by the adjacency\nmatrix can differ. We show that the Laplacian quantum walk's behavior does not\nchange, no matter the weight of the bridge, and so the single bridge is too\nrestrictive to affect the walk. Similarly, the adjacency quantum walk's\nbehavior is unchanged for most weights, but when the weight equals the size of\na clique, the probability does collect at the clique containing the marked\nvertex, and utilizing a two-stage algorithm with different weights for each\nstage, the success probability is boosted from 0.5 to 0.996, independent of the\nsize of the barbell graph.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
