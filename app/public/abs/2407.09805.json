We find the emergence of an additional rotation\nangle proportional to the optical intensity, arised from the nonlinear\ncorrections to both the Verdet constant and the fiber torsion. By analyzing an\noscillator model describing the electron motions in the fiber medium, we can\nobtain the third-order susceptibility in the presence of the magnetic field.\nAccording to the Maxwell's equations and the minimal coupling principle in the\nmetric expression of the curved space, we derive the propagation equations of\nlight in a helically wound optical fiber. Finally, we have obtained the\nanalytic expressions of Faraday rotation angle for both linearly and\nelliptically polarized lights, which explicitly indicates an important\nnonlinear correction on the Faraday rotation angles. Possible experimental\nobservations and some implications of our theoretical findings are discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
