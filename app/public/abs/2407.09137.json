This issue\nhas been exacerbated by the rise of recommender systems. Our research indicates\nthat recommender systems should consider avoidance as a fundamental factor. We\nargue that news articles can be characterized by three principal elements:\nexposure, relevance, and avoidance, all of which are closely interconnected. To\naddress these challenges, we introduce AWRS, an Avoidance-Aware Recommender\nSystem. This framework incorporates avoidance awareness when recommending news,\nbased on the premise that news article avoidance conveys significant\ninformation about user preferences. Evaluation results on three news datasets\nin different languages (English, Norwegian, and Japanese) demonstrate that our\nmethod outperforms existing approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
