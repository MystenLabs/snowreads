UniPortrait consists of only two plug-and-play\nmodules: an ID embedding module and an ID routing module. The ID embedding\nmodule extracts versatile editable facial features with a decoupling strategy\nfor each ID and embeds them into the context space of diffusion models. The ID\nrouting module then combines and distributes these embeddings adaptively to\ntheir respective regions within the synthesized image, achieving the\ncustomization of single and multiple IDs. With a carefully designed two-stage\ntraining scheme, UniPortrait achieves superior performance in both single- and\nmulti-ID customization. Quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate\nthe advantages of our method over existing approaches as well as its good\nscalability, e.g., the universal compatibility with existing generative control\ntools.
