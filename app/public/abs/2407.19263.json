A\ncombined angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and\nfirst-principles calculations reveal the formation of a Moire superstructure\nbetween a 2D Dirac semi-metallic crystal, graphene, and a 2D insulating crystal\nof noble gas, xenon. Incommensurate diffraction pattern and folded Dirac cones\naround the Brillouin zone center imply the formation of hexagonal crystalline\narray of xenon atoms. The velocity of Dirac fermions increases upon the\nformation of the 2D xenon crystal on top of graphene due to the enhanced\ndielectric screening by the xenon over-layer. These findings not only provide a\nnovel method to produce a Moire superstructure from the adsorption of noble gas\non 2D materials, but also to control the physical properties of graphene by the\nformation of a graphene-noble gas interface.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
