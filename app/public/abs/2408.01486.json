These new techniques boost the\nperformance of current and planned MadGraph implementations. Combining\nphase-space mappings with a set of very small learnable flow elements,\nMadNIS-Lite, can improve the sampling efficiency while being physically\ninterpretable. This defines a third sampling strategy, complementing VEGAS and\nthe full MadNIS.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
