AI, on the\nother hand, can be leveraged to innovate and streamline semiconductor\ntechnology from planning and implementation to manufacturing. In this paper, we\npresent \\textit{Intelligent OPC Engineer Assistant}, an AI/LLM-powered\nmethodology designed to solve the core manufacturing-aware optimization problem\nknown as optical proximity correction (OPC). The methodology involves a\nreinforcement learning-based OPC recipe search and a customized multi-modal\nagent system for recipe summarization. Experiments demonstrate that our\nmethodology can efficiently build OPC recipes on various chip designs with\nspecially handled design topologies, a task that typically requires the\nfull-time effort of OPC engineers with years of experience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1vSo12VPw3MoFVMVrdwwpG9BLSujjX6xtWDG9XXBb34","pdfSize":"3746883"}
