The proposed method\nleverages the vectorized linguistic knowledge contained in the distributed\nrepresentation of a Large Language Model, and the causal associations entailed\nby the embedded failure modes and mechanisms of the industrial assets. The\npaper presents the elementary but essential concepts of the solution, which is\nconceived as a causality-aware retrieval augmented generation system, and\nillustrates them experimentally on a real-world Predictive Maintenance setting.\nFinally, it discusses avenues of improvement for the maturity of the utilized\ncausal technology to meet the robustness challenges of increasingly complex\nscenarios in the industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
