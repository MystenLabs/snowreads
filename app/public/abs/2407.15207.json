The consistency conditions\ndemanded for the entropy of the system in terms of the cosmological parameters\nof the model: positive production ($dS/dt>0$) and convexity condition\n($d^{2}S/dt^{2} <0$), are investigated. We show that these conditions strongly\nconstraint the viavility of these models. Additionally, we comment about our\nresults and compare with those obtained in recent works where the restriction\nof the parameters for these two diffusion models was implemented with the use\nof cosmological data.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
