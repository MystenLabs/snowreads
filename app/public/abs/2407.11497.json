However, three main gaps still exist. First, most existing work\ncharacterizes design flaws from the perspective of researchers rather than the\nperspective of general users. Second, little work has been done to infer why\nthese design flaws occur. Third, due to problems such as unclear terminology\nand ambiguous research scope, a better framework that systematically outlines\nvarious design flaws and helps distinguish different types of flaws is desired.\nTo address the above gaps, this work investigated visualization design flaws\nthrough the lens of the public, constructed a framework to summarize and\ncategorize the identified flaws, and explored why these flaws occur.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
