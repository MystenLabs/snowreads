We prove that these operators send localized (quantum) cluster\nmonomials to localized (quantum) cluster monomials. They also send bases to\nbases in many cases. In addition, the bases constructed via freezing coincide\nwith those constructed via localization.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
