This does not work for more general black\nholes such as the Kerr and Reissner-Nordstr\\\"om solutions. Expounding on the\ndetails of how it fails to work nevertheless uncovers interesting connections\nwith the \"spring constant\" of black holes and with black hole thermodynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
