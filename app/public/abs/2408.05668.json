The solution to this problem has been presented in Phys.~Lett.~B 830\n(2022), 137140, where it was suggested to modify the Lagrange multiplier\nconstraint.\n  In this paper, by using the improved formulation, we investigate the\ncosmology and black holes in mimetic gravity with scalar potential and in the\nscalar mimetic $F(R)$ gravity. The inflationary era and dark energy epoch for\nthe above theories are presented as specific examples from the general\nreconstruction scheme which permits to realise any universe expansion history\nvia the choice of the corresponding scalar potential or function $F(R)$. Two\nblack hole solutions including the Schwarzschild and Hayward ones are\nconstructed. The shadow and the radius of the photon sphere for the above black\nholes are found. The explicit confrontation of the black hole shadow radius\nwith the observational bounds from M87$^*$ and Sgr A$^*$ objects is done. It is\ndemonstrated that they do not conflict with Event Horizon Telescope\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
