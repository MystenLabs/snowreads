The interesting feature of such type processes lays on its infinite\nmemory that allows it to record a quite ancient history. Then, using the\nmartingale decomposition method, we establish some deviation and moment\ninequalities for separately Lipschitz functions of such a process, under\nvarious moment conditions on some dominating random variables. Our results\ngeneralize the Markov models of Dedecker and Fan [Stochastic Process.\\ Appl.,\n2015] and a recent paper by Chazottes et al.\\ [Ann.\\ Appl.\\ Probab., 2023] for\nthe special case of a specific class of infinite memory models with discrete\nvalues.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
