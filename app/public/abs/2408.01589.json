We design a heuristic guided search method to speed up the search\nprocess and more efficiently localize the approximate center of soil regions.\nThrough simulation experiments, we assess the effectiveness of the proposed\nalgorithm and discover superior performance in terms of speed, distance\ntraveled, and success rate compared to naive baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
