We present enhanced mathematical results, including an\nexact expression for the reverse trajectory in the probability flow ODE and an\nexact expression for the covariance matrix in the gDDIM scheme. Furthermore, we\noffer an improved understanding of the EI scheme's efficiency in terms of the\nchange of variables. The noising process in DDIM is analyzed from the\nperspective of non-equilibrium statistical physics. Additionally, we propose a\nnew scheme for DDIM, called the principal-axis DDIM (paDDIM).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"7zYOHoyRdDwsT1L6S6ScP-Gx7ziWUNu2iJcTDH0kkJg","pdfSize":"190092"}
