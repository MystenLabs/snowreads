Maintaining the integrity of wind\nturbines to produce this energy is a costly and time-consuming task requiring\nrepeated inspection and maintenance. While autonomous drones have proven to\nmake this process more efficient, the algorithms for detecting anomalies to\nprevent catastrophic damage to turbine blades have fallen behind due to some\ndangerous defects, such as hairline cracks, being barely-visible. Existing\ndatasets and literature are lacking and tend towards detecting obvious and\nvisible defects in addition to not being geographically diverse. In this paper\nwe introduce a novel and diverse dataset of barely-visible hairline cracks\ncollected from numerous wind turbine inspections. To prove the efficacy of our\ndataset, we detail our end-to-end deployed turbine crack detection pipeline\nfrom the image acquisition stage to the use of predictions in providing\nautomated maintenance recommendations to extend the life and efficiency of wind\nturbines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
