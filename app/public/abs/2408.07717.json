PDFs\nhave been extracted from unpolarized $f_1(x,\\textbf{k}^2_{\\perp})$ transverse\nmomentum-dependent parton distribution functions (TMDs). We have solved the\nquark-quark correlation function to have an unpolarized $H(x,\\zeta,t)$ GPD. The\nunpolarized GPDs at zero skewness ($\\zeta=0$) lead to describing the\nelectromagnetic form factors (EMFFs) ($F_M(t)$) and gravitational form factors\n(GFFs)($A_M(t)$) of the mesons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
