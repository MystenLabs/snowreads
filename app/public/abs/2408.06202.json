One of the major challenges is the large search space due to a diverse\nset of game components. In recent works, state abstraction has been applied to\nsearch-based game AI and has brought significant performance improvements.\nState abstraction techniques rely on reducing the search space, e.g., by\naggregating similar states. However, the application of these abstractions is\nhindered because the quality of an abstraction is difficult to evaluate.\nPrevious works hence abandon the abstraction in the middle of the search to not\nbias the search to a local optimum. This mechanism introduces a hyper-parameter\nto decide the time to abandon the current state abstraction. In this work, we\npropose a size-constrained state abstraction (SCSA), an approach that limits\nthe maximum number of nodes being grouped together. We found that with SCSA,\nthe abstraction is not required to be abandoned. Our empirical results on $3$\nstrategy games show that the SCSA agent outperforms the previous methods and\nyields robust performance over different games.
