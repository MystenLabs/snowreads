Here we report the spectroscopic redshift\nconfirmation of COSBO-7, a strongly lensed DSFG in the COSMOS-PRIMER field.\nRecently, using 10 bands of JWST NIRCam and MIRI imaging data on COSBO-7, Ling\net al. (2024) reported a photometric redshift solution of $z\\gtrsim7.0$,\nfavored by four independent spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes,\nand therefore providing an appealing candidate of the most distant massive\nDSFG. This photo-$z$ solution was also supported by a single line detection in\nALMA Band 3 consistent with CO(7-6) at $z=7.46$. However, our new ALMA\nobservations robustly detect two lines in Band 6 identified as CO(7-6) and\n[CI](2-1) at $z_{\\rm spec}=2.625$, and thus the Band 3 line as CO(3-2). The\nthree robust line detections decidedly place COSBO-7 at $z=2.625$, refuting the\nphoto-$z$ solution. We derive physical parameters by fitting NIR-to-mm\nphotometry and lens modeling, revealing that COSBO-7 is a main-sequence galaxy.\nWe examine possible reasons for this photo-$z$ failure and attribute it to (1)\nthe likely underestimation of photometric uncertainty at 0.9$\\mu$m, and (2) the\nlack of photometry at wavelengths beyond 20$\\mu$m. Notably, we recover a\nbona-fide $z_{\\rm phot}\\sim 2.3$ by including the existing MIPS $24\\mu$m\nphotometry, demonstrating the critical importance of mid-infrared data for\nphoto-$z$ robustness. This work highlights a common challenge in modeling SEDs\nof DSFGs, cautioning against the reliability of photometric redshifts, as well\nas pseudo-spectroscopic redshifts based on single line detection.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
