These asymmetries provide a means to observe\ntransversely polarized quarks, which arise exclusively from the interference\nbetween the dipole and the Standard Model interactions, thereby depending\nlinearly on the dipole couplings. We demonstrate that this novel approach can\nenhance current constraints on light-quark dipole operators by an order of\nmagnitude, free from contamination of other new physics effects. Furthermore,\nit allows for a simultaneous determination of both the real and imaginary parts\nof the dipole couplings, offering a new avenue for investigating potential\n$CP$-violating effects at high energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
