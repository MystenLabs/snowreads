It evaluates and compares the generative\nperformance and cultural relevance of leading TTI models in these languages\nagainst their performance in English. Using the proposed IndicTTI benchmark, we\ncomprehensively assess the performance of 30 Indic languages with two\nopen-source diffusion models and two commercial generation APIs. The primary\nobjective of this benchmark is to evaluate the support for Indic languages in\nthese models and identify areas needing improvement. Given the linguistic\ndiversity of 30 languages spoken by over 1.4 billion people, this benchmark\naims to provide a detailed and insightful analysis of TTI models' effectiveness\nwithin the Indic linguistic landscape. The data and code for the IndicTTI\nbenchmark can be accessed at\nhttps://iab-rubric.org/resources/other-databases/indictti.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
