The relation\nbetween the free vector lattice over a pre-ordered Banach space and the free\nBanach lattice of a given convexity type over it is made explicit. It is\ndetermined when precisely the free Banach lattice has a canonical realisation\nas a lattice of homogeneous continuous functions on the positive part of the\nunit ball of the dual space. For free $p$-convex Banach lattices with convexity\nconstant 1 over pre-ordered Banach spaces, realisations as function lattices\nare obtained that generalise those for free Banach lattices of that type over\nBanach spaces.\n  A characterisation of $p$-convex Banach lattices in terms of vector lattice\nhomomorphisms into $\\mathrm{L}_p$-spaces or into the real numbers is included.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
