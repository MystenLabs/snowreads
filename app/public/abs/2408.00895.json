Existing Randomized Smoothing\n(RS) certification methods for classical machine learning models are\ncomputationally intensive. In this paper, we propose the combination of QC and\nthe concept of discrete randomized smoothing to speed up the stochastic\ncertification of ML models for discrete data. We show how to encode all the\nperturbations of the input binary data in superposition and use Quantum\nAmplitude Estimation (QAE) to obtain a quadratic reduction in the number of\ncalls to the model that are required compared to traditional randomized\nsmoothing techniques. In addition, we propose a new binary threat model to\nallow for an extensive evaluation of our approach on images, graphs, and text.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TXUw9YufxQcL0fZmAoEjUTwNITF4nq2yb7LJtk3RvoY","pdfSize":"776441","txDigest":"7QX4WasFFcm67wq6tmbUeSdeMZPyrTVysLhRto6yPctW","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
