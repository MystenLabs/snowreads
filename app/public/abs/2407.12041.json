In dimension two, we show that this function\nis strictly convex, which leads to a new notion of the centre of such a domain,\ncalled the variocentre. In dimension three, we investigate the relationship\nbetween the variance and the distance to the boundary, which mathematically\njustifies claims made for a recently developed algorithm for classifying\ninterior and exterior points with applications in biology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
