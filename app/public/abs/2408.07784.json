While\nmedication is a common treatment, understanding how university students manage\ntheir medication for mental health symptoms in real-world practice has not been\nfully explored. In this study, we conducted semi-structured interviews with\nuniversity students to understand the unique challenges in the mental health\nmedication management process and their coping strategies, particularly\nexamining the role of various technologies in this process. We discovered that\ndue to struggles with self-acceptance and the interdependent relationship\nbetween medication, symptoms, schedules, and life changes, the medication\nmanagement process for students was a highly dynamic journey involving frequent\ndosage changes. Thus, students adopted flexible strategies of using minimal\ntechnology to manage their medication in different situations while maintaining\na high degree of autonomy. Based on our findings, we propose design\nimplications for future technologies to seamlessly integrate into their daily\nlives and assist students in managing their mental health medications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
