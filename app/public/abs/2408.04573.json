Examples of such\naxioms include quasilinearity, homotheticity, independence-type axioms for\nmixture spaces, constant relative/absolute risk and ambiguity aversion axioms,\nstationarity for dated rewards or consumption streams, separability, and many\nothers. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for invariant\nrationalizability via a novel approach which relies on tools from the\ntheoretical computer science literature on automated theorem proving. We also\nestablish a generalization of the Dushnik-Miller theorem, which we use to give\na complete description of the out-of-sample predictions generated by the data\nunder any such collection of axioms.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
