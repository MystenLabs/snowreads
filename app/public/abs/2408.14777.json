Systems that address multiple modes of speech require a\nrobust front-end speech classifier. Performance of whispered vs normal speech\nclassification drops in the presence of additive white Gaussian noise, since\nnormal speech takes on some of the characteristics of whispered speech. In this\nwork, we propose a new feature named the quartered chirp spectral envelope, a\ncombination of the chirp spectrum and the quartered spectral envelope, to\nclassify whispered and normal speech. The chirp spectrum can be fine-tuned to\nobtain customized features for a given task, and the quartered spectral\nenvelope has been proven to work especially well for the current task. The\nfeature is trained on a one dimensional convolutional neural network, that\ncaptures the trends in the spectral envelope. The proposed system performs\nbetter than the state of the art, in the presence of white noise.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
