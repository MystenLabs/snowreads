Meanwhile, in other areas of\nrobotics, large models and sim-to-real have led to tremendous progress.\nInspired by such work, we present AutoMate, a learning framework and system\nthat consists of 4 parts: 1) a dataset of 100 assemblies compatible with\nsimulation and the real world, along with parallelized simulation environments\nfor policy learning, 2) a novel simulation-based approach for learning\nspecialist (i.e., part-specific) policies and generalist (i.e., unified)\nassembly policies, 3) demonstrations of specialist policies that individually\nsolve 80 assemblies with 80% or higher success rates in simulation, as well as\na generalist policy that jointly solves 20 assemblies with an 80%+ success\nrate, and 4) zero-shot sim-to-real transfer that achieves similar (or better)\nperformance than simulation, including on perception-initialized assembly. The\nkey methodological takeaway is that a union of diverse algorithms from\nmanufacturing engineering, character animation, and time-series analysis\nprovides a generic and robust solution for a diverse range of robotic assembly\nproblems. To our knowledge, AutoMate provides the first simulation-based\nframework for learning specialist and generalist policies over a wide range of\nassemblies, as well as the first system demonstrating zero-shot sim-to-real\ntransfer over such a range.
