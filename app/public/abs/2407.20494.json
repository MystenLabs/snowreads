This research paper explores the\ndesign and implementation of a secure, cloud-native machine learning operations\n(MLOPS) pipeline that supports multi-cloud environments. The primary objective\nis to create a robust infrastructure that facilitates secure data collection,\nreal-time model inference, and efficient management of the machine learning\nlifecycle. By leveraging cloud providers' capabilities, the solution aims to\nstreamline the deployment and maintenance of machine learning models, ensuring\nhigh availability, scalability, and security. This paper details the network\ntopology, problem description, business and technical requirements, trade-offs,\nand the provider selection process for achieving an optimal MLOPS environment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
