As a consequence, we complement the classical de Leeuw-Rudin\ntheorem on a description of extreme points of the unit ball of $H^1$ showing\nthat $H^1$ is a unique Hardy-Lorentz space $H(\\Lambda(\\varphi))$, for which\nevery extreme point of the unit ball is a normed outer function. Moreover,\nassuming that $\\varphi$ is strictly increasing and strictly concave, we prove\nthat every function $f\\in H(\\Lambda(\\varphi))$,\n$\\|f\\|_{H(\\Lambda(\\varphi))}=1$, such that the absolute value of its\nnontangential limit ${f}(e^{it})$ is a constant on some set of positive measure\nof $[0,2\\pi]$, is an extreme point of the unit ball of $H(\\Lambda(\\varphi))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
