Along the way, we review several related constructions, and\nshow that the Nadeau-Spink-Tewari recursion determines the characters of\nflagged Schur modules coming from a broader class of translucent diagrams.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
