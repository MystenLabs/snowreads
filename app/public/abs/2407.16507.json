We begin by following the perturbative\nconstruction of Vernov and Khrustalev and provide a rigorous derivation of the\nfourth-order expansion in small amplitude, which we use to verify the Galerkin\nscheme. In the main part, we focus on exploring large solutions numerically. We\nfind an intricate bifurcation structure of time-periodic solutions forming a\nfractal-like pattern and explore it for the first time. Our results suggest\nthat time-periodic solutions exist for arbitrary frequencies, with appearance\nof fine bifurcation structure likely related to the Cantor set families of\nsolutions described in previous rigorous works.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
