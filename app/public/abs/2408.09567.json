The method leverages the MediaPipe framework\nto extract key landmarks from each hand gesture, which are then used to\nconstruct graph representations. A robust preprocessing pipeline, including\ntranslational and scale normalization techniques, ensures consistency across\nthe dataset. The constructed graphs are fed into a GCN-based neural\narchitecture with residual connections to improve network stability. The\narchitecture achieves state-of-the-art results, demonstrating superior\ngeneralization capabilities with a validation accuracy of 99.14%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
