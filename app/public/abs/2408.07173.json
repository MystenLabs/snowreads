However, its computation as a function of the fragment split\nis an ill-posed problem that is usually solved through certain assumptions.\nArguably, the most widely used method for its computation is the\nLog-third-difference method, which assumes an underlying local Gaussian\ndistribution. Experimental data of the even-odd effect show sharp features and\npeaks that are a challenge for the Log-third difference method (or any method\nfor that matter). This paper presents a detailed study of the performance of\nthe Log-third difference method and describes three strategies for improving\nthe precision and accuracy around these sharp features. The best results are\nobtained with an iterative application of the method and with the use of a\nmulti-Gaussian fit. In regions with a smooth behaviour, the direct application\nof the Log-third-difference method remains the best option.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VbJkUtl5O8nUxAX2bItdh51n0z5lj0ZY2UxJWBjs3hk","pdfSize":"930335"}
