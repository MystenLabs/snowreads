In agricultural\napplications, where environmental conditions can be particularly challenging\ndue to variable lighting or weather conditions, Visual-Inertial SLAM has\nemerged as a potential solution. This paper benchmarks several open-source\nVisual-Inertial SLAM systems, including ORB-SLAM3, VINS-Fusion, OpenVINS,\nKimera, and SVO Pro, to evaluate their performance in agricultural settings. We\nfocus on the impact of loop closing on localization accuracy and computational\ndemands, providing a comprehensive analysis of these systems' effectiveness in\nreal-world environments and especially their application to embedded systems in\nagricultural robotics. Our contributions further include an assessment of\nvarying frame rates on localization accuracy and computational load. The\nfindings highlight the importance of loop closing in improving localization\naccuracy while managing computational resources efficiently, offering valuable\ninsights for optimizing Visual-Inertial SLAM systems for practical outdoor\napplications in mobile robotics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
