However, conventional approaches of\nachieving intrinsic C points using photonic crystals with broken symmetries\nsuffer from low Q factor and are highly sensitive to structural geometry,\nrendering them fragile and susceptible to perturbations and disorders. In this\nletter, we report the realization of magneto-optical (MO) bound states in the\ncontinuum (BICs) using a symmetry-preserved planar photonic crystal, achieving\nintrinsic at-{\\Gamma} C points that are robust against variation in structural\ngeometry and external magnetic field. MO coupling between two dipole modes\ninduces Zeeman splitting of the eigenfrequencies, leading to MO BICs and\nquasi-BICs with circular eigenstates for high-Q chiral responses. Furthermore,\nswitchable C point handedness and circular dichroism are enabled by reversing\nthe magnetic field. These findings unveil a new type of BICs with circular\neigenstates and on-demand control of C points, paving the way for advanced\nchiral wave manipulation with enhanced light-matter interaction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
