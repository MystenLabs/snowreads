We then extend our focus to a class of\nnonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization problems (MM) that generalize\n(MOL). By performing the partial forward-backward envelope to the primal\nvariable of the inner maximization subproblem, we propose a minimization\nproblem (MMPen), where its objective function is explicitly formulated. We\nprove that the first-order stationary points of (MMPen) coincide with the\nfirst-order minimax points of (MM). Therefore, various efficient minimization\nmethods and their convergence guarantees can be directly employed to solve\n(MM), hence solving (MCC) through (MOL). Preliminary numerical experiments\ndemonstrate the great potential of our proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
