It employs regression machine learning\nmethods to predict the contributions of various sources to delays. Time-series\nmodels, including LSTM, Hybrid LSTM, and Bi-LSTM, are compared with baseline\nregression models such as Multiple Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random\nForest Regression, and Neural Network. Despite considerable errors in the\nbaseline models, the study aims to identify influential features in delay\nprediction, potentially informing flight planning strategies. Unlike previous\nwork, this research focuses on regression tasks and explores the use of\ntime-series models for predicting flight delays. It offers insights into\naviation operations by independently analyzing each delay component (e.g.,\nsecurity, weather).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
