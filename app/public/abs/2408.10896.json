It is called\nrealizably monotone if $X_\\alpha\\le X_\\beta$ in $\\mathcal{S}$ whenever\n$\\alpha\\le\\beta$ in $\\mathcal{A}$. Such a system necessarily is stochastically\nmonotone, that is, it satisfies $P_\\alpha\\preceq P_\\beta$ in stochastic\nordering whenever $\\alpha \\le \\beta$. It has been known exactly when these\nnotions of monotonicity are equivalent except for a certain subclass of acyclic\nposets, called Class W. In this paper we introduce inverse probability\ntransforms and synchronizing bijections recursively when $\\mathcal{S}$ is a\nposet of Class W and $\\mathcal{A}$ is synchronizable, and validate monotonicity\nequivalence by constructing $(X_\\alpha: \\alpha\\in\\mathcal{A})$ explicitly. We\nalso show that synchronizability is necessary for monotonicity equivalence when\n$\\mathcal{S}$ is in Class W.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
