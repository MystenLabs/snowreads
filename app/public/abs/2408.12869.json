The problem is closely related to the\nrecognition of network matrices, which are a large subclass of totally\nunimodular matrices and have many applications in mixed-integer programming.\nPreviously, Bixby and Wagner have designed an efficient algorithm for graph\nrealization that grows a submatrix in a column-wise fashion whilst maintaining\na graphic realization. This paper complements their work by providing an\nalgorithm that works in a row-wise fashion and uses similar data structures.\nThe main challenge in designing efficient algorithms for the graph realization\nproblem is ambiguity as there may exist many graphs realizing $M$. The key\ninsight for designing an efficient row-wise algorithm is that a graphic matrix\nis uniquely represented by an SPQR tree, a graph decomposition that stores all\ngraphs with the same set of cycles. The developed row-wise algorithm uses data\nstructures that are compatible with the column-wise algorithm and can be\ncombined with the latter to detect maximal graphic submatrices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
