Building on the\ngroundbreaking work of \\cite{marchenko1967distribution}, which demonstrated\nthat the empirical spectral distribution of \\(\\bW_n\\) converges towards a\nprobability measure \\(F\\) characterized by its Stieltjes transform, this paper\ninvestigates the properties of \\(F\\) when \\(\\calB\\) is a general measure. We\nshow that \\(F\\) has an analytic density at the region near where the Stieltjes\ntransform of $\\calB$ is bounded. The density closely resembles \\(C\\sqrt{|x -\nx_0|}\\) near certain edge points \\(x_0\\) of its support for a wide class of\n\\(\\calA\\) and \\(\\calB\\). We provide a complete characterization of the support\nof \\(F\\). Moreover, we show that \\(F\\) can exhibit discontinuities at points\nwhere \\(\\calB\\) is discontinuous.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
