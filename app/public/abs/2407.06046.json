The focus is on studying the angulon quasiparticle concept in the\ncrossover from few- to many-body physics. To this end, we formulate the problem\nin real space and solve it with a mean-field approach in the frame co-rotating\nwith the impurity. We show that the system starts to feature angulon\ncharacteristics when the size of the bosonic cloud is large enough to screen\nthe rotor. More importantly, we demonstrate the departure from the angulon\npicture for large system sizes or large angular momenta where the properties of\nthe system are determined by collective excitations of the Bose gas.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic and Molecular Clusters","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DrOmLAb_DWPRUCbw2kRFVdu1Um2yuf0oVtlbE-Eze0s","pdfSize":"1342005"}
