Our findings significantly extend the scope of quantum\nmechanical systems for which perturbation theory suffices to calculate the\ncontributions of non-perturbative effects to energy levels, with or without the\nneed for a boundary condition, depending on the potential. We further provide\nevidence for our results by predicting the corrections to the large-order\nbehavior of the perturbative expansion for the Jacobi SD elliptic potential\nusing the early terms of the instanton fluctuations that satisfy the P/NP\nrelation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R1VoZkybrt6L57xa5cMT9OGCzyajlkuNApnnKAKfq48","pdfSize":"621926"}
