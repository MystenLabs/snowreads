Planning the paths for a robot to\nsafely and efficiently perform such an inspection is an extremely difficult\nalgorithmic challenge. In this work we consider an abstraction of the\ninspection planning problem which we term Graph Inspection. We give two exact\nalgorithms for this problem, using dynamic programming and integer linear\nprogramming. We analyze the performance of these methods, and present multiple\napproaches to achieve scalability. We demonstrate significant improvement both\nin path weight and inspection coverage over a state-of-the-art approach on two\nrobotics tasks in simulation, a bridge inspection task by a UAV and a surgical\ninspection task using a medical robot.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GItQtkoBTHay0Nc1iGuKZPpG0IFxH8z0AvcBbeUxaYM","pdfSize":"5739720","objectId":"0xa174dffc65da58ee579829c5e889a42cb1aaf20c9ea6b051b6db86aa5ab49257","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
