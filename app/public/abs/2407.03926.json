In the existing works\nanalyzing the performances of ISAC, discrete-time systems were commonly\nassumed, which, however, overlooked the impacts of temporal, spectral, and\nspatial properties. To address this issue, we establish a unified information\nmodel for the band-limited continuous-time ISAC systems. In the established\ninformation model, we employ a novel sensing performance metric, called the\nsensing mutual information (SMI). Through analysis, we show how the SMI can be\nutilized as a bridge between the mutual information domain and the mean squared\nerror (MSE) domain. In addition, we illustrate the communication mutual\ninformation (CMI)-SMI and CMI-MSE regions to identify the performance bounds of\nISAC systems in practical settings and reveal the trade-off between\ncommunication and sensing performances. Moreover, via analysis and numerical\nresults, we provide two valuable insights into the design of novel ISAC-enabled\nsystems: i) communication prefers the waveforms of random amplitude, sensing\nprefers the waveforms of constant amplitude, both communication and sensing\nfavor the waveforms of low correlations with random phases; ii) There exists a\nlinear positive proportional relationship between the allocated time-frequency\nresource and the achieved communication rate/sensing MSE.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
