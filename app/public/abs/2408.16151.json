However, their\napplication in automating other Software Engineering activities remains largely\nunexplored. Thus, in this paper, we report the first results of a study in\nwhich we are exploring the use of ChatGPT to support API migration tasks, an\nimportant problem that demands manual effort and attention from developers.\nSpecifically, in the paper, we share our initial results involving the use of\nChatGPT to migrate a client application to use a newer version of SQLAlchemy,\nan ORM (Object Relational Mapping) library widely used in Python. We evaluate\nthe use of three types of prompts (Zero-Shot, One-Shot, and Chain Of Thoughts)\nand show that the best results are achieved by the One-Shot prompt, followed by\nthe Chain Of Thoughts. Particularly, with the One-Shot prompt we were able to\nsuccessfully migrate all columns of our target application and upgrade its code\nto use new functionalities enabled by SQLAlchemy's latest version, such as\nPython's asyncio and typing modules, while preserving the original code\nbehavior.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
