However, isolating\nspecific nonlinear signal in the collinear geometry, especially with a kHz\nlaser, presents challenges. We present an experimental implementation of\noptical 2DCS in a collinear geometry using a femtosecond laser operating at a 5\nKHz repetition rate. The desired nonlinear signal is selectively extracted in\nthe frequency domain by lock-in detection. Both pump-probe and optical 2DCS\nexperiments were conducted on a rubidium vapor. The signal-to-noise ratio of\npump-probe and 2DCS spectra was characterised under various experimental\nparameters. The study highlights the importance of the lock-in reference\nfrequency in overcoming the limitations imposed by low repetition rates,\nthereby paving the way for the application of collinear optical 2DCS in\nmaterial systems requiring kHz femtosecond lasers.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
