In this\npaper, a method to smooth out these spatial distributions by grading the\nelectrode microstructure in-the-plane is proposed. A mathematical model of a\nlarge format pouch cell is developed and validated against both temperature and\nvoltage experimental data. An analytic solution for the optimal graded\nelectrode that achieves a uniform current distribution across the pouch cell is\nthen derived. The model predicts that the graded electrodes could significantly\nreduce the likelihood of lithium plating in large format pouch cells, with\ngrading increasing the C-rate at which plating occurs from 2.75C to 5.5C. These\nresults indicate the potential of designing spatially varying electrode\narchitectures to homogenise the response of large format pouch cells and\nimprove their high rate performance.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
