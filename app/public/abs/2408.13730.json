Simulations use the\nlattice-Boltzmann method coupled with the discrete element method, providing\ndetailed stress and deformation data. Both simulations and experiments present\na perfect match with each other in carefully conducted deposition experiments,\nvalidating the simulation method. We analyze transient rheological laws and\njamming transitions using our recently introduced length-scale ratio $G$. $G$\nserves as a unified metric for the pressure and shear rate capturing the\ndynamics of sheared fluid-granular systems. Two key transition points, $G_{Y}$\nand $G_{0}$, categorize the material's state into solid-like, creeping, and\nfluid-like states. Yielding at $G_{Y}$ marks the transition from solid-like to\ncreeping, while $G_{0}$ signifies the shift to the fluid-like state. The\n$\\mu-G$ relationship converges towards the equilibrium $\\mu_{eq}(G)$ after\n$G>G_0$ showing the critical point where the established rheological laws for\nsteady states apply during transient conditions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
