Additionally, under mild\nconditions, their stable categories of Gorenstein projective modules and\nGorenstein defect categories are equivalent, respectively. Some homological\nconjectures are also investigated for bounded extensions, including\nAuslander-Reiten conjecture, finististic dimension conjecture, Fg condition,\nHan's conjecture, and Keller's conjecture. Applications to trivial extensions\nand triangular matrix algebras are given.\n  In course of proof, we give some handy criteria for a functor between module\ncategories to induce triangle functors between stable categories of Gorenstein\nprojective modules and Gorenstein defect categories, which generalise some\nknown criteria, and hence might be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iMJL5vm1mOHQ59YTd7RcdIomOI-D0LbEFv3eWBtsyjQ","pdfSize":"297206"}
