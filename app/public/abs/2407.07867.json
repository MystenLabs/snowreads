Then $\\Omega+ \\pi^* \\eta$ is a holomorphically symplectic\nform on a complex manifold which is called the degenerate twistor deformation\nof $M$. We prove that degenerate twistor deformations of compact\nholomorphically symplectic K\\\"ahler manifolds are also K\\\"ahler. First, we\nprove that degenerate twistor deformations are Hermitian symplectic, that is,\ntamed by a symplectic form; this is shown using positive currents and an\nargument based on the Hahn--Banach theorem, originally due to Sullivan. Then we\napply a version of Huybrechts's theorem showing that two non-separated points\nin the Teichm\\\"uller space of holomorphically symplectic manifolds correspond\nto bimeromorphic manifolds if they are Hermitian symplectic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ntJLf4HILCW-JJZI2jtp-be6XkgRUA7OG1mTXtVBgsM","pdfSize":"293109","objectId":"0x766973637077f5c8a75f656734a44a671220d6634f327ca09ad3ea40bb2b3a1e","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
