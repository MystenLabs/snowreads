The MRE contains an integral \"history term\"\nmodeling wake effects, which causes the force acting on a particle at some\ngiven time to depend on its full past trajectory. The history term causes\ncomplications in the numerical solution of the MRE and is therefore often\nneglected, despite both numerical and experimental evidence that its effects\nare generally not negligible. By numerically computing trajectories with and\nwithout the history term of a large number of particles in different flow\nfields, we investigate its impact on the large-scale Lagrangian dynamics of\nsimulated particles. We show that for moderate to large Stokes numbers,\nignoring the history term leads to significant differences in clustering\npatterns. Furthermore, we compute finite-time Lyapunov exponents and show that,\neven for small particles, the differences in the resulting scalar field from\nignoring the BHT can be significant, in particular if the underlying flow is\nturbulent.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
