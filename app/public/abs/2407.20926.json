We theoretically investigated its intensity and polarization in\nsolar prominences, taking 3D radiative transfer and Hanle and Zeeman effects\ninto account. We used an optically thick 3D model representative of a solar\nprominence and applied several inversion methods to the synthetic Stokes\nprofiles, clarifying their pros and cons for inferring prominence magnetic\nfields. We conclude that the self-consistent 3D inversion with radiative\ntransfer is necessary to determine the magnetic field vector, although its\ngeometry cannot be inferred with full fidelity. We also demonstrate that more\ntraditional methods, such as those based on the weak field approximation or the\nconstant-property slab assumption, can offer useful information under certain\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fGN2vIajSLDHJnzPemHAzZmU37zKZ4BvC7nKHHkGpuc","pdfSize":"4826508"}
