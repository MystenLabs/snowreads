The\namplitude of the (nearly) scale-invariant inflationary tensor power spectrum at\nlarge scales provides us with crucial information about the energy scale of\ninflation in the case of the minimal inflaton coupling to gravity. Furthermore,\nthe spectral energy density, $\\Omega_{_{\\rm GW}}(f)$, of the GWs at\nsufficiently small scales (or, large frequencies $f$) serves as an important\nobservational probe of post-inflationary primordial dynamics. In fact, the\nsmall-scale spectral tilt, $n_{_{\\rm GW}} = \\frac{{\\rm d}\\log{\\Omega_{_{\\rm\nGW}}}}{{\\rm d}\\log{f}}$, of the spectral energy density of GWs is sensitive to\nthe (unknown) post-inflationary equation of state (EoS), $w$, of the universe;\nwith a softer EoS ($w < 1/3$) leading to a red tilt: $n_{_{\\rm GW}} < 0$, while\na stiffer EoS ($w > 1/3$) resulting in a blue tilt: $n_{_{\\rm GW}} > 0$. The\npost-inflationary dynamics, however, is generically expected to be quite\ncomplex, potentially involving a number of distinct phases. Hence, in this\nwork, we discuss the possibility of multiple sharp transitions, namely $w_1 \\to\nw_2 \\to w_3 \\to ... \\to w_n$, in the EoS of the post-inflationary universe and\ncompute the corresponding spectral energy density of the inflationary GWs. We\nexplicitly determine the region of the parameter space $\\lbrace{ w_1, \\, w_2,\n\\, w_3, ..., w_n\\rbrace}$ which leads to a potentially detectable signal in the\nupcoming GW detectors, without violating the current constraints.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yKSZpBZAqBqJYAuoHDM-nFRGdFYOJi8366FYHYV8H-o","pdfSize":"10137909"}
