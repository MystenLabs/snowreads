The summary is used instead\nof the original graph to complete the task faster. We introduce multi-view\nstructural graph summaries and propose an algorithm for merging two summaries.\nWe conduct a theoretical analysis of our algorithm. We run experiments on three\ndatasets, contributing two new ones. The datasets are of different domains (web\ngraph, source code, and news) and sizes; the interpretation of multi-view\ndepends on the domain and are pay-level domains on the web, control vs.\\@ data\nflow of the code, and news broadcasters. We experiment with three graph summary\nmodels: attribute collection, class collection, and their combination. We\nobserve that merging two structural summaries has an upper bound of quadratic\ncomplexity; but under reasonable assumptions, it has linear-time worst-case\ncomplexity. The running time of merging has a strong linear correlation with\nthe number of edges in the two summaries. Therefore, the experiments support\nthe assumption that the upper bound of quadratic complexity is not tight and\nthat linear complexity is possible. Furthermore, our experiments show that\nalways merging the two smallest summaries by the number of edges is the most\nefficient strategy for merging multiple structural summaries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
