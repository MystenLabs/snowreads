Wu, Craig Jones","authorsParsed":[["Larson","Austin J.",""],["Wu","John F.",""],["Jones","Craig",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Thu, 18 Jul 2024 17:40:38 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-19","timestamp":1721324438000,"abstract":"  Galaxies are theorized to form and co-evolve with their dark matter halos,\nsuch that their stellar masses and halo masses should be well-correlated.\nHowever, it is not known whether other observable galaxy features, such as\ntheir morphologies or large-scale environments, can be used to tighten the\ncorrelation between galaxy properties and halo masses. In this work, we train a\nbaseline random forest model to predict halo mass using galaxy features from\nthe Illustris TNG50 hydrodynamical simulation, and compare with convolutional\nneural networks (CNNs) and graph neural networks (GNNs) trained respectively\nusing galaxy image cutouts and galaxy point clouds. The best baseline model has\na root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.310 and mean absolute error (MAE) of\n0.220, compared to the CNN (RSME=0.359, MAE=0.238), GNN (RMSE=0.248,\nMAE=0.158), and a novel combined CNN+GNN (RMSE=0.248, MAE=0.144). The CNN is\nlikely limited by our small data set, and we anticipate that the CNN and\nCNN+GNN would benefit from training on larger cosmological simulations. We\nconclude that deep learning models can leverage information from galaxy\nappearances and environment, beyond commonly used summary statistics, in order\nto better predict the halo mass.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
