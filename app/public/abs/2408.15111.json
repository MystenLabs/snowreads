We study the distribution of the\n$\\operatorname{bdes}$ statistic over permutations avoiding prescribed sets of\nlength-three patterns. Specifically, we classify all pattern sets\n$\\Pi\\subseteq\\mathfrak{S}_{3}$ of size 1 and 2 into $\\operatorname{bdes}$-Wilf\nequivalence classes, and we derive a formula for the distribution of big\ndescents for each of these classes. Our methods include generating function\ntechniques along with various bijections involving objects such as Dyck paths\nand binary words. Several future directions of research are proposed, including\nconjectures concerning real-rootedness, log-concavity, and Schur positivity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
