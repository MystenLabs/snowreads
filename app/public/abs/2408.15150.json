Correspondingly, novel approaches are needed to\nensure that RL agents have been tested adequately before going to production.\nAmong them, mutation testing is quite promising, especially under the\nassumption that the injected faults (mutations) mimic the real ones.\n  In this paper, we first describe a taxonomy of real RL faults obtained by\nrepository mining. Then, we present the mutation operators derived from such\nreal faults and implemented in the tool muPRL. Finally, we discuss the\nexperimental results, showing that muPRL is effective at discriminating strong\nfrom weak test generators, hence providing useful feedback to developers about\nthe adequacy of the generated test scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"x__J0dCN4kHTWMfnP5uJe6Dkf2XnPw6wfxrPYsFwy4c","pdfSize":"300332"}
