With the goal of producing art, we discuss an image\ntriangulation algorithm in Python that utilizes Sobel edge detection and point\ncloud sparsification to determine final vertices for a triangulation, resulting\nin the creation of artistic triangulated compositions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"avmtpWU3W3Q7hkGCJPCjKk8M4NVRcjSswwCtnJ1c0TY","pdfSize":"5065868"}
