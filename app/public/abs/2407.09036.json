Inspired by\nbirational geometry, we conjecture that the Berkovich skeleton is the\ncomplement of the union of all open unit disks, and prove this conjecture for\n$\\mathcal{X}$ admitting a strictly semistable model with semiample canonical\nclass.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
