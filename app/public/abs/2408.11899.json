By using the\nstochastic series expansion quantum Monte Carlo (SSE-QMC) method, we obtain the\nproperties of the non-plateau XY phase, 1/9, 3/9, 5/9, 7/9 magnetization\nplateau phases, and fully polarized phase. Then, we determine the precise phase\ntransition critical points belonging to the 3D XY universality class through\nfinite-size scaling. Moreover, we study the longitudinal and transverse dynamic\nspin structure factors of this model in different phases. For the non-plateau\nXY phase, the energy spectra present a gap between the low-energy gapless\nbranch and the high-energy part under the competition of magnetic field and\ninteraction. The gapless branch can be described by the spin wave theory in the\ncanted antiferromagnetic phase of the effective \"block spin\" model. In the\nmagnetization plateau phase, we identify that the excitation arises from\nlocalized disturbances within the sublattice, which are capable of spreading in\nmomentum space. This study offers theoretical insights and interpretations for\nthe characteristics of the ground state and the inelastic neutron scattering\nspectrum in two-dimensional quantum magnetic materials. Specifically, it\nfocuses on materials with a checkerboard unit cell structure and odd-spin\nconfigurations under the influence of a longitudinal magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
