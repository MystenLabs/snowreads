As science advances, nature-inspired materials are becoming part of\nour lives. Animate materials, characterized by their activity, adaptability,\nand autonomy, emulate properties of living systems. While only biological\nmaterials fully embody these principles, artificial versions are advancing\nrapidly, promising transformative impacts across various sectors. This roadmap\npresents authoritative perspectives on animate materials across different\ndisciplines and scales, highlighting their interdisciplinary nature and\npotential applications in diverse fields including nanotechnology, robotics and\nthe built environment. It underscores the need for concerted efforts to address\nshared challenges such as complexity management, scalability, evolvability,\ninterdisciplinary collaboration, and ethical and environmental considerations.\nThe framework defined by classifying materials based on their level of animacy\ncan guide this emerging field encouraging cooperation and responsible\ndevelopment. By unravelling the mysteries of living matter and leveraging its\nprinciples, we can design materials and systems that will transform our world\nin a more sustainable manner.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
