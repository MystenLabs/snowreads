Our approach\nleverages complete information from the readout signal, which is available\nbefore any binary state assignment of the qubits. We provide a detailed\nalgorithm workflow, from the calibration of detector response functions to the\npost-processing of measurement outcomes, offering a computationally efficient\nsolution suitable for the output size typical of current quantum computing\ndevices and quantum algorithms. We benchmark our protocol on actual quantum\ncomputers with superconducting qubits, where the readout signal encodes the\nmeasurement information in the IQ clouds before qubit state assignment.\nFinally, we compare the performance of our algorithm against other measurement\nerror mitigation methods, such as iterative Bayesian unfolding and noise matrix\ninversion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
