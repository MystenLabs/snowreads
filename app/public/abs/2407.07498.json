A block triangular\npreconditioner for the resulting system of algebraic equations is proposed\nwhich is closely related to the Augmented Lagrangian (AL) preconditioner. A\nfield-of-values analysis of a preconditioned Krylov subspace method shows\nconvergence bounds that are independent of the mesh parameter variation.\nNumerical studies support the theory and demonstrate the robustness of the\napproach also with respect to the viscosity parameter variation, as is typical\nfor AL preconditioners when applied to inf-sup stable FE pairs. The numerical\nexperiments also address the accuracy of grad-div stabilized equal-order FE\nmethod for the steady state Navier-Stokes equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
