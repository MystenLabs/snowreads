We call the\nfunctor $\\int^{\\mathcal{A}}\\mathbf{Alg} \\to \\mathcal{A}$, whose typical fibre\nover $A$ is the category $\\mathbf{Alg}_\\mathcal{X}(F_A)$, the \"fibration of\nalgebras\" obtained from $F$.\n  Examples of such constructions arise in disparate areas of mathematics, and\nare unified by the intuition that $\\int^\\mathcal{A}\\mathbf{Alg} $ is a form of\nsemidirect product of the category $\\mathcal{A}$, acting on $\\mathcal{X}$, via\nthe `representation' given by the functor $F : \\mathcal{A} \\times \\mathcal{X}\n\\longrightarrow\\mathcal{X}$.\n  After presenting a range of examples and motivating said intuition, the\npresent work focuses on comparing a generic fibration with a fibration of\nalgebras: we prove that if $\\mathcal{A}$ has an initial object, under very mild\nassumptions on a fibration $p : \\mathcal{E}\\longrightarrow \\mathcal{A}$, we can\ndefine a canonical action of $\\mathcal{A}$ letting it act on the fibre\n$\\mathcal{E}_\\varnothing$ over the initial object. This result bears some\nresemblance to the well-known fact that the fundamental group $\\pi_1(B)$ of a\nbase space acts naturally on the fibers $F_b = p^{-1}b$ of a fibration $p : E\n\\to B$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
