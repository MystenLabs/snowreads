In contrast to previously known $q$-analogues of Guillera's formula, our\nnew $q$-analogue involves another free parameter apart from the $q$-parameter.\nOur derivation of this new result relies on the $q$-analogue of Zeilberger's\nalgorithm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PnsDv3_M2nuZQPqWqa8rxQo2S0szjkOj0p0aJgsA2nM","pdfSize":"99060"}
