Power system oscillations in the electrical grid are a\nmatter of contention. It may transform the stable operation of the power system\ninto an unstable system when oscillations grow and if no corrective actions are\ntaken to mitigate them. This paper manifests the utilization of the\nsynchrophasor technology for situational awareness by oscillation detection. An\nalgorithm is proposed for the low-frequency oscillation-related analysis based\non Prony and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) methods. It gives better insight\nduring the grid disturbance and other events related to power system operation.\nThe effectiveness of this algorithm is validated by two case studies in the\nWestern Regional Indian power grid.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
