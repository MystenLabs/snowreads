The effects of the magnetic field fluctuations are incorporated\ninto the fermion and photon propagators in a quasi-particle picture, which we\ndeveloped in previous works using the {\\it replica trick}. By considering the\nstrong-field limit, here we explicitly calculate the fermion self-energy\ninvolving radiative contributions at first-order in $\\alpha_\\text{em}$, in\norder to obtain the noise-averaged mass of the fermion propagating in the\nfluctuating magnetized medium. Our analytical results reveal a leading\ndouble-logarithmic contribution $\\sim \\left[\\ln \\left( |e B|/m^2\n\\right)\\right]^2$ to the mass, with an imaginary part representing a spectral\nbroadening proportional to the magnetic noise auto-correlation $\\Delta$. While\na uniform magnetic field already breaks Lorentz invariance, inducing the usual\nseparation into two orthogonal subspaces (perpendicular and parallel with\nrespect to the field), the presence of magnetic noise further breaks the\nremaining symmetry, thus leading to distinct spectral widths associated with\nfermion and anti-fermion, and their spin projection in the quasi-particle\npicture.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
