The baryons (antibaryons) are treated as hard incompressible\nobjects. Using this theoretical approach, we analyze experimental particle\nratios involving like-mass as well as unlike-mass hadrons. We also try to\nunderstand the existence of horn-like structures seen in the ratios of strange\nparticles to pion as a function of the collision energy. Using information\nabout the dependence of experimental particle ratios on $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ over a\nwide range of collision energies, we have extracted several model freeze-out\nparameters and examined their dependence on $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ The correlation\nbetween the $\\bar{p}/p$ and $K^-/K^+$ ratios is also examined.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_rxiSYRK_EXnLJJtvBiq2pXQ_OzTwyMihlZ7KjTBoBI","pdfSize":"3916941"}
