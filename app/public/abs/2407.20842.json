Ambiguities related to these solutions\ncan contribute significantly to systematic uncertainties of theoretical\npredictions for physical observables. We propose a general method to estimate\nthese systematic effects using techniques inspired by soft-gluon and\ntransverse-momentum resummation approaches. We first discuss the cases of the\nevolution of strong coupling $\\alpha_s$, collinear parton-distribution\nfunctions (PDFs), and transverse-momentum-dependent distributions (TMDs). We\nthen study the implications for precision observables in hadron-collider\nprocesses, such as the deep-inelastic scattering structure functions and the\ntransverse-momentum distribution of the lepton pair in Drell-Yan production.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
