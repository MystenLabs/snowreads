Existing methods address\nthe problem of fairness-aware domain generalization, focusing on either\ncovariate shift or correlation shift, but rarely consider both at the same\ntime. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that focuses on learning a\nfairness-aware domain-invariant predictor within a framework addressing both\ncovariate and correlation shifts simultaneously, ensuring its generalization to\nunknown test domains inaccessible during training. In our approach, data are\nfirst disentangled into content and style factors in latent spaces.\nFurthermore, fairness-aware domain-invariant content representations can be\nlearned by mitigating sensitive information and retaining as much other\ninformation as possible. Extensive empirical studies on benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods with respect\nto model accuracy as well as both group and individual fairness.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
