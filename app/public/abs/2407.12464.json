The Unfolded Protein Response\nis a crucial mechanism in eukaryotic cells, activated when unfolded proteins\nexceed a critical threshold. It maintains cell homeostasis by enhancing protein\nfolding, initiating quality control, and activating degradation pathways when\ndamage is irreversible. This response functions as a dynamic signaling network,\nwith proteins as nodes and their interactions as edges. We analyze these\nprotein-protein networks across different organisms to understand their\nintricate intra-cellular interactions and behaviors. In this work, analyzing\ntwelve organisms, we assess how fundamental measures in network theory can\nindividuate seed-proteins and specific pathways across organisms. We employ\nnetwork robustness to evaluate and compare the strength of the investigated PPI\nnetworks, and the structural controllability of complex networks to find and\ncompare the sets of driver nodes necessary to control the overall networks. We\nfind that network measures are related to phylogenetics, and advanced network\nmethods can identify main pathways of significance in the complete Unfolded\nProtein Response mechanism.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
