However, most existing\nvisualization tools are designed for individual motions and lack the features\nnecessary to facilitate robot motion comparison. In this paper, we utilize a\nrigorous design framework to develop Motion Comparator, a web-based tool that\nfacilitates the comprehension, comparison, and communication of robot motions.\nOur design process identified roboticists' needs, articulated design\nchallenges, and provided corresponding strategies. Motion Comparator includes\nseveral key features such as multi-view coordination, quaternion visualization,\ntime warping, and comparative designs. To demonstrate the applications of\nMotion Comparator, we discuss four case studies in which our tool is used for\nmotion selection, troubleshooting, parameter tuning, and motion review.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
