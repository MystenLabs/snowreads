Under some suitable assumptions on potential function $h$, for\n$p>2$, we first establish the existence of ground state solutions based on the\nNehari manifold. Subsequently, for $p>4$, we obtain the existence of ground\nstate sign-changing solutions by adopting constrained minimization arguments on\nthe sign-changing Nehari manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
