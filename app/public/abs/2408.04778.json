While context and task goals are vital, factors like user\npersonality traits could also influence method selection. Our study\ninvestigates using personality traits to predict user preferences among\ndecision trees, texts, and factor graphs. We trained a Machine Learning model\non responses to the Big Five personality test to predict preferences. Deploying\nthese predicted preferences in a navigation game (n=6), we found users more\nreceptive to personalized XAI recommendations, enhancing trust in the system.\nThis underscores the significance of customization in XAI interfaces, impacting\nuser engagement and confidence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
