This paper provides a\ncomprehensive review of methods for PD recognition using speech data,\nhighlighting advances in machine learning and data-driven approaches. We\ndiscuss the process of data wrangling, including data collection, cleaning,\ntransformation, and exploratory data analysis, to prepare the dataset for\nmachine learning applications. Various classification algorithms are explored,\nincluding logistic regression, SVM, and neural networks, with and without\nfeature selection. Each method is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and\ntraining time. Our findings indicate that specific acoustic features and\nadvanced machine-learning techniques can effectively differentiate between\nindividuals with PD and healthy controls. The study concludes with a comparison\nof the different models, identifying the most effective approaches for PD\nrecognition, and suggesting potential directions for future research.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
