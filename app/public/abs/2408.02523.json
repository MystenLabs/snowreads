On the other hand, studies on single polymer chain mechanics\nhave revealed that the elasticity of ultimately stretched polymer chains is\ndominated by the energetic contribution mainly originating from chemical bond\ndeformation. Here, we experimentally found that the elasticity of the\ndouble-network gel transits from the entropy-dominated one to the internal\nenergy-driven one with its uniaxial deformation through the thermodynamic\nanalysis. Based on this finding, we developed a simple mechanical model that\ntakes into account the energetic contribution and found that this model\napproximately reproduces the temperature dependence of the stress-strain curve\nof the double-network gel. This study demonstrates the importance of the\nchemical perspective in the mechanical analysis of highly deformed rubbery\npolymer networks.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
