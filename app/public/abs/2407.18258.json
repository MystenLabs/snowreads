This includes a study of the basic properties, as\n$G$-modules, of their $\\ell$-adic representations, Selmer groups, rational\npoints and Shafarevich-Tate groups. In particular, we show that\n$p^\\infty$-Selmer groups are self-dual $G$-modules, and give various\n`$G$-descent' results for Selmer groups and rational points. Along the way we\nrevisit, and slightly refine, a construction going back to Kani and Rosen for\nassociating isogenies to homomorphisms between permutation representations.\n  With a view to future applications, it is convenient to work throughout with\ncurves that are not assumed to be geometrically connected (or even connected);\nsuch curves arise naturally when taking Galois closures of covers of curves.\nFor lack of a suitable reference, we carefully detail how to deduce the\nrelevant properties of such curves and their Jacobians from the more standard\ngeometrically connected case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GjjyUzEHYaDm09KH5pLvgefkF9NdUk6HhC4LRSvUzjA","pdfSize":"400026"}
