Marcus theorem states that a strictly positive symmetric\nmatrix can be transformed into a doubly stochastic symmetric matrix by diagonal\nmatrices. However, in clustering, learning sparse matrices is crucial for\ncomputational efficiency. We extend Marcus theorem by proposing the Marcus\nmapping, which indicates that certain sparse matrices can also be transformed\ninto doubly stochastic symmetric matrices via diagonal matrices. Additionally,\nwe introduce rank constraints into the clustering problem and propose the\nDoubly Stochastic Adaptive Neighbors Clustering algorithm based on the Marcus\nMapping (ANCMM). This ensures that the learned graph naturally divides into the\ndesired number of clusters. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm\nthrough extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we\nexplore the relationship between the Marcus mapping and optimal transport. We\nprove that the Marcus mapping solves a specific type of optimal transport\nproblem and demonstrate that solving this problem through Marcus mapping is\nmore efficient than directly applying optimal transport methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
