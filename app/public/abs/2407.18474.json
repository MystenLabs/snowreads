The states are\nX-shaped and host pairs of identical populations while reducing the number of\ncoherences involved. A geometric L-measure of entanglement is introduced as the\ndistance between the points that represent entangled states and the closest\npoint that defines separable states. Our results give a geometric meaning to\nthe Hill-Wootters concurrence C since L coincides with C. Furthermore, unlike\nC, the measure L distinguishes the rank of states with maximum entanglement. We\nconstruct a time-dependent two-qubit state, traced out over the complementary\ncomponents of a pure tetra-partite system, and find that its one-qubit states\nshare the same entropy. The entanglement measure results bounded from above by\nthe envelope of the minima of such entropy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
