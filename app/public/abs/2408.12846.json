The dynamic behavior\nof the reconstructed model is thoroughly analyzed using the Hubble parameter\n$H(z)$ and various observational datasets. Our robust findings demonstrate that\nthe model displays quintessence behavior at the present epoch and converges to\nthe $\\Lambda$CDM model at late time. It is confirmed through comprehensive\nevaluations against energy conditions that the Null Energy Condition remains\npositive throughout cosmic evolution, and the Dominant Energy Condition is\nconsistently satisfied. The Strong Energy Condition is initially fulfilled in\nthe early Universe but violated in the late epoch. Moreover, scalar\nperturbations extensively assess stability, affirming the strength of the model\nwith respect to the Hubble parameter. This research offers compelling insights\ninto cosmic acceleration, suggesting that $f(Q)$ gravity can effectively\ndisplace the $\\Lambda$CDM model and provides a convincing alternative\nexplanation for the current accelerating expansion of the Universe without\nrelying on the cosmological constant.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
