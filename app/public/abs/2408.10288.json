In order to assist maintenance crews in their\nresponsiveness and task prioritization, a learning machine is developed and\ndeployed in production to suggest diagnostics to train technicians on their\nphones, tablets or laptops as soon as a train incident is declared. A feedback\nloop allows to take into account the actual diagnose by designated train\nmaintenance experts to refine the learning machine. By formulating the problem\nas a discrete set classification task, feature engineering methods are proposed\nto extract physically plausible sets of events from traces generated on-board\nrailway vehicles. The latter feed an original ensemble classifier to class\nincidents by their potential technical cause. Finally, the resulting model is\ntrained and validated using real operational data and deployed on a cloud\nplatform. Future work will explore how the extracted sets of events can be used\nto avoid incidents by assisting human experts in the creation predictive\nmaintenance alerts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
