Two-way quantum computers (2WQC) assume having both $|0\\rangle$\nand $\\langle 0|$ pre and postparation. In theory they allow to solve NP\nproblems, however, basic approach would be more difficult than Shor algorithm,\nwhich is now far from being practical. This article discusses approach to make\npractical 2WQC 3-SAT solver, requiring exponential reduction of error rate,\nwhat should be achievable through linear increase of the numbers of gates. 2WQC\nalso provides additional error correction capabilities, like more stable Grover\nalgorithm, or mid-circuit enforcement of syndrome to zero, like proposed\nequalizer enforcing qubit equality.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
