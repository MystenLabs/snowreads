The transient magnetic linear dichroism at the Co L2 edge and the\nmagnetic circular dichroism at the Fe L3 edge measured in reflection in a\npump-probe experiment with 120 fs temporal resolution show the loss of\nantiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic order in CoO and Fe, respectively, both\nwithin 300 fs after excitation with 60 fs light pulses of 800 and 400 nm\nwavelengths. Comparison to spin-dynamics simulations using an atomistic spin\nmodel shows that direct energy transfer from the laser-excited electrons in Fe\nto the magnetic moments in CoO provides the dominant demagnetization channel in\nthe case of 800-nm excitation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
