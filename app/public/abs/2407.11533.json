Following a century of research on the topic, it is\nstill unclear how low the discrepancy of point sets can go; in other words, how\nregularly distributed can points be in a given space. Recent insights using\noptimization and machine learning techniques have led to substantial\nimprovements in the construction of low-discrepancy point sets, resulting in\nconfigurations of much lower discrepancy values than previously known. Building\non the optimal constructions, we present a simple way to obtain\n$L_{\\infty}$-optimized placement of points that follow the same relative order\nas an (arbitrary) input set. Applying this approach to point sets in dimensions\n2 and 3 for up to 400 and 50 points, respectively, we obtain point sets whose\n$L_{\\infty}$ star discrepancies are up to 25% smaller than those of the\ncurrent-best sets, and around 50% better than classical constructions such as\nthe Fibonacci set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
