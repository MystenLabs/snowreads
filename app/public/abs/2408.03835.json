The number of XC functionals currently available is in the hundreds,\nif not thousands, and the majority of pseudopotentials have been generated for\nthe LDA and PBE. The objective of this study is to identify the error in the\ndetermination of the mechanical and structural properties (lattice constant,\ncohesive energy, elastic constants, and bulk modulus) of crystals calculated by\nDFT with such inconsistency. Additionally, the study aims to estimate the\nperformance of popular XC functionals (LDA, PBE, PBEsol, and SCAN) for these\ncalculations in a consistent manner.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V1gdTaRuw1IgdwatKTaB-1yzy4gdXvRQ4syq0-4vgEk","pdfSize":"317567"}
