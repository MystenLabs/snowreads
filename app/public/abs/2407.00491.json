The\nstochastic gravitational wave background is perhaps the most important current\nand future tool towards pinpointing the early Universe phenomenology related\nwith the inflationary era and the subsequent reheating era. Many mysteries are\ninherent to the stochastic spectrum so in this work we highlight the fact that\nthe complete understanding of early Universe physics and of astrophysical\nprocesses requires data from many distinct frequency band ranges. The\ncombination of these data will provide a deeper and better understanding of the\nphysics that forms the stochastic gravitational wave background, in both cases\nthat it is of cosmological or astrophysical origin. We also discuss how the\nreheating temperature may be determined by combining multi-band frequency data\nfrom gravitational wave experiments and we also discuss how the shape of the\ngravitational wave energy spectrum can help us better understand the physical\nprocesses that formed it.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
