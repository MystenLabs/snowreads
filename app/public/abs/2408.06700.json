To\nachieve this, we apply the recent method developed by A. Elduque and M.\nKochetov to the known classification of fine gradings up to equivalence on the\nsame superalgebras, which was obtained by C. Draper et al. in 2011. We also\nclassify gradings on the simple Lie superalgebra $A(1,1)$, whose automorphism\ngroup is different from the other members of the $A$ series.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CZKeyM39on7Oz3P7owEvCnH0s_gW9mNA-Nr2oqIm5qg","pdfSize":"459665"}
