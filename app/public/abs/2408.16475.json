We demonstrate\nanalytically that such a model gives rise to very strong first-order\nelectroweak phase tyransition through supercooling. We calculate the\ncorresponding gravitational wave signals due to bubble collisions during the\nphase transition. The produced gravitational waves can be detected by future\nspace-based gravitational wave detectors in the frequency range from $10^{-4}$\nHz to $0.1$ Hz.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
