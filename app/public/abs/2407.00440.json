The shape of the cross-section in the heterostructure can be\narbitrary designed, and we experimentally observed the distinctive cross-shaped\nfield pattern transport, non-reciprocal energy harvesting, and most\nimportantly, the remarkable ability of electromagnetic wave to traverse\nobstacles and abrupt structure changes without encountering reflections in 3D\nspace.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
