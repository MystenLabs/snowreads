In this paper, we prove this\nassertion and the following more general assertion: Let $\\mathcal R$ be either\nthe ordered $\\mathbb R$-vector space structure over $\\mathbb R$ or the ordered\ngroup of reals. A first-order expansion of $\\mathcal R$ by a countable subset\n$D$ of $\\mathbb R$ and a compact subset $E$ of $\\mathbb R$ of finite\nCantor-Bendixson rank is d-minimal if $(\\mathcal R,D)$ is locally o-minimal.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
