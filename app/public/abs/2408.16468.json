Our analysis introduces newly\ncharacterized conditions on the interaction kernel that ensure the local\nasymptotic stability of the unique steady state. Compared to previous works on\nthis topic, our results allow for large, singular and non-symmetric\ninteractions. As a corollary of our main results, we show exponential decay of\nsolutions to the Vlasov-Poisson-Fokker-Planck equation in dimension $3$, for\nlow regularity initial data. In the repulsive case, the result holds in\nstrongly nonlinear regimes (\\emph{i.e.} for arbitrarily small Debye length).\nOur techniques rely on the design of new Lyapunov functionals based on\nhypocoercivity and hypoellipticity theories. We use norms which include part of\nthe interaction kernel, and carefully mix ``macroscopic quantities\nbased''--hypocoercivity with ``commutators based''--hypocoercivity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
