To tackle this limitation, we introduce a generic AI\nsystem, namely MUSES, for 3D-controllable image generation from user queries.\nSpecifically, our MUSES addresses this challenging task by developing a\nprogressive workflow with three key components, including (1) Layout Manager\nfor 2D-to-3D layout lifting, (2) Model Engineer for 3D object acquisition and\ncalibration, (3) Image Artist for 3D-to-2D image rendering. By mimicking the\ncollaboration of human professionals, this multi-modal agent pipeline\nfacilitates the effective and automatic creation of images with 3D-controllable\nobjects, through an explainable integration of top-down planning and bottom-up\ngeneration. Additionally, we find that existing benchmarks lack detailed\ndescriptions of complex 3D spatial relationships of multiple objects. To fill\nthis gap, we further construct a new benchmark of T2I-3DisBench (3D image\nscene), which describes diverse 3D image scenes with 50 detailed prompts.\nExtensive experiments show the state-of-the-art performance of MUSES on both\nT2I-CompBench and T2I-3DisBench, outperforming recent strong competitors such\nas DALL-E 3 and Stable Diffusion 3. These results demonstrate a significant\nstep of MUSES forward in bridging natural language, 2D image generation, and 3D\nworld.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
