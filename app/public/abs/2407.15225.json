The monolithically integrated microelectrodes are designed for\nwaveguides phase modulation and wavelength tunning. Experiments show that the\nfabricated electro-optically controlled TFLN AWG has a channel spacing of 200\nGHz and a wavelength tuning efficiency of 10 pm/V.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
