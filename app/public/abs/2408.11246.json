The QCD color group $SU(3)_c$ is\nembedded into a larger, simple gauge group (grand-color) where one of the\nmassless, colored fermions enjoys an anomalous chiral symmetry, rendering the\nstrong CP phase unphysical. The grand-color gauge group $G_{\\rm GC}$ is Higgsed\ndown to $SU(3)_c\\times G_{c'}$, after which $G_{c'}$ eventually confines at a\nlower scale, spontaneously breaking the chiral symmetry and generating a real,\npositive mass to the massless, colored fermion. Since the chiral symmetry has a\n$G_{c'}$ anomaly, there is no corresponding light Nambu-Goldstone boson. The\nanomalous chiral symmetry can be an accidental symmetry that arises from an\nexact discrete symmetry without introducing a domain wall problem. Potential\nexperimental signals of our mechanism include vector-like quarks near the TeV\nscale, pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons below the 10 GeV scale, light dark matter\ndecay, and primordial gravitational waves from the new strong dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
