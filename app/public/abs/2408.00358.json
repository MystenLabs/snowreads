The self-consistent coupling of quasilocal\ngravitational energy and angular momentum leads to a modified Poisson equation.\nThe coupled equations of motion of the effective fluid elements are also\nmodified, with quasilocal angular momentum and frame-dragging leading to novel\ndynamics. The solutions of the full system reproduce the phenonomenology of\ncollisionless dark matter for disc galaxies, offering an explanation for their\nobserved rotation curves. Halos of abundant cold dark matter particles are not\nrequired.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
