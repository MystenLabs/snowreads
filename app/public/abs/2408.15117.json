We\npropose a unified framework based on urban vitality theory and multi-source\ndata, validated by various data sources. We derived 8841 natural cities\nglobally with an area over 5 square kiloxmeters and divided each into new urban\nareas (developed after 2005) and old urban areas (developed before 2005). Urban\nvitality was gauged using the density of road networks, points of interest\n(POIs), and population density with 1 km resolution across morphological,\nfunctional, and social dimensions. By comparing urban vitality in new and old\nurban areas, we quantify the ghost cities index (GCI) globally using the theory\nof urban vitality for the first time. The results reveal that the vitality of\nnew urban areas is 7.69% that of old ones. The top 5% (442) of cities were\ndesignated as ghost cities, a finding mirrored by news media and other\nresearch. This study sheds light on strategies for sustainable global\nurbanization, crucial for the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
