As part of the\nproject, novel bias detection methods to identify societal bias in language\nmodels and word embeddings in European languages are developed, with particular\nattention to linguistic and geographic particularities. This technical report\ndescribes the overall architecture and components of the BIAS Detection\nFramework. The code described in this technical report is available and will be\nupdated and expanded continuously with upcoming results from the BIAS project.\nThe details about the datasets for the different languages are described in\ncorresponding papers at scientific venues.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H91vQRGy9_q1GR97o0DFfbwcuC20EG9hVURQQwSjcLQ","pdfSize":"475535"}
