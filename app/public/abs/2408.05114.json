These images map the molecular outflow and disk of\nOrion Source I (SrcI) on ~12 to 20 AU scales. Our observations show that the\nflow of material around SrcI creates a turbulent boundary layer in the outflow\nfrom SrcI which may dissipate angular momentum in the rotating molecular\noutflow into the surrounding medium. Additionally, the data suggests that the\nproper motion of SrcI may have a significant effect on the structure and\nevolution of SrcI and its molecular outflow. As the motion of SrcI funnels\nmaterial between the disk and the outflow, some material may be entrained into\nthe outflow and accrete onto the disk, creating shocks which excite the NaCl\nclose to the disk surface.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
