Making use of data, especially new or\nunfamiliar data, therefore requires a degree of trust or verification. How is\nthis trust established? In this paper, we present the results of a series of\ninterviews with both producers and consumers of data artifacts (outputs of data\necosystems like spreadsheets, charts, and dashboards) aimed at understanding\nstrategies and obstacles to building trust in data. We find a recurring need,\nbut lack of existing standards, for data validation and verification,\nespecially among data consumers. We therefore propose a set of data guards:\nmethods and tools for fostering trust in data artifacts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1_OCccnbOEDPbYPXOcLtxggHn9yxd23Z01eHqpf-vYk","pdfSize":"1547283"}
