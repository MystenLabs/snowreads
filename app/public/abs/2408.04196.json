In characteristic zero, we\nobtain in addition a general exact formula for the growth rate and give a\ncomplete solution to the growth problems in terms of the character table. We\nalso provide code used to compute our formulas.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
