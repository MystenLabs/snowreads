Our primary goal is to generate gates that\nare approximately leakage-free and equivalent to the controlled-NOT (CNOT) gate\nup to single-qubit operations. These gates belong to the local equivalence\nclass [CNOT]. Additionally, we explore which local equivalence classes of\ntwo-qubit operations can be naturally generated by braiding Fibonacci anyons.\nWe discovered that most of the generated classes are located near the edges of\nthe Weyl chamber representation of two-qubit gates, specifically between the\nlocal equivalence classes of the identity [1] and [CNOT], and between those of\nthe double-controlled-NOT [DCNOT] and [SWAP]. Furthermore, we found a\nnumerically exact implementation of a local equivalent of the SWAP gate using a\nsequence of only nine elements from the Fibonacci braiding gate set.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
