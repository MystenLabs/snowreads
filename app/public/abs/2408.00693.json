In order to\nunderstand the phenomenon, we analyze the convergence using the Vandermonde\nmatrix which is defined using the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix.\nAlthough eigenvalues alone cannot explain the convergence, they may provide an\nupper bound of the residual, together with the right hand side vector and the\neigenvectors. For the diagonalizable case, if the eigenvalues of the\ncoefficient matrix are clustered, the upper bound of the convergence curve\nshows superlinear convergence, when the norm of the matrix obtained by\ndecomposing the right hand side vector into the eigenvector components is not\nso large. We especially analyze the effect of inner-iteration preconditioning\nfor least squares problems, where the eigenvalues cluster towards 1.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
