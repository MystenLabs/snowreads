While increasing biomedical tasks have\nemployed state-of-the-art language models, there are very few studies have\nexamined temporal effects on biomedical models when data usually shifts across\ndevelopment and deployment. This study fills the gap by statistically probing\nrelations between language model performance and data shifts across three\nbiomedical tasks. We deploy diverse metrics to evaluate model performance,\ndistance methods to measure data drifts, and statistical methods to quantify\ntemporal effects on biomedical language models. Our study shows that time\nmatters for deploying biomedical language models, while the degree of\nperformance degradation varies by biomedical tasks and statistical\nquantification approaches. We believe this study can establish a solid\nbenchmark to evaluate and assess temporal effects on deploying biomedical\nlanguage models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
