The precession of orbital and spin\nangular momenta in binary black hole (BBH) systems with misaligned spins\npresents a complex challenge for gravitational waveform modelling. Current\nprecessing BBH waveform models employ a co-precessing frame, which precesses\nalong with the binary. In this paper, we investigate a source of bias stemming\nfrom the mismodelling of ringdown frequency in the co-precessing frame. We find\nthat this mismodelling of the co-precessing frame ringdown frequency introduces\nsystematic biases in parameter estimation, for high mass systems in particular,\nand in the Inspiral-Merger-Ringdown (IMR)-consistency test of general\nrelativity. Employing the waveform model IMRPhenomXPHM, we conduct an\nIMR-consistency test using a Fisher matrix analysis across parameter space, as\nwell as full injected signal parameter estimation studies. Our results show\nthat this mismodelling particularly affects BBH systems with high mass ratios,\nhigh spin magnitudes, and highly inclined spins. These findings suggest\ninconsistencies for all waveform models which do not address this issue.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
