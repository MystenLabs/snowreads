To bridge the two worlds, we propose a framework to seamlessly\nsynergize Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and science. The framework\nhighlights KANs' usage for three aspects of scientific discovery: identifying\nrelevant features, revealing modular structures, and discovering symbolic\nformulas. The synergy is bidirectional: science to KAN (incorporating\nscientific knowledge into KANs), and KAN to science (extracting scientific\ninsights from KANs). We highlight major new functionalities in the pykan\npackage: (1) MultKAN: KANs with multiplication nodes. (2) kanpiler: a KAN\ncompiler that compiles symbolic formulas into KANs. (3) tree converter: convert\nKANs (or any neural networks) to tree graphs. Based on these tools, we\ndemonstrate KANs' capability to discover various types of physical laws,\nincluding conserved quantities, Lagrangians, symmetries, and constitutive laws.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NrmCvsa_Qv5Py8aWp30NFGeCY3B9FbIza7tu2qeEjcU","pdfSize":"9229108"}
