While Graph Neural Ordinary Differential Equations\n(GNODE) are effective in learning node representations, they fail to quantify\nuncertainty. To address this, we introduce Latent Graph Neural Stochastic\nDifferential Equations (LGNSDE), which enhance GNODE by embedding randomness\nthrough Brownian motion to quantify uncertainty. We provide theoretical\nguarantees for LGNSDE and empirically show better performance in uncertainty\nquantification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
