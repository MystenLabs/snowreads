Specifically, we introduce Preference-Based Abstract\nArgumentation for Case-Based Reasoning (which we call AA-CBR-P), allowing users\nto define multiple approaches to compare cases with an ordering that specifies\ntheir preference over these comparison approaches. We prove that the model\ninherently follows these preferences when making predictions and show that\nprevious abstract argumentation for case-based reasoning approaches are\ninsufficient at expressing preferences over constituents of an argument. We\nthen demonstrate how this can be applied to a real-world medical dataset\nsourced from a clinical trial evaluating differing assessment methods of\npatients with a primary brain tumour. We show empirically that our approach\noutperforms other interpretable machine learning models on this dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-OTk8jrZfYj4u-F15ulHeXjZQRvSwjWw0gEHEtF1IMg","pdfSize":"490886"}
