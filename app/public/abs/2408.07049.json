We develop a toppling procedure that gradually builds an\nenvironment that can be used to show that activity will be sustained for a long\ntime. This yields a self-contained and relatively short proof of existence of a\nslow phase for arbitrarily large sleep rates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
