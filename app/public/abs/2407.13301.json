This study\nintroduces Chain-of-Diagnosis (CoD) to enhance the interpretability of\nLLM-based medical diagnostics. CoD transforms the diagnostic process into a\ndiagnostic chain that mirrors a physician's thought process, providing a\ntransparent reasoning pathway. Additionally, CoD outputs the disease confidence\ndistribution to ensure transparency in decision-making. This interpretability\nmakes model diagnostics controllable and aids in identifying critical symptoms\nfor inquiry through the entropy reduction of confidences. With CoD, we\ndeveloped DiagnosisGPT, capable of diagnosing 9604 diseases. Experimental\nresults demonstrate that DiagnosisGPT outperforms other LLMs on diagnostic\nbenchmarks. Moreover, DiagnosisGPT provides interpretability while ensuring\ncontrollability in diagnostic rigor.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
