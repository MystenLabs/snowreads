However, the complexity of the surrounding\nanatomical structures and the scarcity of annotated data pose significant\nchallenges. This study introduces a novel lymph node synthesis technique aimed\nat generating diverse and realistic synthetic rectal lymph node samples to\nmitigate the reliance on manual annotation. Unlike direct diffusion methods,\nwhich often produce masks that are discontinuous and of suboptimal quality, our\napproach leverages an implicit SDF-based method for mask generation, ensuring\nthe production of continuous, stable, and morphologically diverse masks.\nExperimental results demonstrate that our synthetic data significantly improves\nsegmentation performance. Our work highlights the potential of diffusion model\nfor accurately synthesizing structurally complex lesions, such as lymph nodes\nin rectal cancer, alleviating the challenge of limited annotated data in this\nfield and aiding in advancements in rectal cancer diagnosis and treatment.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
