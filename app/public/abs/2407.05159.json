The currently proposed FDA\nme\\-thods can often encounter challenges, especially when dealing with curves\nof varying shapes. This can largely be attributed to the method's strong\ndependence on data approximation as a key aspect of the analysis process. In\nthis work, we propose a free knots spline estimation method for functional data\nwith two penalty terms and demonstrate its performance by comparing the results\nof several clustering methods on simulated and real data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
