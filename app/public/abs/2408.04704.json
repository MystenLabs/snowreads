This\nanalysis investigates the Hawking temperature, remnant radius and mass, as well\nas the effect of parameter $\\xi$ on thermodynamic quantities like entropy, heat\ncapacity, and free energy. The emission rate, evaporation process, quasi-normal\nmodes by calculating Rosen-Morse potential, and topological behavior of the\nblack hole are also explored.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
