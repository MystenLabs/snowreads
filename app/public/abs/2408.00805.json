The resultant formula $f(x)$ is also found\nto coincide with that of the discrete derivative of the sorted sequence of\nfixed points of the reflection operator on even binary palindromes of fixed\neven length \\textit{2k} in any interval $[0\\cdots2^{2k}-1]$. A set of\nequivalent reformulations of the problem are also presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
