Recently, deep learning-based inversion\ntechniques have garnered significant attention due to their capability to\nelucidate intricate non-linear relationships between geophysical data and model\nparameters. Nevertheless, these methods face challenges such as limited\ntraining data availability and the generation of geologically inconsistent\nsolutions. These concerns can be mitigated through the integration of a\nphysics-informed approach. Moreover, the quantification of prediction\nuncertainty is crucial yet often overlooked in deep learning-based inversion\nmethodologies. In this study, we utilized Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)\nbased Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) to invert both synthetic and\nfield Schlumberger sounding data while also estimating prediction uncertainty\nvia Monte Carlo dropout. For both synthetic and field case studies, the median\nprofile estimated by PINNs is comparable to the results from existing\nliterature, while also providing uncertainty estimates. Therefore, PINNs\ndemonstrate significant potential for broader applications in near-surface\ncharacterization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
