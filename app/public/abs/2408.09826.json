Such non-Hermitian lattices are promising paradigms for\nengineering exotic light-matter interactions which benefit from the intrinsic\nchirality and unconventional (non-Bloch) band theory. Here we study a series of\nunconventional light-matter interactions between quantum emitters and the\nprototypical Hatano--Nelson model as well as an extended lattice model dubbed\nthe bosonic Kitaev chain. We focus on the robustness of the dynamics to various\nimperfections and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. We consider both small\nemitters, which interact with the lattice at single sites, and giant emitters\ncoupling at multiple sites. The latter exhibit an exclusive amplification\nmechanism, which we find enables decoherence-free dynamics even in the presence\nof extra dissipation in the system. The protection from dissipation arises from\na cooperation of the non-Hermiticity and the self-interference effect, and is\ntherefore lacking for small emitters. These results not only provides a deeper\ninsight into the interplay of non-Hermiticity and various interference effects,\nbut also have potential applications in engineering exotic spin Hamiltonians\nand quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FFyTinbLwd2vDUKqNCH1VJSyhyeC-iWSnkKO-28wZS4","pdfSize":"2135502"}
