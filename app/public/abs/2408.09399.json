The triangular\nmaximally filtered graph (TMFG) method, when combined with the directed bubble\nhierarchy tree (DBHT) method, defines a useful algorithm for hierarchical data\nclustering. This combined TMFG-DBHT algorithm has been shown to produce\nclusters with good accuracy for time series data, but the previous\nstate-of-the-art parallel algorithm has limited parallelism. This paper\npresents an improved parallel algorithm for TMFG-DBHT. Our algorithm increases\nthe amount of parallelism by aggregating the bulk of the work of TMFG\nconstruction together to reduce the overheads of parallelism. Furthermore, our\nTMFG algorithm updates information lazily, which reduces the overall work. We\nfind further speedups by computing all-pairs shortest paths approximately\ninstead of exactly in DBHT. We show experimentally that our algorithm gives a\n3.7--10.7x speedup over the previous state-of-the-art TMFG-DBHT implementation,\nwhile preserving clustering accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vw5YyfaqQEiC_FQM8hBuJnChdNpmgu8VQTASpF4vxsc","pdfSize":"988542"}
