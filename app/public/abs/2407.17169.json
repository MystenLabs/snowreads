The\nactionable knowledge representation system that we have created for this\npurpose is called KnowTD. It is based on an ontology of thermodynamics that\nrepresents knowledge of thermodynamic theory, material properties, and\nthermodynamic problems. The ontology is coupled with a reasoner that sets up\nthe problem to be solved based on user input, extracts the correct, pertinent\nequations from the ontology, solves the resulting mathematical problem, and\nreturns the solution to the user, together with an explanation of how it was\nobtained. KnowTD is presently limited to simple thermodynamic problems, similar\nto those discussed in an introductory course in Engineering Thermodynamics.\nThis covers the basic theory and working principles of thermodynamics. KnowTD\nis designed in a modular way and is easily extendable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XR3VbIJ-zUGwzXoaVWwfo_-7CDReG0DLdHCXh7FMrhY","pdfSize":"738928"}
