Some relevant qualitative and quantitative facts concerning such\nproblems and their solutions are described. In particular a precise\ncharacterization of the behaviour of suitable approximating solution is\nprovided. Of particular (and independent) interest is the study of an\nassociated ODE for which, we prove existence, uniqueness and comparison\nresults. As a consequence of our arguments, a delicate stability result as well\na quite unexpected multiplicity result is shown for problems as in\n\\eqref{intro}.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
