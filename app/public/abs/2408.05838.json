The proposed method integrates risk awareness and\ntrajectory planning by leveraging probabilistic models to evaluate the\nlikelihood of collisions with dynamic and static obstacles. The RALTPER focuses\non collision avoidance constraints for both the ego vehicle region and the\nGaussian-obstacle risk region. Additionally, this work enhances the\ngeneralization of both vehicle and obstacle models, making the planner\nadaptable to a wider range of scenarios. Our approach formulates the planning\nproblem as a nonlinear optimization, solved using the IPOPT solver within the\nCasADi environment. The planner is evaluated through simulations of various\nchallenging scenarios, including complex, static, mixed environment and narrow\nsingle-lane avoidance of pedestrians. Results demonstrate that RALTPER achieves\nsafer and more efficient trajectory planning particularly in navigating narrow\nareas where a more accurate vehicle profile representation is critical for\navoiding collisions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
