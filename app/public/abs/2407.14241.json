This mechanism, referred to as dressing, has been observed in the\ncontext of light-matter interaction in systems as varied as atoms, molecules\nand solid-state qubits. In this work, we demonstrate state dressing in a\nsemiconductor quantum dot tunnel-coupled to a charge reservoir. We observe the\nemergence of a Floquet ladder of states in the system's high-frequency\nelectrical response, manifesting as interference fringes at the multiphoton\nresonances despite the system lacking an avoided crossing. We study the dressed\nquantum dot while changing reservoir temperature, charge lifetime, and\nexcitation amplitude and reveal the fundamental nature of the mechanism by\ndeveloping a theory based on the quantum dynamics of the Floquet ladder, which\nis in excellent agreement with the data. Furthermore, we show how the technique\nfinds applications in the accurate electrostatic characterisation of\nsemiconductor quantum dots.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
