Today,\nthreats in cyberspace have evolved to a level where conventional methods of\ndefense are usually inadequate. This paper highlights the significance of\npredictive analytics and demonstrates its potential in enhancing cyber security\nframeworks. This research integrates literature on using big data analytics for\npredictive analytics in cyber security, noting that such systems could\noutperform conventional methods in identifying advanced cyber threats. This\nreview can be used as a framework for future research on predictive models and\nthe possibilities of implementing them into the cyber security frameworks. The\nstudy uses quantitative research, using a dataset from Kaggle with 2000\ninstances of network traffic and security events. Logistic regression and\ncluster analysis were used to analyze the data, with statistical tests\nconducted using SPSS. The findings show that predictive analytics enhance the\nvigilance of threats and response time. This paper advocates for predictive\nanalytics as an essential component for developing preventative cyber security\nstrategies, improving threat identification, and aiding decision-making\nprocesses. The practical implications and potential real-world applications of\nthe findings are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
