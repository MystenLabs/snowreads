In this vein, we\ngeneralize Alladi's series expansion for the product generating function of\n$\\mypod(n)$ and show that Andrews' generalization of G\\\"ollnitz-Gordon\nidentities coincides with the number of partitions into parts simultaneously\n$s$-congruent and $t$-distinct (parts appearing fewer than $t$ times).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
