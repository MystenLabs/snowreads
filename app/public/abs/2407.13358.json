These\nrepresentations can be used for many NLP tasks, such as author identification\nand classification, or in recommendation systems. A strong limitation of\nexisting works is that they do not explicitly capture writing style, making\nthem hardly applicable to literary data. We therefore propose a new\narchitecture based on Variational Information Bottleneck (VIB) that learns\nembeddings for both authors and documents with a stylistic constraint. Our\nmodel fine-tunes a pre-trained document encoder. We stimulate the detection of\nwriting style by adding predefined stylistic features making the representation\naxis interpretable with respect to writing style indicators. We evaluate our\nmethod on three datasets: a literary corpus extracted from the Gutenberg\nProject, the Blog Authorship Corpus and IMDb62, for which we show that it\nmatches or outperforms strong/recent baselines in authorship attribution while\ncapturing much more accurately the authors stylistic aspects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"liJCHzXYQmCyE6--ykiZlnre8Sa90pT9WW0yzMgnBFU","pdfSize":"945189"}
