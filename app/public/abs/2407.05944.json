However, in recent years, alternative avenues to tackle\nthis problem are being explored by researchers because of its direct\napplication in the arena of cryptography. One of such applications is the\ncryptanalysis of RSA numbers, which requires prime factorization of large\nsemiprimes. Based on numerical experiments, this paper proposes a conjecture on\nthe distribution of digits on prime of infinite length. This paper infuses the\ntheoretical understanding of primes to optimize the search space of prime\nfactors by shrinking it upto 98.15%, which, in terms of application, has shown\n26.50% increase in the success rate and 41.91% decrease of the maximum number\nof generations required by the genetic algorithm used traditionally in the\nliterature. This paper also introduces a variation of the genetic algorithm\nnamed Sieve Method that is fine-tuned for factorization of big semi-primes,\nwhich was able to factor numbers up to 23 decimal digits with 84% success rate.\nOur findings shows that sieve methods on average has achieved 321.89% increase\nin success rate and 64.06% decrement in the maximum number of generations\nrequired for the algorithm to converge compared to the existing literatures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
