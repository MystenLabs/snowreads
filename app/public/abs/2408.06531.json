The optimal complexity of the scheme is in\n$O({\\varepsilon}^{-5/2})$, ${\\varepsilon} > 0$ being a prescribed accuracy,\nwhich is suboptimal when compared to the canonical multilevel Monte Carlo\nperformance. This suboptimality stems from the discontinuity of the Heaviside\nfunction involved in the biased stochastic gradient that is recursively\nevaluated to derive the value-at-risk. To mitigate this issue, this paper\nproposes and analyzes a multilevel stochastic approximation algorithm that\nadaptively selects the number of inner samples at each level, and proves that\nits optimal complexity is in $O({\\varepsilon}^{-2}|\\ln {\\varepsilon}|^{5/2})$.\nOur theoretical analysis is exemplified through numerical experiments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Mathematics/Probability","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
