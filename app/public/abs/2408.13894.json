Its simple\nexplanation can lead to further questions, not only the one posed in the title,\nbut also questions such as why the simple model that considers only light\npassing just outside the spherical object is successful. The Huygens-Fresnel\ndiffraction model is applied to answer these questions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HZmzHT8NbBNugYmgjKFNcD2mM-srA71sVg7ORBVnVHQ","pdfSize":"3191197"}
