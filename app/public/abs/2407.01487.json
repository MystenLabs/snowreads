We extend this intrinsically\nrelativistic method into the non-relativistic domain, demonstrating its use to\ncalculate the quasinormal modes of the Schr\\\"odinger equation and solve related\nbound-state problems. We also describe how to further generalize this method,\noffering a perspective on the importance of non-relativistic quasinormal modes\nfor the programme of black hole spectroscopy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
