Currently, most modeling\nmethods for slope failure analysis excel at one of these two but are deficient\nin the other. For example, the Finite Element Method (FEM) models the\ninitiation of instability well but quickly loses accuracy when modeling large\ndeformations because of mesh distortion, restricting its ability to predict\nrunout. Conversely, the Material Point Method (MPM) utilizes material points\nwhich move freely across a background grid, allowing for indefinite\ndeformations without computational issues. However, MPM is restricted in its\nability to model slope failure initiation due to limitations of the available\nboundary conditions and reduced accuracy of its stress distributions. The\nsequential hybridization of these two methods, initiating a model in FEM and\nthen transferring to MPM, presents an opportunity to accurately capture both\ninitiation and runout by a single model. The exact time for this transfer is\nnot self-apparent, but it must be conducted after the initiation mechanism and\nbefore excessive mesh distortion. By simulating two granular column failures\nand two slope failures, we demonstrate the effectiveness of this hybrid FEM-MPM\nmethod and identify the appropriate time to transfer.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
