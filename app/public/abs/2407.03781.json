Since the number\nof financial assets grows while the estimation window length remains of limited\nsize, the often used sample estimator yields noisy estimates which are not even\npositive definite. Under the assumption of latent factor models, the covariance\nmatrix is decomposed into a common low-rank component and a full-rank\nidiosyncratic component. In this paper we focus on the estimation of the\nidiosyncratic component, under the assumption of a grouped structure of the\ntime series, which may arise due to specific factors such as industries, asset\nclasses or countries. We propose a generalized methodology for estimation of\nthe block-diagonal idiosyncratic component by clustering the residual series\nand applying shrinkage to the obtained blocks in order to ensure positive\ndefiniteness. We derive two different estimators based on different clustering\nmethods and test their performance using simulation and historical data. The\nproposed methods are shown to provide reliable estimates and outperform other\nstate-of-the-art estimators based on thresholding methods.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
