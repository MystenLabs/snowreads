Despite the\ncommon misconception, the original algorithm is indeed applicable to\nnon-diagonalizable matrices, with diagonalisation primarily serving for\ntheoretical analyses to establish bounds on condition number and solution\nerror. By leveraging basic estimates from [Kro23], we derive bounds comparable\nto those outlined in the Krovi algorithm, thereby reinstating the advantages of\nthe BCOW approach. Furthermore, we extend the BCOW algorithm to address\ntime-dependent linear differential equations by transforming non-autonomous\nsystems into higher-dimensional autonomous ones, a technique also applicable\nfor the Krovi algorithm.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"D5z8dWMM7exNiey7HBc6SRfDKc4h_K8V7as3dcDL4ro","pdfSize":"244573"}
