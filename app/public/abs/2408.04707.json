For $n\\ge 14$ and\n$g\\le 2\\lfloor{n/2}\\rfloor+1$ every such homomorphism is either cyclic, or it\nmaps standard generators of the braid group to either distinct Dehn twists, or\ndistinct crosscap transpositions, possibly multiplied by the same element of\nthe centralizer of the image.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
