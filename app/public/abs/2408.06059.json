The\ncomputation progresses by measurements of a pre-prepared resource state\ntogether with corrections of undesired outcomes via applications of Pauli gates\nto yet unmeasured qubits. The fundamental question of this model is determining\nwhether computation can be implemented deterministically. Pauli flow is one of\nthe most general structures guaranteeing determinism. It is also essential for\npolynomial time ancilla-free circuit extraction. It is known how to efficiently\ndetermine the existence of Pauli flow given an open graph together with a\nmeasurement labelling (a choice of measurements to be performed).\n  In this work, we focus on the problem of deciding the existence of Pauli flow\nfor a given open graph when the measurement labelling is unknown. We show that\nthis problem is in RP by providing a random polynomial time algorithm. To do\nit, we extend previous algebraic interpretations of Pauli flow, by showing\nthat, in the case of X and Z measurements only, flow existence corresponds to\nthe right-invertibility of a matrix derived from the adjacency matrix. We also\nuse this interpretation to show that the number of output qubits can always be\nreduced to match the number of input qubits while preserving the existence of\nflow.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
