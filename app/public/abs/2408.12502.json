The\nanalyzed representative case is where, in the presence of a significant spatial\ngradient of the electron pressure and of a sheared magnetic field\nconfiguration, an alternating magnetic field reconnection process can develop\nassociated with the anisotropy of the fluctuating electron temperature. The\nrelevant process is intrinsically different from that known as the Biermann\nBattery which does not involve magnetic reconnection and requires that the\nunperturbed spatial gradient of the (isotropic) electron temperature be\nmisaligned relative to that of the density gradient.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
