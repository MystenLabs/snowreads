These two facts open the question of how 3D\nmodels can support 3D LiDAR long-term SLAM in indoor, GPS-denied environments.\nThis paper proposes a methodology that leverages BIM models to create an\nupdated map of indoor environments with sequential LiDAR measurements. Session\ndata (pose graph-based map and descriptors) are initially generated from BIM\nmodels. Then, real-world data is aligned with the session data from the model\nusing multi-session anchoring while minimizing the drift on the real-world\ndata. Finally, the new elements not present in the BIM model are identified,\ngrouped, and reconstructed in a surface representation, allowing a better\nvisualization next to the BIM model. The framework enables the creation of a\ncoherent map aligned with the BIM model that does not require prior knowledge\nof the initial pose of the robot, and it does not need to be inside the map.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
