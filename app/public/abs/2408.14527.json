In this paper, we\nconsider a realistic problem of online order delivery in a warehouse, where a\nfleet of robots bring the products belonging to each order from shelves to\nworkstations. This creates a stream of inter-dependent pickup and delivery\ntasks and the associated MAPF problem consists of computing realistic\ncollision-free robot trajectories fulfilling these tasks. To solve this MAPF\nproblem, we propose an extension of the standard Prioritized Planning algorithm\nto deal with the inter-dependent tasks (Interleaved Prioritized Planning) and a\nnovel Via-Point Star (VP*) algorithm to compute an optimal dynamics-compliant\nrobot trajectory to visit a sequence of goal locations while avoiding moving\nobstacles. We prove the completeness of our approach and evaluate it in\nsimulation as well as in a real warehouse.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
