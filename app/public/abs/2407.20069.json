Leveraging quantum computation, we present an efficient\nalgorithm using the Szegedy quantum walk and quantum phase estimation (QPE).\nOur algorithm, which takes the number of nodes and the adjacency matrix as\ninput, constructs a quantum walk operator and applies QPE to estimate its\neigenvalues. These eigenvalues reveal the graph's structural properties,\nenabling us to determine its completeness. We establish a relationship between\nthe number of nodes in a complete graph and the number of marked nodes,\noptimizing the success probability and running time. The time complexity of our\nalgorithm is $\\mathcal{O}(\\log^2n)$, where $n$ is the number of nodes of the\ngraph. offering a clear quantum advantage over classical methods. This approach\nis useful in network structure analysis, evaluating classical routing\nalgorithms, and assessing systems based on pairwise comparisons.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
