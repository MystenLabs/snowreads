However, when applied to tasks\nlacking periodicity, such as stock data prediction, the effectiveness and\nrobustness of STGNNs are found to be unsatisfactory. And STGNNs are limited by\nmemory savings so that cannot handle problems with a large number of nodes. In\nthis paper, we propose a novel approach called the Temporal-Correlation Graph\nPre-trained Network (TCGPN) to address these limitations. TCGPN utilize\nTemporal-correlation fusion encoder to get a mixed representation and\npre-training method with carefully designed temporal and correlation\npre-training tasks. Entire structure is independent of the number and order of\nnodes, so better results can be obtained through various data enhancements. And\nmemory consumption during training can be significantly reduced through\nmultiple sampling. Experiments are conducted on real stock market data sets\nCSI300 and CSI500 that exhibit minimal periodicity. We fine-tune a simple MLP\nin downstream tasks and achieve state-of-the-art results, validating the\ncapability to capture more robust temporal correlation patterns.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Finance/Statistical Finance","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
