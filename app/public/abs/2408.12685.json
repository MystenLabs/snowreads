This approach to MBL is underpinned by mapping the dynamics of the\nmany-body system onto that of a fictitious single particle on the\nhigh-dimensional, correlated and disordered Fock-space graph; yet, as we\nelaborate, the problem is fundamentally different from that of conventional\nAnderson localisation on high-dimensional or hierarchical graphs. We discuss in\ndetail the nature of eigenstate correlations on the Fock space, both static and\ndynamic, and in the ergodic and many-body localised phases as well as in the\nvicinity of the MBL transition. The latter in turn sheds light on the nature of\nthe transition, and motivates a scaling theory for it in terms of Fock-space\nbased quantities. We also illustrate how these quantities can be concretely\nconnected to real-space observables. An overview is given of several analytical\nand numerical techniques which have proven important in developing a\ncomprehensive picture. Finally, we comment on some open questions in the field\nof MBL where the Fock-space approach is likely to prove insightful.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
