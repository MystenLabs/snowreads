However, results from\nresearch into undergraduate physics laboratory courses is often difficult to\ncompare due to the broad variations in courses. We have created a survey to\nhelp classify these courses to compare and contrast them, which will be useful\nin two key endeavours: comparisons between PER studies and providing useful\ndata for individual instructors hoping to improve their courses, thus providing\ninformation relevant to both researchers and instructors. While we are still in\nthe process of collecting sufficient data to create a full taxonomy of\nlaboratory courses, we present here details of the survey creation itself, as\nwell as a first look at the data collected, which includes a broad landscape of\nlab courses in 41 countries. We used both quantitative and qualitative methods\nin analyzing the data collected. Some of these results include similarities\nbetween courses, such as students often using pre-constructed apparatuses and\nthat instructors hope for students to learn technical skills. We also find\ndifferences in courses, such as in the number and types of goals of the course,\nas well as the activities students participate in.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
