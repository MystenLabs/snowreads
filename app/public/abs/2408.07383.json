Our prescription makes explicit use of the freedom to choose the number\nof active flavors at a given scale and, thus, use coexisting PDFs with\ndifferent active flavor number. This new prescription is perturbatively\nequivalent to the former but improves the implementation in two ways. First, it\ncan be naturally generalized to account simultaneously for multiple heavy quark\neffects, such as charm and bottom effects, which can both be relevant at the\nsame scale due to the small mass difference. Second, it can be trivially\ngeneralized to use at any fixed-order or collinear resummed accuracy, while\nprevious prescriptions required ad-hoc expansions of the DGLAP evolution\nkernels for each coefficient. We supplement the paper with codes for the\ncomputation of deep inelastic scattering observables in this new prescription.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
