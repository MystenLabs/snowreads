This is\ndescribed in related papers. I assess the Bayesian probability that the wave\nexists, from this evidence. The probability of the wave in the brain is\nrobustly greater than 0.4. If there is such a wave, we may need to re-think our\nwhole understanding of the brain, in a break from classical neuroscience. I ask\nother researchers to comment on the wave hypothesis and on this assessment. In\na companion paper, I outline possible ways to test it.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
