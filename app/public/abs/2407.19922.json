In the context of this work, we highlight the use of\nLLMs for sentiment analysis (SA) and explainability. Specifically, we\ncontribute a novel technique to leverage LLMs as a post-hoc model-independent\ntool for the explainability of SA. We applied our technique in the financial\ndomain for currency-pair price predictions using open news feed data merged\nwith market prices. Our application shows that the developed technique is not\nonly a viable alternative to using conventional eXplainable AI but can also be\nfed back to enrich the input to the machine learning (ML) model to better\npredict future currency-pair values. We envision our results could be\ngeneralized to employing explainability as a conventional enrichment for ML\ninput for better ML predictions in general.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mT_1rCT3lbs9q7XNsYaS-rQvg5ONUsGII3RfKs6VCYA","pdfSize":"405877"}
