While these efforts never came to fruition, and were\nshortly abandoned in favor of a very different method of dealing with the\nelectron propagator appearing in in QED, the letter is interesting both from\nthe historical viewpoint of revealing what Feynman was thinking about during\nthat period just before the development of QED, and for its scientific ideas.\nIt also contains at the end some philosophical remarks, which Feynman wraps up\nwith the comment, ``Well enough for the baloney.'' In this article I present a\ntranscription of the letter along with editorial notes, and a facsimile of the\noriginal handwritten document. I also briefly comment on Feynman's efforts and\ndiscuss their relation to some later work.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
