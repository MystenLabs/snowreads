Understanding its quantum magnetism and quasiparticle\nexcitation at the atomic scale is crucial for manipulating the quantum spin\nsystems. Here, we report the fabrication of spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains through\non-surface synthesis and in-situ reduction. A closed-shell nanographene is\nemployed as a precursor for Ullman coupling to avoid radical fusing, thus\nobtaining oligomer chains. Following exposure to atomic hydrogen and tip\nmanipulation, closed-shell polymers are transformed into spin-1/2 chains with\ncontrolled lengths by reducing the ketone groups and subsequent hydrogen\ndesorption. The spin excitation gaps are found to decrease in power-law as the\nchain lengths, suggesting its gapless feature. More interestingly, the spinon\ndispersion is extracted from the inelastic spectroscopic spectra, agreeing well\nwith the calculations. Our results demonstrate the great potential of\nfabricating desired quantum systems through a combined on-surface synthesis and\nreduction approach.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
