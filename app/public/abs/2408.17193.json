Both the conservative case and the radiation-reacted case are considered.\nWe use our results to check the changes, during scattering, of the individual\nmomenta, as well as of the total angular momentum. High post-Newtonian order\nvalues of the $O(G^2)$ radiation-reaction acceleration components are provided\nfor checks of future post-Newtonian computations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
