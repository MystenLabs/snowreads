Gaps in protoplanetary disks can hinder the effective inward transport\nof pebbles by trapping the material in pressure bumps. Here we explore how\nmultiple planets change the vapour enrichment by gap opening. For this, we\nextend the chemcomp code to include multiple growing planets and investigate\nthe effect of 1, 2 & 3 planets on the water content and C/O ratio in the gas\ndisk as well as the final composition of the planetary atmosphere. We follow\nplanet migration over evaporation fronts and find that previously trapped\npebbles evaporate relatively quickly and enrich the gas. We also find that in a\nmulti-planet system, the atmosphere composition can be reduced in carbon and\noxygen compared to the case without other planets, due to the blocking of\nvolatile-rich pebbles by an outer planet. This effect is stronger for lower\nviscosities because planets migrate further at higher viscosities and\neventually cross inner evaporation fronts, releasing the previously trapped\npebbles. Interestingly, we find that nitrogen remains super-stellar regardless\nof the number of planets in the system such that super-stellar values in N/H of\ngiant planet atmospheres may be a tracer for the importance of pebble drift and\nevaporation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zak05f5DopjR8Bm2vdw3aM3GGZ75MW4nrENCdkv1YFI","pdfSize":"1781348"}
