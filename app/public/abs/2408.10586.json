This gives rise to a novel contribution to the conductance through the\njunction purely through Fermi arc states, even in the absence of a magnetic\nfield perpendicular to the junction. When the perpendicular magnetic field is\nincluded, we find that for a mesoscopic or smaller samples, the transverse\nFermi arc states have a significant contribution to the conductance for\nexperimentally relevant fields, and need to be taken into account along with\nthe conductance through the bulk chiral Landau levels.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6I-ED-275qJUcYnAAD_unALabuNpGolBxT9Cg1MC500","pdfSize":"7971691"}
