We provide both lower and upper bounds on the minimum distances of these\ncodes and determine the exact values for any $t\\leq 3$ and sufficiently large\n$n$. Our study combines design and integer linear programming techniques. The\ncodes we consider are connected to locally recoverable codes, LDPC codes and\ncombinatorial designs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
