A\nnumerical method is proposed and justified for the solution of this problem\nunder assumptions that the mentioned operator coefficient $A$ is strongly\npositive and some existence and uniqueness conditions are fulfilled. The method\nis based on the reduction of the given problem to an abstract Hammerstein\nequation. The later one is discretized by collocation and then solved via the\nfixed-point iteration method. Each iteration of the method involves Sinc-based\nnumerical evaluation of the operator exponential represented by a\nDunford-Cauchy integral along hyperbola enveloping the spectrum of $A$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
