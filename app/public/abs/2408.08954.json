We find that twist-bend coupling renormalizes the persistence\nlength and the force-extension curves relative to worm-like chains. Analysis of\nintrinsically twisted polymers shows that incorporation of twist-bend coupling\nresults in the oscillatory behavior in principal tangent correlations that are\nobserved in some studies of synthetic polymers. The exact nature of our\nsolution provides a framework to evaluate the role of twist-bend coupling on\npolymer properties and motivates the reinterpretation of existing bio-polymer\nexperimental data.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
