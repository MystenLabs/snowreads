We generalize some known\nresults for the Shub-Smale polynomials, and the spherical ensemble. These two\nprocesses are the two extremal particular cases of the polynomial eigenvalue\nproblem, and we prove that the logarithmic energy lies between these two cases.\nIn particular, the roots of the Shub-Smale polynomials are the ones with the\nlowest logarithmic energy of the family.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0Dtlt7buOe1iGamvy63yUDxQFPkmrlp_w5VWNXAEQA4","pdfSize":"472893"}
