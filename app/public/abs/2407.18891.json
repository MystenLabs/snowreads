In this work, we adopt a well-motivated\npotential $V(\\phi)=\\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\phi^4$ and constrain a variety of\n$\\Upsilon$ parameterizations by using updated Cosmic Microwave Background data\nfrom the \\textit{Planck} and \\textit{BICEP/Keck Array} collaborations. We also\nuse a Bayesian statistical criterion to compare the observational viability of\nthese models. Our results show a significant improvement in the constraints\nover past results reported in the literature and also that some of these warm\ninflation models can be competitive compared to Starobinsky inflation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
