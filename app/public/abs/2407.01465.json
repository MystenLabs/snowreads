In this paper we give an algorithm for $K_r$-Cover that\nruns in subexponential FPT time on graph classes satisfying two simple\nconditions related to cliques and treewidth. As an application we show that our\nalgorithm solves $K_r$-Cover in time\n  * $2^{O_r\\left (k^{(r+1)/(r+2)}\\log k \\right)} \\cdot n^{O_r(1)}$ in\npseudo-disk graphs and map-graphs;\n  * $2^{O_{t,r}(k^{2/3}\\log k)} \\cdot n^{O_r(1)}$ in $K_{t,t}$-subgraph-free\nstring graphs; and\n  * $2^{O_{H,r}(k^{2/3}\\log k)} \\cdot n^{O_r(1)}$ in $H$-minor-free graphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
