In our work, we construct\ngeneral proxy witnesses of quantum properties to detect their presence in\nquantum systems and we do so for quantum systems which may possibly be large.\nIn particular, we discuss proxy witnesses for quantum properties like\nunextendibility, quantum coherence, activation, steerability, and entanglement.\nWe apply these proxy witnesses in some widely considered examples of many-body\nsystems, viz., the quantum Heisenberg models, the quantum J1-J2 model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
