Governments,\nprivate companies, or even individual attackers can collect facial images by\nweb scraping to build an FR system identifying human faces without their\nconsent. This paper introduces Chameleon, which learns to generate a\nuser-centric personalized privacy protection mask, coined as P3-Mask, to\nprotect facial images against unauthorized FR with three salient features.\nFirst, we use a cross-image optimization to generate one P3-Mask for each user\ninstead of tailoring facial perturbation for each facial image of a user. It\nenables efficient and instant protection even for users with limited computing\nresources. Second, we incorporate a perceptibility optimization to preserve the\nvisual quality of the protected facial images. Third, we strengthen the\nrobustness of P3-Mask against unknown FR models by integrating focal\ndiversity-optimized ensemble learning into the mask generation process.\nExtensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that Chameleon outperforms\nthree state-of-the-art methods with instant protection and minimal degradation\nof image quality. Furthermore, Chameleon enables cost-effective FR\nauthorization using the P3-Mask as a personalized de-obfuscation key, and it\ndemonstrates high resilience against adaptive adversaries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
