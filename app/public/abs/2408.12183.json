We introduce a Breakpoints Algorithm for QKP, named QKBP, which\nis based on a technique proposed in Hochbaum (2009) for efficiently generating\nthe concave envelope of the solutions to the relaxation of the problem for all\nvalues of the budget. Our approach utilizes the fact that breakpoints in the\nconcave envelopes are optimal solutions for their respective budgets. For\nbudgets between breakpoints, a fast greedy procedure derives high-quality\nsolutions from the optimal solutions of adjacent breakpoints. The algorithm is\nhighly scalable due to an efficient parametric cut procedure used to generate\nthe concave envelope. This efficiency is further improved by a newly developed\ncompact problem formulation. Our extensive computational study on both existing\nand new benchmark instances, with up to 10,000 elements, shows that while some\nleading algorithms perform well on a few instances, QKBP consistently delivers\nhigh-quality solutions regardless of instance size, density, or budget.\nMoreover, QKBP achieves these results in significantly faster running times\nthan all leading algorithms. The source code of the QKBP algorithm, the\nbenchmark instances, and the detailed results are publicly available on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
