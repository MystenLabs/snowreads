We present a classical\napproach that employs a parameterized angular distribution to describe the\ncomplex issue. By analyzing limited experimental data on angular distribution,\nwe proposed a three-parameter formula to calculate the angular distribution and\nidentified the dependencies of the parameters. We also discuss the sensitivity\nof these parameters within this method. A comprehensive comparison with\nmicroscopic models and experimental data across a wide range of conditions is\nconducted. The proposed formula offers an efficient and straightforward way to\ndetermine the angular distribution of MNT products.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
