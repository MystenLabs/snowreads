ASP has been\nwidely applied to various domains in AI and beyond. The question \"What can be\nsaid about stable models of a logic program from its static information?\" has\nbeen investigated and proved useful in many circumstances. In this work, we\ndive into this direction more deeply by making the connection between a logic\nprogram and a Boolean network, which is a prominent modeling framework with\napplications to various areas. The proposed connection can bring the existing\nresults in the rich history on static analysis of Boolean networks to explore\nand prove more theoretical results on ASP, making it become a unified and\npowerful tool to further study the static analysis of ASP. In particular, the\nnewly obtained insights have the potential to benefit many problems in the\nfield of ASP.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Es5V1SMGM_GtgfBotC8X1AUQRv4VLHozIcf99r_iJs0","pdfSize":"215220","objectId":"0xf26bb793f2977d0ce2ac3a7470f99eeacd4a8f34c1fadd4332e13e5f83c10b13","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
