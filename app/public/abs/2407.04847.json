This notion extends the limit\ncircle/limit point dichotomy in the sense that $\\ell_c~=~0$ at some endpoint if\nand only if the expression is in the limit circle case. In the limit point case\n$\\ell_c>0$, a natural interpretation in terms of iterated Darboux transforms is\nprovided. We also show stability of the index $\\ell_c$ for a suitable class of\nperturbations, extending earlier work on perturbations of spherical\nSchr\\\"odinger operators to the case of general three-coefficient\nSturm-Liouville operators. We demonstrate our results by considering a variety\nof examples including generalized Bessel operators, Jacobi differential\noperators, and Schr\\\"odinger operators on the half-line with power potentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
