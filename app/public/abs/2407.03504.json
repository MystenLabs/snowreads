Theory and Evidence from Renewables","authors":"Michele Fioretti, Junnan He, Jorge Tamayo","authorsParsed":[["Fioretti","Michele",""],["He","Junnan",""],["Tamayo","Jorge",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 3 Jul 2024 21:05:15 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-08","timestamp":1720040715000,"abstract":"  We study firms' strategic interactions when each firm may own multiple\nproduction technologies, each with its own marginal cost and capacity.\nIncreasing industry concentration by reallocating non-efficient capacity to the\nlargest and most efficient firm can decrease market prices as it incentivizes\nthe firm to outcompete its rivals. However, with large reallocations, the\nstandard monotonic relationship between concentration and prices re-emerges as\ncompetition weakens due to the rival's lower capacity. Thus, we demonstrate a\nU-shaped relationship between market prices and industry concentration when\nfirms are diversified. This result does not rely on economies of scale or\nscope. We find consistent evidence from the Colombian wholesale energy market,\nwhere strategic firms are diversified with fossil-fuel and renewable\ntechnologies, exploiting exogenous variation in renewable capacities. Our\nfindings not only apply to the green transition but also to other industries\nand suggest new insights for antitrust policies.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
