His method is based on two basic steps: (1) If the universal\ndivision algebra $U(k,n)$ is a $G$-crossed product then every division algebra\nof degree $n$ over $k$ should be a $G$-crossed product; (2) There are two\ndivision algebras over $k$ whose maximal subfields do not have a common Galois\ngroup. In this note, we give a short proof for the second step in the case\nwhere $\\chr k\\nmid n$ and $p^3|n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
