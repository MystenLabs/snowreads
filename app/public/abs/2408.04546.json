New\nproblem arises when establishing the well-posedness in the stochastic regime:\none can never derive a pathwise control of the energy functional which is used\nto describe the analytic radius of the solution in the deterministic setting.\nTo this end, we establish higher-order estimates in the conormal Sobolev spaces\nin order to get rid of the dependence of the analytic radius on the unknown.\nThree approximate schemes are constructed for solving the stochastic Prandtl\nequation, and a local well-posedness is obtained in a tangentially analytic and\nnormally Sobolev-type space. Furthermore, we study the stochastic Prandtl\nequation driven by a tangential random diffusion, and find that the noise\nregularizes the equation in the sense that in both two and three dimensions,\nthere exists a global Gevrey-2 solution with high probability and the radius\ngrowing linearly in time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
