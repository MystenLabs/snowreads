This is used to produce a general treatment of\nwave dispersion in a pulsar plasma. Specifically, relativistic streaming, the\nspread in Lorentz factors in a pulsar rest frame, and cyclotron resonances are\ntaken into account. Approximations to the response tensor are derived by making\napproximations to relativistic plasma dispersion functions appearing in the\ngeneral form of the response tensor. The cold-plasma limit, the highly\nrelativistic limit, and limits related to cyclotron resonances are considered.\nThe theory developed in this paper has applications to generalised Faraday\nrotation in pulsars and magnetars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-szz7jFqjWn5GJaH8NxjRxD46pfrGEHTV45BtAldiAc","pdfSize":"2647981"}
