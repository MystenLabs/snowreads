We\nextend these results to show that this quantum advantage still occurs for Gibbs\nstates of Hamiltonians with O(1)-local interactions at constant temperature by\nshowing classical hardness-of-sampling and demonstrating such Gibbs states can\nbe prepared efficiently using a quantum computer. In particular, we show\nhardness-of-sampling is maintained even for 5-local Hamiltonians on a 3D\nlattice. We additionally show that the hardness-of-sampling is robust when we\nare only able to make imperfect measurements. Beyond these hardness results, we\npresent a lower bound on the temperatures that Gibbs states become easy to\nsample from classically in terms of the maximum degree of the Hamiltonian's\ninteraction graph.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
