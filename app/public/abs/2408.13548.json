In this\npaper, we first introduce the concept of admissible weak factorization systems\nand establish a bijection between cotorsion pairs and admissible weak\nfactorization systems in extriangulated categories. Consequently, we give the\nequivalences between hereditary cotorsion pairs and compatible cotorsion pairs\nvia admissible weak factorization systems under certain conditions in\nextriangulated categories, thereby generalizing a result by Di, Li, and Liang.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H3SmAF1ODNJMHW1wuRPHZt60mMIkcoq_VDc3XFy4qjM","pdfSize":"182565"}
