We obtain\nsemi-explicit formulas for the inf-convolution of multiple Lambda value at risk\nunder heterogenous beliefs and the explicit forms of the corresponding optimal\nallocations. To show the interplay among the beliefs, we consider three cases:\nhomogeneous beliefs, conditional beliefs and absolutely continuous beliefs. For\nthose cases, we find more explicit expressions for the inf-convolution, showing\nthe influence of the relation of the beliefs on the inf-convolution. Moreover,\nwe consider the inf-convolution of one Lambda value at risk and a general risk\nmeasure, including expected utility, distortion risk measures and Lambda value\nat risk as special cases, with different beliefs. The expression of the\ninf-convolution and the form of the optimal allocation are obtained. Finally,\nwe discuss the risk sharing for another definition of Lambda value at risk.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
