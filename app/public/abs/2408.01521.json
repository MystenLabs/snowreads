Those Josephson diodes were subsequently used as\nratchets to rectify an applied ac current into a dc voltage. We also\ndemonstrate the operation of such a ratchet in the loaded regime, where it\nproduces a nonzero dc output power and yields a thermodynamic efficiency of up\nto $75\\,\\mathrm{\\%}$. The ratchet shows record figures of merit: an output dc\nvoltage of up to $212\\,\\mathrm{\\mu V}$ and an output power of up to\n$0.2\\,\\mathrm{nW}$. The device has an essential area $\\approx 1\\,\\mathrm{\\mu\nm^2}$. For rectification of quasistatic Gaussian noise, the figures of merit\nare more modest, however the efficiency can be as high as for the deterministic\nac drives within some regimes. Since the device is based on YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$,\nit can operate at temperatures up to $\\sim40\\,\\mathrm{K}$, where more noise is\navailable for rectification.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
