We consider the action\nof $G$ on the set $\\mathbb{F}_q \\times \\mathbb{F}_q$. In particular, we study\ncertain relationships between the lengths of the non-trivial orbits of $G$, and\ntheir frequency of occurrence. This is done in part by investigating the order\nof elements of a product in an abelian group when the product has prime power\norder. For $q$ a prime and $b=1$, the orbits correspond to Fibonacci type\nlinear recurrences modulo $q$ for different initial conditions. We also derive\ncertain conditions under which the roots of the characteristic polynomial of\n$Q$ are generators of $\\mathbb{F}_q^\\times$. Examples are included to\nillustrate the theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VL6dHSwNINmHWUPwkY4vBS1nhjDBDLICdJUjJuPQtvc","pdfSize":"246557"}
