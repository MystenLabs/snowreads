Despite remarkable progress, current optical lattice clocks still\nface challenges in meeting the demanding size, weight, and power consumption\nconstraints essential for space applications. Conventional atom sources, such\nas ovens or dispensers, require substantial heating power, making up a\nsignificant fraction of the system's overall power consumption. Addressing this\nchallenge, we present a novel microstructured atomic oven based on fused\nsilica, designed for miniaturization and low-power operation. We characterize\nthe oven by loading a magneto-optical trap with Yb evaporated from the oven and\ndemonstrate operation with a loading rate above $10^8$\n$\\mathrm{atoms}/\\mathrm{s}$ for heating powers below $250$ $\\mathrm{mW}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"w4Lq2x6D5JkMXTycI8GZJuib1hljyltiYcqPAMk9ZwY","pdfSize":"4316843"}
