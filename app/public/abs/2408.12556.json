These can be characterized in\nterms of moment Lyapunov exponents which are principal eigenvalues of the\ngenerator of the tilted (Feynman-Kac) semigroup. Using a computer assisted\nproof, we demonstrate how to determine these eigenvalues and investigate the\nrate function which is the Legendre-Fenichel transform of the moment Lyapunov\nfunction. We apply our results to two case studies: the pitchfork bifurcation\nand a two-dimensional toy model, also considering the transition to a positive\nasymptotic Lyapunov exponent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
