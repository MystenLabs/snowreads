Such interactions\nresponsible for boosting the DM also attenuate its flux at the Earth.\nConsidering a simple model of constant interaction cross-section, we make\nanalytical estimates of the variation of the attenuation ceiling with the DM\nmass and confirm it numerically. We then extend our analysis to a $Z'$-mediated\nleptophilic DM model. We show that the attenuation ceiling remains nearly\nmodel-independent for DM and mediator particles heavier than the electron,\nchallenging some previous discussions on this topic. Using the XENONnT direct\ndetection experiment, we illustrate how constraints based on energy-dependent\nscattering can significantly differ from those based on an assumed constant\ncross-section. This highlights the importance of re-evaluating these\nconstraints in the context of specific models.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BxEssNnIlaxHMahcBaNaDgvfxYHJfIbgP7qmJCT6hYs","pdfSize":"562809","txDigest":"EeXK89Q5xFhuv2CR9UhyYDZK1X65yoxXWpYZe3LQQUAs","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
