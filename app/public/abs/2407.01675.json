While previous analyses assumed relativistic\nproduction, asteroid-mass PBHs, relevant to upcoming experiments like AMEGO-X,\nlikely produce pions and ALPs non-relativistically when their masses exceed 10\nMeV. To account for mass dependence in Hawking radiation, we revisit the\ngreybody factors for massive scalars from Schwarzschild black holes, revealing\nsignificant mass corrections to particle production rates compared to the\nprojected AMEGO-X sensitivity. We highlight the importance of considering\nnon-relativistic $\\pi^0$ production in interpreting PBH gamma-ray signals,\nessential for determining PBH properties. Additionally, we comment on the\npotential suppression of pion production due to form factor effects when\nproducing extended objects via Hawking radiation. We also provide an example\ncode for calculating the Hawking radiation spectrum of massive scalar\nparticles.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
