With prescribed colored noise spectra for intrinsic and extrinsic\nnoise, we present a numerical method, Quantum Accelerated Stochastic Propagator\nEvaluation (Q-ASPEN), to solve the time-dependent noise-averaged reduced\ndensity matrix in the presence of intrinsic and extrinsic noise. Q-ASPEN is\narbitrarily accurate and can be applied to provide estimates for the resources\nneeded to error-correct quantum computations. We employ spectral tensor trains,\nwhich combine the advantages of tensor networks and pseudospectral methods, as\na variational ansatz to the quantum relaxation problem and optimize the ansatz\nusing methods typically used to train neural networks. The spectral tensor\ntrains in Q-ASPEN make accurate calculations with tens of quantum levels\nfeasible. We present benchmarks for Q-ASPEN on the spin-boson model in the\npresence of intrinsic noise and on a quantum chain of up to 32 sites in the\npresence of extrinsic noise. In our benchmark, the memory cost of Q-ASPEN\nscales linearly with the system size once the number of states is larger than\nthe number of basis functions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
