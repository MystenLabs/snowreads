We show that it is asymptotically\nsize-correct under a technical condition. This is the first\nweak-instrument-robust subvector test for instrumental variables regression to\nrecover the degrees of freedom of the commonly used non-weak-instrument-robust\nWald test. Additionally, we provide a closed-form solution for subvector\nconfidence sets obtained by inverting the subvector Anderson-Rubin test. We\nshow that they are centered around a k-class estimator. Also, we show that the\nsubvector confidence sets for single coefficients of the causal parameter are\njointly bounded if and only if Anderson's likelihood-ratio test rejects the\nhypothesis that the first-stage regression parameter is of reduced rank, that\nis, that the causal parameter is not identified. Finally, we show that if a\nconfidence set obtained by inverting the Anderson-Rubin test is bounded and\nnonempty, it is equal to a Wald-based confidence set with a data-dependent\nconfidence level. We explicitly compute this Wald-based confidence test.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
