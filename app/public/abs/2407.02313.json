This study employs a quantum optics-based approach, wherein\nan Unruh-DeWitt detector (modeled as a two-level atom) follows a radial\ntimelike geodesic, falling freely into an uncharged, nonrotating black hole\ndescribed by 4D EGB gravity, becoming thermalized in the usual Unruh manner.\nThe black hole, asymptotically Minkowskian, is enclosed by a Casimir boundary\nproximate to its horizon, serving as a source for accelerated field modes that\ninteract with the infalling detector. Observations are conducted by an\nasymptotic infinity observer, assuming a Boulware field state. Our numerical\nanalysis reveals that, unlike in Einstein gravity, black holes in 4D EGB\ngravity can either enhance or suppress the intensity of acceleration radiation,\ncontingent upon the Gauss-Bonnet coupling parameter $\\alpha$. Specifically, we\nobserve radiation enhancement for negative $\\alpha$ and suppression for\npositive $\\alpha$. These findings offer substantial insights into quantifying\nthe influence of higher-curvature contributions on the behavior of quantum\nfields in black hole geometries within a 4D spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jvULFr4yX51i5UlENd--HkelOJ1UqhUTLTvnyvarydA","pdfSize":"818608","objectId":"0xc52ab2dacff9d2a7fd6d0c223ae1087e35827212c75bad4b386926870f7e370f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
