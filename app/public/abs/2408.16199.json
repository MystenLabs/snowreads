Majority of number fields contain infinitely many\nBass orders. For example, any order of a number field which contains the\nmaximal order of a subfield with degree 2 or whose discriminant is\n4th-power-free in $\\mathbb{Z}$, is a Bass order.\n  In this paper, we will propose a closed formula for the number of fractional\nideals of a Bass order $R$, up to its invertible ideals, using the conductor of\n$R$. We will also explain explicit enumeration of all orders containing $R$.\nOur method is based on local global argument and exhaustion argument, by using\norbital integrals for $\\mathfrak{gl}_n$ as a mass formula.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
