It is well known since the 80's that its overlaps\nare non-selfaveraging and that their statistics satisfy the predictions of the\nreplica theory. All these statistical properties can be understood by\nconsidering that the low energy levels are the points generated by a Poisson\nprocess with an exponential density. Here we first show how, by replacing the\nexponential density by a sum of two exponentials, the overlaps statistics are\nmodified. One way to reconcile these results with the replica theory is to\nallow the blocks in the Parisi matrix to fluctuate. Other examples where the\nsizes of these blocks should fluctuate include the finite size corrections of\nthe REM, the case of discrete energies and the overlaps between two\ntemperatures. In all these cases, the blocks sizes not only fluctuate but need\nto take complex values if one wishes to reproduce the results of our\nreplica-free calculations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
