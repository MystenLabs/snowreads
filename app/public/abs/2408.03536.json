The strong\ncoupling of random laser modes to plasmonic nanocavities results in a dominant\nabsorption of the random laser emission, leading to the first unusual lasing\nthreshold. At higher pump fluences, the nonlinear optical behavior of the Au\nnanoislands induces a second lasing threshold. Various statistical tools have\nbeen employed to analyze the intensity fluctuations of the random laser modes,\nvalidating this unique lasing behavior.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
