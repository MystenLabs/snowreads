We\nstudy general control-affine cost functionals that include as a special case\nthe energy supplied to the system. We derive optimality conditions for the case\nwith and without control bounds by applying the general theory to the specially\nstructured port-Hamiltonian case, and show that this leads to nice optimality\nconditions, in particular in the linear case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
