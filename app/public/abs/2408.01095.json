The Riemann hypothesis, stating the\nlocations of nontrivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function, tentatively\ncharacterizes statistical order in the seemingly random distribution of prime\nnumbers. This famous conjecture has inspired various connections with different\nbranches of physics, recently with non-Hermitian physics, quantum field theory,\ntrapped-ion qubits, and hyperuniformity. Here we develop the computing platform\nfor the Riemann zeta function by employing classical scattering of light. We\nshow that the Riemann hypothesis suggests the landscape of semi-infinite\noptical scatterers for the perfect reflectionless condition under the Born\napproximation. To examine the validity of the scattering-based computation, we\ninvestigate the asymptotic behaviours of suppressed reflections with the\nincreasing number of scatterers and the emergence of multiple scattering. The\nresult provides another bridge between classical physics and the Riemann zeros,\nexhibiting the design of wave devices inspired by number theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
