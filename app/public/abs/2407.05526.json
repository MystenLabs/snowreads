Expectations are based on true facts\nabout the objective environment the machines interact with, and those facts can\nbe encoded into AI models in the form of true objective probability functions.\nAccordingly, AI models involve probabilistic machine learning in which the\nprobabilities should be objectively interpreted. We prove under some basic\nassumptions when machines can learn the true objective probabilities, if any,\nand when machines cannot learn them.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
