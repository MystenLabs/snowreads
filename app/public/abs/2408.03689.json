The sender would like to influence the receiver's decision by\nproviding information, in the form of a statistical experiment or test. The\ntechnology for information production is controlled by a monopolist\nintermediary, who offers a menu of tests and prices to screen the sender's\ntype, possibly including a \"threat\" test to punish nonparticipation. We\ncharacterize the intermediary's optimal screening menu and the associated\ndistortions, which we show may benefit the receiver. We compare the sale of\npersuasive information with other forms of influence -- overt bribery and\ncontrolling access.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
