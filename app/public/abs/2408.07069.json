We critically\nreview the formalism finding that a large class of inflationary theories, based\non Planck-scale physics, predict a scalar bi-spectrum around the gravitational\nfloor level. This mild signal arises for example in $R^2$ gravity, in the\nregime where its gravitational scalar has Hubble-scale mass. Signals much above\nthe gravitational floor arise in theories where scalars undergo multiple turns\nduring inflation, thanks to sub-Planckian physics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
