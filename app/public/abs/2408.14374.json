An equitable coloring is a proper\ncoloring in which the number of vertices in each color class differs by at most\none. In this newly introduced coloring, an additional condition of equitability\nis added to the existing concept of dominator coloring. The minimum number of\ncolors used in this coloring is called the equitable dominator chromatic\nnumber, represented by $\\chi_{ed}(G)$. The concept of equitable dominator\ncoloring is explored for basic graph classes. The equitable dominator chromatic\nnumber is obtained for the same and some observations on the bounds are made in\nthis paper.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"oHsY_2buGHZZqxEhsAHieaRy9ye1KQLVacqIUm4y-2c","pdfSize":"373794"}
