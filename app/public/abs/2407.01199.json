In this\nstudy, we propose a deep learning approach based on a convolutional neural\nnetwork that incorporates cutting conditions as extra model inputs, aiming to\nimprove tool wear estimation accuracy and fulfill industrial demands for\nzero-shot transferability. Through a series of milling experiments under\nvarious cutting parameters, we evaluate the model's performance in terms of\ntool wear estimation accuracy and its transferability to new fixed or variable\ncutting parameters. The results consistently highlight our approach's advantage\nover conventional models that omit cutting conditions, maintaining superior\nperformance irrespective of the stability of the wear development or the\nlimitation of the training dataset. This finding underscores its potential\napplicability in industrial scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Uz8DMAUBuLlkJdWuj7R7bSGRSC7kgwdKuZKxgXr4aI8","pdfSize":"564237","objectId":"0x79759f8f539ed87f25d7e102e4328310f63c792a6c8fc138489fff4d957d200e","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
