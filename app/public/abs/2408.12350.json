The technique, in principle, can reach a\nsub-femtometer noise floor and an operating range on the order of one laser\nwavelength at $\\lambda \\approx 1\\,\\mu m$. With our current experimental setup,\nwe achieve a sensitivity of about $130 fm/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ at $1\\,Hz$ and\n$23 fm/\\sqrt{\\mathrm{Hz}}$ at around $130\\,Hz$. By probing a length actuated\ncavity, we demonstrate six orders of magnitude of dynamic range for\ndisplacement measurement, reaching a maximum motion of $0.15\\,\\mu m$. The\ntracking bandwidth and displacement range are limited by analog effects in the\nsignal digitization and are extendable in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
