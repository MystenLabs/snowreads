We prove that the level one global Weyl modules of\n$\\mathcal{T}(\\mu)$ are isomorphic to the tensor product of the level one\nrepresentation of twisted affine Lie algebras and certain lattice vertex\nalgebras. As a byproduct, we calculate the graded character of the level one\nlocal Weyl modules of $\\mathcal{T}(\\mu)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
