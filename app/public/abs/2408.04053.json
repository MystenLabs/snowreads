This paper introduces subgraph queries as a new\ntask for deep graph learning. Unlike traditional graph prediction tasks that\nfocus on individual components like link prediction or node classification,\nsubgraph queries jointly predict the components of a target subgraph based on\nevidence that is represented by an observed subgraph. For instance, a subgraph\nquery can predict a set of target links and/or node labels. To answer subgraph\nqueries, we utilize a probabilistic deep Graph Generative Model. Specifically,\nwe inductively train a Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) model, augmented\nto represent a joint distribution over links, node features and labels.\nBayesian optimization is used to tune a weighting for the relative importance\nof links, node features and labels in a specific domain. We describe a\ndeterministic and a sampling-based inference method for estimating subgraph\nprobabilities from the VGAE generative graph distribution, without retraining,\nin zero-shot fashion. For evaluation, we apply the inference methods on a range\nof subgraph queries on six benchmark datasets. We find that inference from a\nmodel achieves superior predictive performance, surpassing independent\nprediction baselines with improvements in AUC scores ranging from 0.06 to 0.2\npoints, depending on the dataset.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CZilhLtD91cj_-P3KbtYvaHhb4iHr9kw5SabBAaOyKE","pdfSize":"1342368"}
