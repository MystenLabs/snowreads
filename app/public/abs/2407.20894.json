The motivation comes from the concepts of\nweighted information and weighted entropy that proved useful in\nindustrial/microeconomic and medical statistics. We focus on applications\nrelevant in hypothesis testing and an analysis of exponential families. Several\nnotions, bounds and asymptotics are established, which generalize their\ncounterparts well-known in standard statistical research. It includes\nStein-Sanov theorem, Pinsker's, Bretangnole-Huber and van Trees inequalities\nand Kullback--Leibler, Bhattacharya, Bregman, Burbea-Rao, Chernoff, Renyi and\nTsallis divergences.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
