This construction, while allowing time and risk attitudes to be\nseparated, leads to dynamically inconsistent preferences. We address this issue\nin a game-theoretic sense by formalizing an equilibrium control theory for\ncontinuous-time Markov processes. In these terms, we describe the equilibrium\nstrategy and value function as the solution of an extended\nHamilton-Jacobi-Bellman system of partial differential equations. We verify\nthat (the solution of) this system is a sufficient condition for an equilibrium\nand examine some of its novel features. A consumption-investment problem for an\nagent with CRRA-CES utility showcases our approach.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
