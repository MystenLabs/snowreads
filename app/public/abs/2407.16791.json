Segment co-phasing errors contribute to Keck contrast\nlimits and will be necessary to correct for the segmented Extremely Large\nTelescopes and future space missions. The goal of the post-AO vZWFS on Keck is\nto monitor and correct segment co-phasing errors in parallel with science\nobservations. The ZWFS is ideal for measuring phase discontinuities and is one\nof the most sensitive WFSs, but has limited dynamic range. The Keck vZWFS\nconsists of a metasurface mask imposing two different phase shifts to\northogonal polarizations, split into two pupil images, extending its dynamic\nrange. We report on the vZWFS closed-loop co-phasing performance and early work\ntowards understanding the interactions between the AO system and segment\nphasing. We discuss a comparison of the AO performance when co-phasing by\naligning segment edges, as is currently done at Keck, compared with aligning to\nthe average phase over the segments, as is done by the vZWFS.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
