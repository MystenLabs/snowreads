In this study, we present the first numerical investigation that models\nthe SI in the vertically stratified disk together with the dust coagulation\nprocess. Our simulations reveal that, even with the initial small dust sizes,\nbecause dust coagulation promotes dust size growth, SI can eventually still be\ntriggered. As such, the dust coagulation process broadens the parameter\nboundaries obtained from the previous SI studies using single dust species. We\ndescribe the various stages of dust dynamics along with their size evolution,\nand explore the impact of different dust fragmentation velocities. Implications\nof these results for realistic PPDs are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
