Our approach is based on\ngetting rid of integration in position space and then writing differential\nequations for the products of propagators defined for any graph. We employ the\nso-called ''bananization'' to start with simple Feynman graphs and further\nsubstituting each edge with a multiple one. We explain how the previously\ndeveloped theory of banana diagrams can be used to describe what happens to the\ndifferential equations (Ward identities) on Feynman diagrams after this\ntransformation. Our approach works for generic enough (large enough) dimension\nand masses. We expect that after Fourier transform our equations should be\nrelated to the Picard-Fuchs equations. Therefore, we describe the challenges of\nFourier transform that arise in our approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
