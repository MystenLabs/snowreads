However, in current practice the robot\noften arrives at a fixed location for each table when delivering orders to\ndifferent patrons in the same dining group, thus requiring a human staff member\nor the customers themselves to identify and retrieve each order. This study\ninvestigates how to improve the robot's service behaviours to facilitate clear\nintention communication to a group of users, thus achieving accurate delivery\nand positive user experiences. Specifically, we conduct user studies (N=30)\nwith a Temi service robot as a representative delivery robot currently adopted\nin restaurants. We investigated two factors in the robot's intent\ncommunication, namely visualisation and movement trajectories, and their\ninfluence on the objective and subjective interaction outcomes. A robot\npersonalising its movement trajectory and stopping location in addition to\ndisplaying a visualisation of the order yields more accurate intent\ncommunication and successful order delivery, as well as more positive user\nperception towards the robot and its service. Our results also showed that\nindividuals in a group have different interaction experiences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
