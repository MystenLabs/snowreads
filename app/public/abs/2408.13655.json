More generally, we establish a\ntheory for capillary convex bodies in the half-space and prove a general\nAlexandrov-Fenchel inequality for mixed volumes of capillary convex bodies. The\nconjecture [16, Conjecture 1.5] follows as its consequence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
