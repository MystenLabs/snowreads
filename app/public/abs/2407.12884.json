In our work, we introduce SurroFlow,\na novel normalizing flow-based surrogate model, to learn the invertible\ntransformation between simulation parameters and simulation outputs. The model\nnot only allows accurate predictions of simulation outcomes for a given\nsimulation parameter but also supports uncertainty quantification in the data\ngeneration process. Additionally, it enables efficient simulation parameter\nrecommendation and exploration. We integrate SurroFlow and a genetic algorithm\nas the backend of a visual interface to support effective user-guided ensemble\nsimulation exploration and visualization. Our framework significantly reduces\nthe computational costs while enhancing the reliability and exploration\ncapabilities of scientific surrogate models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
