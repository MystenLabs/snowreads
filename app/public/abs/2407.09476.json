We derive results about\nthe connected domination numbers of a graph and its complement. We provide an\nanswer to an open question about the minimal order of a 3-non-compliant graph.\nWe prove that the complements of knotlessly embeddable graphs of order at least\n15 are all intrinsically knotted. We provide results on general\n$k$-non-compliant graphs and leave a set of open questions for further\nexploration of the subject.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
