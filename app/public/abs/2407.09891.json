While for\nsome automata the exponential blow-up in their number of states is unavoidable,\nwe show that in general, any approximation of state complexity with polynomial\nprecision remains PSPACE-hard. The same is true when using the subset\nconstruction to determinize the NFA, meaning that it is PSPACE-hard to predict\nwhether subset construction will produce an exponential ''blow-up'' in the\nnumber of states or not. To give an explanation for its behaviour, we propose\nthe notion of subset complexity, which serves as an upper bound on the size of\nsubset construction. Due to it simple and intuitive nature it allows to\nidentify large classes of automata which can have limited non-determinism and\ncompletely avoid the ''blow-up''. Subset complexity also remains invariant\nunder NFA reversal and allows to predict how the introduction or removal of\ntransitions from the NFA will affect its size.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"zxJ5a4FhwpyQhHfrFpzBmCYRupwuLCNssebM-EbuAko","pdfSize":"749220"}
