The equal mixture of scalar and vector components in\nthe potential having Martin-like form is considered for the confinement. With\nthe suitable potential parameters for $\\Xi^0$, mass spectra for high radial and\norbital excitation is calculated. The experimentally observed values of ground\nstate magnetic moment, branching ratios and asymmetry parameters for radiative\nweak decays, $\\Xi^{0}\\rightarrow\\Lambda^{0} + \\gamma^{0}$ \\&\n$\\Xi^{0}\\rightarrow\\Sigma^{0} + \\gamma^{0}$ are obtained to validate the model.\nThe spin parity of experimentally known resonances like $\\Xi(1530)$,\n$\\Xi(1820)$, \\& $\\Xi(2030)$ are confirmed through the Regge trajectories in\n$(J,M^2)$ plane. The spin pa+rity of $\\Xi(1950)$, $\\Xi(2130)$, \\& $\\Xi(2250)$\nare predicted using those Regge trajectories. The radiative decay width and\nmagnetic moment of first resonance is also predicted.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wJnVmcctoa2wRW7howvKvWjf-M2RsJoifdluroaV0fs","pdfSize":"2301028"}
