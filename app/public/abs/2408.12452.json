Such\na transverse displacement could be caused, for example, by the refracting\nproperties of the propagation medium, or by the orientation of a system of\nmirrors. By performing transverse-momentum sampling interference between\npolarization-entangled pairs of photons that propagate with different momenta,\nwe show that it is possible to perform transverse-displacement estimation with\na precision that increases with the difference of the transverse momenta of the\nphotons. Moreover, we show that for the estimation of small displacements, it\nis possible to simplify the measurement scheme replacing the\ntransverse-momentum resolving detectors with bucket detectors without any loss\nin sensitivity. More fundamentally, we demonstrate that it is the quantum\ninterference arising from two-photon entanglement in the transverse momenta at\nthe very heart of the foreseen quantum-limited sensitivity in the spatial\ndomain.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
