Although the recently proposed gray-box attacks have improved\npracticality, they suffer from semantic loss during the training process, which\nlimits their targeted attack performance. To advance adversarial attacks of\nimage-to-text models, this paper focuses on a challenging scenario:\ndecision-based black-box targeted attacks where the attackers only have access\nto the final output text and aim to perform targeted attacks. Specifically, we\nformulate the decision-based black-box targeted attack as a large-scale\noptimization problem. To efficiently solve the optimization problem, a\nthree-stage process \\textit{Ask, Attend, Attack}, called \\textit{AAA}, is\nproposed to coordinate with the solver. \\textit{Ask} guides attackers to create\ntarget texts that satisfy the specific semantics. \\textit{Attend} identifies\nthe crucial regions of the image for attacking, thus reducing the search space\nfor the subsequent \\textit{Attack}. \\textit{Attack} uses an evolutionary\nalgorithm to attack the crucial regions, where the attacks are semantically\nrelated to the target texts of \\textit{Ask}, thus achieving targeted attacks\nwithout semantic loss. Experimental results on transformer-based and\nCNN+RNN-based image-to-text models confirmed the effectiveness of our proposed\n\\textit{AAA}.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
