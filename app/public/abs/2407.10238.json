We focus on local convergence of the optimal\nestimator, ignoring questions of optimization. In particular, assuming the\nminimizer of the empirical loss $\\theta^0$ is in a constant size ball around\nthe true parameters $\\theta^*$, we prove that\n$d(\\theta^0,\\theta^*)=\\tilde{O}(\\sqrt{dk^2/n})$.
