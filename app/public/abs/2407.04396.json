While deep\nlearning approaches using fundus images have largely improved early diagnosis\nof glaucoma, variations in images from different devices and locations (known\nas domain shifts) challenge the use of pre-trained models in real-world\nsettings. To address this, we propose a novel Graph-guided Test-Time Adaptation\n(GTTA) framework to generalize glaucoma diagnosis models to unseen test\nenvironments. GTTA integrates the topological information of fundus images into\nthe model training, enhancing the model's transferability and reducing the risk\nof learning spurious correlation. During inference, GTTA introduces a novel\ntest-time training objective to make the source-trained classifier\nprogressively adapt to target patterns with reliable class conditional\nestimation and consistency regularization. Experiments on cross-domain glaucoma\ndiagnosis benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of the overall framework and\nindividual components under different backbone networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
