Various spin torques\nhave proven to be important for efficient and high-speed magnetic memories. So\nfar, this has been understood on the classical level by solving the equations\nof motion for macrospins describing the collective motion of the sublattice\nmagnetizations. Since spins and hence magnetizations are deeply rooted in\nquantum mechanics, we show that the exchange enhanced manipulation of\nsublattice magnetizations extends to quantum antiferromagnets as well. To this\nend, we solve the time-dependent mean-field equations for Schwinger boson\ntheory under external alternating magnetic fields. Exchange enhancement\npersists on the quantum level which includes dephasing effects. Significantly\nlower fields are sufficient to control the sublattice magnetization than for\nuniform fields which holds great promises for the realization of ultrafast\nmagnetic storage devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
