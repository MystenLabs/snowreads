Digital civics research aims to create\npositive social change using a variety of digital technologies. These research\nprojects commonly adopt various embedded processes, such as commissioning\nmodels \\cite{dcitizensproj22}. Despite the adoption of this process within a\nrange of domains, there isn't currently a framework for best practices and\naccountability procedures to ensure we engage with citizens ethically and\nensure the sustainability of our projects. This workshop aims to provide a\nspace to start collaboratively constructing a dynamic framework of best\npractices, laying the groundwork for the future of sustainable embedded\nresearch processes. The overarching goal is to foster discussions and share\ninsights that contribute to developing effective practices, ensuring the\nlongevity and impact of participatory digital civics projects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
