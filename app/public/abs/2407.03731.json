The problem is\nmotivated by the desire to machine learn potential energy surfaces arising in\nmolecular excited state computational chemistry applications. We present\nsimplified models which reproduce the analytically predicted convergence and\nstability behaviors as well as two application-oriented numerical experiments:\nthe electronic excited states of Graphene featuring Dirac conical cusps and\nenergy surfaces corresponding to a sulfur dioxide ($SO_2$) molecule in\ndifferent configurations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
