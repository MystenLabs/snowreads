We derive the\nshadow ansatz -- a product of transformations applied to the mean-field wave\nfunction -- by exploiting a critical link between measurement and preparation.\nEach transformation is obtained by measuring a classical shadow of the residual\nof the contracted Schr\\\"odinger equation (CSE), the many-electron Schr\\\"odinger\nequation (SE) projected onto the space of two electrons. We show that the\nclassical shadows of the CSE vanish if and only if the wave function satisfies\nthe SE and, hence, that randomly sampling only the two-electron space yields an\nexact ansatz regardless of the total number of electrons. We demonstrate the\nansatz's advantages for scalable simulations -- fewer measurements and\nshallower circuits -- by computing H$_{3}$ on simulators and a quantum device.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
