The Al$_2$O$_3$ is grown within the same\nreactor as the $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$, employing trimethylaluminum (TMAl) and\nO$_2$ as precursors without breaking the vacuum. We characterize the shallow\nand deep-level traps through stressed capacitance-voltage (C-V) and\nphoto-assisted C-V methods. The high-temperature deposited dielectric\ndemonstrates an impressive breakdown field of approximately 10 MV/cm.\nFurthermore, we evaluate the reliability and lifetime of the dielectrics using\ntime-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) measurements. By modifying the\ndielectric deposition process to include a high-temperature (800{\\deg}C) thin\ninterfacial layer and a low-temperature (600{\\deg}C) bulk layer, we report a\n10-year lifetime under a stress field of 3.5 MV/cm along a breakdown field of\n7.8 MV/cm.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wZti6gPy6LxbuVWTmb1IP8hlnbiXgGserBz0xwyf4U0","pdfSize":"2442153"}
