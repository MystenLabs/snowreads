We perform a systematic analysis on the general magnitude of\ndifferent terms for related mechanisms. For the $\\eta$ mechanism, we find that\nthe weak magnetism $R$ term dominates the decay rate while the $p$-wave effect\nis suppressed. While for the $\\lambda$ mechanism, the $\\omega$ and the $q$\nterms are with equal importance. For the latter $q$ term, important\ncontributions from weak-magnetism MM part are observed. Finally, we give the\nconstraints on the new physics parameters $m_{\\beta\\beta}$, $\\lambda$ and\n$\\eta$ from current experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
