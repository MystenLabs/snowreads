The individuation of a\nsuitable color palette for a colorway is a complex creative task, responding to\nclient and market needs, stylistic and cultural specifications, and mood. We\nintroduce a modification of this task, the \"generative colorway\" creation, that\nincludes minimal shape modifications, and propose a framework, \"ColorwAI\", to\ntackle this task using color disentanglement on StyleGAN and Diffusion. We\nintroduce a variation of the InterfaceGAN method for supervised\ndisentanglement, ShapleyVec. We use Shapley values to subselect a few\ndimensions of the detected latent direction. Moreover, we introduce a general\nframework to adopt common disentanglement methods on any architecture with a\nsemantic latent space and test it on Diffusion and GANs. We interpret the color\nrepresentations within the models' latent space. We find StyleGAN's W space to\nbe the most aligned with human notions of color. Finally, we suggest that\ndisentanglement can solicit a creative system for colorway creation, and\nevaluate it through expert questionnaires and creativity theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
