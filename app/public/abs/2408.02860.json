We study\nthe problem of computing Nash equilibrium in a subclass of two-player games\nplayed on graphs where each player seeks to maximally satisfy their (possibly\nincomplete) preferences over a set of temporal goals. We characterize the Nash\nequilibrium and prove its existence in scenarios where player preferences are\nfully aligned, partially aligned, and completely opposite, in terms of the\nwell-known solution concepts of sure winning and Pareto efficiency. When\npreferences are partially aligned, we derive conditions under which a player\nneeds cooperation and demonstrate that the Nash equilibria depend not only on\nthe preference alignment but also on whether the players need cooperation to\nachieve a better outcome and whether they are willing to cooperate.We\nillustrate the theoretical results by solving a mechanism design problem for a\ndrone delivery scenario.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IVBzp99IgyCsJxWZbJf6rUYbP9Je0Ki9r0k8V7EiwFE","pdfSize":"1249491"}
