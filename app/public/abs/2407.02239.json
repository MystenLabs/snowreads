Because this CDW formation suppresses pairing,\na superconducting (SC) phase emerges only with doping. In this work, we study\nthe effects of dilution of the local phonon degrees of freedom in the Holstein\nmodel while keeping the system at half filling. We find not only that the CDW\nremains present up to a dilution fraction $f \\sim 0.15$, but also that long\nrange pairing is stabilized with increasing $f$, resulting in a {\\it\nsupersolid} regime centered at $f \\approx 0.10$, where long range diagonal and\noff-diagonal correlations coexist. Further dilution results in a purely SC\nphase, and ultimately in a normal metal. Our results provide a new route to the\nsupersolid phase via the introduction of impurities at fixed positions which\nboth increase quantum fluctuations and also are immune to the competing\ntendency to phase separation often observed in the doped case.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
