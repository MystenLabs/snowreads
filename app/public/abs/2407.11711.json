While the hypothesis is provably correct in classical\nsystems, it is known to fail in the quantum regime. Here, we derive a suitably\nadjusted quantum version of Onsager's original hypothesis. Rigorous analytical\nresults are complemented by a variety of numerical examples.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"obywOaaNjYEnBOBksw92Y-eUHPBAgE_WZeJbYkkAFxg","pdfSize":"544657","objectId":"0x36c1e0396d8461a28ba776c9962972b8912e3a8c2969e7838c2b2c84e52ceefb","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
