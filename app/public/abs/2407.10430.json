Inductive KG reasoning aims\nto predict missing facts for these new entities. Among existing models, graph\nneural networks (GNNs) based ones have shown promising performance for this\ntask. However, they are still challenged by inefficient message propagation due\nto the distance and scalability issues. In this paper, we propose a new\ninductive KG reasoning model, MStar, by leveraging conditional message passing\nneural networks (C-MPNNs). Our key insight is to select multiple query-specific\nstarting entities to expand the scope of progressive propagation. To propagate\nquery-related messages to a farther area within limited steps, we subsequently\ndesign a highway layer to propagate information toward these selected starting\nentities. Moreover, we introduce a training strategy called LinkVerify to\nmitigate the impact of noisy training samples. Experimental results validate\nthat MStar achieves superior performance compared with state-of-the-art models,\nespecially for distant entities.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wKRt3cyXzTDBdwHP9861IoehJ2ygB3tvZR9F9_kvy1M","pdfSize":"746455"}
