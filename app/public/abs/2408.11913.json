There have been various representations of temporal network data each\nof which has different advantages for downstream tasks such as mathematical\nanalysis, visualizations, agent-based and other dynamical simulations on the\ntemporal network, and discovery of useful structure. The tie-decay network is a\nrepresentation of temporal networks whose advantages include the capability of\ngenerating continuous-time networks from discrete time-stamped contact event\ndata with mathematical tractability and a low computational cost. However, the\ncurrent framework of tie-decay networks is limited in terms of how each\ndiscrete contact event can affect the time-dependent tie strength (which we\ncall the kernel). Here we extend the tie-decay network model in terms of the\nkernel. Specifically, we use a cubic spline function for modeling short-term\nbehavior of the kernel and an exponential decay function for long-term\nbehavior, and graft them together. This spline version of tie-decay network\nenables delayed and $C^1$-continuous interaction rates between two nodes while\nit only marginally increases the computational and memory burden relative to\nthe conventional tie-decay network. We show mathematical properties of the\nspline tie-decay network and numerically showcase it with three tasks: network\nembedding, a deterministic opinion dynamics model, and a stochastic epidemic\nspreading model.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
