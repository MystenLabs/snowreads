Specifically, we establish an upper bound on the\ntransversal numbers of pure simplicial complexes in terms of the number of\nvertices and the number of facets, and then provide constructions of pure\nsimplicial complexes whose transversal numbers come close to this bound. We\nintroduce a new family of $d$-dimensional polytopes that could be considered as\n''siblings'' of cyclic polytopes and show that the transversal ratios of such\nodd-dimensional polytopes are $2/5-o(1)$. The previous record for the\ntransversal ratios of $(2k+1)$-polytopes was $1/(k+1)$. Finally, we construct\ninfinite families of $3$-, $4$-, and $5$-dimensional simplicial spheres with\ntransversal ratios converging to $5/8$, $1/2$, and $6/11$, respectively. The\nprevious record was $11/21$, $2/5$, and $1/2$, respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
