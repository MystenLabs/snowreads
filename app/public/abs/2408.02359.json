In this paper, a fully grant-free deep\nlearning (DL)-based method for user activity detection in CF-mMIMO networks is\nproposed. Initially, the known non-orthogonal pilot sequences are used to\nestimate the channel coefficients between each user and the access points.\nThen, a deep convolutional neural network is used to estimate the activity\nstatus of the users. The proposed method is \"blind\", i.e., it is fully\ndata-driven and does not require prior large-scale fading coefficients\nestimation. Numerical results show how the proposed DL-based algorithm is able\nto merge the information gathered by the distributed antennas to estimate the\nuser activity status, yet outperforming a state-of-the-art covariance-based\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bq3AYC9t_gniskWlswnDm7ftEWfwQ54-zBnQQWpN3s4","pdfSize":"346083","txDigest":"GqT69J1Co5v3SfrYSMpbbQHQsUjJ5Dj69Qs89YaHzKwL","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
