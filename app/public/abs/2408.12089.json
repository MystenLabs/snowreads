We also find that the spectral form\nfactor for these integrable systems exhibits a ramp. However, in contrast to\nchaotic systems, the ramp is nonlinear, and the out-of-time-ordered correlators\ndisplay power-law growth for certain operators and Gaussian dynamics. These\nfindings indicate that information scrambling driven by randomness is distinct\nfrom quantum chaos. Moreover, our results provide insight into the dynamics of\nGaussian states in continuous-variable systems, which are useful and available\nresources for quantum information processing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
