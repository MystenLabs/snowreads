The formalism is developed in a\ntransparent way, tailored to the application to real-world problems. Three\nexamples of the application of the theory are detailed: first, an old problem,\nrelating to the return period of floods caused by the Rh{\\^o}ne river, is\nrevisited; second, the frequency of occurrence and the severity of meteorite\nimpacts on the Earth are examined; the data, which are analysed in the third\nexample, relate to the longevity of supercentenarians.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OzDIlsqcbN7mbukgtU4JrIpj0dVjJehGJKhadIH95a4","pdfSize":"590997"}
