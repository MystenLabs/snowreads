This threshold can be wasteful in practical\napplications. We discuss how this threshold can be improved under additional\ndistributional assumptions on the e-values; some of these assumptions are\nnaturally plausible and empirically observable, without knowing explicitly the\nform or model of the e-values. For small values of $\\alpha$, the threshold can\nroughly be improved (divided) by a factor of $2$ for decreasing or unimodal\ndensities, and by a factor of $e$ for decreasing or unimodal-symmetric\ndensities of the log-transformed e-value. Moreover, we propose to use the\nsupremum of comonotonic e-values, which is shown to preserve the type-I error\nguarantee. We also propose some preliminary methods to boost e-values in the\ne-BH procedure under some distributional assumptions while controlling the\nfalse discovery rate. Through a series of simulation studies, we demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our proposed methods in various testing scenarios, showing\nenhanced power.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
