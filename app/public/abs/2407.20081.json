However, the\nnature and ground state of the most anisotropic case, the triangular-lattice\nIsing antiferromagnet (TLIAF), remains elusive and controversial. Here, we\nreport specific heat and thermal conductivity measurements on a\nnewly-discovered Ising-type QSL candidate PrMgAl11O19. At zero field, the\nmagnetic specific heat shows a quadratic temperature dependence. On the\ncontrary, no direct positive magnetic contribution to thermal conductivity was\ndetected, ruling out the presence of mobile gapless fermionic excitations.\nFurther analysis of phonon thermal conductivity reveals that the phonons are\nstrongly scattered by thermally-activated magnetic excitations out of a gap,\nwhich exhibits a linear dependence with magnetic field. These results\ndemonstrate that the spin-1/2 TLIAF PrMgAl11O19 has a gapped Z2 QSL ground\nstate.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
