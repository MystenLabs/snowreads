Taking inspiration from Frank Herbert's\n\"Dune\", where the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood uses the Voice for influence,\nmanipulation, and control of people, we explore how generative AI provides a\nway to implement individualized influence at industrial scales. Already, these\nmodels can manipulate communication across text, image, speech, and most\nrecently video. They are rapidly becoming affordable enough for any\norganization of even moderate means to train and deploy. If employed by\nmalicious actors, they risk becoming powerful tools for shaping public opinion,\nsowing discord, and undermining organizations from companies to governments. As\nresearchers and developers, it is crucial to recognize the potential for such\nweaponization and to explore strategies for prevention, detection, and defense\nagainst these emerging forms of sociotechnical manipulation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
