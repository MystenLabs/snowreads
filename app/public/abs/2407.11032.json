Since obtaining data can be costly\nfor the participants and sharing unique data poses the risk of losing\ncompetitive advantages, motivating the participation of all parties through\nequitable rewards and incentives is necessary. This paper devises an evaluation\nscheme to measure the value of each party's data contribution to the common\nlearning task, tailored to causal inference's statistical demands, by comparing\ncompleted partially directed acyclic graphs (CPDAGs) inferred from\nobservational data contributed by the participants. The Data Valuation Scheme\nthus obtained can then be used to introduce mechanisms that incentivize the\nagents to contribute data. It can be leveraged to reward agents fairly,\naccording to the quality of their data, or to maximize all agents' data\ncontributions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
