The \"tunes\" of the music are presented in\nso-called \"ABC notation\" as simply a sequence of letters from an alphabet: We\nhave no rhythmic variation, with all notes being of equal length. Our\nestimation of algorithmic complexity can be used to distinguish \"simple\" or\n\"easy\" tunes (with more repetition) from \"difficult\" ones (with less\nrepetition) which should prove useful for students learning tunes. We further\npresent a comparison of two tune categories (reels and jigs) in terms of their\ncomplexity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
