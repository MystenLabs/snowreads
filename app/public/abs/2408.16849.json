However, the academic community's efforts to develop\npredictive models for adolescent online learning adaptability require further\nrefinement and expansion. Utilizing data from the \"Chinese Adolescent Online\nEducation Survey\" spanning the years 2014 to 2016, this study implements five\nmachine learning algorithms - logistic regression, K-nearest neighbors, random\nforest, XGBoost, and CatBoost - to analyze the factors influencing adolescent\nonline learning adaptability and to determine the model best suited for\nprediction. The research reveals that the duration of courses, the financial\nstatus of the family, and age are the primary factors affecting students'\nadaptability in online learning environments. Additionally, age significantly\nimpacts students' adaptive capacities. Among the predictive models, the random\nforest, XGBoost, and CatBoost algorithms demonstrate superior forecasting\ncapabilities, with the random forest model being particularly adept at\ncapturing the characteristics of students' adaptability.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-8YKHzsKBPRtU1Rd6VBrIRBjVx5SLKN2XsX-TkO5rWA","pdfSize":"416585"}
