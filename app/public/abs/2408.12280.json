We report on steering inequalities that\nremain unaffacted when introducing up to a threshold magnitude of measurement\nimprecision. This phenomenon, which we call an imprecision plateau, thus\npermits a departure from the standard assumption of idealised measurements\nwithout any incuring cost to the detection power of steering experiments. We\nprovide an explanation for why imprecision plateaus are possible, a simple\ncriterion for their existence and tools for analysing their properties. We also\ndemonstrate that these plateaus have natural applications when the assumption\nof perfect measurements is relaxed: they allow for maintaining both the noise-\nand loss-robustness of standard steering tests and the performance rate of\nidealised one-sided device-independent random number generators.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
