Using the canonical line bundle $K$ and some\nholomorphic differentials $\\boldsymbol{q}$, Hitchin constructed the $G$-Higgs\nbundles in the Hitchin section for a split real form $G$ of a complex simple\nLie group. We study the ${\\mathrm{SO}_0(n,n)}$ case. In our work, we establish\nthe existence of harmonic metrics for these Higgs bundles, which are compatible\nwith the ${\\mathrm{SO}_0(n,n)}$-structure for any non-compact hyperbolic\nRiemann surface. Moreover, these harmonic metrics also weakly dominate $h_X$\nwhich is the natural diagonal harmonic metric induced by the unique complete\nK\\\"ahler hyperbolic metric $g_X$ on $X$. Assuming that these holomorphic\ndifferentials are all bounded with respect to the metric $g_X$, we are able to\nprove the uniqueness of such a harmonic metric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zliM01-pyf7mVHg4eTc5C81b6fADHp-ubRdAOXdpv7g","pdfSize":"519647"}
