We find that, when compared to\ntwo pre-existing model grids, the pseudo-bolometric light curve is consistent\nwith drastically different combinations of progenitor and explosion properties.\nThis may be an effect of known degeneracies in Type IIP light-curve models. We\nindependently compute a large grid of ${\\tt MESA+STELLA}$ single-star\nprogenitor and light-curve models with various zero-age main-sequence masses,\nmass-loss efficiencies, and convective efficiencies. Using the observed\nprogenitor variability as an additional constraint, we select stellar models\nconsistent with the pulsation period and explode them according to previously\nestablished scaling laws to match plateau properties. Our hydrodynamic modeling\nindicates that SN 2023ixf is most consistent with a moderate-energy ($E_{\\rm\nexp}\\approx7\\times10^{50}$ erg) explosion of an initially high-mass red\nsupergiant progenitor ($\\gtrsim 17\\ M_{\\odot}$) that lost a significant amount\nof mass in its prior evolution, leaving a low-mass hydrogen envelope ($\\lesssim\n3\\ M_{\\odot}$) at the time of explosion, with a radius $\\gtrsim 950\\ R_{\\odot}$\nand a synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass of $0.07\\ M_{\\odot}$. We posit that previous\nmass transfer in a binary system may have stripped the envelope of SN 2023ixf's\nprogenitor. The analysis method with pulsation period presented in this work\noffers a way to break degeneracies in light-curve modeling in the future,\nparticularly with the upcoming Vera C.~Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space\nand Time, when a record of progenitor variability will be more common.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
