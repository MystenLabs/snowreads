Previous research has categorized GPS\nreception conditions into line-of-sight (LOS), non-line-of-sight (NLOS), and\nLOS+NLOS scenarios to enhance accuracy. This paper introduces a novel approach\nusing quantum support vector machines (QSVM) with a ZZ feature map and fidelity\nquantum kernel to classify urban GPS signal reception conditions, comparing its\nperformance against classical SVM methods. While classical SVM has been\npreviously explored for this purpose, our study is the first to apply QSVM to\nthis classification task. We conducted experiments using datasets from two\ndistinct urban locations to train and evaluate SVM and QSVM models. Our results\ndemonstrate that QSVM achieves superior classification accuracy compared to\nclassical SVM for urban GPS signal datasets. Additionally, we emphasize the\nimportance of appropriately scaling raw data when utilizing QSVM.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
