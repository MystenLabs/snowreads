We\nrefer to these lines as Bose-Fermi-Braided (BFB) symmetries and argue that they\ncan be classified. Unlike the case of generic anyonic lines, BFB symmetries are\nclosely related to groups. In particular, when BFB lines are non-invertible,\nthey are non-intrinsically non-invertible. Moreover, BFB symmetries are, in a\ncategorical sense, weakly group theoretical. Using this understanding, we study\ninvariants of renormalization group flows involving non-topological QFTs with\nBFB symmetry.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
