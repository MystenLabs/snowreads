This problem and its higher dimensional\ngeneralization have been studied by many mathematicians, including Minkowski,\nvan der Waerden, Hadwiger, Swinnerton-Dyer, Watson, Levenshtein, Odlyzko,\nSloane and Musin. In this paper, we introduce and study a further\ngeneralization of the kissing numbers for convex bodies and obtain some exact\nresults, in particular for balls in dimensions three, four and eight.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
