This\npaper provides a generic diagnostic that assesses whether a given linear\nregression specification on a given dataset admits a design-based\ninterpretation. To do so, we define a notion of potential weights, which encode\ncounterfactual decisions a given regression makes to unobserved potential\noutcomes. If the specification does admit such an interpretation, this\ndiagnostic can find a vector of unit-level treatment assignment probabilities\n-- which we call an implicit design -- under which the regression estimates a\ncausal effect. This diagnostic also finds the implicit causal effect estimand.\nKnowing the implicit design and estimand adds transparency, leads to further\nsanity checks, and opens the door to design-based statistical inference. When\napplied to regression specifications studied in the causal inference\nliterature, our framework recovers and extends existing theoretical results.\nWhen applied to widely-used specifications not covered by existing causal\ninference literature, our framework generates new theoretical insights.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
