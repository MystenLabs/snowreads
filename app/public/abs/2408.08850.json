We apply the method of regions to\nsystematically expand in the small ratio $r/\\rho$ and illustrate this approach\nfor evaluating Fourier transform integrals, which have been the bottleneck for\nderiving complete results in position space. In the limit where the distant\nthird body is much heavier than the other two, we derive new analytic results\nin position space for the three-body conservative potential at\n$\\mathcal{O}(G^2)$ and at leading and next-to-leading order in $r/\\rho$. We\nalso provide necessary formulae for deriving results for arbitrary masses in\nthe rest frame of the distant particle. Our results are exact in velocity, and\ncan be used in analyses involving both bound and unbound hierarchical triples\nin astrophysical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
