The emerging orbital angular momentum (OAM),\nwhich is a property describing the helical phase fronts of electromagnetic\nwaves, offers the potential to improve reliability and increase SE in wireless\ncommunications. To achieve efficient anti-jamming and increase SE of wireless\ncommunications with slight computational complexity cost, in this paper we\npropose an index-modulation embedded mode-hopping (IM-MH) scheme, which\nsimultaneously activates several OAM-modes for hopping along with additional\nindex information and signal information transmission. We analyze the average\nbit error rates (ABERs) for our proposed IM-MH scheme with perfect channel\nstate information (CSI) and imperfect CSI, respectively. We also propose the\nindex-modulation embedded double-serial MH (IMDSMH) scheme, which randomly\nactivates one OAM-mode as the serial second hop to transmit the hopping signals\nin the IM-MH scheme, to further decrease the ABER of wireless communications.\nExtensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed schemes within a\nnarrowband can achieve the low ABER and significantly increase the SE. Also,\nthe ABERs of our proposed IM-MH and IM-DSMH schemes are around 25% and 10%,\nrespectively, compared with that of the mode hopping scheme.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
