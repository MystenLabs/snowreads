Such long-range\ninteractions, decaying with inter-particle distance $r$ as $1/r^s$ in $d$\ndimensions, are known to fall into two qualitatively different categories. For\n$s<d$ (\"strongly\" long-range interactions) there are screening of correlations\nand suppression of large-wavelength density fluctuations (hyperuniformity).\nThese effects eliminate density modes with arbitrarily large energy. For $s>d$\n(\"weakly\" long-range interactions) screening and hyperuniformity do not occur.\nUsing scaling arguments, variational analysis, and Monte Carlo simulations, we\nfind another qualitative distinction. For $s\\geq d/2$ the strong repulsion at\nshort distances leads to enhanced small-wavelength density fluctuations,\ndecorrelating particle positions. This prevents indefinitely negative entropy\nand large energy fluctuations. The distinct behaviors for $s\\geq d/2$ and\n$s<d/2$ give rise to qualitatively different dependencies of the entropy, heat\ncapacity, and energy fluctuations on temperature and density. We investigate\nthe effect of introducing an upper cutoff distance in the pair-potential. The\neffect of the cutoff on energy fluctuations is strong for $s<d/2$ and\nnegligible for $s\\geq d/2$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CFuiSw-i-MwYtFtj8yBy3G5x3yDyhERF1bzSFapuqpU","pdfSize":"1032042"}
