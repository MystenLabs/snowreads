In low carbon systems, generation from renewable energy sources\ndisplaces conventional fossil fuel power plants resulting in lower system-level\nemissions and emissions intensity. However, we find that intermittent\ngeneration from renewables changes the way conventional thermal power plants\noperate, and that the displacement of generation is not 1 to 1 as expected. Our\nwork provides a method that allows policy and decision makers to continue to\ntrack the effect of additional renewable capacity and the resulting thermal\npower plant operational responses.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"cqygcA-O3l8K6zQaskRRIibjntEB2EXTirFkYWr91Ww","pdfSize":"13802846"}
