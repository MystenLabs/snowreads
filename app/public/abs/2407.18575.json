Up to now, the existence conditions\nof this state rely on the presence of a double well in the KH potential,\nobtained by averaging the motion over one period of the laser. However, the\napproximation involved in the averaging is largely invalid in the region of the\ndouble well structure; therefore this raises the question of its relevance for\nidentifying signatures of these exotic states. Here we present a method to\nestablish conditions for the existence of the KH atom based on a\nnonperturbative approach. We show that the KH atom is structured by an\nasymmetric periodic orbit with the same period as the laser field in a wide\nrange of laser parameters. Its imprint is clearly visible on the wavefunction\nin quantum simulations. We identify the range of parameters for which this KH\nstate is effective, corresponding to an elliptic periodic orbit.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
