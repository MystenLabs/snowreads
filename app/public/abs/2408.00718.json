This study marks\nthe first integration and evaluation of MRENS in a full-fledged MILP solver,\nspecifically coupled with the recently-introduced Lagromory separator for\ngenerating multiple reference solutions. Computational experiments on the\nMIPLIB 2017 benchmark set show that MRENS, with multiple reference solutions,\nimproves the solver's ability to find higher-quality feasible solutions\ncompared to single-reference approaches. This study highlights the potential of\nmulti-reference heuristics in enhancing primal heuristics in MILP solvers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fYfosO6v8F3iqHkQHEZ0FiZJ25MiWZ6BuGxKZHaANXw","pdfSize":"131709"}
