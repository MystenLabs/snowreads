In this paper, we consider a general class of\npolar secrecy codes for wiretap channels and study their finite-length\nperformance. In particular, bounds on the normalized mutual information\nsecurity (MIS) leakage, a fundamental measure of secrecy in\ninformation-theoretic security frameworks, are presented for polar secrecy\ncodes. The bounds are utilized to characterize the finite-length scaling\nbehavior of polar secrecy codes, where scaling here refers to the\nnon-asymptotic behavior of both the gap to the secrecy capacity as well as the\nMIS leakage. Furthermore, the bounds are shown to facilitate characterizing\nnumerical bounds on the secrecy guarantees of polar secrecy codes in finite\nblock lengths of practical relevance, where directly calculating the MIS\nleakage is in general infeasible.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
