One major issue is the lack of\nmetrics that can simultaneously generate fast and accurate evaluations based on\neither object detection or point cloud data. In this study, we propose a novel\nLiDAR perception entropy metric based on the probability of vehicle grid\noccupancy. This metric reflects the influence of point cloud distribution on\nvehicle detection performance. Based on this, we also introduce a LiDAR\ndeployment optimization model, which is solved using a differential\nevolution-based particle swarm optimization algorithm. A comparative experiment\ndemonstrated that the proposed PE-VGOP offers a correlation of more than 0.98\nwith vehicle detection ground truth in evaluating LiDAR perception performance.\nFurthermore, compared to the base deployment, field experiments indicate that\nthe proposed optimization model can significantly enhance the perception\ncapabilities of various types of LiDARs, including RS-16, RS-32, and RS-80.\nNotably, it achieves a 25% increase in detection Recall for the RS-32 LiDAR.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
