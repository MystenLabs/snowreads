Here $\\mathscr{F}$ is a family of\nsubsets of $\\mathbb{N}$. Examples of positively thick expansive and positively\nsyndetic expansive maps are constructed here. Also, we obtain conditions under\nwhich a positively expansive map is positively co--finite expansive and\npositively syndetic expansive maps. Further, we study several properties of $p\n\\:\\mathscr{F}-$expansive maps. A characterization of $p\n\\:\\mathscr{F}-$expansive maps in terms of $p \\:\\mathscr{F}^*-$generator is\nobtained. Here $p \\:\\mathscr{F}^*$ is dual of $\\mathscr{F}$. Considering\n$(\\mathbb{Z},+)$ as a semigroup, we study $\\mathscr{F}-$expansive\nhomeomorphism, where $\\mathscr{F}$ is a family of subsets of $\\mathbb{Z}\n\\setminus \\{0\\}$. We show that there does not exists an expansive homeomorphism\non a compact metric space which is $\\mathscr{F}_s-$expansive. Also, we study\nrelation between $\\mathscr{F}-$expansivity of $f$ and the shift map $\\sigma_f$\non the inverse limit space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
