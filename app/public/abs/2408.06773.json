Specifically,\ntunable broadband energy localization in nanoscale hotspots offers a wide range\nof applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics. We experimentally\ndemonstrate a novel principle for the local enhancement of electromagnetic\nfields, based on strong suppression of backscattering. This is achieved at a\ndesigned termination of a topologically non-trivial waveguide that nearly\npreserves the valley degree of freedom. The symmetry origin of the valley\ndegree of freedom prevents edge states to undergo intervalley scattering at\nwaveguide discontinuities that obey the symmetry of the crystal. Using\nnear-field microscopy, we reveal that this can lead to strong confinement of\nlight at the termination of a topological photonic waveguide, even without\nbreaking time-reversal symmetry. We emphasize the importance of symmetry\nconservation by comparing different waveguide termination geometries,\nconfirming that the origin of suppressed backscattering lies with the\nnear-conservation of the valley degree of freedom, and show the broad bandwidth\nof the effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
