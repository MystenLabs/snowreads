By\napplying this law, one of the players (or both of them) defines lower and upper\nutility thresholds, such that once the lower threshold is established,\nbargaining continues in the inter-threshold domain where the solutions are\nacceptable to both parties. This provides a sequential solution to the\nbargaining problem, and it can be implemented iteratively reaching well-defined\noutcomes. The solution is Pareto-optimal, symmetric, and is invariant to\naffine-transformations of utilities. For susceptible players, iterations are\nunnecessary, so they converge in one stage toward the (axiomatic) Nash solution\nof the bargaining problem. This situation also accounts for the asymmetric Nash\nsolution, where the weights of each player are expressed via their Weber\nconstants. Thus the Nash solution is reached without external arbiters and\nwithout requiring the independence of irrelevant alternatives. For\nnon-susceptible players our approach leads to different results.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"YaSyOrVpVe0l3-Q5bdRYYlHW3jUGLCWPan5sWxef5T8","pdfSize":"398531"}
