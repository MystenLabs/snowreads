Many RV Tauri variable stars were originally classified decades ago\nusing visual observations and photographic plates. However, recent studies\nsuggest that there are imposters, or misclassified variables, amongst the\nsample of RV Tau stars. In this study, we examine 84 known and suspected RV Tau\nstars that appear in the variable star catalog of the All Sky Automated Survey\nfor Supernova (ASAS-SN). For each ASAS-SN light curve, we performed a period\nanalysis and compared our results with those of the General Catalog of\nVariables Stars (GCVS) and the automatic classification algorithm used by\nASAS-SN. We found that the pattern of alternating minima present in RV Tau\nvariable stars often confuses automatic classification. Our results include\nupdated periods and classifications for our sample. Our study provides an\nimportant step towards obtaining a robust sample of RV Tau variable stars to\nbetter understand the pulsation mechanism and the evolutionary pathway of these\nvariable stars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IILmujOgZ2mAYgOKjPLTHDgznkJLHvga3bw2W12J46Y","pdfSize":"2293674"}
