The proposed\nMBPF consists of an interdigital capacitor as a series capacitance in the top\nlayer, leading to improve the stopband performance in the pass band range of\n700 to 760 MHz, which makes it suitable for wireless power transfer (WPT)\nsystems by rejecting unwanted signals. In order to validate the performance of\nthe proposed technique, the MBPF is fabricated on the RO-4003 substrate and\ngreat agreement is achieved between simulated and measured results. The stop\nband attenuations of greater than 52 dB and 20 dB are obtained around the\n0.8xfcl (lower cutoff frequency) and 1.2xfcu (upper cutoff frequency),\nrespectively.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
