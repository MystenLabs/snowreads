Here, we\nreport the results from a 53 ks XMM-Newton observation to compare with studies\nfor the previous outburst, particularly focusing on high-resolution\nspectroscopy using the same instrument (RGS) that produced important results\nfor this source during the previous outburst. The EPIC light curve reveals a\ntype I X-ray burst at MJD 60492.31. The entire data are divided into burstless,\npre-, and post-burst spectra to understand the effect of the burst on the\nionization structure. The spectra for dip and non-dip phases are also created.\nThe primary spectral feature in all phases is a broad O VII recombination line,\nalong with velocity-broadened OVIII, NVII, and Ne IX lines. Notably, the Ne IX\nline is detected at different ionization states for the pre-burst (11.65 \\AA)\nand post-burst (13.56 \\AA) phases. The O VIII line profile also shows a\ndifference in equivalent width between dip and non-dip phases. These findings\nsuggest the presence of highly ionized circumstellar material or collisionally\nionized gas affected by the burst and dips. The source remains in a soft\nspectral state, which is consistent with observations during the previous\noutburst.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
