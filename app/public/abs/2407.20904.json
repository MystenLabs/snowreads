Theory and Methods: Our design focuses on the acquisition and\nreconstruction of navigator-free MB multishot UDS diffusion imaging. For\nacquisition, radiofrequency (RF) pulse encoding was employed to achieve\nControlled Aliasing in Parallel Imaging (CAIPI) in MB imaging. For\nreconstruction, a new algorithm named slice-POCS-enhanced Inherent Correction\nof phase Errors (slice-POCS-ICE) was proposed to simultaneously estimate\ndiffusion-weighted images and inter-shot phase variations for each slice. The\nefficacy of the proposed methods was evaluated in both numerical simulation and\nin vivo experiments. Results: In both numerical simulation and in vivo\nexperiments, slice-POCS-ICE estimated phase variations more precisely and\nprovided results with better image quality than other methods. The inter-shot\nphase variations and MB slice aliasing artifacts were simultaneously resolved\nusing the proposed slice-POCS-ICE algorithm. Conclusion: The proposed\nnavigator-free MB multishot UDS acquisition and reconstruction method is an\neffective solution for high-efficiency, high-resolution diffusion imaging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Medical Physics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
