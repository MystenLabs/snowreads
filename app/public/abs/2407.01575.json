Here, we consider a simplified, 2D\nvariant of the haptic feedback estimation problem and discuss how visibility\ndecompositions greatly simplify the problem. Then, we introduce an efficient,\nconcise algorithm for modeling the dynamics of 2D ropes around polygonal\nobstacles in O($n$) time, where $n$ is the number of line segment obstacles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
