The functional form of the\nconsidered model is $f(R,L_m)=\\frac{R}{2\\kappa}+L_m^{\\,\\,\\alpha}$,\ncorresponding to it the analytic shape function is found. For our analysis, we\nstudy the wormhole spacetimes for three particular models for the redshift\nfunction. We observe that the null energy condition is violated despite a\npositive contribution from the electromagnetic energy density. We also note\nthat electric charges, GUP effects, and higher model parameter values increase\nthe throat length. Further, we have studied the deflection of light using the\nGauss-Bonnet theorem, emphasizing the contribution from GUP by including\nhigher-order terms.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R83Ucp8oNKsNdzArA3GDlWeRVUsPnn4fzyh10MaJ0GQ","pdfSize":"5767317"}
