Given\nthe macroeconomic consequences of changes in unemployment benefits, including\ntheir impact on employment rates and output growth, we develop a closed\nmacroeconomic model that integrates heterogeneous households and adaptive firms\nand incorporates real-world entry-exit market mechanisms. The model considers\npersonal values, social norms, and social network formation among workers as we\nexamine the role of social contacts in mediating the effects of unemployment\nbenefits on job-matching quality and labour market outcomes. We simulate the\nmodel across various scenarios where unemployment benefit schemes differ in\nlevel and/or duration. Our results suggest that extending the duration of\nunemployment benefits does not necessarily improve job-matching quality. Longer\nbenefits may indeed reduce the effectiveness of social networks in job finding,\nindicating that social contacts play a key role in labour market dynamics.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
