Upon placing the cycle of repeating sequence terms in a circle,\nseveral fascinating patterns which would otherwise be overlooked emerge. We\ngeneralize a wealth of known Fibonacci and Lucas statistical identities to the\n$U$ and $V$ settings using primary sources such as Lucas in 1878, Carmichael in\n1913, Wall in 1960, and Vinson in 1963, amongst others. We use many of these\ngeneralized identities to form the theoretical basis for our graphical results.\nBased on the order of $m$, defined as $\\omega(m) := \\frac{\\pi(m)}{e(m)}$, where\n$\\pi(m)$ is the period of $m$ and $e(m)$ is the entry point of $m$, we describe\nbehaviors shared by $U$ and $V$ with parameters $q = \\pm 1$. In particular, we\nexhibit some tantalizing examples in the following three sequence pairs:\nFibonacci and Lucas, Pell and associated Pell, and balancing and\nLucas-balancing.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
