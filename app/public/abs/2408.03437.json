Thus, it is desirable to make the understanding of\nlinear system available in the nonlinear setting. This motivates the search for\nlinearization techniques which are able to represent the nonlinear system by an\nequivalent, linear system. While much progress has been made extending various\nlinearization techniques to larger domains and more delicate attractor\ngeometries, the limitations of such techniques for truly nonlinear dynamics,\nsuch as dynamics with coexisting attractors, have been pointed out recently. In\nthis work, we show that genuinely nonlinear dynamics can be globally\nlinearized. To this end, we investigate systems with a continuous spectrum, a\nlimit cycle, and coexisting solutions and explicitly construct linear systems\nmimicking these nonlinear behaviors as close as possible. We approximate the\ntransformations between linear and nonlinear system with deep neural networks.\nThe obtained linearizations are finite dimensional exceeding the phase space\ndimension of the underlying linear system by one at most.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
