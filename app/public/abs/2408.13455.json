This\nstudy assesses six labeling systems across 1.85 million documents at both paper\nlevel and topic level. Our findings indicate that the SDGO and SDSN systems are\nmore aggressive, while systems such as Auckland, Aurora, SIRIS, and Elsevier\nexhibit significant topic consistency, with similarity scores exceeding 0.75\nfor most SDGs. However, similarities at the paper level generally fall short,\nparticularly for specific SDGs like SDG 10. We highlight the crucial role of\ncontextual information in keyword-based labeling systems, noting that\noverlooking context can introduce bias in the retrieval of papers (e.g.,\nvariations in \"migration\" between biomedical and geographical contexts). These\nresults reveal substantial discrepancies among SDG labeling systems,\nemphasizing the need for improved methodologies to enhance the accuracy and\nrelevance of SDG evaluations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
