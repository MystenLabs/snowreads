Often, seemingly simple dynamics lead to intricate\nemergent properties. Despite their visceral appeal, defining complex systems\nlacks universal agreement. In this paper, I will debunk three prevalent myths\nin complex systems and propose resolutions. This work contributes by offering a\ncontemporary interpretation of complex systems, presenting essential\ndefinitions that benefit complexity scientists.\n","subjects":["Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
