Nonadherence has been linked to\nadverse outcomes, including increased risks of mortality and hospitalization.\nAlthough various methods exist to help patients track medication schedules,\nsuch as the Intelligent Drug Administration System (IDAS) and Smart Blister,\nthese tools often face challenges that hinder their commercial viability.\nBuilding on the principles of dosage measurement and information communication\nin IoT, we introduce the Smart Pill Case a smart health adherence tool that\nleverages RFID-based data recording and NFC-based data extraction. This system\nincorporates a load cell for precise dosage measurement and features an Android\napp to monitor medication intake, offer suggestions, and issue warnings. To\nenhance the effectiveness and personalization of the Smart Pill Case, we\npropose integrating federated learning into the system. Federated learning\nallows the Smart Pill Case to learn from medication adherence patterns across\nmultiple users without compromising individual privacy. By training machine\nlearning models on decentralized data collected from various Smart Pill Cases,\nthe system can continuously improve its recommendations and warnings, adapting\nto the diverse needs and behaviors of users. This approach not only enhances\nthe tools ability to support medication adherence but also ensures that\nsensitive user data remains secure and private.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
