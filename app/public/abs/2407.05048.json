While previous research has applied cellular automata in modeling\nchemical, biological, and physical systems, its potential for modeling\ntopological systems, specifically network topologies, remains underexplored.\nThis paper investigates the use of cellular automata to model decentralized\nnetwork topologies, which could enhance load balancing, fault tolerance,\nscalability, and the propagation and dissemination of information in\ndistributed systems.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Cellular Automata and Lattice Gases","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
