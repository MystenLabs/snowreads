We derive a stable method for computing the operator, which\nconsists of first a Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization of images and a principal\ncomponent analysis of the data. This two-step algorithm provides a spectral\ndecomposition of the linear operator. Moreover, we show that both Gram-Schmidt\nand principal component analysis can be written as a deep neural network, which\nrelates this procedure to de-and encoder networks. Therefore, we call the\ntwo-step algorithm a linear algebra network. Finally, we provide numerical\nsimulations showing the strategy is feasible for reconstructing spectral\nfunctions and for solving operator equations without explicitly exploiting the\nphysical model.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DQddfA8dd2WboWcEM23jmUjbNDB0vpOwWZ32WDsaGnY","pdfSize":"5063821"}
