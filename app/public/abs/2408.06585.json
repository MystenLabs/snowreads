In this study, we performed clustering of the\ncreated polarity indexes using the change-point detection algorithm. In\naddition, we constructed a stock portfolio and rebalanced it at each change\npoint utilizing an optimization algorithm. Consequently, the asset allocation\nmethod proposed in this study outperforms the comparative approach. This result\nsuggests that the polarity index helps construct the equity asset allocation\nmethod.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"ZpEycWc4B1CE1p8cpRMTNtPj7U1Rf-y12p2rf4W9yeo","pdfSize":"114403"}
