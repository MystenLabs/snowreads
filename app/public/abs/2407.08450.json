This survey\nreviews the fundamental features of the matricial solution set of a linear\nmatrix inequality, the free spectrahedron, from the perspective of free real\nalgebraic geometry. Namely, among matricial solution sets of noncommutative\npolynomial inequalities, free spectrahedra are precisely the convex ones.\nFurthermore, a procedure for detecting free spectrahedra and producing their\nrepresenting linear matrix pencils is discussed. Finally, free spectrahedra\nadmit a perfect Positivstellensatz, leading to a semidefinite programming\nformulation of eigenvalue optimization over convex matricial sets constrained\nby noncommutative polynomial inequalities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
