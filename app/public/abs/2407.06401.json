Without a consistent, well-designed, and\nscalable knowledge management scheme, an architecture will be unable to move\npast toy problems and tackle the broader problems of cognition. In this paper,\nwe document some of the challenges we have faced in developing the knowledge\nstack for the Companion cognitive architecture and discuss the tools,\nrepresentations, and practices we have developed to overcome them. We also lay\nout a series of potential next steps that will allow Companion agents to play a\ngreater role in managing their own knowledge. It is our hope that these\nobservations will prove useful to other cognitive architecture developers\nfacing similar challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
