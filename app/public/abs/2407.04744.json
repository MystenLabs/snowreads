We use the Norfolk two- and three-body chiral potentials and\ntheir consistent electromagnetic one- and two-nucleon current operators. We\nfind that two-body contributions to the magnetic moment can be large (up to\n$\\sim33\\%$ in $A=9$ systems). We study the model dependence of these\nobservables and place particular emphasis on investigating their sensitivity to\nusing different cutoffs to regulate the many-nucleon operators. Calculations of\nelastic magnetic form factors for $A\\leq 10$ nuclei show excellent agreement\nwith the data out to momentum transfers $q\\approx 3$ fm$^{-1}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
