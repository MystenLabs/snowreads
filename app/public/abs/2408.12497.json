Ghost hyperbolic phonon polaritons (g-HPs), which have\nbeen recently discovered, feature in-plane hyperbolic dispersion and oblique\nwavefronts, enabling long-range propagation. Despite their potential,\ncontrolling the directionality and selective excitation of g-HPs remains\nchallenging. Our research demonstrates that modifying the shape of the\nlaunching micro/nano antenna can achieve this control. Using an asymmetric\ntriangular gold antenna on a calcite crystal surface, we achieve highly\ndirectional g-HP excitation by selectively targeting specific polariton modes.\nAdditionally, the mode of g-HPs can be adjusted by changing the excitation\nwavelength or rotating the antenna. Remarkably, our near-field imaging\nexperiments show g-HP propagation over distances exceeding 35 micrometers, more\nthan twice the length reported in previous studies. This work merges g-HP\ntheory with structural engineering, enhancing the control over g-HPs and paving\nthe way for innovative applications in mid-IR optoelectronics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
