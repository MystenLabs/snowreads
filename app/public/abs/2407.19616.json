Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is a\ncommon unsupervised approach that decomposes a term frequency-inverse document\nfrequency (TF-IDF) matrix to uncover latent topics and segment the dataset\naccordingly. While useful for highlighting patterns and clustering documents,\nNMF does not provide explicit topic labels, necessitating subject matter\nexperts (SMEs) to assign labels manually. We present a methodology for\nautomating topic labeling in documents clustered via NMF with automatic model\ndetermination (NMFk). By leveraging the output of NMFk and employing prompt\nengineering, we utilize large language models (LLMs) to generate accurate topic\nlabels. Our case study on over 34,000 scientific abstracts on Knowledge Graphs\ndemonstrates the effectiveness of our method in enhancing knowledge management\nand document organization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
