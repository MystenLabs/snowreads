This approach was able to handle the Christoffel\ntransforms of the form $(\\Phi\\mu_1,\\dots,\\Phi\\mu_r)$ for a polynomial $\\Phi$,\nwhere $\\Phi\\mu_j$ is the linear functional defined by $$f(x)\\mapsto \\int\nf(x)\\Phi(x)d\\mu_j(x).$$ For these systems we derived determinantal formulas\ngeneralizing Christoffel's classical theorem. In the current paper, we\ngeneralize these formulas to consider the case of rational perturbations\n$$\\Big(\\frac{\\Phi_1}{\\Psi_{1}} \\mu_1,\\dots,\\frac{\\Phi_r}{\\Psi_r}\\mu_r\\Big),$$\nfor any polynomials $\\Phi_1,\\dots,\\Phi_r$ and $\\Psi_1,\\dots,\\Psi_r$. This\nincludes the general Christoffel transforms $(\\Phi_1\\mu_1,\\dots,\\Phi_r\\mu_r)$\nwith $r$ arbitrary polynomials {$\\Phi_1,\\dots,\\Phi_r$,} as well as the\nanalogous Geronimus transforms. This generalizes a theorem of Uvarov to the\nmultiple orthogonality setting. We allow zeros of the numerators and\ndenominators to overlap which permits addition of pure point measure. The\nformulas are derived for multiple orthogonal polynomials of type I and type II\nfor any multi-index.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
