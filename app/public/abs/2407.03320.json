IXC-2.5 excels\nin various text-image comprehension and composition applications, achieving\nGPT-4V level capabilities with merely 7B LLM backend. Trained with 24K\ninterleaved image-text contexts, it can seamlessly extend to 96K long contexts\nvia RoPE extrapolation. This long-context capability allows IXC-2.5 to excel in\ntasks requiring extensive input and output contexts. Compared to its previous\n2.0 version, InternLM-XComposer-2.5 features three major upgrades in\nvision-language comprehension: (1) Ultra-High Resolution Understanding, (2)\nFine-Grained Video Understanding, and (3) Multi-Turn Multi-Image Dialogue. In\naddition to comprehension, IXC-2.5 extends to two compelling applications using\nextra LoRA parameters for text-image composition: (1) Crafting Webpages and (2)\nComposing High-Quality Text-Image Articles. IXC-2.5 has been evaluated on 28\nbenchmarks, outperforming existing open-source state-of-the-art models on 16\nbenchmarks. It also surpasses or competes closely with GPT-4V and Gemini Pro on\n16 key tasks. The InternLM-XComposer-2.5 is publicly available at\nhttps://github.com/InternLM/InternLM-XComposer.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
