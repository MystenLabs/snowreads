We address the global well-posedness and long-time\ndynamics of the model. In the absence of added charges, we prove that the ionic\nconcentrations decay exponentially fast in time to their initial spatial\naverages in all Sobolev norms. When the fluid undergoes the influence of given\ntime-independent charges, we obtain the existence of a finite-dimensional\nglobal attractor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
