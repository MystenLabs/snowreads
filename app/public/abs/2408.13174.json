By decomposing\nthe interaction of the Bose Hubbard model (BHM) according to Hartree\napproximation, we present a self-consistent formalism for solving the\nopen-system bosonic Lindblad equation with weak interactions in the steady\nstate. The 3rd Q with Hartree approximation takes into account the infinite\nFock space of bosons while its demand of resource scales polynomially with the\nsystem size. We examine the method by analyzing three examples of the BHM,\nincluding the uniform chain, interaction induced diode effect, and\nSu-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) Hubbard model. When compared with the simulations\nwith capped boson numbers for small systems, the 3rd Q with Hartree\napproximation captures the qualitative behavior and suggests an upper bound of\nthe steady-state value. Thus, the manageable 3rd Q with Hartree approximation\nallows us to characterize and predict large-system behavior of quantum\ntransport in interacting bosonic systems relevant to cold-atom experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
