{"id":"2407.10978","title":"Building Artificial Intelligence with Creative Agency and Self-hood","authors":"Liane Gabora and Joscha Bach","authorsParsed":[["Gabora","Liane",""],["Bach","Joscha",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sun, 9 Jun 2024 22:28:11 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-17","timestamp":1717972091000,"abstract":"  This paper is an invited layperson summary for The Academic of the paper\nreferenced on the last page. We summarize how the formal framework of\nautocatalytic networks offers a means of modeling the origins of\nself-organizing, self-sustaining structures that are sufficiently complex to\nreproduce and evolve, be they organisms undergoing biological evolution,\nnovelty-generating minds driving cultural evolution, or artificial intelligence\nnetworks such as large language models. The approach can be used to analyze and\ndetect phase transitions in vastly complex networks that have proven\nintractable with other approaches, and suggests a promising avenue to building\nan autonomous, agentic AI self. It seems reasonable to expect that such an\nautocatalytic AI would possess creative agency akin to that of humans, and\nundergo psychologically healing -- i.e., therapeutic -- internal transformation\nthrough engagement in creative tasks. Moreover, creative tasks would be\nexpected to help such an AI solidify its self-identity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
