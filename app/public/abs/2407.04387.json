For stochastic\ninitial data, we demonstrate that the solution to the interacting particle\nmodel, with an appropriately applied cut-off, converges in probabilistic sense\nto the solution of the characteristics of the regularized Vlasov models\nfeaturing local alignments and Newtonian potential. Notably, the cutoff\nparameter for the singular potential is selected to scale polynomially with the\nnumber of particles, representing an improvement over the logarithmic cut-off\nobtained in [38].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
