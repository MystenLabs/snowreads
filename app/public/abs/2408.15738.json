By modeling the field intensity distribution in the cavity and the\noutput spectrum, the DPS region length and phase shift values have been\noptimized. Experimental comparisons with lasers using traditional {\\pi}-phase\nshifts confirm that DFB lasers with optimized DPS lengths and larger phase\nshifts (up to 15{\\pi}) achieve stable single longitudinal mode operation over a\nbroader current range, with lower threshold current, higher power slope\nefficiency, and a higher side mode suppression ratio (SMSR). Furthermore, the\nminimum optical linewidth is reduced significantly, from 1.3 MHz to 220 kHz.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"jQIu2A0is8PERl8V_XfaUPe34gMCemyFkVYY-BbRGYg","pdfSize":"6355178"}
