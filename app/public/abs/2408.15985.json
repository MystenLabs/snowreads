Using current\ntheoretical and experimental constraints, we calculate production cross\nsections for both unpolarized and polarized beams at center-of-mass energies of\n$\\sqrt{s} = 2$ and 3 TeV, demonstrating that polarized beams significantly\nenhance detection prospects by increasing production rates. By analyzing\nkinematic distributions, we establish optimized selection criteria to\neffectively separate signal events from background. At $\\sqrt{s} = 2$ TeV with\nan integrated luminosity of 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we find exclusion regions within\n$s_R^d\\in[0.085,0.16]$ for $m_T\\in [1000,1260]$ GeV and a discovery potential\nwithin $s_R^d\\in[0.14,0.17]$ for $m_T\\in[1000,1100]$ GeV, with these regions\nexpanding to $s_R^d\\in [0.05,0.15]$ for $m_T\\in[1000,1340]$ GeV and $s_R^d \\in\n[0.11, 0.17]$ for $m_T\\in[1000,1160]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$. At $\\sqrt{s} = 3$\nTeV and 1500 fb$^{-1}$, we identify exclusion regions of\n$s_R^d\\in[0.055,0.135]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1640]$ GeV and discovery regions of\n$s_R^d \\in [0.09, 0.15]$ for $m_T \\in [1000, 1400]$ GeV, which further expand\nto $s_R^d \\in [0.028, 0.12]$ for $m_T\\in[1000,1970]$ GeV and $s_R^d\n\\in[0.04,0.122]$ for $m_T\\in[1000,1760]$ GeV at 3000 fb$^{-1}$. Our findings\nemphasize the increased detection potential at higher center-of-mass energies,\nparticularly at 3 TeV compared to 2 TeV, with notable improvements when\npolarized beams are utilized. We also account for the effects of initial state\nradiation, beamstrahlung, and systematic uncertainties, which influence both\nexclusion and discovery prospects.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G9MTUsCjWhWRLoN5aE6ODBiyzhvK9zOUGT66J8yfIc8","pdfSize":"8938215"}
