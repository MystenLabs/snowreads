Results are\nanalyzed within the supersolid scenario, characterized by the\ntranslation-symmetry-breaking parameter $m_z$ and the rotational supersolid\norder parameter $m_\\perp$. We find very robust $m_z > 0$ in the whole easy-axis\nanisotropy regime $\\alpha = J_\\perp/J_z > 0$, even enhanced by the magnetic\nfield $h>0$. Results support also $m_\\perp >0$ for intermediate $\\alpha <1$ as\nwell as for $h>0$. Still, at small $\\alpha \\ll 1$, relevant for recent\nexperiments on the magnetic material K$_2$Co(SeO$_3$)$_2$, we find at $h=0$\nrather vanishing $m_\\perp \\sim 0$, reflecting the gapped spin excitations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
