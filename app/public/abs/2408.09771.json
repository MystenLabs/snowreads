Our analysis reveals that these\nfluctuations generally decrease over time but experience a pronounced spike\nduring the universe's transition into its later accelerated expansion phase. In\nthe framework of the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, the evolution of these\nfluctuations shows similar behaviour, eventually stabilising at a constant\nminimum value. We also find that these fluctuations are holographically\nconnected, provided the universe ends in a de Sitter phase. This holographic\nconnection suggests that in the final de Sitter epoch, the relative\nfluctuations of the horizon energy and the Komar energy are equivalent, and\nsatisfies, $\\sigma_H^2/\\left<E_H\\right>^2=1/N_{surf}=1/N_{bulk} =\n\\sigma_V^2/\\left<E_V\\right>^2.$\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"90XhLKREQaWT7PTs6zuFvdnKe6WuH7RyYDpSXTmzCmU","pdfSize":"491933"}
