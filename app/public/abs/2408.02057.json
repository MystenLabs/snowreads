A\npromising approach to meeting these requirements is to automate complex network\noperations and create self-adjusting networks. These networks should\nautomatically gather contextual information, analyze how to efficiently ensure\nQoS requirements, and adapt accordingly. This paper presents ReactNET, a\nself-adjusting networked system designed to achieve this vision by leveraging\nemerging network programmability and machine learning techniques.\nProgrammability empowers ReactNET by providing fine-grained telemetry\ninformation, while machine learning-based classification techniques enable the\nsystem to learn and adjust the network to changing conditions. Our preliminary\nimplementation of ReactNET in P4 and Python demonstrates its effectiveness in\nvideo streaming applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YUJIq8C2_DC38atOHdHNAqp16p3FQJUIw3D56BNBZQM","pdfSize":"1387520"}
