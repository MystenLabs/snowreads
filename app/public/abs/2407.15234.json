However, supporting the above function faces networking challenges.\nToday's metaverse implementations are, by and large, use secure transport\nconnections to communicate with cloud servers instead of letting participating\nentities communicate directly. In this paper, we use the design and\nimplementation of NDN Workspace, a web-based, multi-user collaborative app to\nshowcase a new way to networking that supports many-to-many secure data\nexchanges among communicating entities directly. NDN Workspace users establish\ntrust relations among each other, exchange URI-identified objects directly, and\ncan collaborate through intermittent connectivity, all in the absence of cloud\nservers. Its data-centric design offers an exciting new approach to metaverse\napp development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
