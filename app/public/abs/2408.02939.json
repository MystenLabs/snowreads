Then we have calculated the\nproperty of electromagnetic field (E-M field) generated by a single\ntransversely polarized proton ($p^{\\uparrow}$). Based on them, the E-M field\ngenerated in small collision system $p^{\\uparrow}+A$ are studied. We find that\nthe orientation of this E-M field has a significant dependence on the\npolarization direction of the proton, and the correlator ($\\Delta\\gamma$ ) has\nalso significant dependence on the angle between reaction plane and\npolarization direction. This finding provides us a new method for probing the\nchiral magnetic effect (CME).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
