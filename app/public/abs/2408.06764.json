By\nreanalyzing its data observed by Fermi and Swift, we find that an early radio\nafterglow as the physical origin of the radio flash can be ruled out, but the\ncoherent radio emission seems to be consistent with the hypothesis of a\nsupramassive magnetar as the central engine collapsing into a black hole.\nWithin this scenario, the derived magnetar surface magnetic field ($B_{\\rm p}$)\nand the initial spin period ($P_{\\rm 0}$) fall into a reasonable range, but\nrequire to prefer a low value of $\\eta_{\\rm R} = 10^{-7}$ or $10^{-6}$.\nMoreover, the calculated low-$\\varepsilon$ value and $E_{\\rm \\gamma,iso}-E_{\\rm\np}$ correlation of GRB 201006A also support to the progenitor from merger of\ncompact stars. No detected the kilonova emission associated with GRB 201006A to\ncompare with the upper limits of optical observations is also discussed.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
