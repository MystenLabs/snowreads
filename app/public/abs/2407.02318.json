We employ a multimodal fusion approach to combine visual\nand audio features. High-quality visual features are extracted using a\nstate-of-the-art self-supervised pre-training network, resulting in efficient\nvideo feature representations. At the same time, audio features serve as\ncomplementary information to help the model better localize the start and end\nof sounds. The fused features are trained in a multi-scale Transformer for\ntraining. In the final test dataset, we achieved a mean average precision (mAP)\nof 0.33, obtaining the second-best performance in this track.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
