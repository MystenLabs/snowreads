DAMA/LIBRA has released\nupdated analysis results by lowering the energy threshold to 0.75 keV through\nvarious upgrades. They have consistently claimed to have observed the annual\nmodulation. In COSINE-100, it is crucial to lower the energy threshold for a\ndirect comparison with DAMA/LIBRA, which also enhances the sensitivity of the\nsearch for low-mass dark matter, enabling COSINE-100 to explore this area.\nTherefore, it is essential to have a precise and quantitative understanding of\nthe background spectrum across all energy ranges. This study expands the\nbackground modeling from 0.7 to 4000 keV using 2.82 years of COSINE-100 data.\nThe modeling has been improved to describe the background spectrum across all\nenergy ranges accurately. Assessments of the background spectrum are presented,\nconsidering the nonproportionality of NaI(Tl) crystals at both low and high\nenergies and the characteristic X-rays produced by the interaction of external\nbackgrounds with materials such as copper. Additionally, constraints on the fit\nparameters obtained from the alpha spectrum modeling fit are integrated into\nthis model. These improvements are detailed in the paper.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
