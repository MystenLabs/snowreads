On the one hand, if $\\alpha$ is\nsufficiently smooth, then we obtain a priori local regularity estimates for\nsolutions near a curved portion of the boundary of the domain. On the other\nhand, if $\\alpha$ depends on the curvature of the boundary of the domain, then\nwe obtain local boundary estimates of Hessians of solutions where the\nright-hand side does not contain the pressure. Our results are new even if the\nviscosity coefficients are constant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2gpqf95rmel9UkXvvKCy89D7xZUtWGa1fspEQzyZmGw","pdfSize":"992717"}
