Here, we show how to extend\nclassical, Hamiltonian shortcuts to adiabaticity to allow the crossing of a\nphase-space separatrix -- a situation in which a corresponding adiabatic\nprotocol does not exist. Specifically, we show how to construct a\ntime-dependent Hamiltonian that evolves one energy shell to another energy\nshell across a separatrix. Leveraging this method, we design an erasure\nprocedure whose energy cost and fidelity do not depend on the protocol's\nduration.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-uSyLxUFN29G26qx96hc2skuWJdSQaQ4_MjvHNYbsxQ","pdfSize":"846950"}
