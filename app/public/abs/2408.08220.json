Like planar vortex sheets, circular sheets are found to\nbe susceptible to a violent short-wave instability known as the\nKelvin-Helmholtz instability, with some modifications due to vortex sheet\ngeometry. This result is in agreement with the classical derivation of (Moore\n1974, Saffman 1992), but our modern approach provides greater clarity. We go on\nto show that the linear evolution problem can develop a singularity from\nanalytic initial data in a time proportional to the square of the vortex sheet\nradius. Numerical evidence is presented that suggests this linear instability\ncaptures the wave-breaking mechanism observed in nonlinear point vortex\nsimulations. Based on these results, we hypothesize that the Kelvin-Helmholtz\ninstability can contribute to the development of secondary instability for\neddies in two-dimensional turbulent flow.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
