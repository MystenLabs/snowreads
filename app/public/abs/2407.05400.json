The same user's responses to\ndifferent experiments can be correlated to some extent due to the individual\neffect of the user. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that\ncollaboratively analyzes the data from paired A/B tests, namely, a pair of A/B\ntesting experiments conducted on the same set of experimental subjects. The\nproposed analysis approach for paired A/B tests can lead to more accurate\nestimates than the traditional separate analysis of each experiment. We obtain\nthe asymptotic distribution of the proposed estimators and demonstrate that the\nproposed estimators are asymptotically the best linear unbiased estimators\nunder certain assumptions. Moreover, the proposed analysis approach is\ncomputationally efficient, easy to implement, and robust to different types of\nresponses. Both numerical simulations and numerical studies based on a real\ncase are used to examine the performance of the proposed method.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"csKHdxWF-OQ6dI2ET94DzeJLHH23ZhxrRoITHGDI92w","pdfSize":"606318"}
