Or from algebraic $K$-theory perspective, one assigns\na homotopy class $[X \\to K (\\mathcal{K})]$, where $\\mathcal{K}$ is the ring of\ncompact operators on the Hilbert space. We show that there is an analogous\nstory for algebraic $K$-theory of a general commutative ring $k$, replacing\ncomplex vector bundles by certain Hamiltonian fiber bundles. The construction\nactually first assigns elements in a certain categorified algebraic $K$-theory,\nanalogous to To\\\"en's secondary $K$-theory of $k$. And there is a natural map\nfrom this categorified algebraic $K$-theory to the classical variant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
