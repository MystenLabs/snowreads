The new quantization condition takes\nlattice energies as input and returns a version of the discretized scattering\namplitude whose definition is transparent in the context of Symanzik Effective\nTheory. In contrast to the standard formalism, this approach uses single-hadron\ndiscretization effects to define modified versions of the finite-volume zeta\nfunctions. The new formalism requires two sets of angular-momentum indices,\nwhich encode the ultraviolet mixing of angular momentum states (due to the\nlattice spacing), in addition to the well-known infrared mixing (due to the\nfinite volume).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"onoOWhjIxSf0naP0uGJUOuwuxLqu9ZIOAia47QFn_gw","pdfSize":"1033003"}
