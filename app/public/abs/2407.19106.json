It is the first to derive the\nZiv-Zakai bound (ZZB) on TOA estimation for OFDM signals containing both known\npilot and unknown data resources. In comparison to the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs)\nderived in prior work, this ZZB captures the low-signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)\nthresholding effects in TOA estimation and accounts for an unknown carrier\nphase. The derived ZZB is evaluated against CRBs and empirical TOA error\nvariances. It is then evaluated on signals with resource allocations optimized\nfor pilot-only TOA estimation, quantifying the performance gain over the\nbest-case pilot-only signal designs. Finally, the positioning accuracy of\nmaximum-likelihood and decision-directed estimators is evaluated on simulated\nlow-Earth-orbit non-terrestrial-network channels and compared against their\nrespective ZZBs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
