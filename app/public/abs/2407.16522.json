These limiting free boundary problems may be formulated as\nStefan-type problems on an evolving hypersurface. Our results are new even in\nthe setting where there is no domain evolution. The models are of particular\nrelevance to a number of applications in cell biology. The analysis utilises\n$L^\\infty$-estimates in the manner of De Giorgi iterations and other technical\ntools, all in an evolving setting. We also report on numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
