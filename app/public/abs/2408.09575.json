However, by 3D printing samples from a\nphoto-responsive polymer, we can obtain a device whose operating frequency can\nbe fine-tuned dynamically using laser excitation. This greatly enhances\nexisting static tunability strategies, typically based on modifying the\ngeometry. We use a version of the classical Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model to\ndemonstrate our approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"xvc8Fj_dGDa7WuVlYXouMKJ--7hxkHnuiac-FQAV6VE","pdfSize":"6233111"}
