In particular if $\\tau$ is a filling of a rectangular diagram,\nthe triples (inv,quinv,maj) and (quinv,inv,maj) have the same distribution over\n$[\\tau]$. Our main result affirms a conjecture proposed by Ayyer, Mandelshtam\nand Martin (2021), thus presenting the equivalence between two refined formulas\nfor the modified Macdonald polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
