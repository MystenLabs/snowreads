An interesting subelection consists of a reasonably large set of\nvoters and a reasonably large set of candidates such that the former have a\nconsistent opinion about the latter. Consistency may take various forms but we\nfocus on three: Identity (all selected voters rank all selected candidates the\nsame way), antagonism (half of the selected voters rank candidates in some\norder and the other half in the reverse order), and clones (all selected voters\nrank all selected candidates contiguously in the original election). We first\nstudy the computation of such hidden subelections. Second, we analyze synthetic\nand real-life data, and find that identifying hidden consistent subelections\nallows us to uncover some relevant concepts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
