However,\ncurrent approaches raise dependability concerns as they do not account for\nuncertainty. In this work, we compare the performance of Monte Carlo Dropout,\nVariational Inference, Markov Chain Monte Carlo, and Ensemble Learning trained\non 512 patients to predict 4-year cognitive score trajectories with confidence\nbounds. We show that MC Dropout and MCMC are able to produce well-calibrated,\nand accurate predictions under noisy training data.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pV58oqfKPm6HrOVxvDNYTxtv7whGw13UyKjLQNiSxbs","pdfSize":"861296"}
