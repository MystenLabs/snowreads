In this\ncontext, the recent advancements in foundational models show promise in\naddressing this challenge. In our work, we propose PlantTrack where we utilize\nDINOv2 which provides high-dimensional features, and train a keypoint heatmap\npredictor network to identify the locations of semantic features such as fruits\nand leaves which are then used as prompts for point tracking across video\nframes using TAPIR. We show that with as few as 20 synthetic images for\ntraining the keypoint predictor, we achieve zero-shot Sim2Real transfer,\nenabling effective tracking of plant features in real environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Kc5rMhOkdVYn4Z0_fG56BY-JNGn4dXZWQXnrHDuMDJ4","pdfSize":"7131918"}
