Namely, in well-known 2-d integrable models\nthe tree-level massless S-matrix exhibits particle production and fails to\nfactorise. This is conjectured to happen due to IR ambiguities in the massless\ntree-level amplitudes. We present a definition of the massless S-matrix which\nhas all the nice properties of integrable theories, there is no particle\nproduction and the S-matrix factorises. As an example, we present in detail the\ncase of the $SU(2)$ principal chiral model (PCM).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mvBzc-FsTHbmvL1Guw4-zCPt28FNk2cHYwJnT6eb_Ug","pdfSize":"556897"}
