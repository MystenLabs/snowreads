Existing CBO techniques\nare generalized by the proposed method through the employment of multiple\ninteracting populations of particles, each of which is used to optimize one\nlevel of the problem. These particle populations are evolved through\nmultiscale-in-time dynamics, which are formulated as a singularly perturbed\nsystem of stochastic differential equations. Theoretical convergence analysis\nfor the multiscale CBO model to an averaged effective dynamics as the\ntime-scale separation parameter approaches zero is provided. The resulting\nalgorithm is presented for both bi-level and tri-level optimization problems.\nThe effectiveness of the approach in tackling complex multi-level optimization\ntasks is demonstrated through numerical experiments on various benchmark\nfunctions. Additionally, it is shown that the proposed method performs well on\nmin-max optimization problems, comparing favorably with existing CBO algorithms\nfor saddle point problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
