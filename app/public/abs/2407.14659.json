It constitutes the summary of the\nauthor's work concerning the relations between cohomology rings of algebraic\nvarieties and rings of functions on zero schemes and fixed point schemes. It\nincludes the results from the co-authored article arXiv:2212.11836. They are\ncomplemented by: an introduction to the theory of group actions on algebraic\nvarieties, with particular focus on vector fields; a historical overview of the\nfield; a few newer results of the author.\n  The fundamental theorem from arXiv:2212.11836 says that if the principal\nnilpotent has a unique zero, then the zero scheme over the Kostant section is\nisomorphic to the spectrum of the equivariant cohomology ring, remembering the\ngrading in terms of a $\\mathbb{C}$ action. In this thesis, we also tackle the\ncase of a singular variety. As long as it is embedded in a smooth variety with\nregular action, we are able to study its cohomology as well by means of the\nzero scheme. In largest generality, this allows us to see geometrically a\nsubring of the cohomology ring. We also show that the cohomology ring of\nspherical varieties appears as the ring of functions on the zero scheme.\nLastly, the K-theory conjecture is studied, with some results attained for GKM\nspaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
