The present work generalizes our\nearlier model of CR self-modulation (Ivlev et al. 2018, Dogiel et al. 2018), in\nwhich the value for the envelope's gas density where CRs excite MHD waves was\ntreated as a free parameter. Now, we investigate the case where the density\nmonotonically increases toward the center. Assuming that CRs are relativistic,\nwe obtain a universal analytical solution which does not depend on the\nparticular shape of gas distribution in the envelope, and self-consistently\nderive boundaries of the diffusion zone formed within the envelope, where CRs\nare scattered at the self-excited waves. The values of the gas density at the\nboundaries are found to be substantially smaller than those assumed in the\nearlier model, which leads to a significantly stronger modulation of\npenetrating CRs. We compute the impact of CR self-modulation on the gamma-ray\nemission, and show that the results of our theoretical model are in excellent\nagreement with recent observations of nearby giant molecular clouds by Yang et\nal. (2023).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
