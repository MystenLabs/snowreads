However,\nambiguities in the diagnostics used to measure star formation rates (SFRs) and\nother quantities have hampered attempts at reaching definite conclusions. We\napproach this problem by utilizing the physical parameters output of the\nMAGPHYS fitting code, which we apply to the Ultraviolet-to-Far Infrared\n(UV-to-FIR) photometry, in $\\geq$20 bands, of spatially-resolved regions in the\ntwo galaxies. We separate the regions in arm and interarm, and study the\ndistributions of the specific SFRs (sSFRs=SFR/M$_{star}$), stellar ages and\nstar formation efficiency (SFE=SFR/M$_{gas}$). We find that the distributions\nof these parameters in the arm regions are almost indistinguishable from those\nin the interarm regions, with typical differences of a factor 2 or less in the\nmedians. These results support the 'gatherer' scenario of spiral arms, which we\nplan to test with a larger sample in the near future.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
