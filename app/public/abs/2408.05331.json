An extensive study of their\npresence and characteristics has been done in classical computer software but\nnot quantum computer software. In this paper, we outline challenges and\npotential solutions for the automated detection of flaky tests in bug reports\nof quantum software. We aim to raise awareness of flakiness in quantum software\nand encourage the software engineering community to work collaboratively to\nsolve this emerging challenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RUen9obiSpxefLDdbCHORiFMUJXiF-MBQKLOgyfxwbo","pdfSize":"68191"}
