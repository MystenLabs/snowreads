While individual steps might not require sophisticated\ncontrol methods, bringing them together as a whole workflow requires advanced\nmanagement mechanisms. In this work, we used RADICAL-EnTK (Ensemble Toolkit) -\none of the SDK components of the ECP ExaWorks project - to implement and\nexecute the novel Exascale Additive Manufacturing (ExaAM) workflows on up to\n8000 compute nodes of the Frontier supercomputer at the Oak Ridge Leadership\nComputing Facility. EnTK allowed us to address challenges such as varying\nresource requirements (e.g., heterogeneity, size, and runtime), different\nexecution environment per workflow, and fault tolerance. And a native\nportability feature of the developed EnTK applications allowed us to adjust\nthese applications for Frontier runs promptly, while ensuring an expected level\nof resource utilization (up to 90%).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
