To enhance\nadaptability as well as robustness to unpredictable traffic demands, and to\nsolve dynamic routing environments efficiently, machine learning-based\nsolutions are being considered. For network control problems, such as\noptimizing packet forwarding decisions according to Quality of Service\nrequirements and maintaining network stability, deep reinforcement learning\ntechniques have demonstrated promising results. For this reason, we investigate\nthe viability of multi-agent deep Q-networks for routing in satellite\nconstellation networks. We focus specifically on reward shaping and quantifying\ntraining convergence for joint optimization of latency and load balancing in\nstatic and dynamic scenarios. To address identified drawbacks, we propose a\nnovel hybrid solution based on centralized learning and decentralized control.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"97bMVOwGHpPP0QHopVn3ZBH50oZ89HJ8g3IT3jdG4TY","pdfSize":"765089"}
