The design of the method is based on a standard variational\nformulation of the problem (no skew-symmetrization), and boundary conditions\nare imposed with a Nitsche technique. We use the enhanced version of VEM, with\na ``DoFi-DoFi'' stabilization in the diffusion and reaction terms. We prove\nstability of the proposed method and derive $h$-version error estimates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
