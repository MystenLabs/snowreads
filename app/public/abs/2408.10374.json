As the operating systems used to\nmanage these systems evolve, special consideration must be given to DRAM\ndevices accessible by FPGAs. These devices may hold sensitive data that can\nbecome inadvertently exposed to adversaries following user logout. Although\naddressed in some cloud FPGA environments, automatic DRAM clearing after\nprocess termination is not automatically included in popular FPGA runtime\nenvironments nor in most proposed cloud FPGA hypervisors. In this paper, we\nexamine DRAM data persistence in AMD/Xilinx Alveo U280 nodes that are part of\nthe Open Cloud Testbed (OCT). Our results indicate that DDR4 DRAM is not\nautomatically cleared following user logout from an allocated node and\nsubsequent node users can easily obtain recognizable data from the DRAM\nfollowing node reallocation over 17 minutes later. This issue is particularly\nrelevant for systems which support FPGA multi-tenancy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"6Nsc343fKpKoGYInRZcfHQJH7aVhrwLqNYSJx0JbVEk","pdfSize":"7267099"}
