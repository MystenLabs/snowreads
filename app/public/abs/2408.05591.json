First, we provide a\ndetailed prescription for setting up initial conditions in the field. This\nprescription allows us to specify the power spectra of the fields (peaked on\nsubhorizon length scales and without a homogeneous field mode), and\nimportantly, also correctly reproduces the behaviour of density perturbations\non large length scales consistent with superhorizon adiabatic perturbations. We\nthen evolve the fields using a spatially inhomogeneous Klein-Gordon equation,\nincluding the effects of expansion and radiation-sourced metric perturbations.\nWe show how gravity enhances, and how free streaming erases the initially\nadiabatic density perturbations of the field, revealing more of the underlying,\nnon-evolving, white-noise isocurvature density contrast. Furthermore, we\nexplore the effect of non-gravitational self-interactions of the field,\nincluding oscillon formation, on the suppression dynamics. As part of this\npaper, we make our code, ${\\sf{Cosmic-Fields-Lite}}$ (${\\sf{CFL}}$), publicly\navailable. For observationally accessible signatures, our work is particularly\nrelevant for structure formation in light/ultralight dark matter fields.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
