We\nincorporate the model within a larger system that includes frame-caption\nalignment, latent space vector clustering, and a novel LLM-based cluster\ninterpreter. We measure, tune, and apply this system to the task of summarizing\na video into three to five thematic clusters, with each theme described by ten\nLLM-produced phrases. We apply this system to two news topics, COVID-19 and the\nWinter Olympics, and five other topics are in progress.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l3JloMKMD_-A8f9QBvrGyiFoMpMTuqK3RgapQSTntnw","pdfSize":"2844827"}
