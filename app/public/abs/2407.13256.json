The tensorial and L\\\"owdin subspace\nrepresentations are implemented and compared. Full analytical DFT+$U$+$J$\nforces are implemented and benchmarked for the tensorial and L\\\"owdin\nrepresentations. We also present the implementation of the recently proposed\nminimum-tracking linear-response method that enables the $U$ and $J$ parameters\nto be calculated on first principles basis without reference to the Kohn-Sham\neigensystem. These implementations are benchmarked against recent results for\ndifferent materials properties including DFT+$U$ band gap opening in NiO, the\nrelative stability of various polaron distributions in TiO$_2$, the dependence\nof the calculated TiO$_2$ band gap on +$J$ corrections, and, finally, the role\nof the +$U$ and +$J$ corrections for the computed properties of a series of the\nhexahydrated transition metals. Our implementation provides results consistent\nwith those already reported in the literature from comparable methods. We\nconclude the contribution with tests on the influence of the L\\\"owdin\northonormalization on the occupancies, calculated parameters, and derived\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9KkdYMH49VBbstKOer4aupRIO2XuKxmOH8tdR5JdLrs","pdfSize":"2280842"}
