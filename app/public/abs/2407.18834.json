This is\nfar from human capabilities and from what is needed in real-world applications.\nIn this work, we address this gap by training shape-conditioned agents to\nreorient diverse objects in hand, relying purely on tactile feedback (via\ntorque and position measurements of the fingers' joints). To achieve this, we\npropose a learning framework that exploits shape information in a reinforcement\nlearning policy and a learned state estimator. We find that representing 3D\nshapes by vectors from a fixed set of basis points to the shape's surface,\ntransformed by its predicted 3D pose, is especially helpful for learning\ndexterous in-hand manipulation. In simulation and real-world experiments, we\nshow the reorientation of many objects with high success rates, on par with\nstate-of-the-art results obtained with specialized single-object agents.\nMoreover, we show generalization to novel objects, achieving success rates of\n$\\sim$90% even for non-convex shapes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
