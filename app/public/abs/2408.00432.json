These\nsimulations show the formation and evolution of a Milky Way-sized galaxy using\neight of the most widely used numerical codes in the community (Art-I, Enzo,\nRamses, Changa, Gadget-3, Gear, Gizmo, and Arepo). In this short report, we\ndescribe the public release of the raw output data from all of these\nsimulations at z = 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 (plus at z=1, 0 when available), and\nseveral metadata files containing the halo centers, virial quantities, and\nmerger trees. The data from even thinner timesteps will be released as soon as\nthe upcoming collaboration papers (VII-IX) are submitted and accepted.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
