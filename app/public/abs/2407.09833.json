To\naddress these limitations and enhance the robustness and precision of motion\ncapture with noise interference, we introduce LiveHPS++, an innovative and\neffective solution based on a single LiDAR system. Benefiting from three\nmeticulously designed modules, our method can learn dynamic and kinematic\nfeatures from human movements, and further enable the precise capture of\ncoherent human motions in open settings, making it highly applicable to\nreal-world scenarios. Through extensive experiments, LiveHPS++ has proven to\nsignificantly surpass existing state-of-the-art methods across various\ndatasets, establishing a new benchmark in the field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
