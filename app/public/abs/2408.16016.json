The qandies model is already used to explain the essential\nconcepts of quantum science and quantum cryptography. However, teleportation\nand related concepts are yet to be explained. Motivated by this fact, we\ninvestigate and extend the idea of Jacobs and Lin-Mor-Shapira to explain\nteleportation using qandies. Here, we explicitly design the teleportation\nprotocol and perform a circuit model using qandy gates. The protocol is\nsuccessful when the correlated qandies are appropriately pre-shared and use of\nsome local operations at both ends. The model we develop can be a valuable tool\nfor science and engineering educators who want to help the general public to\ngain more insights into quantum science and technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Popular Physics","Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
