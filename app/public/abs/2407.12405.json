This\npaper introduces a conversion tool for various previously proposed fisheye\ncamera models. It is user-friendly, simple, yet extremely fast and accurate,\noffering conversion capabilities for a broader range of models compared to\nexisting tools. We have verified that models converted using our system perform\ncorrectly in applications such as SLAM. By utilizing our system, researchers\ncan obtain output parameters directly from input parameters without the need\nfor an image set and any recalibration processes, thus serving as a bridge\nacross different fisheye camera models in various research fields. We provide\nour system as an open source tool available at:\nhttps://github.com/eowjd0512/fisheye-calib-adapter\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
