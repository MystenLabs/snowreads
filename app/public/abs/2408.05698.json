A back-to-back configuration allows a higher\ntransverse momentum for $J/\\psi$. We present an extension of a previous work\nwhere we studied $\\cos2\\phi$ azimuthal asymmetry within the TMD factorization\nframework for this process. We present and compare the effect of TMD evolution\non the asymmetry, in two approaches that differ in the parameterization of the\nperturbative tails of the TMDs and the non-perturbative factors. We show that\nthe asymmetry depends on the parameterizations of the non-perturbative Sudakov\nfactors in the larger $b_T$ region and on the perturbative part of the\nevolution kernel. We use NRQCD to estimate the $J/\\psi$ production and show the\neffect of using different long-distance matrix element (LDME) sets. Overall,\nthe asymmetry after incorporating TMD evolution is small, but increases with\nthe transverse momentum imbalance of the $J/\\psi$-jet pair.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1fKwS3VF4B85cdt9kStCDXTN-uEL95ePE4iuPCPleKg","pdfSize":"808739"}
