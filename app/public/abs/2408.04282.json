The\nmodel is free from any dimensionful parameters. The bare ECG emerges as the\nlower energy limit of the Weyl-ECG in the local non-conformal-invariant vacua\n(i.e., broken phase) in the maximally symmetric spacetimes fixing the vacuum\nexpectation value of the scalar field to the Planck mass scale. Here, the\nnatural presence of (anti-) de Sitter backgrounds spontaneously breaks Weyl's\nlocal conformal symmetry akin to the Higgs mechanism, while it is radiatively\nbroken at the renormalization scale at the one-loop level in flat vacua through\nthe Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. The model allows anti-de Sitter and flat spaces\nbut does not allow de Sitter to be vacuum spacetime solutions. The properties\nof the model deserve further exploration, specifically, those of\nnonperturbative (e.g., instantons and/or anti-instantons) contributions, for\nexample, in the resurgence or tachyon condensation context requires detailed\nstudy.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LZLr1iPErqOZtTvRGneaF6MRR02LaefhYBjCPUvMbdI","pdfSize":"437104"}
