Unlike traditional SWIPT systems\nwith fixed-position antennas (FPAs), our FA-assisted system enables dynamic\nreconfiguration of the radio propagation environment by adjusting the positions\nof FAs. This capability enhances both energy harvesting and communication\nperformance. The system comprises a base station (BS) equipped with multiple\nFAs that transmit signals to an energy receiver (ER) and an information\nreceiver (IR), both equipped with a single FA. Our objective is to maximize the\ncommunication rate between the BS and the IR while satisfying the harvested\npower requirement of the ER. This involves jointly optimizing the BS's transmit\nbeamforming and the positions of all FAs. To address this complex convex\noptimization problem, we employ an alternating optimization (AO) approach,\ndecomposing it into three sub-problems and solving them iteratively using first\nand second-order Taylor expansions. Simulation results validate the\neffectiveness of our proposed FA-assisted SWIPT system, demonstrating\nsignificant performance improvements over traditional FPA-based systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
