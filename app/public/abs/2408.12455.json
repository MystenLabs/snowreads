The earliest method for such\nconstruction based on prime numbers was proposed by Ahlswede which relies on\nalgorithms for generation of prime numbers. This method requires knowledge of\n$2^n$ first prime numbers for identification codes with block length $n,$ which\nis not computationally efficient. In this work, we revisit Ahlswede's scheme\nand propose a number of modifications. In particular, employing probabilistic\nprime generation algorithm, we guarantee that the prime keys generation is\npossible in polynomial time. Furthermore, additional improvements in terms of\ntype II upper bound are derived and presented. Finally, we propose a method for\nidentification coding based on hash functions which generalizes the Ahlswede's\nscheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
