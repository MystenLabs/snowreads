In this context, the search for more effective problem-solving\nstrategies becomes a topic of great interest. This paper presents a new dynamic\nthat integrates coevolution into the NK model together with an Erd\\\"os-R\\'enyi\nrandom network, allowing more than one neighbor update. We explore how this\ncoevolution can be employed as an optimization strategy for solving group\nproblems. In recent coevolution models, only one agent is removed and another\nis added to the neighborhood of influence. Here, we allow $L$ agents to be\nchanged, which had a large impact on the system performance. In the analysis of\nthe results, we consider rewiring as a way for the target agent to obtain\ninformation from individuals or groups that were not part of its neighborhood.\nOur simulations demonstrate that coevolution can produces gain on the\ncomputational cost.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"hnCYIMBpA2V6B7XMjmGWlBHR7zQvUQD69Sc8S3Cbb_E","pdfSize":"2214060"}
