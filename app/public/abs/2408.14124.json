They are known as {\\em discommensurations} (or kinks or fronts), {\\em\nadvancing }if the right-asymptotic equilibrium is to the right of the\nleft-asymptotic one, {\\em retreating} otherwise. Following work of Middleton,\nFloria \\& Mazo and Baesens \\& MacKay, there is a threshold tilt $F_d(p/q)\\ge 0$\nup to which there continue to be periodic equilibria of type $(p,q)$ and above\nwhich there is a globally attracting periodically sliding solution in the space\nof sequences of type $(p,q)$.\n  In this paper, we prove that there are values $F_d(p/q\\pm)$ of tilt with\n$0\\le F_d(p/q\\pm) \\le F_d(p/q)$, generically positive and less than $F_d(p/q)$,\nup to which there continue to be equilibrium advancing or retreating\ndiscommensurations, respectively, and such that for $F_d(p/q\\pm) < F <\nF_d(p/q)$ there are periodically sliding discommensurations, apart perhaps from\nexceptional cases with both a degenerate type $(p,q)$ equilibrium and a\ndegenerate advancing equilibrium discommensuration. We give examples, however,\nto show that equilibrium and periodically sliding discommensurations may\nco-exist, both above and below $F_d(p/q\\pm)$, so the case of discommensurations\nis not as clean as that of periodic configurations.\n  On the way, we prove that $F_d(\\omega) \\to F_d(p/q\\pm)$ as $\\omega \\searrow\np/q$ or $\\nearrow p/q$ respectively. Finally, we prove that $F_d(p/q\\pm)=0$ is\nequivalent to the existence of a rotational invariant circle consisting of\nperiodic orbits of type $(p,q)$ and right-going (respectively left-going)\nseparatrices, for the corresponding twist map on the cylinder.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"39CeAUiCJcTINlxeGRQKsWb0et2CiXwQkX_Ppuns4sE","pdfSize":"462485"}
