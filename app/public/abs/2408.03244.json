Simulation-based testing is a\ncommon approach to attempt to verify performance of autonomous systems, but\nassurance also requires formal evidence. This paper introduces the Assurance of\nDigital Assets (ADA) framework, a structured method for the assurance of\ndigital assets, i.e. novel, complex, or intelligent systems enabled by digital\ntechnologies, using contract-based design. Results are shown for an autonomous\nferry assurance case, focusing on collision avoidance during the ferry's\ntransit. Further, we discuss the role of simulation-based testing in verifying\ncompliance to contract specifications, to build the necessary evidence for an\nassurance case.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
