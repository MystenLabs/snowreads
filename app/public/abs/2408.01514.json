The theory is amply\nillustrated with a variety of concrete examples employing scales of Hilbert\nspaces, fractional Sobolev spaces, and domains of (strictly) positive\nfractional powers of operators, employing interpolation theory.\n  In particular, we explicitly describe the domains of positive powers of the\nharmonic oscillator operator in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$ $\\big($and hence that of the\nHermite operator in $L^2\\big(\\mathbb{R}; e^{-x^2}dx)\\big)\\big)$ in terms of\nfractional Sobolev spaces, certain commutation techniques, and positive powers\nof (the absolute value of) the operator of multiplication by the independent\nvariable in $L^2(\\mathbb{R})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aidl-qS6pG8PHzd334XfLk5vk881r3q5IoUekjf6DEA","pdfSize":"590892","txDigest":"B6TKku3TBLSmvmRDkbYhd65Au3oVnvNZ2aB8P5YRkCP2","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
