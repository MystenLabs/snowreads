They allow users to\nengage with a wide range of content and services, enhancing the Internet's\nutility for all. The aesthetics of a website play a crucial role in its overall\neffectiveness and can significantly impact user experience, engagement, and\nsatisfaction. This paper examines the importance of website design aesthetics\nin enhancing user experience, given the increasing number of internet users\nworldwide. It emphasizes the significant impact of first impressions, often\nformed within 50 milliseconds, on users' perceptions of a website's appeal and\nusability. We introduce a novel method for measuring website aesthetics based\non color harmony and font popularity, using fuzzy logic to predict aesthetic\npreferences. We collected our own dataset, consisting of nearly 200 popular and\nfrequently used website designs, to ensure relevance and adaptability to the\ndynamic nature of web design trends. Dominant colors from website screenshots\nwere extracted using k-means clustering. The findings aim to improve\nunderstanding of the relationship between aesthetics and usability in website\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
