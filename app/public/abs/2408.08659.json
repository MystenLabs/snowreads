More generally, the simultaneously (nearly)\ninvariant subspaces with respect to $(S^m)^*$ and $(S^{km+\\gamma})^*$ are\ncharacterised for $m\\geq 3$, $k\\geq 1$ and $\\gamma\\in \\{1,2,\\cdots, m-1\\},$\nwhich leads to a description of (nearly) invariant subspaces with respect to\nhigher order shifts. Finally, the corresponding results for Toeplitz operators\ninduced by a Blaschke product are presented. Techniques used include a\nrefinement of Hitt's algorithm, the Beurling--Lax theorem, and matrices of\nanalytic functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rnTX30ScSLIftpff9SOE97yVEri3333rmMZisRFIS3I","pdfSize":"233904"}
