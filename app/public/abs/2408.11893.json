From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including\neigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third\nquantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain\nthe dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce a new basis\nfor third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the\n$Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator\ncoherent state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional\ncomplex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"RhvCwNa97-RE6LUv7YzM6ZHd_2_YuqmOMMdMGYg4cXk","pdfSize":"366754"}
