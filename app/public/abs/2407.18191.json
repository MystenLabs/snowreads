This\nthermality can be attributed to the time evolution of observers within the\ncausal diamond, governed by one of the conformal quantum mechanics (CQM)\nsymmetry generators: the noncompact hyperbolic operator $S$. In this paper, we\nshow that the unbounded nature of $S$ endows it with a quantum instability,\nwhich is a generalization of a similar property exhibited by the inverted\nharmonic oscillator potential. Our analysis is semiclassical, including a\ndetailed phase-space study of the classical dynamics of $S$ and its dual\noperator $R$, and a general semiclassical framework yielding basic instability\nand thermality properties that play a crucial role in the quantum behavior of\nthe theory. For an observer with a finite lifetime $\\mathcal{T}$, the detected\ntemperature\n  $T_D = 2 \\hbar/(\\pi \\mathcal{T})$ is associated with a Lyapunov exponent\n$\\lambda_L = \\pi T_D/\\hbar$, which is half the upper saturation bound of the\ninformation scrambling rate.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LNCcFrVMe3PS87p7tLBlblaytHvC8TYSdmWhMNh2HAY","pdfSize":"439557","objectId":"0x740e97950c0e922f5c707f841f724183aa28aa675ba0077cb23a5a96f538c9f2","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
