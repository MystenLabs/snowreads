Monti demonstrated that the Lipschitz\napproximation of the blow-up, after rescaling by the square root of the excess,\nconverges to a limit function for $n \\ge 2$. However, the partial differential\nequation he derived for this limit function $\\varphi$ through contact variation\nis incorrect. Instead, the correct equation is that the horizontal Laplacian of\nthe limit function $\\varphi$ is independent of the coordinate $y_1$ and solves\nequation 1 weakly.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
