We introduce lasso\nsemigroups as a generalisation of Wilke algebras that mirrors how lasso\nautomata generalise $\\Omega$-automata, and we show that finite lasso semigroups\ncharacterise regular lasso languages. We then show a dual adjunction between\nlasso automata and quotients of the free lasso semigroup with a recognising\nset, and as our main result we show that this dual adjunction restricts to one\nbetween $\\Omega$-automata and quotients of the free Wilke algebra with a\nrecognising set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
