Confirming a conjecture of Mader, Liu and\nMontgomery [J. Lond. Math. Soc., 2017] showed that every $K_{s, t}$-free graph\nwith average degree $d$ contains a subdivision of a clique with at least\n$\\Omega(d^{\\frac{s}{2(s-1)}})$ vertices. We give an improvement by showing that\nsuch a graph contains a balanced subdivision of a clique with the same order,\nwhere a balanced subdivision is a subdivision in which each edge is subdivided\nthe same number of times.\n  In 1975, Erd\\H{o}s asked whether the sum of the reciprocals of the cycle\nlengths in a graph with infinite average degree $d$ is necessarily infinite.\nRecently, Liu and Montgomery [J. Amer. Math. Soc., 2023] confirmed the\nasymptotically correct lower bound on the reciprocals of the cycle lengths, and\nprovided a lower bound of at least $(\\frac{1}{2} -o_d(1)) \\log d$. In this\npaper, we improve this low bound to $\\left(\\frac{s}{2(s-1)} -o_d(1)\\right) \\log\nd$ for $K_{s, t}$-free graphs.\n  Both proofs of our results use the graph sublinear expansion property as well\nas some novel structural techniques.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
