We show that this generalised\n$\\lambda$-Core is non-empty for the class of separable games that admit a\nsocially optimal Nash equilibrium. Examples are provided that indicate that\nnon-emptiness of the generalised $\\lambda$-Core cannot be expected for large\nclasses of normal form games.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
