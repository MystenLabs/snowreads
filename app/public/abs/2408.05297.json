However,\ndespite its intent to maintain randomness, A/B testing often faces challenges\nthat compromise this randomness, leading to significant limitations in\npractice. In this study, we introduce Bootstrap Matching, an innovative\napproach that integrates Bootstrap resampling, Matching techniques, and\nhigh-dimensional hypothesis testing to address the shortcomings of A/B tests\nwhen true randomization is not achieved. Unlike traditional methods such as\nDifference-in-Differences (DID) and Propensity Score Matching (PSM), Bootstrap\nMatching is tailored for large-scale datasets, offering enhanced robustness and\ncomputational efficiency. We illustrate the effectiveness of this methodology\nthrough a real-world application in online advertising and further discuss its\npotential applications in digital marketing, empirical economics, clinical\ntrials, and high-dimensional bioinformatics.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
