We demonstrate that the convex hull $D$ in the\nnatural extended-variable space $R^{d+n}$ is given by full optimal big-M\nlifting (i) when $d\\leq 2$ (and that it is not generally true for $d\\geq 3$),\nand also (ii) under some technical conditions, when the polytopes have a common\nfacet-describing constraint matrix, for arbitrary $d\\geq 1$ and $n\\geq 1$.\nAdditionally, we give further results on the polyhedral structure of $D$, and\nwe demonstrate that all facets of $D$ can be enumerated in polynomial time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
