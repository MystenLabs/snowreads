By controlling the concentration of the\nchemical substrates, this study can guide the optimal growth of cells. The\nnovelty of this work lies on the direct and dual models that remain in a weak\nsetting, which is uncommon in the recent literature for solving optimal control\nsystems. Moreover, it is known that the adjoint problems offer a powerful\napproach to quantifying the uncertainty associated with model inputs. However,\nthese systems typically lack closed-form solutions, making it challenging to\nobtain weak solutions. For that, the well-posedness of the direct problem is\nfirst well guaranteed. Then, the existence of an optimal control and the\nfirst-order optimality conditions are established. Finally, weak solutions for\nthe adjoint system to the non-linear degenerate direct model, are introduced\nand investigated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
