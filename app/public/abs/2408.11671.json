However, imperfections, particularly carrier leakage\nand unwanted sideband signal, can significantly compromise control fidelity. To\nmitigate these defects, regular and precise mixer calibrations are\nindispensable, yet they pose a formidable challenge in large-scale quantum\ncontrol. Here, we introduce an in situ calibration technique and\noutcome-focused mixer calibration scheme using superconducting qubits. Our\nmethod leverages the qubit's response to imperfect signals, allowing for\ncalibration without modifying the wiring configuration. We experimentally\nvalidate the efficacy of this technique by benchmarking single-qubit gate\nfidelity and qubit coherence time.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
