These gates are characterized by a single complex parameter $\\beta$, and\ncan be constructed using Gaussian pulses and free evolutions with the help of\nan ancillary transmon qubit. We show that there is a lower bound for the gate\ntime in the standard construction of an ECD gate. We present a method for\noptimizing the pulse shape of an ECD gate using a pulse-shaping technique\nsubject to a set of experimental constraints. Our optimized pulse shapes remain\nsymmetric, and can be applied to a range of target values of $\\beta$ by tuning\nonly the amplitude. We demonstrate that the total gate time of an ECD gate for\na small value of $\\beta$ can be reduced either by relaxing the no-overlap\nconstraint on the primitives used in the standard construction or via our\noptimal-control method. We show a slight advantage of the optimal-control\nmethod by demonstrating a reduction in the preparation time of a\n$|+Z_\\mathrm{GKP}>$ logical state by $\\thicksim$$10\\%$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
