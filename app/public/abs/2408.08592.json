However, the deployment of\nneural-network-controlled systems (NNCSs) raises significant safety concerns.\nMany recent advances overlook critical aspects of verifying control and\nensuring safety in real-time scenarios. This paper presents a case study on\nusing POLAR-Express, a state-of-the-art NNCS reachability analysis tool, for\nruntime safety verification in a Turtlebot navigation system using LiDAR. The\nTurtlebot, equipped with a neural network controller for steering, operates in\na complex environment with obstacles. We developed a safe online controller\nswitching strategy that switches between the original NNCS controller and an\nobstacle avoidance controller based on the verification results. Our\nexperiments, conducted in a ROS2 Flatland simulation environment, explore the\ncapabilities and limitations of using POLAR-Express for runtime verification\nand demonstrate the effectiveness of our switching strategy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
