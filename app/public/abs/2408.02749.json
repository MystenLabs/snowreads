We are thus able to leverage the machinery of homological\nperturbation theory to prove strong statements on the homological theory of\ndifferential modules admitting additional auxiliary gradings and having\ninfinite homological dimension. One of the main takeaways of our results is\nthat the category of differential modules is much more similar than expected to\nthe category of chain complexes, and from the K-theoretic perspective such\nobjects are largely indistinguishable. This intuition is made precise through\nthe construction of so-called anchored resolutions, which are a distinguished\nclass of projective flag resolutions that possess remarkably well-behaved\nuniqueness properties in the (flag-preserving) homotopy category. We apply this\ntheory to prove an analogue of the Total Rank Conjecture for differential\nmodules admitting a ZZ/2-grading in a large number of cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
