It turns out that\nnature violates Bell inequalities, which entails the failure of at least one of\nthose assumptions. Since rejecting any of them - even partially - proves to be\nenough to explain the observed correlations, it is natural to ask about the\ncost in each case. This paper follows up on the results in PNAS 118 e2020569118\n(2021), showing the equivalence between the locality and free choice\nassumptions, adding to the picture retro-causal models explaining the observed\ncorrelations. Here, we consider more challenging causal scenarios which allow\nonly single-arrow type violations of a given assumption. The figure of merit\nchosen for the comparison of the causal cost is defined as the minimal\nfrequency of violation of the respective assumption required for a simulation\nof the observed experimental statistics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
