This exhibition was showcased in the cinema foyer for two\nweeks in June, providing a real-world platform for students to display their\nwork. Over the course of two years, we implemented this active learning task\nwith two different cohorts of students. In this paper, we share our experiences\nand insights from these activities, highlighting the impact on student\nengagement and learning outcomes. We also provide a detailed description of the\nseven individual tasks that learners must perform: topic and data selection and\nanalysis, research and art inspiration, design conceptualisation, proposed\nsolution, visualisation creation, exhibition curation, and reflection. By\nintegrating these tasks, students not only develop technical skills but also\ngain practical experience in presenting their work to a public audience,\nbridging the gap between academic learning and professional practice.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
