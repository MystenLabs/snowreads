We\npropose, for the first time, a principled architecture which employs\nVariational Auto-Encoders for estimating a latent distribution responsible for\ngenerating the data, and Evidential Deep Learning for its ability to sense\nout-of-distribution activities. We verify that the fused data processed by\ndifferent antennas of the same Wi-Fi receiver results in increased accuracy of\nhuman activity recognition compared with the most recent benchmarks, while\nstill being informative when facing out-of-distribution samples and enabling\nsemantic interpretation of latent variables in terms of physical phenomena. The\nresults of this paper are a first contribution toward the ultimate goal of\nproviding a flexible, semantic characterisation of black-swan events, i.e.,\nevents for which we have limited to no training data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
