Any such operator is\nhypercyclic if and only if it is topologically mixing, and when the symbol is\nautomorphic, such an operator is supercyclic if and only if it is mixing. When\nthe domain is a punctured plane, a composition operator is supercyclic if and\nonly if it satisfies the Frequent Hypercyclity Criterion, and when the domain\nis conformally equivalent to a punctured disc, such an operator is hypercyclic\nif and only if it satisfies the Frequent Hypercyclicity Criterion. When the\ndomain is finitely connected and either conformally equivalent to an annulus or\nhaving two or more holes, no weighted composition operator can be supercyclic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hJ0LSuFJLZshabuqGEXnBlFPbJKPZQY9PFIXGTt1T7s","pdfSize":"291395"}
