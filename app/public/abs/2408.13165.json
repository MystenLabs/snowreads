The problem setting\nconsists of a server having a library of files and a set of access caches.\nEvery user, equipped with a private cache, connects to $L$ neighboring access\ncaches in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. The server populates the private and\naccess caches with file contents in either coded or uncoded format. For this\nsetting, we derive a lower bound on the optimal worst-case transmission rate\nusing cut-set arguments. This lower bound applies to both coded and uncoded\nplacements. We then provide an achievable scheme with uncoded placement and\nshow that our scheme specializes to the well-known Maddah-Ali-Niesen scheme for\nthe dedicated cache network in the absence of access caches. Finally, we show\nthat the proposed scheme achieves optimality in large memory regimes and\nprovide numerical plots comparing the rate of the proposed scheme with the\nderived lower bound, demonstrating the optimality of our scheme.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
