In biomedical studies and\noperations applications, censored survival outcome is frequently observed, in\nwhich case the restricted mean survival time and survival probability are of\ngreat interest. In this paper, we propose two robust criteria for learning\noptimal treatment rules with censored survival outcomes; the former one targets\nat an optimal treatment rule maximizing the restricted mean survival time,\nwhere the restriction is specified by a given quantile such as median; the\nlatter one targets at an optimal treatment rule maximizing buffered survival\nprobabilities, where the predetermined threshold is adjusted to account the\nrestricted mean survival time. We provide theoretical justifications for the\nproposed optimal treatment rules and develop a sampling-based\ndifference-of-convex algorithm for learning them. In simulation studies, our\nestimators show improved performance compared to existing methods. We also\ndemonstrate the proposed method using AIDS clinical trial data.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
