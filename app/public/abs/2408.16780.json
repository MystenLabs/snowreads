In the long term, such explanations are the key to gaining users'\nacceptance of AI-based systems' decisions. We report on applying a\nmodel-driven-based optimisation to search for an interpretable and explainable\npolicy that solves the game 2048. This paper describes a solution to the\nGECCO'24 Interpretable Control Competition using the open-source software\nEvoAl. We aimed to develop an approach for creating interpretable policies that\nare easy to adapt to new ideas.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"K0Wt93sJ2kpa52sTHBVkkYjjYcDfr6td2eIGybdinSg","pdfSize":"566188"}
