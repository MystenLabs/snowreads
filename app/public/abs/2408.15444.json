Equations are presented using a diagrammatic\ncalculus for tensor categories. To this quantum question and answer setting, we\nextend the standard definitions, including strategies, correlations, and\nsynchronicity, and we use these definitions to extend results about\nsynchronicity. We extend the graph homomorphism (isomorphism) game to quantum\ngraphs, and show it is synchronous (bisynchronous) and that its perfect\nquantum-commuting (bi)strategies are quantum graph homomorphisms\n(isomorphisms). Our extended definitions agree with the existing quantum games\nliterature, except in the case of synchronicity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
