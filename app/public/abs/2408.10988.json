A total of 62 bursts were detected in\ncoherent tied-array beams using the MeerTRAP real-time transient detection\npipeline. We measure a structure-optimising dispersion measure of\n$527.65\\pm0.01\\,\\text{pc}\\,\\text{cm}^{-3}$ using the brightest burst in the\nsample. We find the bursts of FRB 20240114A are generally detected in part of\nthe broad band of MeerKAT, $\\sim40\\%$ in the UHF and $\\sim30\\%$ in the L-band,\nindicating the band limited nature. We analyse the fluence distribution of the\n44 bursts detected at UHF, constraining the fluence completeness limit to\n$\\sim1\\,$Jy ms, above which the cumulative burst rate follows a power law $R\n(>F)\\propto (F/1\\,\\text{Jy}\\,\\text{ms})^\\gamma$ with $\\gamma=-1.8\\pm0.2$. Using\nchannelised telescope data captured in our transient buffer we localise FRB\n20240114A in the image domain to RA = 21h27m39.86s, Dec = +04d19m45.01s with an\nuncertainty of 1.4 arcsec. This localisation allows us to confidently identify\nthe host galaxy of FRB 20240114A. Also using the transient buffer data we\nperform a polarimetric study and demonstrate that most of the bursts have\n$\\sim100\\%$ linear polarisation fractions and up to $\\sim20\\%$ circular\npolarisation fractions. Finally, we predict the flux density of a potential\npersistent radio source (PRS) associated with FRB 20240114A is\n$\\backsimeq[0.6\\text{--}60]\\,\\mu\\text{Jy}$ based on the simple relation between\nthe luminosity of the PRS and the rotation measure arising from the FRB local\nenvironment.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
