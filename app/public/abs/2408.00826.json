We link the operator\ncomplexity of the density matrix to the state/operator complexity of purified\nstates using three purification schemes: time-independent, time-dependent, and\ninstantaneous purification. We propose inequalities among the operator and\nstate complexities of mixed states and their purifications, demonstrated with a\nsingle qubit, two-qubit Werner states, and infinite-dimensional diagonal mixed\nstates. We find that the complexity of a vacuum evolving into a thermal state\nequals the average number of Rindler particles created between left and right\nRindler wedges. Finally, for the thermofield double state evolving from zero to\nfinite temperature, we show that 1) the state complexity follows the Lloyd\nbound, reminiscent of the quantum speed limit, and 2) the Krylov state/operator\ncomplexities are subadditive in contrast to the holographic volume complexity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
