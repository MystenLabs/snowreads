To be more precise, we are interested in\n\\[Q_n^{+}:=\\sup_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}}\\sup_{v_1,v_2,\\ldots,v_n\\geq\n1}P(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_i\\varepsilon_i\\in(x-1,x+1)),\\]\n\\[Q_n=\\sup_{x\\in\\mathbb{R}}\\sup_{|v_1|,|v_2|,\\ldots,|v_n|\\geq\n1}P(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}v_i\\varepsilon_i\\in(x-1,x+1))\\] where the random variables\n$(\\varepsilon_i)_{i=1,2,\\ldots,n}$ are spins in Curie-Weiss models. This is a\ngeneralization of classical Littlewood-Offord problems from Rademacher random\nvariables to possibly dependent random variables. In particular, it includes\nthe case of general i.i.d. Bernoulli random variables. We calculate the\nasymptotics of $Q_n^{+}$ and $Q_n$ as $n\\to\\infty$ and observe the phenomena of\nphase transitions. Besides, we prove that the supremum in the definition of\n$Q_n^{+}$ is attained when $v_1=v_2=\\cdots=v_n=1$. When $n$ is even, the\nsupremum in the definition of $Q_n$ is attained when one half of $(v_i)_i$\nequals to $1$ and the other half equals to $-1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
