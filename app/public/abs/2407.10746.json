While Anderson localization dictates the wave's evolution in\nconservative random systems, the introduction of non-Hermiticity tends to force\nthe beam to unidirectionally propagate towards one edge of the potential due to\nthe existence of skin modes. As we show, the antagonism between these effects\nresults in qualitatively distinct phases of wave diffraction, including\ncounter-intuitive characteristics regarding the relationship between the\nstrength of disorder and the wavepacket's velocity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
