Here, using the Landauer formalism in combination\nwith first-principles calculations, we show that C-BPN is a highly stable\nthermoelectric material at elevated temperatures under mechanical strain, where\nits thermoelectric efficiency can be anisotropically engineered. Transport\ncalculations reveal that C-BPN's transmission spectrum has significant degrees\nof directional anisotropy and it undergoes a metal-insulator transition under\nstrain, which leads to an increase in its Seebeck coefficient. C-BPN's lattice\nthermal conductance can be selectively tuned up to 35% bidirectionally at room\ntemperature by strain engineering. Enhancement in its power factor and the\nsuppression of its lattice thermal conductance improves the p-type figure of\nmerit up to 0.31 and 0.76 at 300 and 1000~K, respectively. Our findings reveal\nthat C-BPN has high potency to be used in thermoelectric nano devices with\nselective anisotropic properties at elevated temperatures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
