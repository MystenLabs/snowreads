To enhance the comprehensiveness of this work, we complement\nthe results and their proofs with suitable diagrams and figures. The new\nresults presented here settle some open questions posed in the past. For the\nsake of completeness of this work, we briefly discuss previous known results\nand provide directions of research and applications of our results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
