Then a novel ontology, named Reactive Digital Twin\nOntology is described, in which sensors, activators and the decision processes\nare also semantically described, turning the previous synchronic approach to\ncultural heritage documentation into a diachronic one. Some case studies\nexemplify this theory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
