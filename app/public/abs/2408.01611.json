In\nparticular, for a sufficiently wide spectrum of supermassive black holes, we\nstudied what energy photons will decay under the influence of a strong magnetic\nfield, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical\nparameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high\nenergy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus,\nwill be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
