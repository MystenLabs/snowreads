In the quantum electrodynamics prescription\n$\\textrm{QED}_{\\textrm{L}}$ these arise at order $1/L^3$ in the large-volume\nexpansion, which is also the leading order because of the neutrality of the\ncurrents defining the underlying correlation function. Knowing the size of the\nfinite-volume effects in question is relevant for determinations of the leading\nisospin-breaking corrections to the muon anomalous magnetic moment coming from\nthe hadronic vacuum polarisation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
