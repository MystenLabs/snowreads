The CDW state with the domain wall network has attracted\nsignificant interest due to its coexistence with superconductivity. Here we\npresent a scanning tunneling microscopy, transport and magnetic susceptibility\nstudy of 1T-Ti$_{1-\\text{x}}$Ta$_\\text{x}$Se$_2$. Ta substitution for Ti atoms\nallows us to perform experiments over the wide range of doping ($ 0 \\leqslant\n\\text{x} \\leqslant 0.2$), providing access to a significantly broader phase\ndiagram than Cu intercalation experiments. At x = 0.02, we observe a complex\nnetwork of domains and domain walls. We identify two distinct types of domain\nwalls and show their structure with atomic resolution. Additionally, an elusive\nsymmetry-breaking stripe CDW is found at the light substitution of x = 0.02. We\nalso measure highly substituted x = 0.2 crystals that are superconducting\ndespite the full collapse of the CDW order. Our results uncover rich CDW\nphysics in Ta-substituted 1T-TiSe2 crystals and illuminate the interplay\nbetween the CDW and superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
