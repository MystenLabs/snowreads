The\nsolver is based on a hardware-aware fine-grained parallel simulated annealing\nalgorithm developed for Intel's neuromorphic research chip Loihi 2. Preliminary\nresults show that our approach can generate feasible solutions in as little as\n1 ms and up to 37x more energy efficient compared to two baseline solvers\nrunning on a CPU. These advantages could be especially relevant for size-,\nweight-, and power-constrained edge computing applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
