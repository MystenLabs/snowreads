A Review\n  for Safe Automated Driving Perception","authors":"Mert Keser, Youssef Shoeb, Alois Knoll","authorsParsed":[["Keser","Mert",""],["Shoeb","Youssef",""],["Knoll","Alois",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 30 Aug 2024 12:01:06 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-09-02","timestamp":1725019266000,"abstract":"  Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have become central for the perception functions\nof autonomous vehicles, substantially enhancing their ability to understand and\ninterpret the environment. However, these systems exhibit inherent limitations\nsuch as brittleness, opacity, and unpredictable behavior in out-of-distribution\nscenarios. The European Union (EU) Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, as a\npioneering legislative framework, aims to address these challenges by\nestablishing stringent norms and standards for AI systems, including those used\nin autonomous driving (AD), which are categorized as high-risk AI. In this\nwork, we explore how the newly available generative AI models can potentially\nsupport addressing upcoming regulatory requirements in AD perception,\nparticularly with respect to safety. This short review paper summarizes the\nrequirements arising from the EU AI Act regarding DNN-based perception systems\nand systematically categorizes existing generative AI applications in AD. While\ngenerative AI models show promise in addressing some of the EU AI Acts\nrequirements, such as transparency and robustness, this review examines their\npotential benefits and discusses how developers could leverage these methods to\nenhance compliance with the Act. The paper also highlights areas where further\nresearch is needed to ensure reliable and safe integration of these\ntechnologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
