From the numerical point of view, the pricing of\nderivatives with SABR/LIBOR market models (SABR/LMMs) is mainly carried out\nwith Monte Carlo simulation. However, this approach could involve excessively\nlong computational times. For first time in the literature, in the present\npaper we propose an alternative pricing based on partial differential equations\n(PDEs). Thus, we pose original PDE formulations associated to the SABR/LMMs\nproposed by Hagan \\cite{haganSABRLIBOR}, Mercurio \\& Morini\n\\cite{mercurioMorini} and Rebonato \\cite{rebonatoWhite}. Moreover, as the PDEs\nassociated to these SABR/LMMs are high dimensional in space, traditional full\ngrid methods (like standard finite differences or finite elements) are not able\nto price derivatives over more than three or four underlying interest rates. In\norder to overcome this curse of dimensionality, a sparse grid combination\ntechnique is proposed. A comparison between Monte Carlo simulation results and\nthe ones obtained with the sparse grid technique illustrates the performance of\nthe method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
