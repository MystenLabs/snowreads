Current solutions don't fit the online custom service scenarios well due\nto the lack of attention to user questions and possible responses. Hence, we\npropose to develop a time-saving and careful reading assistant for CSRs, named\nCARE. It can help the CSRs quickly find proper responses from the user manuals\nvia explicit clue chains. Specifically, each of the clue chains is formed by\ninferring over the user manuals, starting from the question clue aligned with\nthe user question and ending at a possible response. To overcome the shortage\nof supervised data, we adopt the self-supervised strategy for model learning.\nThe offline experiment shows that CARE is efficient in automatically inferring\naccurate responses from the user manual. The online experiment further\ndemonstrates the superiority of CARE to reduce CSRs' reading burden and keep\nhigh service quality, in particular with >35% decrease in time spent and\nkeeping a >0.75 ICC score.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
