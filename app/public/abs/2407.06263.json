We find a lower decay rate\nthan predicted by standard thermal theory. The discrepancy is due to the\nviolation of thermal equilibrium during the critical bubble nucleation. It is\nreduced by introducing dissipation and noise. We propose a criterion for the\nsystem to remain in equilibrium during the nucleation process and show that it\nis violated in the Hamiltonian evolution of a single field. In the case of many\nfields, the fulfillment of the criterion is model-dependent.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
