Here, we employ various density functional theory formulations to\nexplore its effects on magnetic characteristics of polyacetylene by ab initio\nbasis. Our results indicate that subtle correlation effects beyond the\ngeneralized gradient approximation lead to the formation of spin-density wave\nsolutions on the $\\pi$-conjugated carbon $p$ orbitals that could compete with\nother solutions, possibly leading to emergence of intertwined orders. Our study\nsuggests that the phase diagram of polyacetylene should be explored further.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
