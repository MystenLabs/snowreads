However, it faces the challenges of large\nparameter search space and sparse and noisy user-item interactions, which\nreduces the applicability of the generated model parameters. The Semantic\nCodebook Learning for Dynamic Recommendation Models (SOLID) framework presents\na significant advancement in DSR by effectively tackling these challenges. By\ntransforming item sequences into semantic sequences and employing a dual\nparameter model, SOLID compresses the parameter generation search space and\nleverages homogeneity within the recommendation system. The introduction of the\nsemantic metacode and semantic codebook, which stores disentangled item\nrepresentations, ensures robust and accurate parameter generation. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrates that SOLID consistently outperforms existing DSR,\ndelivering more accurate, stable, and robust recommendations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
