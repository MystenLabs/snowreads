Focusing on the clustering of medical\npublications, we employ recursive iterations in conjunction with a dimension\nrelaxation method to significantly enhance density of clustering results.\nFurthermore, we propose a unique vectorization technique for articles,\nleveraging conditional probabilities for more effective clustering. Our methods\nprovide advantages in both computational efficiency and clustering accuracy,\nsubstantiated through comprehensive experiments.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cgE21jvROOGBJFLDhWq56lGh-hRAwtwu-9d8fwZMQKY","pdfSize":"1013752"}
