These scoping\nmechanisms utilize distance functions in the representation space to ascertain\nthe scope of the edit. In this work, we show that distance-based scoping\nfunctions grapple with lexical biases leading to issues such as misfires with\nirrelevant prompts that share similar lexical characteristics. To address this\nproblem, we introduce, Projector Editor Networks for Model Editing (PENME),is a\nmodel editing approach that employs a compact adapter with a projection network\ntrained via a contrastive learning objective. We demonstrate the efficacy of\nPENME in achieving superior results while being compute efficient and flexible\nto adapt across model architectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jOPm0oh6ZzFOLn7wZbl5BItKNA7Bc9zCGpUZlA-Pwec","pdfSize":"2403757"}
