This scenario is to be achieved\nthrough the development of artificial intelligence capabilities assisting the\nhuman operator in controlling the Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) and processing\nthe sensor data, thereby alleviating the need for extensive operator training.\nThis paper presents the HADRON project that seeks to develop and test multiple\nnovel technologies to enable human-friendly control of drone swarms. This\nproject is divided into three main parts. The first part consists of the\nintegration of different technologies for the intuitive control of drones,\nfocusing on novice or inexperienced pilots and operators. The second part\nfocuses on the development of a multi-drone system that will be controlled from\na command and control station, in which an expert pilot can supervise the\noperations of the multiple drones. The third part of the project will focus on\nreducing the cognitive load on human operators, whether they are novice or\nexpert pilots. For this, we will develop AI tools that will assist drone\noperators with semi-automated real-time data processing.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
