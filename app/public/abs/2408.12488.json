This theorem was extended to\nprofinite groups whose mod-$p$ cohomology algebra is finitely generated by\nHenn. In a weaker form, the Lannes-Quillen theorem was then extended by Symonds\nto arbitrary profinite groups. Building on Symonds' result, we formulate and\nprove a full version of this theorem for all profinite groups. For this\npurpose, we develop a theory of products for families of discrete torsion\nmodules, parameterized by a profinite space, which is dual, in a very precise\nsense, to the theory of coproducts for families of profinite modules,\nparameterized by a profinite space, developed by Haran, Melnikov and Ribes. In\nthe last section, we give applications to the problem of conjugacy separability\nof $p$-torsion elements and finite $p$-subgroups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
