Compared with existing models that passively detect specific\nanomaly classes with large labeled training samples, user-level network traffic\ncontains sizeable new anomaly classes with few labeled samples and has an\nimbalance, self-similar, and data-hungry nature. Motivation on those\nlimitations, in this paper, we propose \\textit{Meta-UAD}, a Meta-learning\nscheme for User-level network traffic Anomaly Detection. Meta-UAD uses the\nCICFlowMeter to extract 81 flow-level statistical features and remove some\ninvalid ones using cumulative importance ranking. Meta-UAD adopts a\nmeta-learning training structure and learns from the collection of K-way-M-shot\nclassification tasks, which can use a pre-trained model to adapt any new class\nwith few samples by few iteration steps. We evaluate our scheme on two public\ndatasets. Compared with existing models, the results further demonstrate the\nsuperiority of Meta-UAD with 15{\\%} - 43{\\%} gains in F1-score.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
