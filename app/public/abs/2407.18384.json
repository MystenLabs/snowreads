It covers fundamental results in approximation theory, optimization\ntheory, and statistical learning theory, which are the three main pillars of\ndeep neural network theory. Serving as a guide for students and researchers in\nmathematics and related fields, the book aims to equip readers with\nfoundational knowledge on the topic. It prioritizes simplicity over generality,\nand presents rigorous yet accessible results to help build an understanding of\nthe essential mathematical concepts underpinning deep learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/History and Overview"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
