We consider the Poisson structure appearing as the classical limit\nof the $R$-matrix, and parametrize the symplectic leaves explicitly in terms of\na type of matrix we call a shape matrix. We then introduce a quantized version\nof the shape matrix for the REA, and show that each irreducible representation\nof the REA has a unique shape.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
