In this paper, we\nintroduce a novel defect-generation method, named DDPM-MoCo, to address these\nissues. Firstly, we utilize the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)\nto generate high-quality defect data samples, overcoming the problem of\ninsufficient sample data for model learning. Furthermore, we utilize the\nunsupervised learning Momentum Contrast model (MoCo) with an enhanced batch\ncontrastive loss function for training the model on unlabeled data, addressing\nthe efficiency and consistency challenges in large-scale negative sample\nencoding during diffusion model training. The experimental results showcase an\nenhanced visual detection method for identifying defects on metal surfaces,\ncovering the entire process, starting from generating unlabeled sample data for\ntraining the diffusion model, to utilizing the same labeled sample data for\ndownstream detection tasks. This study offers valuable practical insights and\napplication potential for visual detection in the metal processing industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
