The SASV system integrates ASV and CM systems to enhance security\nagainst spoofing attacks. Our approach employs score and embedding fusion from\nASV models (ECAPA-TDNN, WavLM) and CM models (AASIST). The fused embeddings are\nprocessed using a simple DNN structure, optimizing model performance with a\ncombination of recently proposed a-DCF and BCE losses. We introduce a novel\nparallel network structure where two identical DNNs, fed with different inputs,\nindependently process embeddings and produce SASV scores. The final SASV\nprobability is derived by averaging these scores, enhancing robustness and\naccuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed parallel DNN\nstructure outperforms traditional single DNN methods, offering a more reliable\nand secure speaker verification system against spoofing attacks.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
