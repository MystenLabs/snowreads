However,\nthe gigapixel resolution of WSIs and the scarcity of manual annotations present\nsubstantial challenges. Multiple instance learning (MIL) is a promising weakly\nsupervised learning approach for WSI classification. Recently research revealed\nemploying pseudo bag augmentation can encourage models to learn various data,\nthus bolstering models' performance. While directly inheriting the parents'\nlabels can introduce more noise by mislabeling in training. To address this\nissue, we translate the WSI classification task from weakly supervised learning\nto semi-weakly supervised learning, termed SWS-MIL, where adaptive pseudo bag\naugmentation (AdaPse) is employed to assign labeled and unlabeled data based on\na threshold strategy. Using the \"student-teacher\" pattern, we introduce a\nfeature augmentation technique, MergeUp, which merges bags with low-priority\nbags to enhance inter-category information, increasing training data diversity.\nExperimental results on the CAMELYON-16, BRACS, and TCGA-LUNG datasets\ndemonstrate the superiority of our method over existing state-of-the-art\napproaches, affirming its efficacy in WSI classification.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
