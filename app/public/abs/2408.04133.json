We\nprovide a heuristic explanation for the connection between the formal\nsummation/expansion and the Mellin-Barnes integral in the literature, and\nspecify the exact convergence condition. We derive an asymptotic condition on\nthe conformal moments of GPDs to satisfy the boundary condition at $x=1$ and\nsubsequently develop an approximate formula for GPDs when $x>\\xi$. Since\nexperimental observables constraining GPDs can be expressed in terms of double\nor even triple summations involving their moments, scale evolution factors, and\nWilson coefficients, etc., we propose a method to handle the ordering of the\nmultiple summations and convert them into multiple Mellin-Barnes integrals via\nanalytical continuations of integer summation indices.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
