Predominantly, much research in this area has customarily\nfocused on the equations given by Regge, Wheeler and Zerilli. In this work we\nstudy linearized perturbations of a Schwarzschild black hole using the\nCharacteristic formulation of numerical relativity, with an emphasis on the\ncomputation of QNMs. Within this formalism, the master equation describing\ngravitational perturbations is known to satisfy a fourth order hypergeometric\ndifferential equation. We analyse the singular points of this master equation,\nand obtain series solutions whose coefficients are given by three term\nrecurrence relations, from which Leaver's continued fraction method can be\napplied. Using this technique, we recover the standard Schwarzschild\nquasinormal modes. In addition, we find that imposing purely outgoing boundary\nconditions, a natural feature of the Bondi-Sachs framework, leads to the\nrecovery of the algebraically special mode.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
