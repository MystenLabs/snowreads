To that end, we demonstrate Wheeler, a three-wheeled\ninput device with two side buttons that can speed up complex multi-level\nhierarchy navigation in common applications. When in operation, the three\nwheels of Wheeler are each mapped to a different level in the application\nhierarchy. Each level can be independently traversed using its designated\nwheel, allowing users to navigate through multiple levels efficiently.\nWheeler's three wheels can also be repurposed for other tasks such as 2D cursor\nmanipulation. In this demonstration, we describe the different operation modes\nand usage of Wheeler.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
