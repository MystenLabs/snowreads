From the moment a user creates an account, they continually\nexpand their network of friends or followers, freely interacting with others by\nposting, commenting, and sharing content. Over time, user behavior evolves\nbased on demographic attributes and the networks they establish. In this\nresearch, we propose a predictive method to understand how a user evolves on\nsocial media throughout their life and to forecast the next stage of their\nevolution. We fine-tune a GPT-like decoder-only model (we named it E-GPT:\nEvolution-GPT) to predict the future stages of a user's evolution in online\nsocial media. We evaluate the performance of these models and demonstrate how\nuser attributes influence changes within their network by predicting future\nconnections and shifts in user activities on social media, which also addresses\nother social media challenges such as recommendation systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
