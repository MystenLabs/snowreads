Our main theorem provides the new phenomenon\nin which differences in the Hausdorff dimension of the limit set generated by a\nMarkov system cause essentially different results on multifractal analysis.\nThis paper also provides a new characterization of the geodesic flow on the\nPoinca\\'re disc model of two-dimensional hyperbolic space and the limit set of\na generalized Schottky group. To prove our main theorem we use thermodynamic\nformalism on a countable Markov shift, gamma function, and zeta function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
