While the physical reality manifests\nitself in a wide range of phenomena with varying levels of complexity, the\nequations that describe them display certain statistical regularities and\npatterns, which we begin to explore here. By drawing inspiration from\nlinguistics, where Zipf's law states that the frequency of any word in a large\ncorpus of text is roughly inversely proportional to its rank in the frequency\ntable, we investigate whether similar patterns for the distribution of\noperators emerge in the equations of physics. We analyse three corpora of\nformulae and find, using sophisticated implicit-likelihood methods, that the\nfrequency of operators as a function of their rank in the frequency table is\nbest described by an exponential law with a stable exponent, in contrast with\nZipf's inverse power-law. Understanding the underlying reasons behind this\nstatistical pattern may shed light on Nature's modus operandi or reveal\nrecurrent patterns in physicists' attempts to formalise the laws of Nature. It\nmay also provide crucial input for symbolic regression, potentially augmenting\nlanguage models to generate symbolic models for physical phenomena. By\npioneering the study of statistical regularities in the equations of physics,\nour results open the door for a meta-law of Nature, a (probabilistic) law that\nall physical laws obey.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
