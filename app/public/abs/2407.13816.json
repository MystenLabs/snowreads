We find the classical model reproduces the quantum results in\nremarkable detail, and provides an analytical handle on the nature and shape of\nthe spin transport's three distinct regimes: ballistic (easy-plane),\nsubdiffusive (isotropic) and insulating (easy-axis). Further, we show that this\nphenomenology is remarkably robust to the inclusion of bond disorder -- albeit\nthat the transient dynamics approaching the steady states differs qualitatively\nbetween the clean and disordered cases -- providing an accessible instance of\nballistic transport in a disordered setting.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
