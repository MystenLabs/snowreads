The inequality carries a universal constant\nindependent of $M$ and involves the fractional mean curvature of $M.$ In\nparticular, it interpolates between the fractional Micheal-Simon Sobolev\ninequality recently obtained by Cabr\\'e, Cozzi, and the first author, and a new\nfractional Hardy inequality on $M$. Our method, when restricted to the plane\ncase $M=\\R^n$, gives a new simple proof of the fractional Hardy inequality. To\nobtain the fractional Hardy inequality on a hypersurface, we establish an\ninequality which bounds a weighted perimeter of $M$ by the standard perimeter\nof $M$ (modulo a universal constant), and which is valid for all convex\nhypersurfaces $M$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
