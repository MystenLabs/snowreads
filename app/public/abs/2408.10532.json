{"id":"2408.10532","title":"NutrifyAI: An AI-Powered System for Real-Time Food Detection,\n  Nutritional Analysis, and Personalized Meal Recommendations","authors":"Michelle Han, Junyao Chen","authorsParsed":[["Han","Michelle",""],["Chen","Junyao",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 20 Aug 2024 04:18:53 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-21","timestamp":1724127533000,"abstract":"  With diet and nutrition apps reaching 1.4 billion users in 2022 [1], it's no\nsurprise that health apps like MyFitnessPal, Noom, and Calorie Counter, are\nsurging in popularity. However, one major setback [2] of nearly all nutrition\napplications is that users must enter food data manually, which is\ntime-consuming and tedious. Thus, there has been an increasing demand for\napplications that can accurately identify food items, analyze their nutritional\ncontent, and offer dietary recommendations in real-time. This paper introduces\na comprehensive system that combines advanced computer vision techniques with\nnutrition analysis, implemented in a versatile mobile and web application. The\nsystem is divided into three key components: 1) food detection using the YOLOv8\nmodel, 2) nutrient analysis via the Edamam Nutrition Analysis API, and 3)\npersonalized meal recommendations using the Edamam Meal Planning and Recipe\nSearch APIs. Designed for both mobile and web platforms, the application\nensures fast processing times with an intuitive user interface, with features\nsuch as data visualizations using Chart.js, a login system, and personalized\nsettings for dietary preferences, allergies, and cuisine choices. Preliminary\nresults showcase the system's effectiveness, making it a valuable tool for\nusers to make informed dietary decisions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
