More\nprecisely, we consider the simple random walk on $\\mathbb{Z}^d$, $d\\geq 2$,\nkilled upon exiting the large (bounded) domain $D_N :=(ND)\\cap \\mathbb{Z}^d$.\nWe denote by $P_N$ the corresponding transition matrix and we study the\nproperties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\\phi_N$ -- one of\nour motivation is that the random walk ``conditioned to stay in $D_N$'' is a\nrandom walk among conductances $c_N(x,y) = \\phi_N(x)\\phi_N(y)$. With\nprobabilistic arguments and under mild assumptions on the domain, we show that\n$\\phi_N$ varies regularly, with a uniform control inside $D_N$. We derive\nseveral corollaries, among which a uniform convergence of $\\phi_N$ to the first\neigenfunction of the corresponding continuous Dirichlet problem. Our results\nmay not be new, but our proofs use (simple) probabilistic ideas that could be\nhelpful in other contexts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
