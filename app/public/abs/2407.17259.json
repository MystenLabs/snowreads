For a first formal characterization, we describe a\nmapping from the spatial information concepts location, field, object, network,\nand event, as used in spatial computing, to conceptual modeling concepts using\nthe FDMM formalism. This allows to identify necessary adaptations at the\nmetamodeling level to make the approach applicable to arbitrary types of\nspatial conceptual modeling languages. Finally, possible application areas of\nspatial conceptual modeling in the medical domain, manufacturing and\nengineering, physical IT architectures and smart homes, supply chain management\nand logistics, civil engineering, and smart cities and cultural heritage are\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
