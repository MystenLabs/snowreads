However, existing\nmethods still face two critical challenges: context overload resulting from\nmultiple rounds of retrieval, and over-planning and repetitive planning due to\nthe lack of a recorded retrieval trajectory. In this paper, we propose a novel\niterative RAG method called ReSP, equipped with a dual-function summarizer.\nThis summarizer compresses information from retrieved documents, targeting both\nthe overarching question and the current sub-question concurrently.\nExperimental results on the multi-hop question-answering datasets HotpotQA and\n2WikiMultihopQA demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art, and exhibits excellent robustness concerning context length.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
