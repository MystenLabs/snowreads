Our method involves training an\nagent equipped with memory, implemented as a recurrent policy, on a diverse set\nof procedurally generated quadruped robots. We demonstrate that the policies\ntrained by our framework transfer seamlessly to both simulated and real-world\nquadrupeds not encountered during training, maintaining high-quality motion\nacross platforms. Through a series of simulation and hardware experiments, we\nhighlight the critical role of the recurrent unit in enabling generalization,\nrapid adaptation to changes in the robot's dynamic properties, and sample\nefficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"-xJkT-YU3VQihUo1iUMQobxwsjpHxuW12yoM-gvxiok","pdfSize":"3959434"}
