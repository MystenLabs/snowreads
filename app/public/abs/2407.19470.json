Meanwhile, the qualities of laser-induced color centers\nare well guaranteed. Femtosecond laser processing suffices for increasing the\nyield of $\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ color centers in bulk materials and forms\ncrater-shaped enriched regions on the surface. However, there is a notable\nabsence of existing simulation methods to explain the mechanisms behind\nlaser-assisted $\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ color center generation. In this work,\nwe design a three-dimensional molecular dynamics (3D-MD) model using an\nintegral hemi-ellipsoidal shell mathematical model to simulate the interaction\nof Gaussian laser beams with bulk materials. Furthermore, we calculate the\ntransmittance, absorption coefficient, refractive index, and reflectivity of\n$4H$-SiC. Then, the absorptance of a 1030 nm laser in 350 {\\mu}m-thick $4H$-SiC\nmaterial is abtained to simulate the energy loss during the actual processing.\nFinally, the study analyzes the movement trajectories of\n$\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ color centers and explains the source of\n$\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ on the surface. This analysis explains the reasons for\nthe enrichment of color centers in the crater-shaped regions formed after laser\ndeposition. Our work provides an effective 3D-MD modeling approach to study the\nprocessing mechanisms of laser interaction with semiconductor materials,\noffering insights into efficient $\\mathrm{V}_\\mathrm{Si}$ color center creation\nprocesses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9MN6-M-Y0x7KdKH5PrFti6snpj5bW-_N787yAklXS1I","pdfSize":"22207607"}
