Instead the forward modeling is completed in the\ntraining stage, where training models are built before calculating 3D forward\nmodeling training data. The method relies on training data being similar to the\nfield dataset of choice, therefore, the field data was first inverted in 1D to\nget an idea of the expected conductivity distribution. With this information, $\n10,000 $ training models were built with similar conductivity ranges, and the\nresearch shows that this provided enough information for the network to produce\nrealistic 2D inversion models over an aquifer-bearing region in California.\nOnce the training was completed, the actual inversion time took only a matter\nof seconds on a generic laptop, which means that if future data was collected\nin this region it could be inverted in near real-time. Better results are\nexpected by increasing the number of training models and eventually the goal is\nto extend the method to 3D inversion.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
