The first method employs the Lyapunov active control\ntechnique. Through this technique, we develop appropriate control functions to\nsynchronize a 4D chaotic HR neuron (response system) with the canonical\nprojection of a 5D chaotic HR neuron (drive system). Numerical simulations are\nprovided to demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. The second method\nis data-driven and leverages a machine learning-based control technique. Our\ntechnique utilizes an ad hoc combination of reservoir computing (RC)\nalgorithms, incorporating reservoir observer (RO), online control (OC), and\nonline predictive control (OPC) algorithms. We anticipate our effective\nheuristic RC adaptive control algorithm to guide the development of more\nformally structured and systematic, data-driven RC control approaches to\nchaotic synchronization problems, and to inspire more data-driven neuromorphic\nmethods for controlling and achieving synchronization in chaotic neural\nnetworks in vivo.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
