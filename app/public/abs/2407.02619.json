If, in addition, $K$ is real closed, we define a signed analogue of the\nGoldman-Iwahori space consisting of signed seminorms. This new space can be\nseen as the linear algebraic version of the real analytification of projective\nspace over $K$. We study this space with methods from real tropical geometry by\nconstructing natural real tropicalization maps from the signed Goldman-Iwahori\nspace to all real tropicalized linear spaces. We prove that this space is the\nlimit of all real tropicalized linear embeddings. We give a combinatorial\ninterpretation of this result by showing that the signed Goldman-Iwahori space\nis the real tropical linear space associated to the universal realizable\noriented matroid. In the constant coefficient case for $K = \\mathbb{R}$, we\ndescribe this space explicitly and relate it to real Bergman fans.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
