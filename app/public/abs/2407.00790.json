One application is to the formality of the cochain\nalgebra of the $n$-sphere. We show that it is formal as an\n$\\mathbb{E}_n$-algebra, also with coefficients in general commutative ring\nspectra, but rarely $\\mathbb{E}_{n+1}$-formal unless the coefficients are\nrational. Along the way we show that the free functor from operads in spectra\nto monads in spectra is fully faithful on a nice subcategory of operads which\nin particular contains the stable $\\mathbb{E}_n$-operads for finite $n$. We use\nthis to interpret our results on loop and suspension functors of augmented\nalgebras in operadic terms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gtiVSf0LqSF7z-YK_wlk8P6XgDKMJCYlwuzkP3Hl-Lk","pdfSize":"436704"}
