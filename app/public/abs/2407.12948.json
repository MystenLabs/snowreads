Our bounds depend on the\n\"intrinsic\" dimensional characteristics such as the effective rank, as opposed\nto the dimension of the ambient space. We illustrate the advantages of such\nresults in several applications, including new moment inequalities for sample\ncovariance matrices and the corresponding eigenvectors of heavy-tailed random\nvectors. Moreover, we demonstrate that our techniques yield sharpened versions\nof the moment inequalities for empirical processes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
