They serve as real-world platform for\nstudents to display their work, bridging the gap between classroom learning and\nprofessional practice. Students must develop a technical solution, grasp the\ncontext, and produce work that is appropriate for public presentation. This\nscenario helps to encourage innovative thinking, engagement with the topic, and\nhelps to enhance technical proficiency. We present our implementation of a\ndata-art exhibition within a computing curriculum, for third-year degree-level\nstudents. Students create art-based visualisations from selected datasets and\npresent their work in a public exhibition. We have used this initiative over\nthe course of two academic years with different cohorts, and reflect on its\nimpact on student learning and creativity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
