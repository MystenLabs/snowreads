However, the industry-wide adoption of AI is hindered by\nthe lack of standardized documentation for the complex compositions of\nautomation systems, AI software, production hardware, and their\ninterdependencies. This paper proposes a formal model using standards and\nontologies to provide clear and structured documentation of AI applications in\nautomation systems. The proposed information model for artificial intelligence\nin automation systems (AIAS) utilizes ontology design patterns to map and link\nvarious aspects of automation systems and AI software. Validated through a\npractical example, the model demonstrates its effectiveness in improving\ndocumentation practices and aiding the sustainable implementation of AI in\nindustrial settings.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
