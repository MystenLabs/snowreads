This proves the odd multiplicity conjecture of Papadakis and\nPetrotou and implies that this determinant is a complete invariant of the\nsimplicial sphere. We extend this result to odd-dimensional connected oriented\nsimplicial homology manifolds. In characteristic 2, we prove a generalization\nto the Hodge-Riemann forms of any connected simplicial homology manifold. To\nprove the latter theorem we establish the strong Lefschetz property for certain\nquotients of the Stanley-Reisner rings of connected simplicial pseudomanifolds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
