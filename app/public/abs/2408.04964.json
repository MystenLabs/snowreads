In our setting, predictions come as\napproximate distances to the target: for each point $p\\in \\mathbb{R}^d$ that\nthe searcher visits, we obtain a value $\\lambda(p)$ such that $|p\\mathbf{t}|\\le\n\\lambda(p) \\le c\\cdot |p\\mathbf{t}|$, where $c\\ge 1$ is a fixed constant,\n$\\mathbf{t}$ is the position of the target, and $|p\\mathbf{t}|$ is the\nEuclidean distance of $p$ to $\\mathbf{t}$. The cost of the search is the length\nof the path followed by the searcher. Our main positive result is a strategy\nthat achieves $(12c)^{d+1}$-competitive ratio, even when the constant $c$ is\nunknown. We also give a lower bound of roughly $(c/16)^{d-1}$ on the\ncompetitive ratio of any search strategy in $\\mathbb{R}^d$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"btlH7ApsZPGk8roMjg_vb_7fHtJZhuHkuIusK2IX7As","pdfSize":"1348234"}
