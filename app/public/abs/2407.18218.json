The fitness\nlandscapes of the species are coupled to a controllable amount, where the\nunderlying properties of the individual landscapes are also controllable. No\nprevious work has explored the use of hierarchical control within the model.\nThis paper explores the effects of using a confederation, based on Bookchins\ncommunalism, and a single point of global control. Significant changes in\nbehaviour from the traditional model are seen across the parameter space.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cGvd_YM-eerXkli0zsXgoFNfuOjKFs8D8uGk6C00hyo","pdfSize":"837275"}
