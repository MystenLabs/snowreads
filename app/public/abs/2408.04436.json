We show that the thermoelectric performance of\nmaterials is governed by the geometric structure of Bloch wave functions within\nthe framework of the Boltzmann equation. The essential geometric notion is the\nHilbert-Schmidt quantum distance, measuring the resemblance between two quantum\nstates. We establish a geometric characterization of the scattering rate by\nextending the concept of quantum distance between two states in momentum space\nat a distance.Employing isotropic quadratic band touching semimetals, where one\ncan concentrate on the role of quantum geometric effects other than the Berry\ncurvature, we find that the response functions for electrical quantum transport\nand, therefore, the thermoelectric power factor can be succinctly expressed in\nterms of the maximum quantum distance, $d_\\mathrm{max}$. Specifically, when\n$d_\\mathrm{max}$ reaches one, the power factor doubles compared to the case\nwith trivial geometry ($d_\\mathrm{max}=0$). Our finding highlights the\nsignificance of quantum geometry in improving the performance of thermoelectric\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
