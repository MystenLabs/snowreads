Furthermore, we delve into the core properties of the mean\n$\\Psi$-intermediate dimensions. Additionally, we establish the mass\ndistribution principle, a Frostman-type lemma, H\\\"older distortion, and derive\nthe corresponding product formula. Finally, we provide illustrative examples of\nthe mean $\\Psi$-intermediate dimension, demonstrating its practical\napplications.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LgMh5jDBWciPj4ZHonBJpFHqqiZJMMlFdFj_HefQKcM","pdfSize":"329419"}
