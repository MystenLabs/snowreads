We demonstrate a continuous polarization rotator by\nutilizing the liquid crystals (LC) in theta-cell configuration comprising of\ncircular and parallel alignment of LC on two aligning glass substrates. A\nrotation of plane of polarization up to 160 degree is observed using Stokes\npolarimetry and substantiated by the mathematical analysis using Mueller matrix\nformalism. Further, the device is demonstrated as a plane of polarization\ndetector with high precision detection angle. The plane of polarization is\nanalyzed through single shot imaging of the intensity distribution of\ntransmitted light through the LC theta-cell.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
