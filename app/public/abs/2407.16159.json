This framework features a number of design choices\nwhich facilitate creating resolvent splitting algorithms with specific\ncommunication structure. We illustrate these design choices using a variety of\nconstraint sets and objective functions, as well as the use of a mixed-integer\nSDP to minimize time per iteration or required number of communications between\nthe resolvents which define the splitting. Using the Performance Estimation\nProblem (PEP) framework, we provide parameter selections, such as step size,\nwhich for high dimensional problems provide optimal contraction factors in the\nalgorithms. Among the algorithm design choices we introduce, we provide a\ncharacterization of algorithm designs which provide minimal convergence time\ngiven structural properties of the monotone operators, resolvent computation\ntimes, and communication latencies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
