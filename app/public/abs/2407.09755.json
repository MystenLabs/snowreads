In this theoretical article, we go beyond the simple model\nused in the previous study to address more phenomena, such as the appearance of\nbunching shoulders in the second-order correlation function, Rabi splitting in\nthe steady-state spectrum, and population dynamics on excited Dicke states,\nwhich for moderate pumping explains the observed collective effects. Overall,\nour results can guide further experiments with NV centers, and they are also\nrelevant for other solid-state color centers, such as silicon-vacancy centers\nin diamond and silicon carbide, boron-vacancy centers and carbon-related\ncenters in hexagonal boron-nitride.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
