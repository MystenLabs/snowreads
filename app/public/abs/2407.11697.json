With a significant portion of the\npopulation using social media on a regular basis, there are growing efforts by\nmalicious organizations to manipulate public opinion through coordinated\ncampaigns. Current methods for identifying coordinated user accounts typically\nrely on either similarities in user behaviour, latent coordination in activity\ntraces, or classification techniques. In our study, we propose a framework\nbased on the hypothesis that coordinated users will demonstrate abnormal growth\nin their behavioural patterns over time relative to the wider population.\nSpecifically, we utilize the EPClose algorithm to extract contrasting patterns\nof user behaviour during a time window of malicious activity, which we then\ncompare to a historical time window. We evaluated the effectiveness of our\napproach using real-world data, and our results show a minimum increase of 10%\nin the F1 score compared to existing approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"YAbtUFkOnUUmZ7e1VQoTPB2MTtPcSqPXMQYm2Cp_5N8","pdfSize":"1499090"}
