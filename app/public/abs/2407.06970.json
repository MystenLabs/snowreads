If a binary\nmediator variable is misclassified, the resulting analysis can be severely\nbiased. Misclassification is especially difficult to deal with when it is\ndifferential and when there are no gold standard labels available. Previous\nwork has addressed this problem using a sensitivity analysis framework or by\nassuming that misclassification rates are known. We leverage a variable related\nto the misclassification mechanism to recover unbiased parameter estimates\nwithout using gold standard labels. The proposed methods require the reasonable\nassumption that the sum of the sensitivity and specificity is greater than 1.\nThree correction methods are presented: (1) an ordinary least squares\ncorrection for Normal outcome models, (2) a multi-step predictive value\nweighting method, and (3) a seamless expectation-maximization algorithm. We\napply our misclassification correction strategies to investigate the mediating\nrole of gestational hypertension on the association between maternal age and\npre-term birth.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
