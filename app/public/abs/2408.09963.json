Our main\nresult shows that totally-isotropic polynomials of graphical alternating matrix\nspaces give rise to a natural q-analogue of graph independence polynomials.\n  For p-groups of class 2 and exponent p, this family of polynomials over\nfields of order p can be naturally interpreted as enumerating their abelian\nsubgroups containing the commutator subgroup according to the orders. With this\ninterpretation, our main result has implications to graphical groups over\nfinite fields, in the same spirit as the results in (Bull. Lond. Math. Soc.,\n2022) by Rossmann, who studied enumerating conjugacy classes of graphical\ngroups over finite fields.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
