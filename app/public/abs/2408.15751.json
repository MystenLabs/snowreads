As an alternative, optimizing existing traffic\nmanagement systems, particularly through adaptive traffic signal control,\noffers a promising solution. This paper explores the use of Reinforcement\nLearning (RL) to enhance traffic signal operations at intersections, aiming to\nreduce congestion without extensive sensor networks. We introduce two RL-based\nalgorithms: a turn-based agent, which dynamically prioritizes traffic signals\nbased on real-time queue lengths, and a time-based agent, which adjusts signal\nphase durations according to traffic conditions while following a fixed phase\ncycle. By representing the state as a scalar queue length, our approach\nsimplifies the learning process and lowers deployment costs. The algorithms\nwere tested in four distinct traffic scenarios using seven evaluation metrics\nto comprehensively assess performance. Simulation results demonstrate that both\nRL algorithms significantly outperform conventional traffic signal control\nsystems, highlighting their potential to improve urban traffic flow\nefficiently.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-FMzyS3mWmFzV8Oat7Cyaid4Aon8TXITaiYtqHs-Lys","pdfSize":"621726"}
