However, achieving precise QSP requires a circuit depth that\nscales exponentially with the number of qubits, making it a substantial\nobstacle in harnessing quantum advantage. Recent research suggests using a\nParameterized Quantum Circuit (PQC) to approximate a target state, offering a\nmore scalable solution with reduced circuit depth compared to precise QSP.\nDespite this, the need for iterative updates of circuit parameters results in a\nlengthy runtime, limiting its practical application. In this work, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to leverage a pre-trained neural network to\ndirectly generate the QSP circuit for arbitrary quantum state, thereby\neliminating the significant overhead of online iterations. Our study makes a\nsteady step towards a universal neural designer for approximate QSP.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"PLKZ6GL70kKsq6LTWFozeWilZ_VPduuRxPKCJZ3oiqA","pdfSize":"2878429"}
