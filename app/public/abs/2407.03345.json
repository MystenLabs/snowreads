Known as open-endedness,\nwe've been successful in finding mechanisms that generate new states, but have\nbeen less successful in finding mechanisms that generate new rules. Here, we\nweigh whether or not analyzing the effects of internal and external system\nconstraints on a system's dynamics would be a fruitful avenue to understanding\nopen-endedness. We discuss the connection between physical constraints and the\nways that the system can physically reach possible states while those\nconstraints are present. It seems that the physical constraints that define\nbiological objects (and dynamics) are maintained by dynamics that occur from\nwithin the system. This is in opposition to current modeling approaches where\nsystem constraints are maintained externally. We suggest that constraints can\nbe characterized as variables whose values are either completely conserved,\nquasi-conserved, or conditionally conserved. Regardless of whether or not a\nconstrained variable is a part of the biological object or present in the\nobject's environment, we discuss how the accessible system states under that\nconstraint can lead to local, emergent conservation laws (rules), with\nexamples. Finally, we discuss the possible benefits of formally understanding\nhow system constraints that emerge from within a system lead to system dynamics\nthat can be characterized as new, emergent rules -- particularly for artificial\nintelligence, hybrid life, embodiment, astrobiology, and more. Understanding\nhow new, local rules might emerge from within the system is crucial for\nunderstanding how open-ended systems continually discover new update rules, in\naddition to continually discovering new states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ObazguTQZSR83BfYGX4VaX9xC-1rJ_A02F-N9bSHF_c","pdfSize":"6609643"}
