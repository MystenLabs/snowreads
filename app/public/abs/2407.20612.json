The\nmultifractal properties of the eigenstates allow for charactering various phase\ntransitions. In this work, we perform a thoroughly analysis of the impacts of\nan excited-state quantum phase transition (ESQPT) on the fractal behavior of\nboth static and dynamical wavefunctions in a ferromagentic spin-$1$\nBose-Einstein condensate (BEC).By studying the features of the fractal\ndimensions, we show how the multifractality of eigenstates and time evolved\nstate are affected by the presence of ESQPT. Specifically, the underlying ESQPT\nleads to a strong localization effect, which in turn enables us to use it as an\nindicator of ESQPT. We verify the ability of the fractal dimensions to probe\nthe occurrence of ESQPT through a detailed scaling analysis. We also discuss\nhow the ESQPT manifests itself in the fractal dimensions of the long-time\naveraged state. Our findings further confirm that the multifractal analysis is\na powerful tool for studying of phase transitions in quantum many-body systems\nand also hint an potential application of ESQPTs in burgeoning field of state\npreparation engineering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
