This physics-based architecture is of particular interest as it\nbuilds on the known relationship between velocities and positions. We here aim\nat discussing the advantages, limitations and performance of Tustin-Nets\ncompared to first-principles grey-box models on a real physical apparatus,\nshowing how, with a standard training procedure, the former can hardly achieve\nthe same accuracy as the latter. To address this limitation, we present a\ntraining strategy based on transfer learning that yields Tustin-Nets that are\ncompetitive with the first-principles model, without requiring extensive\nknowledge of the setup as the latter.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
