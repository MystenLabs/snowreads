Nevertheless, their widespread adoption introduces numerous\nchallenges, including issues related to academic integrity, copyright,\nenvironmental impacts, and ethical considerations such as data bias, fairness,\nand privacy. The rapid evolution of LLMs also raises concerns regarding the\nreliability and generalizability of their evaluations. This paper offers a\ncomprehensive survey of the literature on these subjects, systematically\ngathered and synthesized from Google Scholar. Our study provides an in-depth\nanalysis of the risks associated with specific LLMs, identifying sub-risks,\ntheir causes, and potential solutions. Furthermore, we explore the broader\nchallenges related to LLMs, detailing their causes and proposing mitigation\nstrategies. Through this literature analysis, our survey aims to deepen the\nunderstanding of the implications and complexities surrounding these powerful\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SMYwvu9qB23GYrrJLjU0foW2aHDU1JqtPoccvluDbFw","pdfSize":"219379"}
