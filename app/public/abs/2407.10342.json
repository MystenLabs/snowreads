The optimization of the deposition conditions such as temperature,\nV/III ratio, deposition rate, and Si concentration resulted in a high charge\ncarrier concentration (>$10^{15}/cm^{3}$) in the Si-doped Al-rich Al(Ga)N\nfilms. A pulsed deposition condition was employed to achieve a controllable Al\ncomposition greater than 95% and to prevent unintended Ga incorporation in the\nAlGaN material deposited using the close-coupled showerhead reactor. Also, the\neffect of unintentional Si incorporation on free charge carrier concentration\nat the regrowth interface was observed by varying the thickness of the regrown\nAl(Ga)N layer. A maximum charge carrier concentration of $4.8\\times\n10^{16}/cm^3$ and $7.5\\times 10^{15}/cm^3$ were achieved for Al0.97Ga0.03N and\nAlN films with thickness <300 nm compared to previously reported n-Al(Ga)N\nfilms with thickness $\\ge$400 nm deposited using MOCVD technique.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
