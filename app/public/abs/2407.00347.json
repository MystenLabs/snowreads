Traditionally, this requires users to\nshare their data with model owners for fine-tuning, which is not only costly\nbut also raises significant privacy concerns. Furthermore, fine-tuning\nlarge-scale models is computationally intensive and often impractical for many\nusers. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a system that combines\noffsite-tuning with physical-layer security, which provides local data owners\nwith a lightweight adapter and a compressed emulator. Data owners then\nfine-tune the adapter locally and securely send it back to the model owners\nthrough a confidential channel for integration, ensuring privacy and resource\nconservation. Our paper focuses on optimizing computational resource allocation\namong data owners and the large model owner deployed on edge, and on the\ncompression ratio of adapters. We incorporate a secrecy uplink channel to\nmaximize the utility that we defined while minimizing system costs like energy\nconsumption and delay. The optimization uses the Dinkelbach algorithm,\nfractional programming, successive convex approximation and alternating\noptimization. Experiments demonstrate our algorithm's superiority over existing\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
