Our approach\nfirst calibrates the image with the help of the color checker target, and then\ntrains a supervised-learning model to predict the skin color. In the\ncalibration stage, We propose to use three different transformation matrices to\nmap the device dependent RGB response to the reference CIE XYZ space. In so\ndoing, color correction error can be minimized. We then compute the average\nvalue of the region of interest in the calibrated images, and feed them to the\nprediction model. We explored both the linear regression and support vector\nregression models. Cross-validation results show that both models can\naccurately make the prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
