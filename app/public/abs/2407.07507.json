In this work, we consider a quantum channel exploiting a\nSilicon-photomultiplier-based receiver and evaluate its performance for quantum\ncommunication protocols under three possible configurations, defined by\ndifferent post-processing of the detection outcomes. We investigate two\nscenarios: information transmission over the channel, quantified by the mutual\ninformation, and continuous-variable quantum key distribution. The preliminary\nresults encourage further use of this detection scheme in extended networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
