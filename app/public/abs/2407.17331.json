However, the instance discrimination method\nused by CLIP can hardly encode the semantic structure of training data. To\nhandle this limitation, cluster discrimination has been proposed through\niterative cluster assignment and classification. Nevertheless, most cluster\ndiscrimination approaches only define a single pseudo-label for each image,\nneglecting multi-label signals in the image. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMulti-Label Cluster Discrimination method named MLCD to enhance representation\nlearning. In the clustering step, we first cluster the large-scale LAION-400M\ndataset into one million centers based on off-the-shelf embedding features.\nConsidering that natural images frequently contain multiple visual objects or\nattributes, we select the multiple closest centers as auxiliary class labels.\nIn the discrimination step, we design a novel multi-label classification loss,\nwhich elegantly separates losses from positive classes and negative classes,\nand alleviates ambiguity on decision boundary. We validate the proposed\nmulti-label cluster discrimination method with experiments on different scales\nof models and pre-training datasets. Experimental results show that our method\nachieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks including\nlinear probe, zero-shot classification, and image-text retrieval.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
