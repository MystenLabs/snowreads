There are recent and relevant advances applying machine learning for\nprotein structure prediction and repeat classification that are useful for this\nprocess. However, no service contemplates required databases and software to\nsupplement researching on repeat proteins. In this publication we present\nDaisy, an integrated repeat protein curation web service. This service can\nprocess Protein Data Bank (PDB) and the AlphaFold Database entries for tandem\nrepeats identification. In addition, it uses an algorithm to search a sequence\nagainst a library of Pfam hidden Markov model (HMM). Repeat classifications are\nassociated with the identified families through RepeatsDB. This prediction is\nconsidered for enhancing the ReUPred algorithm execution and hastening the\nrepeat units identification process. The service can also operate every\nassociated PDB and AlphaFold structure with a UniProt proteome registry.\nAvailability: The Daisy web service is freely accessible at\ndaisy.bioinformatica.org.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"jMt2CEfGGVOext7FxAzoAh_ubGAARYKwsCcAtk6HuSw","pdfSize":"2349144"}
