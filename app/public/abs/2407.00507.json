However, instead of assuming\nreciprocity, AVOCADO poses an adaptive control problem that aims at adapting in\nreal-time to the cooperation degree of other robots and agents. Adaptation is\nachieved through a novel nonlinear opinion dynamics design that relies solely\non sensor observations. As a by-product, based on the nonlinear opinion\ndynamics, we propose a novel method to avoid the deadlocks under geometrical\nsymmetries among robots and agents. Extensive numerical simulations show that\nAVOCADO surpasses existing geometrical, learning and planning-based approaches\nin mixed cooperative/non-cooperative navigation environments in terms of\nsuccess rate, time to goal and computational time. In addition, we conduct\nmultiple real experiments that verify that AVOCADO is able to avoid collisions\nin environments crowded with other robots and humans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
