Moreover,\nthe broken power-law power spectrum has abundant near-peak features and our\nresults can be used as a near-peak approximation that covers a wide range of\nmodels. Our analytical approximation is useful in the rapid generation of the\nSIGW energy spectrum, which is beneficial for gravitational wave data analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
