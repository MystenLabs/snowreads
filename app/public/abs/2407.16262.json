We formulate\na criterion on the action of the group generated by the orthogonal parts of the\nIFS on $\\pi$, and show that it ensures the dimension of $\\pi \\nu$ is preserved;\nthis significantly refines previous results by Hochman-Shmerkin (2012) and\nFalconer-Jin (2014), and is sharp for projections to lines and hyperplanes. A\nkey ingredient in the proof is an application of a restricted projection\ntheorem of Gan-Guo-Wang (2024).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
