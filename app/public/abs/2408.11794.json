This leads to reduced operational costs and\nimproved financial performance through optimized system design, resource\nallocation, and system-wide synergies. In addition, system planners must\nconsider multiple probable scenarios to plan for potential variations in\noperating conditions, uncertainties, and future demands, ensuring robust and\nadaptable solutions that can effectively address the needs and challenges of\nvarious systems. This research introduces Co-design Architecture for\nMulti-objective Energy System Optimization (CAMEO), which facilitates design\nspace exploration of the co-design problem via a modular and automated workflow\nsystem, enhancing flexibility and accelerating the design and validation\ncycles. The cloud-scale automation provides a user-friendly interface and\nenable energy system modelers to efficiently explore diverse design\nalternatives. CAMEO aims to revolutionize energy system optimization by\ndeveloping next-generation design assistant with improved scalability,\nusability, and automation, thereby enabling the development of optimized energy\nsystems with greater ease and speed.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
