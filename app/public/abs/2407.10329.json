This chapter explores how genAI intersects with\nnon-discrimination laws, identifying shortcomings and suggesting improvements.\nIt highlights two main types of discriminatory outputs: (i) demeaning and\nabusive content and (ii) subtler biases due to inadequate representation of\nprotected groups, which may not be overtly discriminatory in individual cases\nbut have cumulative discriminatory effects. For example, genAI systems may\npredominantly depict white men when asked for images of people in important\njobs.\n  This chapter examines these issues, categorizing problematic outputs into\nthree legal categories: discriminatory content; harassment; and legally hard\ncases like unbalanced content, harmful stereotypes or misclassification. It\nargues for holding genAI providers and deployers liable for discriminatory\noutputs and highlights the inadequacy of traditional legal frameworks to\naddress genAI-specific issues. The chapter suggests updating EU laws, including\nthe AI Act, to mitigate biases in training and input data, mandating testing\nand auditing, and evolving legislation to enforce standards for bias mitigation\nand inclusivity as technology advances.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
