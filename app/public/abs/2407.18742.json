Here, we directly\nprobe the electron spin properties in bulk silicon by measuring the\npolarization of luminescence following circularly polarized light excitation.\nThe experiments performed for both direct and indirect gap excitation allow not\nonly an experimental determination of the optical selection rules in silicon\nfor the different phononassisted transitions but they also lead to the\nmeasurement of the spin relaxation of electrons in conditions which are not\naccessible using transport techniques. We also measure the spin properties of\nfree excitons in bulk silicon, a very little explored field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
