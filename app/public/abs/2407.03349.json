By taking advantage of the orthogonality of the original\nbasis, our procedure circumvents the well-known instability problem arising\nfrom the matrix inversion involved in classical polynomial regression.\nMoreover, the recurrent generation of biorthogonal polynomials in our framework\nfacilitates the upgrading of all polynomials to include one additional element\nin the set whilst also allowing for a natural downgrading of the polynomial\nregression approximation. This is achieved by the posterior removal of any\nbasis element leading to a straightforward approach for reducing the\napproximation order. We illustrate the usefulness of this approach through a\nseries of examples where we derive the resulting biorthogonal polynomials from\nLegendre, Laguerre, and Chebyshev orthogonal bases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
