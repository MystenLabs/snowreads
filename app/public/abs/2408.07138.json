This preferential\nsurface termination leads to a significant surface to bulk core level shift for\nthe Ni 2p X-ray photoemission core level, not seen in the corresponding Fe 2p\ncore level spectra. Inverse photoemission spectroscopy (IPES), thus provides\nsome indication of the density of states resulting from the dmit2 =\n1,3-dithiol-2-thione-4,5-dithiolato ligand unoccupied molecular orbitals.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
