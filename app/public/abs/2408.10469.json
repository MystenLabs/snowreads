In this work, we combine\nthe strengths of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) models SAM2 and Cutie to address\nthese challenges. Additionally, we explore the impact of various\nhyperparameters on video instance segmentation performance. Our approach\nachieves a J\\&F score of 0.7952 in the testing phase of LSVOS challenge VOS\ntrack, ranking third overall.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
