Lean is\nalso a functional programming language, so it should be possible to implement\ncomputational polynomials in Lean. It turns out not to be as easy as the naive\nauthor thought.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
