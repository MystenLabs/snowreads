We consider the $t$-$J$ model, in which the\nnearest-neighbor spin interaction $J_1$ is smaller than the\nnext-nearest-neighbor interaction $J_2$ corresponding to the CuO double-chain\nstructure. We vary $J_1$ from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic values and\ncalculate the correlation functions including the superconducting pair\ncorrelation function. Employing the density-matrix renormalization group\nmethod, we show that the ground state for antiferromagnetic $J_1$ exhibits the\nhallmarks of the Luther-Emery liquid phase, in which the spin-singlet pair and\ncharge-density-wave correlations exhibit power-law decays against distance, and\nthe spin correlation function decays exponentially. Its signatures are\ngradually dismissed as $J_1$ approaches the ferromagnetic regime. Our findings\nsuggest that the antiferromagnetic double-chain structure without ferromagnetic\nbonds is favorable for superconductivity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
