These Ising machines typically\nrequire an optical modulator to represent the analog spin variables of these\nproblems. However, modern day optical modulators have a relatively low\nmodulation resolution. We therefore investigate how the low bit-resolution of\noptical hardware influences the performance of this type of novel computing\nplatform. Based on numerical simulations, we determine the minimum required\nbit-resolution of an optical Ising machine for different benchmark problems of\ndifferent sizes. Our study shows that a limited bit-resolution of 8bit is\nsufficient for the optical modulator. Surprisingly, we also observe that the\nuse of a 1bit-resolution modulator significantly improves the performance of\nthe Ising machine across all considered benchmark problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"l_K0NdOXkGvAWU_CcxOswT0aspxqSxISbHJuDj8Ps54","pdfSize":"3296349"}
