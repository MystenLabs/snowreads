We present\nobservations of three young brown dwarfs: 2MASS J12003792-7845082, TWA 28, and\n2MASS J08561384-1342242, with the goal of constraining their chemical\ncompositions, thermal profiles, surface gravities, spin rotations, and\n$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C. Atmospheric retrievals of CRIRES$^+$ K-band spectra were\nconducted using the radiative transfer code petitRADTRANS coupled with the\nBayesian inference algorithm MultiNest, resulting in a detailed\ncharacterization of the atmospheres of these objects. We report the volume\nmixing ratios of main molecular and atomic species, including the novel\ndetection of hydrogen fluoride (HF) in a brown dwarf's atmosphere, and\ndetermine $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C values of $81^{+28}_{-19}$ and $79^{+20}_{-14}$ in\nthe atmospheres of TWA 28 and J0856, respectively, with strong significance\n($>3\\sigma$). Tentative evidence ($\\sim 2\\sigma$) of $^{13}$C in J1200 was\nfound, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C = $114^{+69}_{-33}$, along with $^{18}$O detected\nat moderate significance in J0856 (3.3$\\sigma$) and TWA 28 (2.1$\\sigma$). The\nretrieved thermal profiles indicate hot atmospheres (2300-2600 K) with low\nsurface gravities and slow spins, consistent with young objects. The consistent\ncarbon isotope ratios among the three objects, showing no significant deviation\nfrom the local ISM, suggest a fragmentation-based formation mechanism similar\nto star formation. The tentative detection of $^{18}$O in two objects\nhighlights the potential of high-resolution spectroscopy to probe additional\nisotope ratios, such as $^{16}$O/$^{18}$O, in the atmospheres of brown dwarfs\nand super-Jupiters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
