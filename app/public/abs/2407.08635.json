In this study, we investigate the magnetic\ndipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic octupole moments of the $\\Xi_c^*\\bar\nK$ state within the context of the QCD light-cone sum rule. During this\nanalysis, we posit that the $\\Xi_c^*\\bar K$ state assumes a molecular structure\nwith quantum numbers $J^P = \\frac{3}{2}^-$. The extracted outcomes are given as\n$\\mu_{\\Xi_c^*\\bar K} = 0.15^{+0.04}_{-0.03}\\,\\mu_N$, $\\mathcal{Q}_{\\Xi_c^*\\bar\nK} = (-0.93^{+0.22}_{-0.17})\\times 10^{-3}\\,\\rm{fm^2}$, and\n$\\mathcal{O}_{\\Xi_c^*\\bar K} = (-0.45^{+0.10}_{-0.09})\\times\n10^{-4}\\,\\rm{fm^3}$. The findings of this study, when considered alongside\nother pertinent characteristics, may assist in elucidating the nature of this\ncontroversial phenomenon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
