We develop a\nmaster-equation treatment of optically detected magnetic resonance,\nincorporating IR light saturation effects. This master equation provides the\nsinglet population, which is then utilized to calculate the reflectivity and\nultimately derive the magnetic field sensitivity taking into account photon and\nspin shot noise. We further show that our model is compatible with experiments\nof IR-based NV center magnetometry. Through optimization in a high-parameter\nspace, we uncover the potential to achieve sensitivities in the order of\nsub-pico tesla, even for sub-millimeter scales.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
