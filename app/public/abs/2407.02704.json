The first effort is the study of regular transductions, which\nextends the notion of regularity from languages into word-to-word functions.\nThe other important effort is generalizing the notion of regular languages from\nwords to arbitrary monads, introduced in arXiv:1502.04898. In this paper, we\npresent a number of examples of transducer classes that fit the proposed\nframework. In particular we show that our class generalizes the classes of\nMealy machines and rational transductions. We also present examples of\nrecognizable transducers for infinite words and a specific type of trees called\nterms. The main result of this paper is a theorem, which states the class of\nrecognizable transductions is closed under composition, subject to some\ncoherence axioms between the structure of a monad and the structure of a\ncomonad. Due to its complexity, we formalize the proof of the theorem in Coq\nProof Assistant. In the proof, we introduce the concepts of a context and a\ngeneralized wreath product for Eilenberg-Moore algebras, which could be\nvaluable tools for studying these algebras.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"58YPxUilLChnLjD10jwl4_9nk4sMKqahMvE3j43ZWRo","pdfSize":"1456462"}
