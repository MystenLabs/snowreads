This\nproblem is about a ma\\^{i}tre d' seating diners around a table, trying to\nmaximize the number of diners who don't get napkins. Along with this problem,\nWinkler introduces a variation called the adaptive ma\\^{i}tre d' and presents a\nstrategy. This problem was later investigated and a better strategy was\ndiscovered by Acton et al. [2]. We describe an even better strategy which we\ncall ``long trap setting\" and prove that it is optimal. We also derive a\nformula for the expected number of napkinless diners under our optimal\nstrategy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
