While assortment optimization has been a\nmajor topic in revenue management for decades, the mixed-logit model is\nconsidered one of the most general and flexible approaches for modeling and\npredicting customer purchasing behavior. Existing exact methods have primarily\nrelied on mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) or second-order cone (CONIC)\nreformulations, which allow for exact problem solving using off-the-shelf\nsolvers. However, these approaches often suffer from weak continuous\nrelaxations and are slow when solving large instances. Our work addresses the\nproblem by focusing on components of the objective function that can be proven\nto be monotonically super-modular and convex. This allows us to derive valid\ncuts to outer-approximate the nonlinear objective functions. We then\ndemonstrate that these valid cuts can be incorporated into Cutting Plane or\nBranch-and-Cut methods to solve the problem exactly. Extensive experiments show\nthat our approaches consistently outperform previous methods in terms of both\nsolution quality and computation time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
