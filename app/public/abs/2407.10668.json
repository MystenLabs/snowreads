Written\nwith a view towards applications in hyperbolicity, rational points, and entire\ncurves, it introduces the fundamental definitions of C-pair-theory\nsystematically. In particular, it establishes an appropriate notion of\n\"morphism\", which agrees with notions from the literature in the smooth case,\nbut is better behaved in the singular setting and has functorial properties\nthat relate it to minimal model theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
