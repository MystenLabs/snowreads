We investigate the impact of a\nstatic electric field on the superradiant emission process between Rydberg\n$|60D_{5/2}\\rangle$ and $|61P_{3/2}\\rangle$ states in an ultracold Cesium\nRydberg atom ensemble. We report experimental observations of a significant\nslowdown in superradiance upon applying an electric field. To understand the\nslowing down dynamics, we employ a discrete truncated Wigner approximation\n(DTWA) method to solve the corresponding master equation numerically. Our\nnumerical simulations demonstrate that superradiance decoherence is caused by\nthe Stark shifts of the Rydberg level. Our theoretical simulations\nqualitatively match the experimental observations. Our work provides new\ninsights into controlling quantum critical behaviors, with implications for\nquantum many-body dynamics, and the study of quantum phase transitions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
