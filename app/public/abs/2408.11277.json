Our study assumes that the energy\ngap of detector $B$ exceeds that of detector $A$. It is shown that\n$A\\rightarrow B$ steerability is bigger that $B\\rightarrow A$ steerability,\nimplying that the observer with a small energy gap has more stronger\nsteerability than the other one. We find that the energy gap difference can\nenlarge the harvesting-achievable range of $A\\rightarrow B$ steering, while it\ncan also narrow the harvesting-achievable range of $B\\rightarrow A$ steering at\nthe same time. In addition, the maximal steering asymmetry indicates the\ntransformation between two-way steering and one-way steering in some cases,\nshowing that $B\\rightarrow A$ steering suffers ``sudden death\" at the point of\nthis parameter. These results suggest that asymmetric steering exhibits richer\nand more interesting properties than quantum entanglement harvested from vacuum\nquantum field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7Q1CK2KVoWJXImO-XkP3KjeHxMK-x1h0-9wMffK5WN8","pdfSize":"256365"}
