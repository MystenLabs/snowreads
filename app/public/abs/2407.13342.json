However, inferring continuous signed distance\nfields from discrete unoriented point clouds still remains a challenge. The\nneural network typically fits the shape with a rough surface and omits\nfine-grained geometric details such as shape edges and corners. In this paper,\nwe propose a novel non-linear implicit filter to smooth the implicit field\nwhile preserving high-frequency geometry details. Our novelty lies in that we\ncan filter the surface (zero level set) by the neighbor input points with\ngradients of the signed distance field. By moving the input raw point clouds\nalong the gradient, our proposed implicit filtering can be extended to non-zero\nlevel sets to keep the promise consistency between different level sets, which\nconsequently results in a better regularization of the zero level set. We\nconduct comprehensive experiments in surface reconstruction from objects and\ncomplex scene point clouds, the numerical and visual comparisons demonstrate\nour improvements over the state-of-the-art methods under the widely used\nbenchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
