We identify filament\nspines using DisPerSE and isolate galaxies residing in filamentary\nenvironments. Employing a FoF algorithm, we delineate individual filaments and\ndetermine their axes by diagonalizing the moment of inertia tensor. The\norientations of galaxy pairs relative to the axis of their host filament are\nanalyzed. Our study covers diverse subsets of filaments identified through\nvarying linking lengths, examining how galaxy pairs align with the filament\naxis across different spatial parameters such as pair separation and distance\nfrom the filament spine. We consistently observe a strong alignment pattern\ncharacterized by the probability distribution for the cosine of the orientation\nangle, which is nearly identical in each case. Furthermore, the study\ninvestigates the impact of redshift space distortions, confirming that the\nalignment signal persists in both real and redshift space. To validate our\nmethod, we employ Monte Carlo simulations with different theoretical\nprobability distributions. Our results reaffirm previous findings with\nprojected two-dimensional distributions and extend our understanding of how\nfilaments impact the spatial organization and evolution of galaxies across\ncosmic scales.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
