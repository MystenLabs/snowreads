As an application we consider the problem of maximising the expected\nutility of the terminal wealth in a semimartingale setting, where the\nsemimartingale is written in terms of a time-changed Brownian motion and a\nfinite variation process. To solve this problem, we use an initial enlargement\nof filtration and our change of variable formulas to shift the problem to a\nmaximisation problem under the enlarged filtration for models driven by a\nBrownian motion and a finite variation process. The latter problem can be\nsolved by using martingale properties. Then applying again a change of variable\nformula, we derive the optimal strategy for the original problem for a power\nutility and for a logarithmic utility.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
