We first\nshow that the tangent bundle $T_S$ of $S$ is not big if $S$ is a rational\nelliptic surface. We then study the property of bigness of the tangent bundle\n$T_S$ of a weak del Pezzo surface $S$. When the degree of $S$ is $4$, we\ncompletely determine the bigness of the tangent bundle through the\nconfiguration of $(-2)$-curves. When the degree $d$ of $S$ is less than or\nequal to $3$, we get a partial answer. In particular, we show that $T_S$ is not\nbig when the number of $(-2)$-curves is less than or equal to $7-d$, and $T_S$\nis big when $d=3$ and $S$ has the maximum number of $(-2)$-curves. The main\ningredient of the proof is to produce irreducible effective divisors on\n$\\mathbb{P}(T_S)$, using Serrano's work on the relative tangent bundle when $S$\nhas a fibration, or the total dual VMRT associated to a conic fibration on $S$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JKIm4iJmf7btcBge6P8edwnHGY5yjo3_0BxlZINvx0c","pdfSize":"518297"}
