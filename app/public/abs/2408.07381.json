The ferroelectric ground state of both smectic phases was\nconfirmed by their second harmonic generation activity and polarization\nswitching. In SmCF phase polarization becomes oriented to electric field by\ndecreasing the tilt angle to zero. Although both smectic phases are\nferroelectric in nature, their dielectric response was found to be very\ndifferent.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
