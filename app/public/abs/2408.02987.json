Due to\nthe uncontrollable factors like abrupt sensors breakdown or communication\nfault, the spatiotemporal signal collected by sensors is always incomplete. A\ndynamic graph convolutional network (DGCN) is effective for processing\nspatiotemporal signal recovery. However, it adopts a static GCN and a sequence\nneural network to explore the spatial and temporal patterns, separately. Such a\nseparated two-step processing is loose spatiotemporal, thereby failing to\ncapture the complex inner spatiotemporal correlation. To address this issue,\nthis paper proposes a Compact-Dynamic Graph Convolutional Network (CDGCN) for\nspatiotemporal signal recovery with the following two-fold ideas: a) leveraging\nthe tensor M-product to build a unified tensor graph convolution framework,\nwhich considers both spatial and temporal patterns simultaneously; and b)\nconstructing a differential smoothness-based objective function to reduce the\nnoise interference in spatiotemporal signal, thereby further improve the\nrecovery accuracy. Experiments on real-world spatiotemporal datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed CDGCN significantly outperforms the\nstate-of-the-art models in terms of recovery accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
