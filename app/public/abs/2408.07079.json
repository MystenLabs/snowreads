One of the\nmost predominant biomarkers in neuroimaging is represented by brain age, which\nhas been shown to be a good indicator for different conditions, such as\nAlzheimer's Disease. Using brain age for pretraining DL models in transfer\nlearning settings has also recently shown promising results, especially when\ndealing with data scarcity of different conditions. On the other hand,\nanatomical information of brain MRIs (e.g. cortical thickness) can provide\nimportant information for learning good representations that can be transferred\nto many downstream tasks. In this work, we propose AnatCL, an anatomical\nfoundation model for brain MRIs that i.) leverages anatomical information with\na weakly contrastive learning approach and ii.) achieves state-of-the-art\nperformances in many different downstream tasks. To validate our approach we\nconsider 12 different downstream tasks for diagnosis classification, and\nprediction of 10 different clinical assessment scores.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
