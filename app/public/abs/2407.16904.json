Forty participants completed a body\ntransfer task twice, once while wearing a headset in video passthrough and once\nwithout a headset. Results indicate that using video passthrough induces\nsimulator sickness, creates social absence, (another person in the physical\nroom feels less present), alters self-reported body schema, and distorts\ndistance perception. On the other hand, compared to past research which showed\nperceptual aftereffects from video passthrough, the current study found none.\nWe discuss the broader implications for the widespread adoption of mixed\nreality headsets and their impact on theories surrounding presence and body\ntransfer.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
