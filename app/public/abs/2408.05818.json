We prove that they scatter, and that\nthe wave operators mapping the initial data to the scattering states are 1-1,\nonto and continuous in a suitable topology.\n  Our proof is carried out entirely in physical space, and combines dispersive\nestimates for the free transport with new trilinear bounds for the gain and\nloss operators of the KWE on weighted Lebesgue spaces. A fundamental tool in\nobtaining these bounds is a novel collisional averaging estimate.\n  Finally we show that the nonlinear evolution preserves positivity forward in\ntime. For this, we use the Kaniel-Shinbrot iteration scheme \\cite{KS}, properly\ninitialized to ensure the successive approximations are dispersive.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Ep5N08VdtPOOj56JGZ11Qt0RIcM-ybZ63kgVErY2wN4","pdfSize":"451583"}
