This model\ncan characterize the stubbornness of the human, which measures how strong the\nhuman adheres to his preferred trajectory. Accordingly, a static model is\nintroduced indicating a link between the force in haptically coupled\nhuman-robot interactions and humans's stubbornness. The introduced stubbornness\nparameter enables an application-independent reaction of the automation for the\ncooperative trajectory planning. Simulation results in the context of\nhuman-machine cooperation in a care application show that the proposed\nbehavioral model can quantitatively estimate the stubbornness of the\ninteracting human, enabling a more targeted adaptation of the automation to the\nhuman behavior.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
