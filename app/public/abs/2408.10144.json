We first give a characterization\nof biharmonic conformal immersions of totally umbilical surfaces into a generic\n3-manifold. As an application, we give a method to produce biharmonic conformal\nimmersions into a conformally flat 3-space. We then use the method to obtain a\nclassification of biharmonic maps in a family of conformal immersions and\nconstruct many examples of biharmonic conformal immersions from a 2-sphere into\na conformal 3-sphere. Our examples include proper biharmonic conformal\nimmersions of a 2-sphere minus a point into a conformal 3-sphere with\nnonconstant conformal factor and the biharmonic isometric immersion\n$S^2(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}})\\to S^3$ which was found in [2]. Finally, we study\nbiharmonic conformal immersions of Hopf cylinders of a Riemannian submersion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Y3B0XROTozofuplcZT1ZXBEWcX8fI5LikouzGfR-cMU","pdfSize":"250831"}
