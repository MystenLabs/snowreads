Earlier work had shown that the computation of\ngeodesic distance can be challenging for Lie groups relevant to harmonic\noscillators. Here, this problem is approached by working to leading order in an\nexpansion by the structure constants of the Lie group. An explicit formula for\nan upper bound on the quantum complexity of a harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian\nwith time-dependent frequency is derived. Applied to a massless test scalar\nfield on a cosmological de Sitter background, the upper bound on complexity as\na function of the scale factor exhibits a logarithmic increase on super-Hubble\nscales. This result aligns with the gate complexity and earlier studies of de\nSitter complexity. It provides a proof of concept for the application of\nNielsen complexity in cosmology, together with a systematic setting in which\nhigher-order terms can be included.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
