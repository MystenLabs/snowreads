Each vector $u_a$\ncomes from a space $U_a$ called an axis (or mode), the output $\\langle\nt|u_1,\\ldots, u_{\\ell}\\rangle$ lies in a base space $U_0$. In applications,\naxes often function as linear models of input parameters to a multiparameter\nprocess. The tensor then models the complex ways these parameters interact to\nproduce a vector in the base which models outcomes. Thus some linear methods\nbecome accessible on a nonlinear problem.\n  Many applications of tensors use decompositions $U_a=X_{a,1}\\oplus \\cdots\n\\oplus X_{a,k_a}$ with a prescribed subset $\\Delta$ of coordinates\n$(i_0,i_1,\\ldots, i_{\\ell})$, $1\\leq i_a\\leq k_a$, where \\[\n  (i_0,i_1,\\ldots, i_{\\ell})\\not\\in \\Delta\n  \\qquad \\Longrightarrow \\qquad\n  \\langle t|X_{1,i_1},\\ldots, X_{\\ell,i_{\\ell}}\\rangle \\leq\n  \\sum_{j\\neq i_0} X_{0,j}. \\] We call $\\Delta$ a cluster pattern and observe\nthat these generalize familiar structures such as echelon forms, block\ndiagonalization, orthogonal, eigen, and singular value decompositions, and\nclustering more broadly.\n  This article introduces a class of efficiently computable cluster patterns\nthat emerge from an underlying Lie theory of multilinear maps. The new family\ngeneralizes known cluster patterns such as Tucker decompositions and block\ndiagonal decompositions but also includes decompositions that approximate\ncurves and surfaces. The latter patterns can capture properties of data\ncategories that do not decompose into the types of disjoint clustering for\nwhich existing methods are designed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
