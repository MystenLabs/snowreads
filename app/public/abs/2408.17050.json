The secure ISAC\nchannel is modeled as two state-dependent fast-fading channels with correlated\nRayleigh fading coefficients and independent additive Gaussian noise\ncomponents. Delayed channel outputs are fed back to the transmitter to improve\nthe communication performance and to estimate the channel state sequence. We\nestablish and illustrate an achievable secrecy-distortion region for degraded\nsecure ISAC channels under correlated Rayleigh fading. We also evaluate the\ninner bound for a large set of parameters to derive practical design insights\nfor secure ISAC methods. The presented results include in particular parameter\nranges for which the secrecy capacity of a classical wiretap channel setup is\nsurpassed and for which the channel capacity is approached.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
