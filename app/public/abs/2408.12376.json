Based historically on the visual measures, nowadays\nthe orbits rely more (or exclusively) on the accurate speckle data. This\nprompts reconsideration of the methods of orbit calculation, undertaken here\nand illustrated by 20 examples, from accurate to drastically revised and\ntentative orbits. Good understanding and critical assessment of the input data\nis a key requirement, especially concerning visual measures. Combination of\nvisual and speckle data is still needed for long-period binaries, but the\nrelative weights must match their respective errors. When the orbit can be\nfully constrained only by accurate speckle data, the old measures should be\nignored. Orbits can be classified into three grades: A - fully constrained, B -\nsemi-constrained, and C - preliminary or tentative. Typical use cases of visual\norbits are listed. Accurate parallaxes from Gaia, together with the orbits,\nwill greatly expand the data on stellar masses. Continued speckle monitoring\nwill be an essential complement to Gaia, but the vast amount of new pairs will\nrestrict future work on orbits to the most interesting or relevant objects.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DA_wMTd6SegrLZy6371H93ClPK2yNU097vDdC3DCl9k","pdfSize":"554452"}
