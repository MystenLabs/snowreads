The\nresulting problem is a sequential decision-making problem with rolling\nforecasts. In addition to a risk-neutral objective, this paper formulates two\nrisk-aware objectives that control the conditional value-at-risk of system cost\nand the buffered probability of exceeding a predefined threshold of unserved\nload. The resulting policy uses a parameter-modified cost function\napproximation that reduces the computational load compared to the direct\ninclusion of those risk measures in the problem objective. We demonstrate our\nmethod on a numerical case study.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
