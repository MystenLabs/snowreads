Yet, the interpretation of ultrasound images is often complicated\nby acoustic shadows, speckle noise, and other artifacts that obscure crucial\ndiagnostic details. To address these challenges, our study presents a novel\nunsupervised anomaly detection framework specifically designed for fetal\nultrasound imaging. This framework incorporates gestational age filtering,\nprecise identification of fetal standard planes, and targeted segmentation of\nbrain regions to enhance diagnostic accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce the use\nof denoising diffusion probabilistic models in this context, marking a\nsignificant innovation in detecting previously unrecognized anomalies. We\nrigorously evaluated the framework using various diffusion-based anomaly\ndetection methods, noise types, and noise levels. Notably, AutoDDPM emerged as\nthe most effective, achieving an area under the precision-recall curve of\n79.8\\% in detecting anomalies. This advancement holds promise for improving the\ntools available for nuanced and effective prenatal diagnostics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bVKE-g4U8VfqmCxKpvhG-F7GcFPnCS7xwbkMMWtqb5k","pdfSize":"33011917"}
