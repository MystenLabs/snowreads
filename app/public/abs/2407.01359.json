We call the resulting geometry a generalized\nSiklos space-time. After deriving a number of identities for complex spaces, we\nspecialize to Lorentz signature, where we show that the Killing function must\nbe real and that the corresponding Dirac spinor is Majorana (as long as the\nspace-time is not conformally flat), and we obtain the local form of the\nmetric. We show that the purely gravitational degrees of freedom correspond to\nwaves, whereas the matter sources generically correspond, via Einstein's field\nequations, to a sum of pure radiation and a space-like perfect fluid.\nConsequently, we conclude that the physically relevant case is obtained when\nthe Killing function is homogeneous on the wave surfaces.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
