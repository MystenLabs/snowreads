The course is taught for ten weeks to a mix of students from\ndifferent study programs and combines both practical assignments with a\nclosed-book exam. We discuss the challenges of teaching a course on research\nmethods and explain how we address these challenges in the course design.\nAdditionally, we share our lessons learned and the do's and don'ts we learned\nover several iterations of teaching the course.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
