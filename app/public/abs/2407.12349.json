We prove\nthat the scheme preserves the thermodynamic structure, that is, the balance of\nmass and volumetric fluid content and the energy dissipation balance. The\nexistence of discrete solutions is established under suitable growth\nconditions. Furthermore, it is shown that the algorithm can be realised as a\nsplitting method, that is, decoupling the Cahn-Hilliard subsystem from the\nporo-elasticity subsystem, while the first one is nonlinear and the second\nsubsystem is linear. The schemes are illustrated by numerical examples and a\nconvergence test.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
