To realize NC, electronic analogues of brain\ncomponents, such as synapses and neurons, must be designed. In spintronics,\ndomain wall (DW) based magnetic tunnel junctions - which offer both synaptic\nand neuronal functionalities - are one of the promising candidates. An\nelectronic neuron should exhibit leaky-integrate-fire functions similar to\ntheir biological counterparts. However, most experimental studies focused only\non the integrate-and-fire functions, overlooking the leaky function. Here, we\nreport on a domain wall neuron device that achieves integration using\nspin-orbit torque-induced domain wall motion and a leaky function via synthetic\nantiferromagnetic coupling. By fabricating Hall bar devices in a special\ngeometry, we could achieve these two functionalities. During the leaky process,\nthe maximum DW velocity achieved was 2500 {\\mu}m/s. The proposed design\nutilizes materials used in STT-MRAM fabrication and is compatible with CMOS\nfabrication. Therefore, this neuron can be readily integrated into NC.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CJ9tCWfw5K5HtBvsRjCPwYR9yVcGeTxLHYoP1SQNZ2o","pdfSize":"899474"}
