While inferential tasks become\nchallenging when data is collected in a sequential manner, we argue that this\nproblem can be alleviated when the sequential algorithm at hand satisfies\ncertain stability property. This notion of stability is motivated from the\nseminal work of Lai and Wei (1982). Our first main result shows that such a\nstability property is always satisfied for the UCB algorithm, and as a result\nthe sample means for each arm are asymptotically normal. Next, we examine the\nstability properties of the UCB algorithm when the number of arms $K$ is\nallowed to grow with the number of arm pulls $T$. We show that in such a case\nthe arms are stable when $\\frac{\\log K}{\\log T} \\rightarrow 0$, and the number\nof near-optimal arms are large.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ru6AwZrNrLs4DFKfupxldiQ-5T_5lECO7KLYGfC_38Y","pdfSize":"442208"}
