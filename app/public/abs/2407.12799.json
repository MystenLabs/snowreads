The paper presents a\ncomprehensive overview of protocols from all layers of the Open System\nInterconnection (OSI) model. The protocols encompass a range of communication\ntechnologies, including ad-hoc, mobile broadband, and fiber-optic cable. All of\nthese protocols are utilized in the field of intelligent transportation systems\n(ITS) and must exchange information at some point. The current development\nleads to a much tighter connection between ecosystems that were previously\nisolated or not connected. This situation necessitates a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the protocols at all layers to ensure the establishment of\nsafe and secure applications within the field of intelligent transportation\nsystems (ITS).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
