The specific calculations for 6,7Li and 7Be nuclei indicate\nthat the conventional impulse approximation can be applied to the\nelectron-nucleus scattering only when the incident electron energy does not\nexceed twice the nucleon mass. In addition, the quasi-elastic scattering cross\nsection of 7Li in the excitation from its ground state to the nearest excited\nstate and that of elastic scattering in the ground state are independently\ntreated, whereas they have not been separately measured in experiments. The\nobtained scattering cross sections corresponding to an appropriate adjustment\nof the harmonic oscillator parameter along with the V-A structure interpret\nreasonably well the available experimental data at MeV energies and provide\npredictive information at GeV energies. This gives new perspectives in studying\nthe structure of nuclei and the weak interactions via electron or lepton\nscattering at high (GeV) energies, considering nuclei rather than quarks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
