The coupling between phonons and spins usually\ndepends on spin-orbit interaction and is relatively weak. Here, we propose a\nnew mechanism for this coupling and the associated THE: the skew scattering of\nphonons via spin fluctuations by the scalar spin chirality. This coupling does\nnot require spin-orbit interaction and is ubiquitous in Mott insulators,\nleading to a thermal Hall angle on the order of $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-2}$. Based\non this mechanism, we investigate the THE in YMnO$_3$ with a trimerized\ntriangular lattice where the THE beyond spins was recognized, and predict the\nTHE in the Kagome and square lattices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e70bKg10sFgTjF2EMPq8JB6RszZxe4Q4a08cCpc_32g","pdfSize":"3141479","txDigest":"E8ucdcBKj9sEYmN8ubNUGtf8ceS2vz9rWSbFZpmv4pQE","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
