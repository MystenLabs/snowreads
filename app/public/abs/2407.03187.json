Yet, accidents still\nfrequently occur, especially in merging areas; meanwhile, it is difficult to\ncomprehensively obtain the conditions of road infrastructure. These limitations\nnot only restrict the further improvement of road capacity but also result in\nirreparable losses of life and property. To overcome this bottleneck, this\npaper constructs a space-time global view of the road traffic system based on a\nreal-time sharing mechanism, enabling both road users and managers to timely\naccess the driving intentions of nearby vehicles and the real-time status of\nroad infrastructure.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
