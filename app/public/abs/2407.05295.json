However, unexpected noise limits this precision\nand prevents the implementation of error correction codes. Specifically,\nfrequency shifts have been found to suppress one-qubit gate fidelity. Although\nthe exact source of the frequency shifts remains unclear, several experiments\nhave indicated a relationship between the frequency shift and heating from the\ncontrol signal. Based on these results, we modeled the heating effect using the\nlow-temperature dependence of specific heat from the Debye model to simulate\nqubit control with frequency shifts. This model quantitatively reproduces some\nof the experimental results and makes it possible to simulate qubit gates with\ntemperature-dependent frequency shifts. The simulated control fidelity of the\nproposed model was consistent with the experimental results, demonstrating that\na gate fidelity above $99.9$% can be achieved in a hot environment.\nAdditionally, our comparison of the two temperature-dependent frequency shift\nmodels reveals the condition for a microscopic frequency shift model in which\nthe variance of the frequency shift is limited to a specific range.\nFurthermore, we investigated gate fidelity using the DRAG method and\ndemonstrated the utility of temperature-dependent simulations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
