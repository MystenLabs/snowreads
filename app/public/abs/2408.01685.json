Employing angle-resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy, we reveal the spectroscopic fingerprint of short-range\nantiferromagnetic order in conjunction with enhanced electron-phonon\ninteraction in the electron-doped cuprate superconductor\n$\\mathrm{Nd_{1.85}Ce_{0.15}CuO_4}$. The observed mode coupling exhibits a\nstrong momentum dependence that is in striking contrast to the node-antinode\ndichotomy previously observed in the hole-doped cuprates. Our results reveal an\nintimate relationship between electron-phonon coupling and antiferromagnetic\nfluctuations, which collectively sets the stage for unconventional\nsuperconductivity in the electron-doped cuprates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JmXSKPo1Odex8KtkOzd-Lm9OJvPflfuo8plFP7-hXUQ","pdfSize":"4996646","txDigest":"4dLNJUfgp8bcwroHNYmLxWwmNhAcqL8ajPZeLAxQY175","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
