Both require spatial models for effective route planning\nand localization. This paper addresses the challenge of road graph construction\nfor autonomous vehicles. Despite recent advances, creating a road graph remains\nlabor-intensive and has yet to achieve full automation. The goal of this paper\nis to generate such graphs automatically and accurately. Modern cars are\nequipped with onboard sensors used for today's advanced driver assistance\nsystems like lane keeping. We propose using global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) traces and basic image data acquired from these standard sensors in\nconsumer vehicles to estimate road-level maps with minimal effort. We exploit\nthe spatial information in the data by framing the problem as a road centerline\nsemantic segmentation task using a convolutional neural network. We also\nutilize the data's time series nature to refine the neural network's output by\nusing map matching. We implemented and evaluated our method using a fleet of\nreal consumer vehicles, only using the deployed onboard sensors. Our evaluation\ndemonstrates that our approach not only matches existing methods on simpler\nroad configurations but also significantly outperforms them on more complex\nroad geometries and topologies.
