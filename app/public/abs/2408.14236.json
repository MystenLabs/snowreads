Our experiments show a trade-off between performance and semantic\ngrounding for extrinsic knowledge compared to a fine-tuned model intrinsic\nknowledge. We report our findings on the Large Language Models for Ontology\nLearning (LLMs4OL) 2024 challenge.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
