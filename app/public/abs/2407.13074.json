For both\n$k=1$ and $k=2$ we prove that there exists $T_0>0$ such that the radius of\nspatial analyticity of the solution remains the same in the time interval\n$[-T_0, T_0]$. We also consider the evolution of the radius of spatial\nanalyticity when the local solution extends globally in time. For the\nZakharov-Kuznetsov equation ($k=1$), we prove that, in both focusing ($\\mu=1$)\nand defocusing ($\\mu=-1$) cases, and for any $T> T_0$, the radius of\nanalyticity cannot decay faster than $cT^{-4+\\epsilon}$, $\\epsilon>0$, $c>0$.\nFor the modified Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation ($k=2)$ in the defocusing case\n($\\mu=-1$), we prove that the radius of spatial analyticity cannot decay faster\nthan $cT^{-\\frac{4}{3}}$, $c>0$, for any $T>T_0$. These results on the\nalgebraic lower bounds for the evolution of the radius of analyticity improve\nthe ones obtained by Shan and Zhang in [J. Math. Anal.
