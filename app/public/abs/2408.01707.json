ML methods have notably\nbeen devoted to analyze the importance of each parameter in the model, thereby\nimproving the comprehension of the system's behavior and facilitating design\noptimization. Following this investigation, it has been found that Ge emerged\nas the most effective emitter layer when paired with the optimal base layer,\nInGaAsSb compound that possesses a direct bandgap of 0.53 eV. Subsequently, a\np-Ge/n-InGaAsSb single-heterojunction TPV cell is introduced executing a device\ntransport model featuring a p-n structure. This cell operated at black body\n(TBB) and cell temperatures of 1578 K and 300 K, respectively. Through\nmeticulous optimization efforts, the performance of the TPV cell is\nsignificantly enhanced resulting in an impressive efficiency of 16.50%. This\nefficiency is accompanied by a short circuit current, JSC=15.53 A/cm2, an\nopen-circuit voltage, VOC=0.47 V, and a fill factor FF=79.5%. These findings\nsuggest that this structural configuration holds considerable promise for the\ndevelopment of high-performance TPV cells.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
