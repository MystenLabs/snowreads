We studied its\npressure-dependent crystal structure by using synchrotron powder x-ray\ndiffraction at room temperature. Our results show a smooth contraction of the\nunit cell volume by applying pressure while preserving I4mm symmetry. No\nstructural transition was observed up to 35 GPa. By the equation of state\nfitting analysis, the bulk modulus and its pressure derivative were determined\nto be 73 (1) GPa and 5.5 (2), respectively. Furthermore, similar to the\nisostructural EuCoGe3, an anisotropic compression of a and c lattice parameters\nwas observed. Our experimental results show a good agreement with the\npressure-dependent structural evolution expected from theoretical calculations\nbelow 13 GPa. Reflecting a strong deviation from integer Eu valence, the\nexperimental volume data appear to be smaller than those of DFT calculated\nvalues at higher pressures.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
