However these cross-discpline connections -- and\ntheir importance to growing scientific discplines such as biophysics -- are\nrarely tought in introductory physics courses. Here we examine how the laws of\nphysics shape Darwinism evolution through the surface area to volume ratio, an\nimportant geometric measure of a structure. We develop conceptual cartoon\nclicker questions to enhance students' understanding of these interdisciplinary\nconcepts. By connecting abstract physical laws with biological (and\ntechnological) applications, our approach aims to help students appreciate the\ndeep connections between physical and biological sciences, thereby enriching\nthe learning experience in introductory physics courses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Biological Physics","Physics/Popular Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
