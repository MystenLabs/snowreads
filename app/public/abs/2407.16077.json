Recent studies have found two-dimensional\nhyperbolic embeddings superior to Euclidean embeddings in modeling connectomes\nacross species, especially human connectomes. However, those studies had\nlimitations: geometries other than Euclidean, hyperbolic, or spherical were not\nconsidered. Following William Thurston's suggestion that the networks of\nneurons in the brain could be successfully represented in Solv geometry, we\nstudy the goodness-of-fit of the embeddings for 21 connectome networks (8\nspecies). To this end, we suggest an embedding algorithm based on Simulating\nAnnealing that allows us to embed connectomes to Euclidean, Spherical,\nHyperbolic, Solv, Nil, and product geometries. Our algorithm tends to find\nbetter embeddings than the state-of-the-art, even in the hyperbolic case. Our\nfindings suggest that while three-dimensional hyperbolic embeddings yield the\nbest results in many cases, Solv embeddings perform reasonably well.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
