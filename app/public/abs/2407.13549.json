Our results\nshow that most viral events do not significantly increase engagement and rarely\nlead to sustained growth. The virality effect usually depends on the engagement\ntrend preceding the viral post, typically reversing it. When news emerges\nunexpectedly, viral events enhances users' engagement, reactivating the\ncollective response process. In contrast, when virality manifests after a\nsustained growth phase, it represents the final burst of that growth process,\nfollowed by a decline in attention. Moreover, quick viral effects fade faster,\nwhile slower processes lead to more persistent growth. These findings highlight\nthe transient effect of viral events and underscore the importance of\nconsistent, steady attention-building strategies to establish a solid\nconnection with the user base rather than relying on sudden visibility spikes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"S0svu0qaCWO4aZF6_pkNXR1uS4cTlb-ftlPzBfA8Krk","pdfSize":"1822030"}
