To improve the finite sample properties of\nstatistical inference procedures that are based on the limit results,\nresampling procedures such as random permutation and bootstrap methods are a\npopular solution. In order to analyze the behaviour of the functionals of the\nresampling empirical processes, corresponding conditional functional\ndelta-methods are desirable. While conditional functional delta-methods for\nsome special cases already exist, there is a lack of more general conditional\nfunctional delta-methods for resampling procedures for empirical processes,\nsuch as the permutation and pooled bootstrap method. This gap is addressed in\nthe present paper. Thereby, a general multiple sample problem is considered.\nThe flexible application of the developed conditional delta-method is shown in\nvarious relevant examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"46CJBIR9pe0T7iViX9rV3FSV0q7rF51Yv6JT8Cl6T7g","pdfSize":"522548"}
