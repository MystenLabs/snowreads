They imply the\nconstancy of the ratio of speed of gravity to light throughout cosmic\nevolution. This holds without fine tuning, even if one includes the general\n$G_4 (\\pi,X)$ and $G_5 (\\pi)$ scalar potentials. In this paper we go into the\ndetails of this 4D Luminal extension of Horndeski theory including its scalar\nsector. We also present the complete action including the general\n$G_5(\\pi,X),\\, G_6(\\pi,X)$ scalar potentials. Thus we show all the $U(1)$ gauge\ninvariant vector Galileons in 4D that result from a Kaluza-Klein dimensional\nreduction from 5D Horndeski. They provide a consistent coupling of a higher\nderivative vector to scalar modifications of gravity -- namely, without\ninducing Ostrogradsky ghosts and keeping gauge invariance -- in the aim to\nexplore more universal couplings of dark energy to other matter, such as\nvectors and in particular the Photon.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
