For\narbitrary shapes of $D(x)$ and prescriptions of the associated multiplicative\nstochastic process, we obtain analytical expressions for the average time $T$\nfor reaching the target (mean first-passage time), given the initial and reset\npositions, in good agreement with stochastic simulations. For arbitrary $D(x)$,\nwe obtain an exact closed-form expression for $T$, within Stratonovich\nscenario, while for other prescriptions, like It\\^o and anti-It\\^o, we derive\nasymptotic approximations for small and large rates $r$. Exact results are also\nobtained for particular forms of $D(x)$, such as the linear one, with arbitrary\nprescriptions, allowing to outline and discuss the main effects introduced by\ndiffusive heterogeneity on a random search with resetting. We explore how the\neffectiveness of resetting varies with different types of heterogeneity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
