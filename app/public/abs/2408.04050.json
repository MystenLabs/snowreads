They are popular in\ndomains such as manufacturing and computing for their intuitive layout of such\ndata. However, these domains frequently generate data at scales which tax both\nthe visual representation and the ability to render it at interactive speeds.\nTo aid visualization developers who use Gantt charts in these situations, we\ndevelop a task taxonomy of low level visualization tasks supported by Gantt\ncharts and connect them to the data queries needed to support them. Our\ntaxonomy is derived through a literature survey of visualizations using Gantt\ncharts over the past 30 years.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"XSju4RXVYTTcYCP140FuATBRn0n5kG_-Ic68ndgXoDA","pdfSize":"238809"}
