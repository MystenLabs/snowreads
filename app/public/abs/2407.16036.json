The optimal operation\nand safety of these batteries require proper and reliable estimation of battery\ncapacities to monitor the state of health. Current methods for estimating the\ncapacities fail to adequately account for long-term temporal dependencies of\nkey variables (e.g., voltage, current, and temperature) associated with battery\naging and degradation. In this study, we explore the usage of transformer\nnetworks to enhance the estimation of battery capacity. We develop a\ntransformer-based battery capacity prediction model that accounts for both\nlong-term and short-term patterns in battery data. Further, to tackle the data\nscarcity issue, data augmentation is used to increase the data size, which\nhelps to improve the performance of the model. Our proposed method is validated\nwith benchmark datasets. Simulation results show the effectiveness of data\naugmentation and the transformer network in improving the accuracy and\nrobustness of battery capacity prediction.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
