Users often evaluate the Quality of Service (QoS) to choose the\nbest option among them. Predicting the QoS values of these web services is a\nsignificant challenge in the field of web services. A Canonical Polyadic\n(CP)-based tensor network model has proven to be efficient for predicting\ndynamic QoS data. However, current CP-based tensor network models do not\nconsider the correlation of users and services in the low-dimensional latent\nfeature space, thereby limiting model's prediction capability. To tackle this\nissue, this paper proposes an Extended Canonical polyadic-based Tensor Network\n(ECTN) model. It models the correlation of users and services via building a\nrelation dimension between user feature and service feature in low-dimensional\nspace, and then designs an extended CP decomposition structure to improve\nprediction accuracy. Experiments are conducted on two public dynamic QoS data,\nand the results show that compared with state-of-the-art QoS prediction models,\nthe ECTN obtains higher prediction accuracy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
