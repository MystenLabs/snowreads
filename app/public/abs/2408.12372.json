The set ${\\mathcal AP}(f)=\\{ n\\in \\mathbb N\\ \\colon\\\na_n(f)\\neq 0\\}$ is called the set of algebraic periods.\n  We solve an open problem existing in literature by showing that for every\nfinite subset ${\\mathcal A}$ of natural numbers there exist an orientable\nsurface $S_{\\rm g}$, as well as a non-orientable surface $N_{\\rm g}$, of genus\n${\\rm g}$, and a Morse$\\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphism $f$ of this surface\nsuch that $\\mathcal{AP}(f)=\\mathcal{A}$. For such a map it implies the\nexistence of points of a minimal period $n$ for each odd $n \\in \\mathcal{A}$.\nFor the orientation-reversing Morse$\\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphisms of\n$S_{\\rm g}$ we identify strong restrictions on ${\\mathcal AP}(f)$. Our method\nalso provides an estimate of the number of homotopy classes of\nMorse$\\unicode{x2013}$Smale diffeomorphisms, which is exponential in ${\\rm g}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
