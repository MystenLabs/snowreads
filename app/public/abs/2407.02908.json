However, the immense computational requirements surrounding EMRI data\nprocessing and analysis makes their detection and analysis challenging. We\nfurther develop and explore a sparse dictionary learning (SDL) algorithm to\nexpeditiously reconstruct EMRI gravitational waveforms lasting as long as 1\nyear. A suite of year-long EMRI systems are studied to understand the detection\nand accurate waveform retrieval prospects of the method. We show that full-year\nEMRIs can be reconstructed within 2 minutes, some with a false alarm rate less\nthan 0.001/yr and with 1.16 day time windows with mismatch as low as 0.06. This\nprovides an encouraging prospect to use the SDL method for long-duration GW\nsearches like that for EMRIs in this study.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0MCcQA--SH-EfpsInXJe5rVm6Ol75Y_qH1e_WfTPPG8","pdfSize":"1657753"}
