However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle\nnoise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. Research on translating\nSAR images into optical-like representations has been conducted to aid the\ninterpretation of SAR data. Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly\nutilized low-resolution satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based\non Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training\ninstability and low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution\ndata usage and GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional\nimage-to-image translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model\n(BBDM). We conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired\nSAR and optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR). The\nexperimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional\nDiffusion Models (CDMs) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality\nmetrics.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
