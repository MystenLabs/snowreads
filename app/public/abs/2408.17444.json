We show that every countably $m$-rectifiable subset of\n$\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ can be displaced from every $(2n-m)$-negligible subset by a\nHamiltonian diffeomorphism that is arbitrarily $C^\\infty$-close to the\nidentity. As a consequence, every countably $n$-rectifiable and $n$-negligible\nsubset of $\\mathbb{R}^{2n}$ is arbitrarily symplectically squeezable. Both\nresults are sharp w.r.t. the parameter $s$ in the $s$-negligibility assumption.\n  The proof of our squeezing result uses folding. Potentially, our folding\nmethod can be modified to show that the Gromov width of $B^{2n}_1\\setminus A$\nequals $\\pi$ for every countably $(n-1)$-rectifiable closed subset $A$ of the\nopen unit ball $B^{2n}_1$. This means that $A$ is not a barrier.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
