Over the course of the disease,\nangiogenic factors released by leukaemic cells drastically alter the bone\nmarrow vascular niches resulting in observable structural abnormalities. We use\na technique from topological data analysis - persistent homology - to quantify\nthe images and infer on the disease through the imaged morphological features.\nWe find that persistent homology uncovers succinct dissimilarities between the\ncontrol, early, and late stages of AML development. We then integrate\npersistent homology into stage-dependent Gaussian mixture models for the first\ntime, proposing a new class of models which are applicable to persistent\nhomology summaries and able to both infer patterns in morphological changes\nbetween different stages of progression as well as provide a basis for\nprediction.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
