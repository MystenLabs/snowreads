This is a higher analogue\nof Solovay's result for $L(\\mathbb{R})$. We obtain this configuration starting\nwith large-cardinal assumptions in the realm of supercompactness, thus\nimproving former theorems by Cramer, Shi and Woodin.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
