Such a boundary condition can be reformulated as one\nof dynamic type. First, we formulate the boundary controllability problem of\nthe system within the framework of boundary control systems, proving its\nwell-posedness. Then we reduce the question to a moment problem. Using the\nspectral analysis of the associated Sturm-Liouville problem and the moment\nmethod, we establish the null controllability of the system at any positive\ntime $T$. Finally, we approximate minimum energy controls by a penalized HUM\napproach. This allows us to validate the theoretical controllability results\nobtained by the moment method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KMXcMX7qdJvXgwvx09lzXnxkS8GmWoST7CZjIyHnumM","pdfSize":"2063834"}
