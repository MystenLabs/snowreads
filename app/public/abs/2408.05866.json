Several modifications to the structure functions\nare applied to improve the modeling of the cross sections at low energies where\nperturbative QCD is less accurate and at high energies where there is\nnon-negligible top quark production, and small-$x$ logarithms need to be\nresumed. Using the FONLL general-mass variable-flavor number scheme, we account\nfor heavy quark mass effects and separate the heavy flavor components of the\nstructure functions, obtaining predictions of their relative contributions to\nthe cross sections and the uncertainties arising from the parton distribution\nfunctions. Additionally, the effects of final state radiation are implemented\nin the calculation of the double-differential cross section and discussed in\nterms of their impact on measurements at neutrino telescopes.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"or6P9-u_fnUfwNSHfiVwaYAQuRYJqkKw8sksfZgrYMM","pdfSize":"1088034"}
