Based on their\npioneering results, we continue to study Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and\ntheir generalizations in the present paper. Inspired by the corresponding\nresults in Rota--Baxter groups, we firstly obtain some properties and\nconstruction methods for Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups, and then study the\nsubstructures and quotient structures of these semigroups. On the other hand,\nwe introduce the notion of relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and\nexplore the relationship between these semigroups and dual weak left braces,\nwhich are known to give set-theoretical solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation.\nMore specifically, we show that every relative Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroup\ngives rise to a dual weak left brace, and conversely, every dual weak left\nbrace can be obtained from a bijective strong relative Rota--Baxter Clifford\nsemigroup. Furthermore, it turns out that there is an equivalence between the\ntwo categories of bijective strong Rota--Baxter Clifford semigroups and dual\nweak left braces. The substructures and quotient structures of Rota--Baxter\nClifford semigroups are also considered.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
