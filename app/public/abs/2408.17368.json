In this paper,\nwe introduce configuration monitoring to determine an unknown configuration of\na running system based on observations of its behavior. We develop a modular\nand generic pipeline to synthesize automata-theoretic configuration monitors\nfrom a featured transition system model of the configurable system to be\nmonitored. The pipeline further allows synthesis under partial observability\nand network-induced losses as well as predictive configuration monitors taking\nthe potential future behavior of a system into account. Beyond the novel\napplication of configuration monitoring, we show that our approach also\ngeneralizes and unifies existing work on runtime monitoring and fault\ndiagnosis, which aim at detecting the satisfaction or violation of properties\nand the occurrence of faults, respectively. We empirically demonstrate the\nefficacy of our approach with a case study on configuration monitors\nsynthesized from configurable systems community benchmarks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fmnHJMYpA4lfhf2vdE6khSXHuYsjNQklm4jxr744Yc0","pdfSize":"421960"}
