The NERC event diagnosis report has\nhighlighted several issues, emphasizing the need for continuous performance\nmonitoring of these IBRs by system operators. Key areas of concern include the\nmismatch of control and protection performance of IBRs between the original\nequipment manufacturer (OEM)-provided models and field measurements. The\ninability to replicate the realistic response can result in incorrect\nreliability and resilience studies. In this paper, we developed an approach on\nhow to emulate the behavior of an IBR using measurement data obtained for\nsystem operators to utilize in real-time and long-term planning. Two\nexperiments are conducted in the phasor domain and electromagnetic transients\n(EMT) domain to emulate the behavior for grid forming and grid following\ninverters under various operating conditions and the effectiveness of the\nproposed model is demonstrated in terms of accuracy and ease of utilizing\nuser-defined models (UDMs).\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
