For each frame $\\phi$ in $\\mathbb{R}^n$, we\nassociate a simple undirected graph $G(\\phi)$ and use it to verify the\nscalability of $\\phi$. We provide some necessary conditions to test the\nscalability of a given frame. Finally, we study the scalability of some special\nclasses of frames by using graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
