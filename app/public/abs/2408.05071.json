In this paper we use the functional autoregressive sieve bootstrap\nto imitate the behavior of the partial sum process and we show that this\nprocedure asymptotically correct estimates critical values under the null\nhypothesis. We also establish the consistency of the corresponding bootstrap\nbased test under local alternatives. The finite sample performance of the\nprocedure is studied via simulations under the null -hypothesis and under the\nalternative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
