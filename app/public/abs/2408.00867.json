We\nconsider the maximum queue lengths of a signalized corridor consisting of nine\nintersections every two minutes, roughly equivalent to the cycle length. Our\nresearch shows that maximum queue lengths at all the intersections follow the\nextreme value distributions. To the best knowledge of the authors, this is the\nfirst attempt to characterize queue length time series using extreme value\nanalysis. These findings are significant as they offer a mechanism to assess\nthe extremity of queue lengths, thereby aiding in evaluating the effectiveness\nof the adaptive signal controllers and corridor management. Given that extreme\nqueue lengths often precipitate spillover effects, this insight can be\ninstrumental in preempting such scenarios.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"NzOw4FacrY2JbVJhMhU5nZ5nVgBwYEBkf19p7MoDdRo","pdfSize":"2370191"}
