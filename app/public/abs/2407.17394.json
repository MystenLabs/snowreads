This is relevant in Task and Motion Planning\n(TAMP), where many motion planning problems must be solved in sequence. We\nattempt to solve this problem by proving an upper bound on the number of\nsamples that are sufficient, with high probability, to find a solution by\ndrawing on prior work in deterministic sampling and sample complexity theory.\nWe also introduce a numerical algorithm to compute a tighter number of samples\nbased on the proof of the sample complexity theorem we apply to derive our\nbound. Our experiments show that our numerical bounding algorithm is tight\nwithin two orders of magnitude on planar planning problems and becomes looser\nas the problem's dimensionality increases. When deployed as a heuristic to\nschedule samples in a TAMP planner, we also observe planning time improvements\nin planar problems. While our experiments show much work remains to tighten our\nbounds, the ideas presented in this paper are a step towards a practical sample\nbound.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
