Let $\\alpha $ be a generator\nof $\\mathbb{F}_{3^m}^*$, where $m$ is a positive integer. Denote by\n$\\mathcal{C}_{(i_1,i_2,\\cdots, i_t)}$ the cyclic code with generator polynomial\n$m_{\\alpha^{i_1}}(x)m_{\\alpha^{i_2}}(x)\\cdots m_{\\alpha^{i_t}}(x)$, where\n${{m}_{\\alpha^{i}}}(x)$ is the minimal polynomial of ${{\\alpha }^{i}}$ over\n${{\\mathbb{F}}_{3}}$. In this paper, by analyzing the solutions of certain\nequations over finite fields, we present four classes of optimal ternary cyclic\ncodes $\\mathcal{C}_{(0,1,e)}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{(1,e,s)}$ with parameters\n$[3^m-1,3^m-\\frac{3m}{2}-2,4]$, where $s=\\frac{3^m-1}{2}$. In addition, by\ndetermining the solutions of certain equations and analyzing the irreducible\nfactors of certain polynomials over $\\mathbb{F}_{3^m}$, we present four classes\nof optimal ternary cyclic codes $\\mathcal{C}_{(2,e)}$ and $\\mathcal{C}_{(1,e)}$\nwith parameters $[3^m-1,3^m-2m-1,4]$. We show that our new optimal cyclic codes\nare inequivalent to the known ones.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
