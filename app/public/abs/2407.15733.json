In this paper, we\nconsider such an online multiple testing problem with the goal of providing\nsimultaneous lower bounds for the number of true discoveries in data-adaptively\nchosen rejection sets. Using the (online) closure principle, we show that for\nthis task it is necessary to use an anytime-valid test for each intersection\nhypothesis. Motivated by this result, we construct a new online closed testing\nprocedure and a corresponding short-cut with a true discovery guarantee based\non multiplying sequential e-values. This general but simple procedure gives\nuniform improvements over existing methods but also allows to construct\nentirely new and powerful procedures. In addition, we introduce new ideas for\nhedging and boosting of sequential e-values that provably increase power.\nFinally, we also propose the first online true discovery procedure for\narbitrarily dependent e-values.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
