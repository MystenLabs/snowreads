For example, in\nHIV studies, the longitudinal bio-marker such as CD4 cell count in a patient's\nblood over follow up months is jointly modelled with the time to disease\nprogression, death or dropout via a random intercept term mostly assumed to be\nGaussian. However, longitudinal observations in these kinds of studies often\nexhibit non-Gaussian behavior (due to high degree of skewness), and parameter\nestimation is often compromised under violations of the Gaussian assumptions.\nIn linear mixed-effects model assumptions, the distributional assumption for\nthe subject-specific random-effects is taken as Gaussian which may not be true\nin many situations. Further, this assumption makes the model extremely\nsensitive to outlying observations. We address these issues in this work by\ndevising a joint model which uses a robust distribution in a parametric setup\nalong with a conditional distributional assumption that ensures dependency of\ntwo processes in case the subject-specific random effects is given.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
