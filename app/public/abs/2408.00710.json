We apply\nthis framework in 2D to the canonical scenario of cloaking a circular object.\nWe find that perfect cloaking using a finite-sized isotropic cloak is\nimpossible over any bandwidth, with the bounds scaling linearly with the\nbandwidth before saturating due to the finite size of the cloak and the\npresence of material loss. The bounds also exhibit linear scaling with material\nloss in the cloak and linear scaling with the inverse of the radial thickness\nof the design region before saturation due to finite-size effects or the\npresence of material loss. The formulation could readily find applications in\nthe development of cloaking devices, setting expectations and benchmarks for\noptimal performance.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
