For a generic set of smooth initial data (density and\nvelocity), it is known that the solution loses regularity at a finite time\n$t_0$, where both the the density and the velocity gradient become unbounded.\nAim of this paper is to provide an asymptotic description of the solution\nbeyond the time of singularity formation. For $t>t_0$ we show that a singular\ncurve is formed, where the mass has positive density w.r.t.1-dimensional\nHausdorff measure. The system of equations describing the behavior of the\nsingular curve is not hyperbolic. Working within a class of analytic data,\nlocal solutions can be constructed using a version of the Cauchy-Kovalevskaya\ntheorem. For this purpose, by a suitable change of variables we rewrite the\nevolution equations as a first order system of Briot-Bouquet type, to which a\ngeneral existence-uniqueness theorem can then be applied.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
