A\nline determined by $i$ green and $j$ red points such that $i + j \\ge 2$ and $|i\n- j| \\le r$ is called \\emph{r-equichromatic}. We establish lower bounds for\n$1$-equichromatic and $2$-equichromatic lines. In particular, we show that if\nat most $2n-k-2$ points of $P$ are collinear, then the number of\n$1$-equichromatic lines passing through at most six points is at least\n$\\frac{1}{4}(6n-k(k+3))$, and if at most $\\frac{2}{3}(2n - k)$ points of $P$\nare collinear, then the number of $2$-equichromatic lines passing through at\nmost four points is at least $\\frac{1}{6}(10n - k(k + 5))$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
