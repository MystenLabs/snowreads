The billiards we\nstudy are classified as integrable, pseudointegrable or non-integrable,\ndepending on their internal angles which determine properties of classical\ntrajectories and associated quantum spectral statistics. A consistent picture\nemerges when transitioning from integrable to non-integrable triangles: (1)\nLSRs increase; (2) spectral complexity growth slows down; (3) Lanczos\ncoefficient variances decrease; (4) energy eigenstates delocalize in the Krylov\nbasis; and (5) spread complexity increases, displaying a peak prior to a\nplateau instead of recurrences. Pseudo-integrable triangles deviate by a small\namount in these charactertistics from non-integrable ones, which in turn\napproximate models from the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE). Isosceles\npseudointegrable and non-integrable triangles have independent sectors that are\nsymmetric and antisymmetric under a reflection symmetry. These sectors\nseparately reproduce characteristics of the GOE, even though the combined\nsystem approximates characteristics expected from integrable theories with\nPoisson distributed spectra.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Atw0DcS2eStVD49GaLIqM2cCvLdXl_9P0hdoIP33Vgk","pdfSize":"3092746"}
