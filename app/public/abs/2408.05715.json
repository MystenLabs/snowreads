Nevertheless, such LLM-based code\ngeneration approaches still struggle to generate error-free code in a few tries\nwhen faced with complex problems. To address this, the prevailing strategy is\nto sample a huge number of candidate programs, with the hope of any one in them\ncould work. However, users of code generation systems usually expect to find a\ncorrect program by reviewing or testing only a small number of code candidates.\nOtherwise, the system would be unhelpful. In this paper, we propose Top Pass, a\ncode ranking approach that identifies potential correct solutions from a large\nnumber of candidates. Top Pass directly optimizes the pass@k loss function,\nenhancing the quality at the top of the candidate list. This enables the user\nto find the correct solution within as few tries as possible. Experimental\nresults on four benchmarks indicate that our Top Pass method enhances the\nusability of code generation models by producing better ranking results,\nparticularly achieving a 32.9\\% relative improvement in pass@1 on CodeContests\nwhen compared to the state-of-the-art ranking method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Key5X7yboVElF6YglWaBg9l11-SmKiMFJ_5eXLwht-8","pdfSize":"4377655"}
