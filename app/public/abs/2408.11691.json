Current data-driven approaches often assume prior knowledge of the\nrelevant state variables or result in overparameterized state spaces. Boyuan\nChen and his co-authors proposed a neural network model that estimates the\ndegrees of freedom and attempts to discover the state variables of a dynamical\nsystem. Despite its innovative approach, this baseline model lacks a connection\nto the physical principles governing the systems it analyzes, leading to\nunreliable state variables.\n  This research proposes a method that leverages the physical characteristics\nof second-order Hamiltonian systems to constrain the baseline model. The\nproposed model outperforms the baseline model in identifying a minimal set of\nnon-redundant and interpretable state variables.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SnggIRf8mH-0FLLXpUDJ_7M0IFhya6yXOKM15i720BY","pdfSize":"2684066"}
