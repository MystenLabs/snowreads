Over the last decades, satellite images have been largely employed to\ndetect barchans on Earth and on the surface of Mars, with AI (Artificial\nIntelligence) becoming an important tool for monitoring those bedforms.\nHowever, automatic detection reported in previous works is limited to isolated\ndunes and does not identify successfully groups of interacting barchans. In\nthis paper, we inquire into the automatic detection and tracking of barchans by\ncarrying out experiments and exploring the acquired images using AI. After\ntraining a neural network with images from controlled experiments where complex\ninteractions took place between dunes, we did the same for satellite images\nfrom Earth and Mars. We show, for the first time, that a neural network trained\nproperly can identify and track barchans interacting with each other in\ndifferent environments, using different image types (contrasts, colors, points\nof view, resolutions, etc.), with confidence scores (accuracy) above 70%. Our\nresults represent a step further for automatically monitoring barchans, with\nimportant applications for human activities on Earth, Mars and other celestial\nbodies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9CY8_LAcMEpt-8H14Fgv--7jtje4Qha0pOHXOGQnrr0","pdfSize":"7540904"}
