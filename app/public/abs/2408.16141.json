Such a variational\nformula induces the Riesz $\\alpha$-energy measure of log-concave function $f$,\nwhich will be denoted by $\\mathfrak{R}_{\\alpha}(f, \\cdot)$. We pose the related\nRiesz $\\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem aiming to find necessary and/or\nsufficient conditions on a pregiven Borel measure $\\mu$ defined on $\\Rn$ so\nthat $\\mu=\\mathfrak{R}_{\\alpha}(f,\\cdot)$ for some log-concave function $f$.\nAssuming enough smoothness, the Riesz $\\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem reduces\nto a new Monge-Amp\\`{e}re type equation involving the Riesz $\\alpha$-potential.\nMoreover, this new Minkowski problem can be viewed as a functional counterpart\nof the recent Minkowski problem for the chord measures in integral geometry\nposed by Lutwak, Xi, Yang and Zhang (Comm.\\ Pure\\ Appl.\\ Math.,\\ 2024). The\nRiesz $\\alpha$-energy Minkowski problem will be solved under certain mild\nconditions on $\\mu$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
