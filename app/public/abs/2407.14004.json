In this paper, we employed the determinant\nquantum Monte Carlo method to investigate the symmetry-allowed superconducting\norders on the two-dimensional honeycomb lattice within the Hubbard model, using\ndoped graphene as the carrier, focusing their response to bond disorder.\nSpecifically, we calculated the pairing susceptibility and effective pairing\ninteractions for the $d+id$ wave and extended $s$-wave pairings for different\nelectron densities and disorder strengths. Our calculations show that at high\nelectron densities, increased disorder strength may lead to a transform from\n$d+id$ wave dominance to extended $s$ wave dominance. However, at lower\nelectron densities, neither of the two superconducting pairings appears under\nlarger disorder strength. Our calculations may contribute to a further\nunderstanding of the superconducting behavior in doped materials affected by\ndisorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
