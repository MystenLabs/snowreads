We consider the\n$S$-packing coloring problem on subclasses of subcubic graphs: For $0\\le i\\le\n3$, a subcubic graph $G$ is said to be $i$-saturated if every vertex of degree\n3 is adjacent to at most $i$ vertices of degree 3. Furthermore, a vertex of\ndegree 3 in a subcubic graph is called heavy if all its three neighbors are of\ndegree 3, and $G$ is said to be $(3,i)$-saturated if every heavy vertex is\nadjacent to at most $i$ heavy vertices. We prove that every 1-saturated\nsubcubic graph is $(1,1,3,3)$-packing colorable and $(1,2,2,2,2)$-packing\ncolorable. We also prove that every $(3,0)$-saturated subcubic graph is\n$(1,2,2,2,2,2)$-packing colorable.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CbHmfUFQWEKteQsivHt8VvwaXbvpGJu-W5srFrttlGw","pdfSize":"188339","objectId":"0x1bb2b9d256a85646f4b13fb277afb7d6bf946b3a1211b92ec264fd16f522f566","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
