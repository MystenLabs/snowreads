Using X-ray photoelectron and\nnear-edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy at the Cu L2,3\nand Cr L2,3 absorption edges we determine the charge states of ions in the\nstudied compound. Analyzing the systematic NEXAFS and resonant photoelectron\nspectroscopy data at the Cu/Cr L2,3 absorption edges allowed us to assign the\nCuCrP$_2$S6 material to a Mott-Hubbard type insulator and identify different\nAuger-decay channels (participator vs. spectator) during absorption and\nautoionization processes. Spectroscopic and theoretical data obtained for\nCuCrP$_2$S6 are very important for the detailed understanding of the electronic\nstructure and electron-correlations phenomena in different layered materials,\nthat will drive their further applications in different areas, like\nelectronics, spintronics, sensing, and catalysis.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
