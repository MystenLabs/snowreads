This problem is relevant in population/policy\ncomparison, discrete maximum likelihood, and model selection. We develop a test\nstatistic that is asymptotically normal, even in high-dimensional settings and\nwith potentially many ties in the population mean vector, by integrating\nconcepts and tools from cross-validation and differential privacy. The key\ntechnical ingredient is a central limit theorem for globally dependent data. We\nalso propose practical ways to select the tuning parameter that adapts to the\nsignal landscape.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"5rLWTk7k2UWRDlYAvIi92klaRTBXUKohTbMQyBA822k","pdfSize":"1045799","txDigest":"4z6HrFUdRJTKZRfBYgehd5uYKqpvi7YfDu87iQP4r6nY","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
