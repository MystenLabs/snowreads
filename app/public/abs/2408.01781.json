The key idea of our approach\nis to study the hitting time distribution for shrinking Poincar\\'e sections\nthat have a particularly simple scaling property under the action of the\ngeodesic flow. This extends the extreme value law of Kirsebom and Mallahi-Karai\n[arXiv:2209.07283] for cusp excursions for the modular surface. Here we show\nthat the limit law can be expressed in terms of Hall's formula for the gap\ndistribution of the Farey sequence.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
