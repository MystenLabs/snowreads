While significant progress has been\nmade in tracking general objects, research on more challenging scenarios, such\nas tracking camouflaged objects, remains limited. Camouflaged objects, which\nblend seamlessly with their surroundings or other objects, present unique\nchallenges for detection and tracking in complex environments. This challenge\nis particularly critical in applications such as military, security,\nagriculture, and marine monitoring, where precise tracking of camouflaged\nobjects is essential. To address this gap, we introduce the Camouflaged Object\nTracking Dataset (COTD), a specialized benchmark designed specifically for\nevaluating camouflaged object tracking methods. The COTD dataset comprises 200\nsequences and approximately 80,000 frames, each annotated with detailed\nbounding boxes. Our evaluation of 20 existing tracking algorithms reveals\nsignificant deficiencies in their performance with camouflaged objects. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel tracking framework, HiPTrack-MLS,\nwhich demonstrates promising results in improving tracking performance for\ncamouflaged objects. COTD and code are avialable at\nhttps://github.com/openat25/HIPTrack-MLS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
