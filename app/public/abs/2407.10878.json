However, existing methods face\nchallenges in assessing the impact of shocks, such as the outbreak of the\nRussian-Ukrainian war. In this context, we apply deep neural network-based\nGranger causality to identify important drivers of natural gas demand.\nFurthermore, the resulting dependencies are used to construct a counterfactual\ncase without the outbreak of the war, providing a quantifiable estimate of the\noverall effect of the shock on various German energy sectors.
