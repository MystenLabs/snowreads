CBCT can produce\nthree-dimensional views of a patient's head, providing clinicians with better\ndiagnostic capability, whereas Panoramic X-ray can capture the entire\nmaxillofacial region in a single image. If the CBCT is already available, it\ncan be beneficial to synthesize a Panoramic X-ray, thereby avoiding an\nimmediate additional scan and extra radiation exposure. Existing methods focus\non delineating an approximate dental arch and creating orthogonal projections\nalong this arch. However, no golden standard is available for such dental arch\nextractions, and this choice can affect the quality of synthesized X-rays. To\navoid such issues, we propose a novel method for synthesizing Panoramic X-rays\nfrom diverse head CBCTs, employing a simulated projection geometry and dynamic\nrotation centers. Our method effectively synthesized panoramic views from CBCT,\neven for patients with missing or nonexistent teeth and in the presence of\nsevere metal implants. Our results demonstrate that this method can generate\nhigh-quality panoramic images irrespective of the CBCT scanner geometry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
