We present a method for calculating primitive roots from\nquadratic residues, including semi-primitive roots. We then present\nprogressions that generate primitive and semi-primitive roots, and deduce an\nalgorithm to obtain the full set of primitive roots without any GCD\ncalculation. Next, we present a method for determining irreducible quadratic\nforms with arbitrarily large conjectured asymptotic density of primes (after\nShanks, [1][2]). To this end, we propose an algorithm for calculating the\nsquare root modulo p, based on the Tonelli-Shanks algorithm [4].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
