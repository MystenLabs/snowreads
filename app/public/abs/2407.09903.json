This family\npossesses a rare property that orthogonal polynomials of degree $n$ have\n$n(n+1)/2$ real common zeros, which leads to important examples in the theory\nof minimal cubature rules. This paper aims to give an account of the minimal\ncubature rules of two variables and examples originating from Koornwinder\npolynomials, and we will also provide further examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FehV6Qb52Gw_Q2ojCzOJtTKvDGY12wPglvK0Y2QWcBo","pdfSize":"644982"}
