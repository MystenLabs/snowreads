In this work, we demonstrate a high-performance MoS2\nphototransistors by integrating few-layer MoS2 on a PN junction formed in a\nsilicon (Si) substrate. The photovoltage created in the PN junction under light\nillumination electrically gates the MoS2 channel, creating a strong\nphotoresponse in MoS2. We present an analytical model for the photoresponse of\nour device and show that it is in good agreement with measured experimental\nphotocurrent in MoS2 and photovoltage in the Si PN junction. This device\nstructure separates light absorption and electrical response functions, which\nprovides us an opportunity to design new types of photodetectors. For example,\nincorporating ferroelectric materials into the gate structure can produce a\nnegative capacitance that boosts gate voltage, enabling low power, high\nsensitivity phototransistor; this, combined with separating light absorption\nand electrical functions, enables advanced high-performance photodetectors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
