Necessary to any analysis of these questions is an understanding\nof how a given species' spatial distribution evolves in time. While studies of\nanimal movement are often conducted using telemetry data, the collection of\nsuch data can be time- and resource-intensive, frequently resulting in small\nsample sizes. Ecological surveys of animal populations are also indicative of\nspecies distribution trends, but may be constrained to a limited spatial\ndomain. Within this article we utilize crowd-sourced observations from the\neBird database to model the abundance of migratory bird species in space and\ntime. While crowd-sourced observations are individually less reliable than\nthose produced by experts, the sheer size and spatial coverage of the eBird\ndatabase make it attractive for use in this setting. We introduce a hidden\nMarkov model for observed bird counts utilizing a novel transition structure\ndeveloped using principles from circuit theory. After illustrating model\nproperties we fit it to observations of Baltimore orioles and yellow-rumped\nwarblers within the eastern United States and discuss insight it provides into\nthe migratory patterns for these species.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
