In multilayer graphene, the order of the\nstacking of the layers plays a crucial role in the electronic properties and\nthe manifestation of superconductivity, and friction affects how layers slide\nto change the stacking. Here, we study the effects of friction in bilayer\ngraphene by focusing on quantum fluctuations in the free energy barrier that\nlayers have to overcome to slide with respect to each other. We evaluate the\nfree energy at the barrier in bilayer graphene through the self-consistent\nharmonic approximation, accounting for quantum and thermal ionic fluctuations.\nWe obtain a very large reduction of the barrier of more than 30%. Temperature\neffects are weaker, although high temperatures induce a significant reduction\nof the barrier as well. Our approach is general and paves the way for\nsystematically accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal effects in free\nenergy barriers of other macroscopic systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
