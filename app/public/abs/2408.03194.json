However, acquiring high-resolution MRI\ntypically extends scan time, which can introduce motion artifacts.\nSuper-resolution of MRI therefore emerges as a promising approach to mitigate\nthese challenges. Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple\ncontrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not\nfully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully\nutilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we\npropose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new\nspatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs\nattention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query,\nwhich is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common\nstructures from different contrasts. We further propose a novel\nfrequency-domain CQA module in addition to the spatial domain, to enable more\nfine-grained structural refinement. Extensive experiments on fastMRI knee data\nand low-field brain MRI show that SGSR outperforms state-of-the-art MCSR\nmethods with statistical significance.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
