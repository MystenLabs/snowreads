In this paper, we are pioneering to make the investigation of fairness\nin SGNNs expanded from GNNs. We identify the issue of degree bias within signed\ngraphs, offering a new perspective on the fairness issues related to SGNNs. To\nhandle the confronted bias issue, inspired by previous work on degree bias, a\nnew Model-Agnostic method is consequently proposed to enhance representation of\nnodes with different degrees, which named as Degree Debiased Signed Graph\nNeural Network (DD-SGNN) . More specifically, in each layer, we make a transfer\nfrom nodes with high degree to nodes with low degree inside a head-to-tail\ntriplet, which to supplement the underlying domain missing structure of the\ntail nodes and meanwhile maintain the positive and negative semantics specified\nby balance theory in signed graphs. We make extensive experiments on four\nreal-world datasets. The result verifies the validity of the model, that is,\nour model mitigates the degree bias issue without compromising\nperformance($\\textit{i.e.}$, AUC, F1).
