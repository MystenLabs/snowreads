For rescattered electrons, we show that for a given time that electron\ntunnels to the continuum, there are typically multiple trajectories that lead\nto the same final momentum in the high-energy region. These trajectories start\nwith slightly different initial transverse momenta and carry different phases\ngiving rise to the interference structures in the PMD, which can also be\nassociated with the laser-free electron-ion differential cross section. This is\nin contrast to the well-known long and short trajectories, which result in\ndifferent interference patterns. Our results can be used to extend current\ncapabilities of the laser-induced electron diffraction and other ultrafast\nimaging and strong-field spectroscopic techniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
