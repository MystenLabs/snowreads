As a consequence, we show that a non-unital operator system\narising from the direct limit of C*-algebras under positive maps is a\nC*-algebra if and only if its unitization is a C*-algebra. Secondly, we show\nthat the completely positive approximation property and the completely\ncontractive approximation property of a non-unital operator system is\nequivalent to its bidual being an injective von Neumann algebra. This implies\nin particular that all non-unital operator systems with the completely\ncontractive approximation property must necessarily admit an abundance of\npositive elements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
