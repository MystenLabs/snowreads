Given\nthe linear characteristics inherent to the Koopman operator, controlling its\neigenvalues offers an opportunity to enhance long-term prediction performance,\na critical task for forecasting future trends in time-series datasets with\nlong-term behaviors. However, controlling eigenvalues is challenging due to\nhigh computational complexity and difficulties in managing them during the\ntraining process. To tackle this issue, we propose leveraging the singular\nvalue decomposition (SVD) of the Koopman matrix to adjust the singular values\nfor better long-term prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that, during\ntraining, the loss term for singular values effectively brings the eigenvalues\nclose to the unit circle, and the proposed approach outperforms existing\nbaseline methods for long-term prediction tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"QGJrNNN2vw9R16YjmiZR4hi4PSjPlQdbe2k6g2ypNAs","pdfSize":"452683"}
