SSIP\nis flexible: it is capable of performing both external surgery, that is surgery\nbetween two codeblocks, and internal surgery, that is surgery within the same\ncodeblock. Under the hood, it performs linear algebra over $\\mathbb{F}_2$\ngoverned by universal constructions in the category of chain complexes. We\ndemonstrate on quantum Low-Density Parity Check (qLDPC) codes, which are not\ntopological codes in general, and are of interest for near-term fault-tolerant\nquantum computing. Such qLDPC codes include lift-connected surface codes,\ngeneralised bicycle codes and bivariate bicycle codes. We show that various\nlogical measurements can be performed cheaply by surgery without sacrificing\nthe high code distance. For example, half of the single-qubit logical\nmeasurements in the $Z$ or $X$ basis on the $[[ 144 ,12, 12 ]]$ gross code\nrequire only 30 total additional qubits each, assuming the upper bound on\ndistance given by QDistRnd is tight. This is two orders of magnitude lower than\nthe additional qubit count of 1380 initially predicted by Bravyi et al.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aOm_gsGBgLQnhaX1-wm8nEc102AuGW7Rk4CXUc0Y5QQ","pdfSize":"782814"}
