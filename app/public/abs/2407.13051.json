We study modified first order Sobolev spaces on metric measure\nspaces: $\\mathrm{TC}$-Newtonian space, $\\hat{\\mathrm{TC}}$-Newtonian space, and\nGigli-like space. We prove that if the measure is Borel regular and\n$\\sigma$-finite, then the modified $\\mathrm{TC}$-Newtonian space is equivalent\nto the Haj{\\l}asz-Sobolev space. Moreover, if additionally the measure is\ndoubling then all modified spaces are equivalent to the Haj{\\l}asz-Sobolev\nspace.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
