The updated\nbindings are $115(17)$ MeV for the $I=0$ member of the antitriplet and $47(8)$\nMeV for its $I=1/2$ partner. We also provide an update of our earlier study of\nthe variable heavy mass dependence of binding in the $1^+$ channel and new\nresults on this dependence for binding in the $0^+$ channel, accessible when\nthe two heavy quarks have unequal masses. Implications of these results of\npotential relevance to experimental searches for signals of the production of\ndoubly bottom tetraquarks and/or a possible bottom-charm partner of the\n$T_{cc}$ are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
