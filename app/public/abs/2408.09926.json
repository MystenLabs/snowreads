Such problems require several experts to\ncollaborate on solving them, or a single analyst to reconcile multiple\ncomplementary standpoints. Previous research has shown that wall-sized displays\nsupports different collaboration styles, based most often on abstract tasks as\nproxies of real work. We present the design and implementation of WoW, short\nfor ``Workspace on Wall'', a multi-user Web-based portal for collaborative\nmeetings and workshops in multi-surface environments. We report on a two-year\neffort spanning context inquiry studies, system design iterations, development,\nand real testing rounds targeting design engineers in the tire industry. The\npneumatic tires found on the market result from a highly collaborative and\niterative development process that reconciles conflicting constraints through a\nseries of product design workshops. WoW was found to be a flexible solution to\nbuild multi-view set-ups in a self-service manner and an effective means to\naccess more content at once. Our users also felt more engaged in their\ncollaborative problem-solving work using WoW than in conventional meeting\nrooms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
