For each self-adjoint, trace-class\noperator $O$ we define a set $\\Lambda_n\\subset \\mathbb{R}$, and we show that it\nconverges to the spectrum of $O$ in the Hausdorff metric under mild conditions.\nOur set $\\Lambda_n$ only depends on the first $n$ moments of $O$. We show that\nit can be effectively calculated for physically relevant operators, and it\napproximates the spectrum well.\n  We prove that using the above method we can converge to the minimal and\nmaximal eigenvalues with super-exponential speed.\n  We also construct monotone increasing lower bounds $q_n$ for the minimal\neigenvalue (or decreasing upper bounds for the maximal eigenvalue). This\nsequence only depends on the moments of $O$ and a concrete upper estimate of\nits $1$-norm; we also demonstrate that $q_n$ can be effectively calculated for\na large class of physically relevant operators. This rigorous lower bound $q_n$\ntends to the minimal eigenvalue with super-exponential speed provided that $O$\nis not positive semidefinite. As a by-product, we obtain computable upper\nbounds for the $1$-norm of $O$, too.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
