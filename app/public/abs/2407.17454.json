Explanability helps build\ntrust in artificial intelligence systems beyond their mere predictive accuracy\nand robustness. In this paper, we propose a cycle of scientific discovery that\ncombines machine learning with automated reasoning for the generation and the\nselection of explanations. We present a taxonomy of explanation selection\nproblems that draws on insights from sociology and cognitive science. These\nselection criteria subsume existing notions and extend them with new\nproperties.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NiuJJrNF5w1dts2fu1I41jo9u6wJvmcs3E-1HiJ40LA","pdfSize":"125206"}
