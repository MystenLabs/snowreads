We prove that every entry of any optimal matrix is a\nsquare root of a rational number, and we find provably optimal matrices for $n\n\\leq 4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
