In this article, I consider two cases in which\npreregistration does not improve this evaluation. First, I argue that, although\npreregistration can facilitate the transparent evaluation of severity in Mayo's\nerror statistical philosophy of science, it does not facilitate this evaluation\nin Popper's theory-centric approach. To illustrate, I show that associated\nconcerns about Type I error rate inflation are only relevant in the error\nstatistical approach and not in a theory-centric approach. Second, I argue that\na preregistered test procedure that allows deviations in its implementation\ndoes not provide a more transparent evaluation of Mayoian severity than a\nnon-preregistered procedure. In particular, I argue that sample-based\nvalidity-enhancing deviations cause an unknown inflation of the test\nprocedure's Type I (familywise) error rate and, consequently, an unknown\nreduction in its capability to license inferences severely. I conclude that\npreregistration does not improve the transparent evaluation of severity in\nPopper's philosophy of science or when deviations are allowed.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
