Upon cooling, the nematic order undergoes a\nstrongly first-order phase transition followed by a second-order magnetic\ntransition at $T_{\\textrm{N}}$ $\\approx$ 34.6 K. The temperature difference\nbetween these two phase transitions is $\\sim$ 1 K. The observed phenomenon can\nbe attributed to a distinctive first-order preemptive Ising-nematic transition,\na characteristic unique to a quasi-two-dimensional scenario marked by strong\nout-of-plane spatial anisotropy due to weak coupling. Our studies establish\nK$_{5}$Fe$_{4}$Ag$_{6}$Te$_{10}$ as the first material in the family of iron\npnictides and chalcogenides that possesses a nematic tricritical point\npreceding the magnetic one upon decreasing nematic coupling.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
