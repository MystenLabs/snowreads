This process has allowed us to automatically extract\nsamples that represent various musical elements depicted on the manuscripts,\nincluding notes, staves, clefs, erasures, and composer's annotations, among\nothers. To distinguish between digitization noise and actual music elements, a\nsubset of these images was meticulously grouped and labeled by multiple\nindividuals into several classes. After assessing the consistency of the\nannotations, we trained multiple neural network-based classifiers to\ndifferentiate between the identified music elements. The primary objective of\nthis study was to evaluate the reliability of these classifiers, with the\nultimate goal of using them for the automatic categorization of the remaining\nunannotated data set. The dataset, complemented by manual annotations, models,\nand source code used in these experiments are publicly accessible for\nreplication purposes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qdU2rNf72bx6YHsLIS49lyFV-ByO1L8BWno7KssGI5c","pdfSize":"2923014"}
