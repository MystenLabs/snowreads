These changes have significant implications for\ncomputer applications, including automatic translation and chatbots, making it\nessential to characterize them accurately. The recent development of LLMs has\nnotably advanced natural language understanding, particularly in sense\ninference and reasoning. In this paper, we investigate the potential of LLMs in\ncharacterizing three types of semantic change: dimension, relation, and\norientation. We achieve this by combining LLMs' Chain-of-Thought with\nrhetorical devices and conducting an experimental assessment of our approach\nusing newly created datasets. Our results highlight the effectiveness of LLMs\nin capturing and analyzing semantic changes, providing valuable insights to\nimprove computational linguistic applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
