However, current methods exhibit limited performance mainly due\nto the scarcity of high-quality data, the insufficient utilization of facial\ndynamics, and the ambiguity of expression semantics, etc. To this end, we\npropose a novel framework, named Multi-modal Fine-grained CLIP for Dynamic\nFacial Expression Recognition with AdaptERs (FineCLIPER), incorporating the\nfollowing novel designs: 1) To better distinguish between similar facial\nexpressions, we extend the class labels to textual descriptions from both\npositive and negative aspects, and obtain supervision by calculating the\ncross-modal similarity based on the CLIP model; 2) Our FineCLIPER adopts a\nhierarchical manner to effectively mine useful cues from DFE videos.\nSpecifically, besides directly embedding video frames as input (low semantic\nlevel), we propose to extract the face segmentation masks and landmarks based\non each frame (middle semantic level) and utilize the Multi-modal Large\nLanguage Model (MLLM) to further generate detailed descriptions of facial\nchanges across frames with designed prompts (high semantic level).\nAdditionally, we also adopt Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) to enable\nefficient adaptation of large pre-trained models (i.e., CLIP) for this task.\nOur FineCLIPER achieves SOTA performance on the DFEW, FERV39k, and MAFW\ndatasets in both supervised and zero-shot settings with few tunable parameters.\nProject Page: https://haroldchen19.github.io/FineCLIPER-Page/\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
