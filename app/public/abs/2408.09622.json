Fundamentally, monitoring\ninvolves observing BGP feeds to detect suspicious announcements and taking\ndefensive action. However, BGP monitoring relies on seeing the malicious BGP\nannouncement in the first place! In this paper, we develop a novel attack that\ncan hide itself from all state-of-the-art BGP monitoring systems we tested\nwhile affecting the entire Internet. The attack involves launching a sub-prefix\nhijack with the RFC-specified NO_EXPORT community attached to prevent networks\nwith the malicious route installed from sending the route to BGP monitoring\nsystems. We study the viability of this attack at four tier-1 networks and find\nall networks we studied were vulnerable to the attack. Finally, we propose a\nmitigation that significantly improves the robustness of the BGP monitoring\necosystem. Our paper aims to raise awareness of this issue and offer guidance\nto providers to protect against such attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
