This includes song structure,\nemotional emphasis, and contrast between lead and background vocals. While\nautomatic lyrics transcription (ALT) systems have advanced beyond producing\nunstructured strings of words and are able to draw on wider context, ALT\nbenchmarks have not kept pace and continue to focus exclusively on words. To\naddress this gap, we introduce Jam-ALT, a comprehensive lyrics transcription\nbenchmark. The benchmark features a complete revision of the JamendoLyrics\ndataset, in adherence to industry standards for lyrics transcription and\nformatting, along with evaluation metrics designed to capture and assess the\nlyric-specific nuances, laying the foundation for improving the readability of\nlyrics. We apply the benchmark to recent transcription systems and present\nadditional error analysis, as well as an experimental comparison with a\nclassical music dataset.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
