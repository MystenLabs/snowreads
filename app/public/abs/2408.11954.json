In this paper, we\npresent a type system for data-flow analysis for a subset of the ReScript\nlanguage, more specific for a lambda-calculus with mutability and pattern\nmatching. The type system is a local analysis that collects information about\nwhat variables are used and alias information.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"OKAPJawSZpWBU8Xe_kF1Dc5gKnEoEVbdoiXJhYVDXX4","pdfSize":"864599"}
