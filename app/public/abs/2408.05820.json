The study\nof $\\gcd(n,u_n)$ corresponds, following Silverman, to divisibility sequences\narising from the split algebraic group $\\mathbb G_{\\mathrm{a}} \\times \\mathbb\nG_{\\mathrm{m}}$; in this case, Sanna determined all asymptotic moments of the\narithmetic function $\\log\\,\\gcd (n,u_n)$ when $(u_n)_n$ is a Lucas sequence.\nHere, we characterize the asymptotic behavior of the moments themselves\n$\\sum_{n \\leq x}\\,\\gcd(n,u_n)^\\lambda$, thus solving the moment problem for\n$\\mathbb G_{\\mathrm{a}} \\times \\mathbb G_{\\mathrm{m}}$. We give both\nunconditional and conditional results, the latter only relying on standard\nconjectures in analytic number theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GMYLE8-aypsPgWfM9Yj10qRTJQWS9Ui-kRcZQ83_Hu0","pdfSize":"499059"}
