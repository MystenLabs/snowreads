It turns out that the expression\nobtained can be rewritten in terms of Rabotnov functions. Moreover, for the\noriginal parameter $\\alpha =1/3$ in the Andrade model, we obtain an expression\nin terms of Miller-Ross functions. The asymptotic behaviours of $G_{\\alpha\n}\\left( t\\right) $ for $t\\rightarrow 0^{+}$ and $t\\rightarrow +\\infty $ are\nalso derived applying the Tauberian theorem. The analytical results obtained\nhave been numerically checked by solving the Volterra integral equation\nsatisfied by $G_{\\alpha }\\left( t\\right) $ by using a successive approximation\napproach, as well as computing the inverse Laplace transform of\n$\\tilde{G}_{\\alpha }\\left( s\\right) $ by using Talbot's method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
