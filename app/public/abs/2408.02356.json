However, since catalytic processes often require high\ntemperatures and pressures, most catalysts are quite difficult to meet the\nrequirements of high selectivity and high activity simultaneously. Herein, a\nplasmon-promoted photocatalyst, integrating Ag nanowires with metal-organic\nframeworks (MOFs)-confined Pd nanoparticles, is rationally designed to afford\nAgNWs/ZIF-8/Pd which achieve highly selective and efficient catalytic\nhydrogenation toward 2(5H)-Furanone under mild conditions. The plasmonic\nAgNWs/ZIF-8/Pd exhibited much stronger photocatalytic activity and higher\nselectivity compared with AgNWS/ZIF-8 and ZIF-8/Pd. The enhanced activity can\nbe attributed to the synergistic coupling between Pd nanoparticles and AgNWs,\nand the possible reaction mechanism is proposed. This work provides a new\napproach to constructing efficient photocatalysts and offers new insights into\nthe understanding of the influence of the plasmonic effect on photocatalytic\nhydrogenation reactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
