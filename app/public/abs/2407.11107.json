This paper presents a\n$\\textbf{la}$tent $\\textbf{l}$inear $\\textbf{q}$uadratic $\\textbf{r}$egulator\n(LaLQR) that maps the state space into a latent space, on which the dynamical\nmodel is linear and the cost function is quadratic, allowing the efficient\napplication of LQR. We jointly learn this alternative system by imitating the\noriginal MPC. Experiments show LaLQR's superior efficiency and generalization\ncompared to other baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
