We show using the\nsymmetry properties of matrices that a defective photonic crystal, doped with\nthree-level atoms, breaks PT symmetry. For the two defect modes lying in the\nbandgap region, both the reflection and the absorption become nonreciprocal,\nwhile the transmission remains reciprocal. We show that the relevant energy\nspectra do not exhibit exceptional points, thereby invalidating its necessity\nto achieve nonreciprocity in reflection and absorption. We further demonstrate\nhow this nonreciprocity can be coherently controlled using the driving field\nand dissipation rates of the atoms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
