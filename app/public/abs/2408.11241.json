Nevertheless, it is time-consuming and\nexpensive to collect and annotate real-world data, especially for V2X systems.\nIn this paper, we present a self-supervised learning method for V2X cooperative\nperception, which utilizes the vast amount of unlabeled 3D V2X data to enhance\nthe perception performance. Beyond simply extending the previous pre-training\nmethods for point-cloud representation learning, we introduce a novel\nself-supervised Cooperative Pretraining framework (termed as CooPre) customized\nfor a collaborative scenario. We point out that cooperative point-cloud sensing\ncompensates for information loss among agents. This motivates us to design a\nnovel proxy task for the 3D encoder to reconstruct LiDAR point clouds across\ndifferent agents. Besides, we develop a V2X bird-eye-view (BEV) guided masking\nstrategy which effectively allows the model to pay attention to 3D features\nacross heterogeneous V2X agents (i.e., vehicles and infrastructure) in the BEV\nspace. Noticeably, such a masking strategy effectively pretrains the 3D encoder\nand is compatible with mainstream cooperative perception backbones. Our\napproach, validated through extensive experiments on representative datasets\n(i.e., V2X-Real, V2V4Real, and OPV2V), leads to a performance boost across all\nV2X settings. Additionally, we demonstrate the framework's improvements in\ncross-domain transferability, data efficiency, and robustness under challenging\nscenarios. The code will be made publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zXl_PtiUgnRfgpfmLyVHRcXS-rE3OrRjCCEFfx4jLfQ","pdfSize":"4880790"}
