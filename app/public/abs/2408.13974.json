Math., 321 (2017) 269-286], using the theory of ultrafilters, J. H.\nJohnson Jr., and F. K. Richter proved the nilpotent polynomial Hales-Jewett\ntheorem. Using this result they proved the restricted version of the van der\nWaerden theorem for nilprogressions of rank $2$ and conjectured that this\nresult must hold for arbitrary rank. In this article, we give an affirmative\nanswer to their conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
