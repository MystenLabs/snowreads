Therefore, good gameplay requires policies that deal\nwith the different information that is hidden from each player. To combat this,\neffective algorithms often reason about information sets; the sets of all\npossible game states that are consistent with a player's observations. While\nthere is no way to distinguish between the states within an information set,\nthis property does not imply that all states are equally likely to occur in\nplay. We extend previous research on assigning weights to the states in an\ninformation set in order to facilitate better gameplay in the imperfect\ninformation game of Reconnaissance Blind Chess. For this, we train two\ndifferent neural networks which estimate the likelihood of each state in an\ninformation set from historical game data. Experimentally, we find that a\nSiamese neural network is able to achieve higher accuracy and is more efficient\nthan a classical convolutional neural network for the given domain. Finally, we\nevaluate an RBC-playing agent that is based on the generated weightings and\ncompare different parameter settings that influence how strongly it should rely\non them. The resulting best player is ranked 5th on the public leaderboard.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ioAO5ZkB3L_oyfY9yWAnUETi7k0u3xnocv4z7HKVm_8","pdfSize":"2930799"}
