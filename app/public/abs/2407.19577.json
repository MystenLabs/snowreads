We discuss the Reggeization of pion exchange in\ncharged pion photoproduction with an emphasis on consistency with current\nconservation. We show that the gauge-invariant amplitude for the exchange of a\nparticle with generic even spin $J\\geq 2$ in the $t$-channel is analytic at\n$J=0$, and that it can be interpreted in terms of the nucleon electric current.\nThis enables us to reconcile the dynamics in the $s$- and $u$-channel, which\ninvolves also nucleon exchanges, with the amplitude expressed in terms of\n$t$-channel partial waves, as required by Regge theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
