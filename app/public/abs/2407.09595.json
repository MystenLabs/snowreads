The conjecture states\nthat virtual black-hole configurations in the path integral generate terms\nwhich violate all global symmetries in the effective action for matter. Because\nof its central role, it is crucial to understand limitations to the validity of\nthis conjecture. In the context of the Lorentzian path integral over spacetime\ngeometries, we explore whether virtual black-hole configurations can be\nsuppressed dynamically. To that end, we work in a spherically symmetric setting\nand make use of horizon-detecting curvature invariants which vanish on the\nhorizon. By constructing a non-local action from the inverse of such curvature\ninvariants, we can achieve destructive interference of black-hole\nconfigurations in the path integral.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
