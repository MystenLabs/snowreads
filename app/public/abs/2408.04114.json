We unify the tasks of Natural Language Inference, Summarization\nEvaluation, Factuality Verification and Factual Consistency Evaluation to train\nmodels capable of evaluating the factual consistency of source-target pairs\nacross diverse domains. We rigorously evaluate these against eight baselines on\na comprehensive benchmark suite comprising 22 datasets that span various tasks,\ndomains, and document lengths. Results demonstrate that our method achieves\nstate-of-the-art performance on this heterogeneous benchmark while addressing\nefficiency concerns and attaining cross-domain generalization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
