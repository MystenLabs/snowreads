Our proposal builds upon recent contributions, expanding from\nthe purely isotropic setting to encompass geometrically anisotropic correlation\nstructures, i.e., random fields with correlation ranges that vary across\ndifferent directions. We conduct experiments with both simulated and real data\nto assess the performance of the methodology and to provide guidelines to\npractitioners.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OlSUgkv6uahqYX784sFYvfTOlVQnuFwutrRIwvLAm8o","pdfSize":"6656419"}
