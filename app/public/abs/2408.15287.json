Traditional machine learning models and\nGPU-based approaches have long been utilized to tailor educational experiences\nto individual student needs. However, these methods face significant challenges\nin terms of scalability, computational efficiency, and real-time adaptation to\nthe dynamic nature of educational data. This study proposes leveraging quantum\ncomputing to address these limitations. We review existing personalized\nlearning systems, classical machine learning methods, and emerging quantum\ncomputing applications in education. We then outline a protocol for data\ncollection, privacy preservation using quantum techniques, and preprocessing,\nfollowed by the development and implementation of quantum algorithms\nspecifically designed for personalized learning. Our findings indicate that\nquantum algorithms offer substantial improvements in efficiency, scalability,\nand personalization quality compared to classical methods. This paper discusses\nthe implications of integrating quantum computing into educational systems,\nhighlighting the potential for enhanced teaching methodologies, curriculum\ndesign, and overall student experiences. We conclude by summarizing the\nadvantages of quantum computing in education and suggesting future research\ndirections.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GTLoYR6s6TzxTlulXnMG5UYIHmrW7QQzwbPuWbLSBlg","pdfSize":"658671"}
