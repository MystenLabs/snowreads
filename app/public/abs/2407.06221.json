Traditional detection methods struggle to keep pace with the evolving\nnature of these threats. Detecting malicious URLs in real-time requires\nadvanced techniques capable of handling large datasets and identifying novel\nattack patterns. The challenge lies in developing a robust model that combines\nefficient feature extraction with accurate classification. We propose a hybrid\nmachine learning approach combining Self-Organizing Map based Radial Movement\nOptimization (SOM-RMO) for feature extraction and Radial Basis Function Network\n(RBFN) based Tabu Search for classification. SOM-RMO effectively reduces\ndimensionality and highlights significant features, while RBFN, optimized with\nTabu Search, classifies URLs with high precision. The proposed model\ndemonstrates superior performance in detecting various malicious URL attacks.\nOn a benchmark dataset, our approach achieved an accuracy of 96.5%, precision\nof 95.2%, recall of 94.8%, and an F1-score of 95.0%, outperforming traditional\nmethods significantly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
