In\nour work, we explore an extension of the generalized variational continual\nlearning (GVCL) model, named AutoVCL, which combines task heuristics for\ninformed learning and model optimization. We demonstrate that our model\noutperforms the standard GVCL with fixed hyperparameters, benefiting from the\nautomatic adjustment of the hyperparameter based on the difficulty and\nsimilarity of the incoming task compared to the previous tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
