A candidate for producing such\nsteady emission is a mass asymmetry, or \"mountain\", sourced by temperature\nasymmetries in the star's crust. A number of studies have examined\ntemperature-induced shifts in the crustal capture layers between one nuclear\nspecies and another to produce this asymmetry, with the presence of capture\nlayers in the deep crust being needed to produce the required mass asymmetries.\nHowever, modern equation of state calculations cast doubt on the existence of\nsuch deep capture layers. Motivated by this, we investigated an alternative\nsource of temperature dependence in the equation of state, coming from the\npressure supplied by the solid crustal lattice itself. We show that\ntemperature-induced perturbations in this pressure, while small, may be\nsignificant. We therefore advocate for more detailed calculations,\nself-consistently calculating both the temperature asymmetries, the\nperturbations in crustal lattice pressure, and the consequent mass asymmetries,\nto establish if this is a viable mechanism for explaining the observed\ndistribution of low-mass X-ray binary spin frequencies. Furthermore, the\ncrustal lattice pressure mechanism does not require accretion, extending the\npossibility for such thermoelastic mountains to include both accreting and\nisolated neutron stars.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
