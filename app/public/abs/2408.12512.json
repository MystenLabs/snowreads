Unlike\nDirichlet-Neumann and Neumann-Neumann algorithms, we find different properties\nbased on the forward-backward structure of the optimality system. Variants can\nbe found using only Dirichlet and Neumann transmission conditions. Some of\nthese variants are only good smoothers, while others could lead to efficient\nsolvers.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
