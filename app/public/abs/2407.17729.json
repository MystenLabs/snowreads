The high-resolution\nspectra yielded the radial velocities of all three stars and the atmospheric\nparameters of $T_{\\rm eff,A}$ = 7225$\\pm42$ K, [M/H] = 0.30$\\pm$0.03 dex, and\n$v_{\\rm A}$$\\sin i$ = 78$\\pm$5 km s$^{-1}$ of the primary component. The\ncombined analysis of these observations resulted in the fundamental parameters\nof the eclipsing components and the third light of $l_3$ = 0.043$\\pm$0.004,\nwhich is consistent with the light contribution of the tertiary star observed\nin the echelle spectra. WASP 0346-21 A resides within the overlapping\nmain-sequence domain of $\\delta$ Sct and $\\gamma$ Dor variables, while the\nsecondary component of $M_{\\rm B}$ = 0.185$\\pm$0.013 M$_\\odot$, $R_{\\rm B}$ =\n0.308$\\pm$0.023 R$_\\odot$, $T_{\\rm eff,B}$ = 10,655$\\pm$146 K, and $L_{\\rm B}$\n= 1.09$\\pm$0.17 L$_\\odot$ matches well with the low-mass white dwarf (WD) model\nfor $Z$ = 0.01, corresponding to the thick-disk population classified by the\nGalactic kinematics. Multifrequency analyses were performed on the residual\nTESS data after removing the binarity effects. The low frequencies around\n26.348 day$^{-1}$ and 17.683 day$^{-1}$ are $\\delta$ Sct pulsations originating\nfrom WASP 0346-21 A, and the high frequencies of 97.996 day$^{-1}$ and 90.460\nday$^{-1}$ are considered to be extremely low-mass WD oscillations. These\nresults demonstrate that WASP 0346-21 is a hierarchical triple system,\nconsisting of an EL CVn binary with multiperiodic pulsations in each component\nand a distant outer tertiary.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3p_RvjNyjssPYI4f_Fa_Z8UUUcRBMn_vs7tGOwt5VNI","pdfSize":"1223620","objectId":"0xb166f3597930f650ad03c990c0b52b1df926c2cc3c1c94cca11134e1c7d1ca2c","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
