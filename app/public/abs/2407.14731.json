We perform blow-up processes for\nthe enhancement $SU(5)\\rightarrow G'$, where $G'=E_6$, $E_7$ or $E_8$, to\nexamine whether a sufficient set of exceptional curves emerge that can explain\nthe charged matter generation predicted from anomaly cancelation. We first\napply one of the six Esole-Yau small resolutions to the multiply enhanced\nsingularities, but it turns out that the proper transform of the threefold\nequation does not reflect changes in the singularity or how the generic\ncodimension-two singularities gather there. We then use a(n) (apparently)\ndifferent way of small resolutions than Esole-Yau to find that, except for the\ncases of $G'= E_6$ and special cases of $E_7$, either (1) the resolution only\nyields exceptional curves that are insufficient to cancel the anomaly, or (2)\nthere arises a type of singularity that is neither a conifold nor a generalized\nconifold singularity. Finally, we revisit the Esole-Yau small resolution and\nshow that the change of the way of small resolutions amounts to simply\nexchanging the proper transform and the constraint condition, and under this\nexchange the two ways of small resolutions are completely equivalent.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
