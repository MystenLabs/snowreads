High quality single crystals of\nYbI$_3$ are grown from Yb and I as starting precursors, using the vapor\ntransport technique. The grown crystals are characterized by single crystal\nx-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, magnetization, and heat capacity probes.\nThe crystal-field split ground state of Yb$^{3+}$ in \\Yb~ is a well-isolated\nKramers doublet with an effective moment $\\rm J_{eff} = 1/2$. Upon cooling, the\nlow-temperature heat capacity of \\Yb~ reveals a broad peak at $\\rm T_1 =\n0.95$~K due to short-range ordering of the Yb moments, followed by a sharp peak\nat $\\rm T_2 = T_N = 0.6$~K due to long-range ordering. The magnetic behavior is\nfound to be weakly anisotropic with $\\chi^\\parallel > \\chi^\\perp$, where\n$\\chi^\\parallel$ and $\\chi^\\perp$ refers to the in-plane ($H \\parallel ab$) and\nout-of-plane ($H \\perp ab$) susceptibilities. The 2~K isothermal magnetization\nsaturates at $\\rm \\approx~1.5~\\mu_B/Yb^{3+}$ (in-plane) and $\\rm\n\\approx~1~\\mu_B/Yb^{3+}$ (out-of-plane), suggesting the anisotropy to be\neasy-plane type. Low-temperature heat capacity, well below T$_N$, is found to\nvary as T$^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha~\\approx~2.5$, indicating a possible\nunconventional magnetic ground state for YbI$_3$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"99Se_2wOYayMS7ZpEE20RLTQO5NWczJCI6UKpxZDBvc","pdfSize":"25735909","objectId":"0x5a45e7f096dc810944050c625f3726e5226e56860c98769dcac718e63b136f01","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
