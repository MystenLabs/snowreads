A new tight lower bound for $\\beta_E(J_{n,k})$ based\non hitting sets has been obtained. Using this bound, exact values for\n$\\beta_E(J_{n,2})$ and $\\beta_M(J_{n,2})$ have been derived, and it is proved\nthat $\\beta_E(J_{n,2}) = \\beta_M(J_{n,2})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
