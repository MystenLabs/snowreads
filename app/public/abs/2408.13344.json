Using a new\nchange of variables, Lyapunov functions, and a comparison principle, we provide\nsemiglobal exponential stability bounds for the states of the closed loop\nsystems that hold for all nonnegative times. For the first time, we consider\nbounded extremum seeking controls in the presence of constant input delays and\nfor linear time-varying systems with unknown control directions, and we provide\nreduction model controllers for quantifying the effects of the delays.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lyogoYWpKqp9s7asnZ8ObD41qQwjPOIosifiga06FXQ","pdfSize":"650050"}
