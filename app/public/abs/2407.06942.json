It becomes urgent to further evaluate Kyber's physical\nsecurity for the upcoming deployment phase. In this paper, we present an\nimproved two-step attack on Kyber to quickly recover the full secret key, s, by\nusing much fewer energy traces and less time. In the first step, we use the\ncorrelation power analysis (CPA) attack to obtain a portion of guess values of\ns with a small number of energy traces. The CPA attack is enhanced by utilizing\nboth the Pearson and Kendall's rank correlation coefficients and modifying the\nleakage model to improve the accuracy. In the second step, we adopt the lattice\nattack to recover s based on the results of CPA. The success rate is largely\nbuilt up by constructing a trail-and-error method. We implement the proposed\nattack for the reference implementation of Kyber512 (4 128-value groups of s)\non ARM Cortex-M4 and successfully recover a 128-value group of s in about 9\nminutes using a 16-core machine. Additionally, in that case, we only cost at\nmost 60 CPA guess values for a group and 15 power traces for a guess.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
