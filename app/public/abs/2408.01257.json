The advent of social media has\nmade it integral also to online human interactions, such as those that\ncharacterize thriving online communities and social movements. At the same\ntime, coordination is also core to effective disinformation, manipulation, and\nhate campaigns. This survey collects, categorizes, and critically discusses the\nbody of work produced as a result of the growing interest on coordinated online\nbehavior. We reconcile industry and academic definitions, propose a\ncomprehensive framework to study coordinated online behavior, and review and\ncritically discuss the existing detection and characterization methods. Our\nanalysis identifies open challenges and promising directions of research,\nserving as a guide for scholars, practitioners, and policymakers in\nunderstanding and addressing the complexities inherent to online coordination.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
