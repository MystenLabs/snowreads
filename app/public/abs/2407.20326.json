The associated beta functions at one loop and\npartially at two loops are derived, and a wide variety of interface conformal\nfield theories (CFTs) is found, even in cases where the bulk universality class\nis free or as simple as the Wilson-Fisher description of the $O(N)$ model. For\nup to three scalar fields in the bulk, interface fixed points are classified\nfor all bulk universality classes encountered in this case. Numerical results\nare obtained for interface CFTs that exist for larger numbers of multiscalar\nfields. Our analytic and numerical results indicate the existence of a vast\nspace of interface CFTs, much larger than the space of defect CFTs found for\nline and surface defect deformations of multiscalar models in $4-\\varepsilon$\ndimensions. In this vast space, stable interfaces found for free and $O(N)$\nbulks belong to the $F_4$ family, with global symmetries $SO(3), SU(3), Sp(6)$\nand $F_4$, realised with $N=5,8,16,24$ scalar fields, respectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"G8Al0qX9zlC8o1CKV0er99w8HveLaPKN6-ph5R9jqgE","pdfSize":"606103"}
