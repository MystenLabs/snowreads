The main benefit of\nthe LLP is its potential ability to capture the nonlinear system's dynamics\nwith precision superior to other linearization techniques, such as local\nlinearization about the operation point. The idea of lifting is supported by\nthe theory of Koopman Operators. For LLP identification, we focus on the\ndata-driven method based on the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD)\nalgorithm. However, while the EDMD algorithm presents an extremely simple and\nefficient way to obtain the LLP, it can also yield poor results. In this paper,\nwe present some less intuitive practical guidelines for data-driven\nidentification of the LLPs, aiming at improving usability of LLPs for designing\ncontrol. We support the guidelines with two motivating examples. The\nimplementation of the examples are shared on a public repository.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
