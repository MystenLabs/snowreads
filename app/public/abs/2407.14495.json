Unlike existing methods that rely on\nnested conformal framework and full conditional distribution estimation, CTI\nestimates the conditional probability density for a new response to fall into\neach interquantile interval using off-the-shelf multi-output quantile\nregression. CTI constructs prediction sets by thresholding the estimated\nconditional interquantile intervals based on their length, which is inversely\nproportional to the estimated probability density. The threshold is determined\nusing a calibration set to ensure marginal coverage. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that CTI achieves optimal performance across various datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
