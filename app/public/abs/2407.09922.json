Objective: To\ninvestigate the safety and neuroprotective properties of tPBM using\nnear-infrared (NIR)-II laser stimulation. Methods: We conducted thirteen\nexperiments involving multidimensional and quantitative methods and measured\nserum neurobiomarkers, performed electroencephalogram (EEG) and magnetic\nresonance imaging (MRI) scans, assessed executive functions, and collected a\nsubjective questionnaire. Results: Significant reductions (n=15) in neuron\nspecific enolase (NSE) levels were observed after treatment, indicating\nneuroprotective effects. No structural or functional brain abnormalities were\nobserved, confirming the safety of tPBM. Additionally, cognitive and executive\nfunctions were not impaired, with participants' feedback indicating minimal\ndiscomfort. Conclusions: Our data indicate that NIR-II tPBM is safe with\nspecific parameters, highlighting its potential for brain protection.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
