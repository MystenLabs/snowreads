However, scaling\nthese systems presents significant challenges, particularly in balancing the\npreservation of previous policies with the adaptation of new ones to current\nenvironments. This balance, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma, is\nespecially pronounced in complex multi-agent domains such as the train\nscheduling problem, where environmental and agent behaviors are constantly\nchanging, and the search space is vast. In this work, we propose addressing\nthese challenges in the train scheduling problem using curriculum learning. We\ndesign a curriculum with adjacent skills that build on each other to improve\ngeneralization performance. Introducing a curriculum with distinct tasks\nintroduces non-stationarity, which we address by proposing a new algorithm:\nContinual Deep Q-Network (DQN) Expansion (CDE). Our approach dynamically\ngenerates and adjusts Q-function subspaces to handle environmental changes and\ntask requirements. CDE mitigates catastrophic forgetting through EWC while\nensuring high plasticity using adaptive rational activation functions.\nExperimental results demonstrate significant improvements in learning\nefficiency and adaptability compared to RL baselines and other adapted methods\nfor continual learning, highlighting the potential of our method in managing\nthe stability-plasticity dilemma in the adaptive train scheduling setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
