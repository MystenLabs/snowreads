However, most of\nthe analyses regarding slope stability were performed without considering the\nunsaturated state of the soil. The prime purpose of the present manuscript is\nto address the stability of unsaturated homogeneous slopes subjected to\nsurcharge load and pseudo-static seismic forces under different climatic\nconditions. The upper bound limit analysis technique was used based on the\nlog-spiral failure mechanism. The suction stress-based effective stress\napproach was used to capture the effect of the unsaturated zone of the slope.\nThe suction stress is modelled using Gardner's one-parameter hydraulic\nconductivity function and van-Genuchten's soil water characteristics curve. An\nextensive parametric study is carried out to assess the combined effect of\nslope geometry, soil-strength parameters, hydro-mechanical parameters, depth of\nwater table, various flow conditions, surcharge load, and seismic loading. A\nfew stability charts are proposed to show the impact of surcharge load and\nseismic load separately on unsaturated homogeneous slopes subjected to various\nclimatic conditions. The present computed solutions match quite well with the\navailable solutions prescribed in the literature.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lDx_VvMpGj-DbqJrXbZ4ay6ldQAObcxjRC9HX4nGZP8","pdfSize":"2380718"}
