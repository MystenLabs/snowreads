Such\nsolutions have been constructed by Krieger-Schlag-Tataru in $d = 3$ and by\nJendrej in $d = 5$. The result from Jendrej covers the extremal case $\\nu = 3$,\nwhich we are missing, and any $\\nu > 8$. Surprisingly, no one else has treated\nthe $d = 4$ case yet. The major difference between dimensions 4 and 5 in our\npaper lies in this renormalization procedure. In $d = 4$, we essentially follow\nKrieger-Schlag-Tataru scheme used for the 3D equation. This scheme has been\nused with success in other equations such as the 3D-critical NLS, Schr\\\"odinger\nmaps or wave maps. In all of these cases, the non-linearity is a polynomial,\nwhich allows to treat the error terms using simple algebra rules. In $d = 5$,\nthe setup needs to be modified because the nonlinearity of the equation has a\nmuch lower regularity and it is not clear anymore how one should deal with the\nnonlinear error terms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
