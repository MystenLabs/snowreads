High pressure electric transport experiments\ndemonstrate that superconducting transition occurs with critical\ntemperature(Tc) 42 K at 187 GPa. The shift of Tc as function of external\napplied magnetic field is in consistent to the nature of superconductivity\nwhile the upper critical field at zero temperature Hc2(0) is estimated to~16.8\nTesla while the GL coherent length ~57 angstrom is estimated. The structure\ninvestigation using synchrotron radiation implies that the observed\nsuperconductivity may come from Fm-3m phase of NbH3.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
