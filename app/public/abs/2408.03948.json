However, research on human behavioral responses is\nlagging behind, i.e., the research into human reliance on AI advice (AI\nreliance). Current shortcomings in the literature include the unclear\ninfluences on AI reliance, lack of external validity, conflicting approaches to\nmeasuring reliance, and disregard for a change in reliance over time. Promising\navenues for future research include reliance on generative AI output and\nreliance in multi-user situations. In conclusion, we present a morphological\nbox that serves as a guide for research on AI reliance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
