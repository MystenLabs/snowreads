The low-dimensional signals that capture internal brain states\nare useful for building brain machine interfaces and understanding the neural\ncomputation underlying meaningful behavior. We derive a practical upper bound\nto the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of inferred neural latent trajectories using\nFisher information. We show that the SNR bound is proportional to the\noverdispersion factor and the Fisher information per neuron. Further numerical\nexperiments show that inference methods that exploit the temporal regularities\ncan achieve higher SNRs that are proportional to the bound. Our results provide\ninsights for fitting models to data, simulating neural responses, and design of\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
