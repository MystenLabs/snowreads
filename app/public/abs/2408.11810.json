These methods are costly and\nspecifically target prevalent Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs), while\nPixel-domain Diffusion Models (PDMs) remain largely unexplored and robust\nagainst such attacks. Our work addresses this gap by proposing a novel\nattacking framework with a feature representation attack loss that exploits\nvulnerabilities in denoising UNets and a latent optimization strategy to\nenhance the naturalness of protected images. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nthe effectiveness of our approach in attacking dominant PDM-based editing\nmethods (e.g., SDEdit) while maintaining reasonable protection fidelity and\nrobustness against common defense methods. Additionally, our framework is\nextensible to LDMs, achieving comparable performance to existing approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"--j00JVuSRnGqvBC6TiXFBdvKJJRWOEE7JkmDqhmeWk","pdfSize":"8745559"}
