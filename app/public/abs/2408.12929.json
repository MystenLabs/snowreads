As anticipated by previous work,\nour findings indicate that the geometric distortion of light impacts the focal\nplane's apparent scale, with a more pronounced influence as the size of the\nfocal plane increases. Our models suggest that the effect consistently\ninfluences the pixel scale in both the vertical and parallel directions. The\napparent scale variation follows a sinusoidal distribution throughout one orbit\nperiod. Simulations reveal that the effect is particularly pronounced in the\ncenter of the Galaxy and gradually diminishes along the direction of ecliptic\nlatitude. At low ecliptic latitudes, the total aberration leads to about 0.94\npixels offset (a 20-minute exposure) and 0.26 pixels offset (a 300-second\nexposure) at the edge of the field of view, respectively. Appropriate\nprocessings for the geometric effect during the CSST pre- and post-observation\nphases are presented.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
