Here we present an\nefficient source-independent QSS protocol utilizing entangled photon pairs in\nquantum networks. Through the post-matching method, which means the measurement\nevents in the same basis are matched, the key rate is almost independent of the\nnumber of participants. In addition, the unconditional security of our QSS\nagainst internal and external eavesdroppers can be proved by introducing an\nequivalent virtual protocol. Our protocol has great performance and technical\nadvantages in future quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SgwL4JsEAZkuIgY4Adyd2aG700bOTmgk0H7AAd-f3wE","pdfSize":"1237565"}
