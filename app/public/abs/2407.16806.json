The interest in this\nexcess re-emerged with di-photon ($\\approx$95 GeV), $WW$ and $\\tau\\tau$\nsignatures obtained by the Large Hadron Collider, leading to a combined global\nsignificance of $3.8\\sigma$. We perform a feasibility study for discovering\nsuch a new scalar at future electron-positron colliders using the recoil-mass\nmethod applied to $e^{+} e^{-} \\to ZS$ with $Z \\rightarrow \\mu^{+} \\mu^{-}$ and\n$S \\to b \\bar{b}$. We employ a Deep Neural Network to enhance the separation\nbetween the Standard Model background and the signal, reducing the required\nintegrated luminosity for a discovery by a factor of two to three. As a result,\na $SU(2)_L$ singlet Higgs can be observed at a 250 GeV centre-of-mass energy\ncollider and $5~{\\rm ab}^{-1}$ integrated luminosity if it has a mixing angle\nof at least $0.2$ with the Standard Model Higgs. This further strengthens the\nphysics case for future $e^+e^-$ accelerators, like CEPC, CLIC, FCC-ee and ILC.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
