We\ndesigned a new augmented reality (AR) system, avaTTAR, for table tennis stroke\ntraining. The system provides both \"on-body\" (first-person view) and \"detached\"\n(third-person view) visual cues, enabling users to visualize target strokes and\ncorrect their attempts effectively with this dual perspectives setup. By\nemploying a combination of pose estimation algorithms and IMU sensors, avaTTAR\ncaptures and reconstructs the 3D body pose and paddle orientation of users\nduring practice, allowing real-time comparison with expert strokes. Through a\nuser study, we affirm avaTTAR's capacity to amplify player experience and\ntraining results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qnFuXxfiI19HVp0DM8QQQt2IvOroNms5VK0ec1GbhPU","pdfSize":"3135216"}
