However, existing methods often rely on domain-specific predefined\nmeta-paths, which are coarse-grained and focus solely on aspects like node\ntype, limiting their ability to capture complex interactions. We introduce\nMF2Vec, a model that uses multi-faceted (fine-grained) paths instead of\npredefined meta-paths. MF2Vec extracts paths via random walks and generates\nmulti-faceted vectors, ignoring predefined schemas. This method learns diverse\naspects of nodes and their relationships, constructs a homogeneous network, and\ncreates node embeddings for classification, link prediction, and clustering.\nExtensive experiments show that MF2Vec outperforms existing methods, offering a\nmore flexible and comprehensive framework for analyzing complex networks.
