We introduce Two-Pass Forward Propagation, a novel\ntraining method that avoids specific nonlinear activation functions by\nmodulating and re-entering error with random noise. Additionally, we propose a\nnew way to implement convolutional neural networks using simple neural networks\nin integrated optical systems. Theoretical foundations and numerical results\ndemonstrate significant improvements in training speed, energy efficiency, and\nscalability, advancing the potential of optical computing for complex data\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"b3dQ8TaopQGi6nG1_3vega3MnPcFt9zqRE7No2_XSDI","pdfSize":"2894806"}
