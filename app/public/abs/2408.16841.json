The connection to\ninformation and communication technology exposes CPS to cyber risks. It is\ncrucial to assess these risks to manage them effectively. This paper reviews\nscholarly contributions to cyber risk assessment for CPS, analyzing how the\nassessment approaches were evaluated and investigating to what extent they meet\nthe requirements of effective risk assessment. We identify gaps limiting the\neffectiveness of the assessment and recommend real-time learning from\ncybersecurity incidents. Our review covers twenty-eight papers published\nbetween 2014 and 2023, selected based on a three-step search. Our findings show\nthat the reviewed cyber risk assessment methodologies revealed limited\neffectiveness due to multiple factors. These findings provide a foundation for\nfurther research to explore and address other factors impacting the quality of\ncyber risk assessment in CPS.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
