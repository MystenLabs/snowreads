For some initial\nmisorientations, the expanding grains form well-defined, faceted shapes, while\nfor others the shapes remain cylindrical. The embedded grains tend to rotate\nduring grain boundary migration, with the direction of rotation dependent on\ninitial misorientation and direction of growth (expand/shrink). The kinetic\nshapes, which are bounded by low mobility grain boundary planes, differ from\nequilibrium shapes (bounded by low energy grain boundaries). The multi-mode\ndisconnection model-based predictions are consistent with the molecular\ndynamics results for faceting tendency, kinetic grain shape, and grain rotation\nas a function of misorientation and whether the grains are expanding or\ncontracting. This demonstrates that grain boundary migration and associated\ngrain rotation are mediated by disconnection flow along grain boundaries.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lW7DYnm1OteaL8nyxptfccajESQbvpQPdpJD8k5ZHlM","pdfSize":"28622365"}
