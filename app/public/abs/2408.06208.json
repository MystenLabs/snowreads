The key components of the proposed scheme\nare a novel event-triggering mechanism (ETM) and the suitable design of the MHE\ncost function. The main characteristic of our method is that the MHE's\nnonlinear optimization problem is only solved when the ETM triggers the\ntransmission of measured data to the remote state estimator. If no event\noccurs, then the current state estimate results from an open-loop prediction\nusing the system dynamics. Furthermore, we show robust global exponential\nstability of the ET-MHE under a suitable detectability condition. Finally, we\nillustrate the applicability of the proposed method in terms of a nonlinear\nbenchmark example, where we achieved similar estimation performance compared to\nstandard MHE using 86% less computational resources.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
