A variety of applications have\nbeen built with magnetorheological elastomers, such as vibration absorbers,\nactuators, or grippers, showing that this material is promising for soft\nrobotics. In this work, the novel concept of a gripper is proposed, exploring\nthe features of a magnetorheological elastomer and permanent magnet. The\ngripper uses the energy of a permanent magnet to provide a self-closing\ngripping mechanism. The usage of flexible material enables one to hold delicate\nobjects of various shapes. This paper presents the rolling effect of\nmagnetorheological elastomer and permanent magnet, the design process, and the\nfeatures of the soft gripper. The effectiveness of the soft gripper was\nvalidated in a series of experiments that involved lifting different objects.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
