This system creates a marketplace where\nbushfire management authorities obtain essential data from drone operators. Key\nfeatures include local differential privacy to protect data providers and a\nblockchain-based solution ensuring fair data exchanges and accountability. The\nframework is validated through a proof-of-concept implementation, demonstrating\nits scalability and potential for various large-scale data collection\nscenarios. This approach addresses privacy concerns and compliance with\nregulations like Australia's Privacy Act 1988, offering a practical solution\nfor enhancing bushfire detection and management through crowdsourced drone\nservices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
