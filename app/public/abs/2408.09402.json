Our findings reveal two distinct pair\ncreation channels: the symmetric and asymmetric transition channels. We propose\nthat the asymmetric transition channel arises from the inherent spatial\ninhomogeneity of intense laser pulses. By mapping the field-theoretical model\nof laser-assisted multi-photon pair creation onto a quantum-mechanical\ntime-dependent framework, a semi-analytical solution that captures the\nasymmetric transition signatures of vacuum decay is derived. Additionally, it\nis demonstrated that neglecting spatial inhomogeneity leads to erroneous\ntransition amplitudes and incorrect identification of pair creation channels,\neven when the dipole approximation holds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
