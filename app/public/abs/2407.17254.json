We calculate the energy spectrum and the acceleration time of\nparticles leaving the source as a function of the energy beyond which the\nLorentz invariance violation becomes relevant. Lorentz invariance violation\ncauses significant changes in the acceleration of particles by the first and\nsecond-order Fermi mechanisms. The energy spectrum of particles accelerated by\nfirst-order Fermi mechanism under LIV assumption shows a strong suppression for\nenergies above the break. The calculations presented here complete the scenario\nfor LIV searches with astroparticles by showing, for the first time, how the\nbenchmark acceleration mechanisms (Fermi) are modified under LIV assumption.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
