The group $G$ is called\nquadratic rational if, for every irreducible complex character\n$\\chi\\in{\\rm{Irr}}(G)$, the field ${\\mathbb{Q}}(\\chi)$ is an extension of\n${\\mathbb{Q}}$ of degree at most $2$. Quadratic rational groups have a nice\ncharacterization in terms of the structure of the group of central units in\ntheir integral group ring, and in fact they generalize the well-known concept\nof a cut group (i.e., a finite group whose integral group ring has a finite\ngroup of central units). In this paper we classify the Frobenius groups that\nare quadratic rational, a crucial step in the project of describing the\nGruenberg-Kegel graphs associated to quadratic rational groups. It turns out\nthat every Frobenius quadratic rational group is uniformly semi-rational, i.e.,\nit satisfies the following property: all the generators of any cyclic subgroup\nof $G$ lie in at most two conjugacy classes of $G$, and these classes are\npermuted by the same element of the Galois group\n${\\rm{Gal}}({\\mathbb{Q}}_{|G|}/{\\mathbb{Q}})$ (in general, every cut group is\nuniformly semi-rational, and every uniformly semi-rational group is quadratic\nrational). We will also see that the class of groups here considered coincides\nwith the one studied in [4], thus the main result of this paper also completes\nthe analysis carried out in [4].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
