Specifically,\nwe investigate the problem under bandit feedback and strongly uncoupled\ndynamics, which allows modular development of the multi-player system that\napplies to a wide range of real applications. We propose a mirror-descent-based\nalgorithm, which converges in $O(T^{-1/4})$ and is also no-regret. The result\nis achieved by a dedicated use of two regularizations and the analysis of the\nfixed point thereof. The convergence rate is further improved to $O(T^{-1/2})$\nin the case of strongly monotone games. Motivated by practical tasks where the\ngame evolves over time, the algorithm is extended to time-varying monotone\ngames. We provide the first non-asymptotic result in converging monotone games\nand give improved results for equilibrium tracking games.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"P-TaeFX__wiBbuKD_SrPrXZlxk2OzgB_ekOMiclLBtw","pdfSize":"1071361"}
