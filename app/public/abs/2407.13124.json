It is believed that the distribution of values of\n$\\Lambda_X(s)$ model the distribution of values of the Riemann zeta-function\n$\\zeta(s)$. This principle motivates many avenues of study. Of particular\ninterest is the behavior of $\\Lambda_X'(s)$ and the distribution of its zeros\n(all of which lie inside or on the unit circle). In this article we present\nseveral identities for the moments of $\\Lambda_X'(s)$ averaged over $U(N)$, for\n$x \\in \\mathbb{C}$ as well as specialized to $|x|=1$. Additionally, we prove,\nfor positive integer $k$, that the polynomial $\\int_{U(N)} |\\Lambda_X(1)|^{2k}\ndX$ of degree $k^2$ in $N$ divides the polynomial $\\int_{U(N)}\n|\\Lambda_X'(1)|^{2k} dX$ which is of degree $k^2+2k$ in $N$ and that the ratio,\n$f(N,k)$, of these moments factors into linear factors modulo $4k-1$ if $4k-1$\nis prime. We also discuss the relationship of these moments to a solution of a\nsecond order non-linear Painl\\'{e}ve differential equation. Finally we give\nsome formulas in terms of the $_3F_2$ hypergeometric series for the moments in\nthe simplest case when $N=2$, and also study the radial distribution of the\nzeros of $\\Lambda_X'(s)$ in that case.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
