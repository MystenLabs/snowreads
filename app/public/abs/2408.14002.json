To\nrealize more degrees of light modulation, nonlocal modes, manifested as\nwavelength and momentum selectivity, should be applied into metasurface BS.\nHere, we demonstrate that single nonlocal phase gradient metasurface(NPGM) can\nfunction as a series of independent near-symmetric multiport BS,constructed by\nits momentum-polarization mode subspaces.Then, using any of above BS with\nsimultaneous multiphoton interference, high-photon NOON states are prepared\nwith high success probability and fidelity. For example,four-mode four-photon\nNOON state is obtained with 34.8% success probability and fidelity of 99.9%,\ngreatly higher than those previously reported.With unique capability of\nmultiphoton interference, this multiport BS on single NPGM can be directly used\nin the on-chip quantum photonics. Also, the efficient generation of high-photon\nNOON states with above BS has potential applications in quantum precision\nmeasurement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
