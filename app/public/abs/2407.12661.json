However, complex indoor scenes pose challenges\nsuch as ambiguity due to limited observations. Recent implicit surface\nrepresentations, such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) and signed distance\nfunctions (SDFs), employ various geometric priors to resolve the lack of\nobserved information. Nevertheless, their performance heavily depends on the\nquality of the pre-trained geometry estimation models. To ease such dependence,\nwe propose regularizing the geometric modeling by explicitly encouraging the\nmutual information among surface normals of highly correlated scene points. In\nthis way, the geometry learning process is modulated by the second-order\ncorrelations from noisy (first-order) geometric priors, thus eliminating the\nbias due to poor generalization. Additionally, we introduce a simple yet\neffective scheme that utilizes semantic and geometric features to identify\ncorrelated points, enhancing their mutual information accordingly. The proposed\ntechnique can serve as a plugin for SDF-based neural surface representations.\nOur experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed in improving the\nsurface reconstruction quality of major states of the arts.
