The cases of\nparabolic cylinder functions and modified Bessel functions have been discussed\nwith considerable detail in the literature, and we give a brief account of\nthese results, completing some aspects in the case of parabolic cylinder\nfunctions. Different techniques for obtaining these bounds are considered. They\nare all based on simple qualitative descriptions of the solutions of associated\nODEs (mainly Riccati equations, but not only Riccati). In spite of their\nsimplicity, they provide the most accurate global bounds known so far. We also\nprovide examples of application of these ideas to the more general cases of the\nKummer confluent function and the Gauss hypergeometric function. The function\nratios described in this paper are important functions appearing in a large\nnumber of applications, in which simple approximations are very often required.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
