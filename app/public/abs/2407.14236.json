{"id":"2407.14236","title":"A slight improvement on the Ball-Rivoal theorem","authors":"Li Lai","authorsParsed":[["Lai","Li",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Fri, 19 Jul 2024 12:03:07 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-07-22","timestamp":1721390587000,"abstract":"  We prove that the dimension of the $\\mathbb{Q}$-linear span of\n$1,\\zeta(3),\\zeta(5),\\ldots,\\zeta(s-1)$ is at least $1.009 \\cdot \\log s/(1+\\log\n2)$ for any sufficiently large even integer $s$ and we claim that the constant\n$1.009$ can be improved further to $1.108$. This slightly refines a well-known\nresult of Rivoal (2000) or Ball-Rivoal (2001). Quite unexpectedly, the proof\nonly involves inserting the arithmetic observation of Zudilin (2001) into the\noriginal proof of Ball-Rivoal. Although our result is covered by a recent\ndevelopment of Fischler (2021+), our proof has the advantages of being simple\nand providing explicit non-vanishing small linear forms in $1$ and odd zeta\nvalues.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
