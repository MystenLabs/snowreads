The Paper\nSource Tracing (PST) task seeks to automate the identification of pivotal\nreferences for given scholarly articles utilizing advanced data mining\ntechniques. In the KDD CUP OAG-Challenge PST track, we design a\nrecommendation-based framework tailored for the PST task. This framework\nemploys the Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) model to generate final\npredictions. To process the textual attributes of the papers and extract input\nfeatures for the model, we utilize SciBERT, a pre-trained language model.\nAccording to the experimental results, our method achieved a score of 0.37814\non the Mean Average Precision (MAP) metric, outperforming baseline models and\nranking 11th among all participating teams.
