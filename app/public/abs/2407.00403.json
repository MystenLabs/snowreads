Thakur introduced multiple zeta values in\nthe arithmetic of positive characteristic function fields, and the definition\ndepends on the field of constants of the chosen function field. Using\nPapanikolas' theory on the relationship between the $t$-motivic Galois group\nand the periods of a pre-$t$-motive, we show that there exist no algebraic\nrelations which relate multiple zeta values with different constants field.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
