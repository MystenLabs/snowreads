In particular, we provide combinatorial formulas for the\ndegree of the $h$-polynomial for various fundamental classes of graphs such as\npaths, cycles, and bipartite graphs. To the best of our knowledge, this marks\nthe first investigation into the combinatorial interpretation of this algebraic\ninvariant. Additionally, we characterize all connected graphs in which the sum\nof the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity and the degree of the $h$-polynomial of\nan edge ideal reaches its maximum value, which is the number of vertices in the\ngraph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
