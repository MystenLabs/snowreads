For homogeneous spacetimes, the\neffective dynamics agree with the standard results of loop quantum cosmology,\nwhile the equations for static solutions give an effective\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation. There exist solutions to the effective\nTolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation that have a mass of the order of the Planck\nmass, a Planckian radius, and no horizon; these miniature stars could\npotentially contribute to dark matter, and could be an end state for an\nevaporating black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
