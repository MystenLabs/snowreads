Despite the success of existing object\ndetection models, they are often evaluated in ideal scenarios where captured\nimages guarantee the accurate and complete representation of the detecting\nscenes. However, images captured by image sensors may be affected by different\nfactors in real applications, including cyber-physical attacks. In particular,\nattackers can exploit hardware properties within the systems to inject\nelectromagnetic interference so as to manipulate the images. Such attacks can\ncause noisy or incomplete information about the captured scene, leading to\nincorrect detection results, potentially granting attackers malicious control\nover critical functions of the systems. This paper presents a research work\nthat comprehensively quantifies and analyzes the impacts of such attacks on\nstate-of-the-art object detection models in practice. It also sheds light on\nthe underlying reasons for the incorrect detection outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
