Modern TDI cameras can control image integration frequency during\nimaging operation, adding an additional degree of freedom (DOF) to the imaging\noperation. On the other hand, modern agile EOS is capable of imaging\nnon-parallel ground targets, which require a substantial amount of angular\nvelocity and angular acceleration during operation. We leverage this DOF to\nminimize various factors impacting image quality, such as angular velocity.\nInitially, we derive analytic expressions for angular velocity based on\nkinematic equations. These expressions are then used to formulate a constrained\noptimal control problem (OCP), which we solve using differential dynamic\nprogramming (DDP). We validate our approach through testing and comparison with\nreference methods across various practical scenarios. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that our proposed method efficiently achieves near-optimal\nsolutions without encountering non-convergence issues.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xV-TR4GXAkNqoblQxnivIMphK-Nr3i_-YyHVPwt6xqc","pdfSize":"1904942"}
