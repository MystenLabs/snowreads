The algebra $P_k$ is\nconsidered as a module over the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\\mathcal A$. In 1989,\nSinger [22] defined the $k$-th homological algebraic transfer, which is a\nhomomorphism $$\\varphi_k :{\\rm Tor}^{\\mathcal A}_{k,k+d} (\\mathbb F_2,\\mathbb\nF_2) \\to (\\mathbb F_2\\otimes_{\\mathcal A}P_k)_d^{GL_k}$$ from the homological\ngroup of the mod-2 Steenrod algebra $\\mbox{Tor}^{\\mathcal A}_{k,k+d} (\\mathbb\nF_2,\\mathbb F_2)$ to the subspace $(\\mathbb F_2\\otimes_{\\mathcal\nA}P_k)_d^{GL_k}$ of $\\mathbb F_2{\\otimes}_{\\mathcal A}P_k$ consisting of all\nthe $GL_k$-invariant classes of degree $d$.\n  In this paper, by using the results of the Peterson hit problem we present\nthe proof of the fact that the Singer algebraic transfer of rank five is an\nisomorphism in the internal degrees $d= 20$ and $d = 30$. Our result refutes\nthe proof for the case of $d=20$ in Ph\\'uc [17].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
