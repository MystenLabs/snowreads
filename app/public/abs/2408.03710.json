At first, we obtain the field equations form which a\ntotal constant along the radial coordinate $r$ is deduced. Since we cannot\nsolve the solutions exactly, so we investigate their asymptotic behaviors at\nthe horizon and at the infinity. We attain the conserved and thermodynamic\nquantities such as temperature, angular velocity, entropy, the energy and the\nangular momentum densities of the rotating quartic quasitopological Lifshitz\ndilaton black brane. By evaluating the total constant at the horizon and the\ninfinity, we can make a relation between the thermodynamic quantities and so\nget to a Smarr-type formula. We demonstrate that the thermodynamic quantities\nof this rotating black brane obey the first law of the thermodynamics. We also\nstudy the thermal stability of the rotating quartic quasitopological Lifshitz\ndilaton black brane and it is not thermally stable.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8aclgxAWDWp_3hABLf5Vkz5gQL8day6FVMdQ1YksVcY","pdfSize":"203017"}
