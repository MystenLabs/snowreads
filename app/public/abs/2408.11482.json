This approach relies on proving\nthe linear independence between some functions depending on the observations\nand its derivatives. In particular, we show that, in some cases, only low-order\nderivatives are necessary, opposed to classical approaches that need more\nderivation. We also provide different constructive procedures to retrieve the\nunknowns, which are based on the resolution of some linear systems. Moreover,\nunder some analytic conditions, these unknowns may be retrieved with very few\ndata. We finally apply this approach to some illustrative examples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
