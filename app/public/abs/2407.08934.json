Our\nframework aims to shed light on the emergence of structural patterns in data\nrepresentations, a phenomenon widely acknowledged but arguably still lacking a\nsolid formal grounding. Specifically, we introduce a characterization of\ncompositional structures in terms of \"interaction decompositions,\" and we\nestablish necessary and sufficient conditions for the presence of such\nstructures within the representations of a model.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
