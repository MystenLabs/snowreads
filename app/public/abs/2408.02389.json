Such a centrality measure quantifies the\nimportance of the vertices in a network during a contagious process. In this\npaper, we present a randomized approximation algorithm that can compute\nprobabilistically guaranteed high-quality percolation centrality estimates,\ngeneralizing techniques used by Pellegrina and Vandin (TKDD 2024) for the\nbetweenness centrality. The estimation obtained by our algorithm is within\n$\\varepsilon$ of the value with probability at least $1-\\delta$, for fixed\nconstants $\\varepsilon,\\delta \\in (0,1)$. We our theoretical results with an\nextensive experimental analysis on several real-world networks and provide\nempirical evidence that our algorithm improves the current state of the art in\nspeed, and sample size while maintaining high accuracy of the percolation\ncentrality estimates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
