The centralizer of $x$ in $\\overline{W}$ is the special case\n$\\operatorname{C}(x,x)$. The key structure in our description of the conjugacy\nclass $[x]$ is the mod-set ${Mod}_{\\overline{W}}(w) =\n(w-\\operatorname{I})R^\\vee$, where~$w$ is the finite part of $x$ and $R^\\vee$\nis the coroot lattice. The coconjugation set $\\operatorname{C}(x,x')$ is then\ndescribed by ${Mod}_{\\overline{W}}(w')$ together with the fix-set of $w'$,\nwhere $w'$ is the finite part of $x'$. For any element $w$ of the associated\nfinite Weyl group $W$, the mod-set of $w$ is contained in the classical\nmove-set ${Mov}(w) = \\operatorname{Im}(w - \\operatorname{I})$. We prove that\nthe rank of ${Mod}_{\\overline{W}}(w)$ equals the dimension of ${Mov}(w)$, and\nthen further investigate type-by-type the surprisingly subtle structure of the\n$\\mathbb{Z}$-module ${Mod}_\\overline{W}(w)$. As corollaries, we determine\nexactly when ${Mod}_{\\overline{W}}(w) = {Mov}(w) \\cap R^\\vee$, in which case\nour closed-form descriptions of conjugacy classes and coconjugation sets are as\nsimple as possible.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
