A Si waveguide (WG)\nphotodetector (PD) based on defect-mediated photodetection is a promising\ncandidate for a transparent in-line optical power monitor owing to its\nsimplicity and ease of integration with a fully complementary\nmetal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible process. Here, we propose a simple\noptical power monitoring scheme for a 2$\\times$2 Mach$\\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder\ninterferometer (MZI) optical switch based on InGaAsP/Si hybrid MOS optical\nphase shifters. In the proposed scheme, a low-doped p-type Si WG PD with a\nresponse time of microseconds is utilized as a transparent in-line optical\npower monitor and the ground terminal of the MOS optical phase shifter is\nshared with that of the Si WG PD to enable the simple monitoring of the output\noptical power of the MZI. Based on this scheme, we experimentally demonstrate\nthat the output optical power of a 2$\\times$2 MZI can be simply monitored by\napplying a bias voltage to the Si slabs formed at the output WGs of the MZI\nwithout excess optical insertion loss.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
