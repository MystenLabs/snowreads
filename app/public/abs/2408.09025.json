It consists of a\ntwo-part investigation into online Quantum Game Jams. The first part involves\nexamining three events that took place between 2020 and 2021. The second part\nprovides a detailed account of organising the Global Quantum Game Jam from 2021\nto 2022, evaluating its outcomes based on participant feedback and experiences.\nAdditionally, it examines the backgrounds of the participants in the global\nevents of 2021 and 2022. Based on the findings, this paper proposes a set of\nguidelines for organising future online Quantum Game Jams, which can also be\napplicable to game jams and science game jams in general\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Ph06ysaZSB4dr8CRDPDZsdPDTC8E2xLbDHT03y9OnKQ","pdfSize":"757093"}
