For an open compact subgroup $\\mathcal{U}$\nof $G$ and a unital commutative ring $k$, we let $\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathcal{U}}$\ndenote the space of compactly supported $k$-valued functions on\n$G/\\mathcal{U}$. Building on work of Ollivier--Schneider, we investigate the\ngraded $\\textrm{Ext}$-algebra $E_{\\mathcal{U}}^* :=\n\\textrm{Ext}_G^*(\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathcal{U}},\\mathbf{X}_{\\mathcal{U}})^{\\textrm{op}}$.\nIn particular, we describe the Yoneda product, an involutive anti-automorphism,\nand (when $k$ is a field of characteristic $p$ and $\\mathcal{U}$ has no\n$p$-torsion) a duality operation. We allow for the reductive group to be\nnon-split, and for the open compact subgroup $\\mathcal{U}$ to be non-pro-$p$.\n  Specializing further to the case $G = \\textrm{SL}_2(\\mathbb{Q}_p)$ with $p\n\\geq 5$ and a coefficient field of characteristic $p$, we obtain more precise\nresults when $\\mathcal{U}$ is equal to an Iwahori subgroup $J$ or a\nhyperspecial maximal compact subgroup $K$. In particular, we compute the\nstructure of $E_J^*$ as an $E_J^0$-bimodule, obtain an explicit description of\nthe center $\\mathcal{Z}(E_J^*)$ of $E_J^*$, and construct a surjective morphism\nof algebras $\\mathcal{Z}(E_J^*) \\longrightarrow E_K^*$ (analogous to the\ncompatibility between Bernstein and Satake isomorphisms in characteristic 0).\nFrom this we deduce the (somewhat surprising) fact that $E_K^*$ is not\ngraded-commutative, contrary to what happens for almost all $\\ell$-modular\ncharacteristics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
