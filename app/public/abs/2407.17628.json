While recent approaches to unsupervised\nobject localization have demonstrated significant progress by leveraging\nself-supervised visual representations, they often require computationally\nintensive training processes, resulting in high resource demands in terms of\ncomputation, learnable parameters, and data. They also lack explicit modeling\nof visual context, potentially limiting their accuracy in object localization.\nTo tackle these challenges, we propose a single-stage learning framework,\ndubbed PEEKABOO, for unsupervised object localization by learning context-based\nrepresentations at both the pixel- and shape-level of the localized objects\nthrough image masking. The key idea is to selectively hide parts of an image\nand leverage the remaining image information to infer the location of objects\nwithout explicit supervision. The experimental results, both quantitative and\nqualitative, across various benchmark datasets, demonstrate the simplicity,\neffectiveness and competitive performance of our approach compared to\nstate-of-the-art methods in both single object discovery and unsupervised\nsalient object detection tasks.
