However, the role of 1-form symmetries in Projected Entangled-Pair\nStates (PEPS), two-dimensional tensor network states, remains largely\nunderexplored. We present a novel framework for understanding 1-form symmetries\nwithin tensor networks, specifically focusing on the derivation of algebraic\nrelations for symmetry matrices on the PEPS virtual legs. Our results reveal\nthat 1-form symmetries impose stringent constraints on tensor network\nrepresentations, leading to distinct anomalous braiding phases carried by\nsymmetry matrices. We demonstrate how these symmetries influence the ground\nstate and tangent space in PEPS, providing new insights into their physical\nimplications for enhancing ground state optimization efficiency and\ncharacterizing the 1-form symmetry structure in excited states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
