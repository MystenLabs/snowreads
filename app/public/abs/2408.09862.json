By using suitable virial functionals, we are able\nto characterize the nonexistence of breather solutions, different from standing\nwaves, by only using their inner energy and the power of the corresponding\nnonlinearity of the equation. We extend this result for several NLS models with\ndifferent power nonlinearities and even the derivative and logarithmic NLS\nequations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
