This\npaper highlights the security dimensions of UWB technology, focusing in\nparticular on the intricacies of device fingerprinting for authentication,\nexamined through the lens of state-of-the-art deep learning techniques.\nFurthermore, we explore various potential enhancements to the UWB standard that\ncould realize a sovereign UWB data network. We argue that UWB data\ncommunication holds significant potential in healthcare and ultra-secure\nenvironments, where the use of the common unlicensed 2.4~GHz band-centric\nwireless technology is limited or prohibited. A sovereign UWB network could\nserve as an alternative, providing secure localization and short-range data\ncommunication in such environments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
