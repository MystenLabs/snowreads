In this work, we focus on a fundamental visual feature within the\nmammalian retina, Object Motion Sensitivity (OMS). Using DVS data from EV-IMO\ndataset, we analyze the performance of an algorithmic implementation of OMS\ncircuitry for motion segmentation in presence of ego-motion. This holistic\nanalysis considers the underlying constraints arising from the hardware circuit\nimplementation. We present novel CMOS circuits that implement OMS functionality\ninside image sensors, while providing run-time re-configurability for key\nalgorithmic parameters. In-sensor technologies for dynamical environment\nadaptation are crucial for ensuring high system performance. Finally, we verify\nthe functionality and re-configurability of the proposed CMOS circuit designs\nthrough Cadence simulations in 180nm technology. In summary, the presented work\nlays foundation for hardware-algorithm re-engineering of known biological\ncircuits to suit application needs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
