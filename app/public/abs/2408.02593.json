This approach has been\ngeneralized to higher non-abelian bundles with connection through transport\nfunctors and higher holonomies, at least in dimension two and partially in\ndimension three. In this thesis, we introduce a new variant of thin homotopy\nbased on the definition of skeletal diffeologies introduced recently by Kihara\nand show that, in the abelian setting, ordinary differential cohomology can be\ncompletely recovered in terms of the homotopy theory of skeletal diffeological\nspaces. Specifically, to any smooth manifold and non-negative integer $k$, we\nassociate a $k$-skeletal simplicial presheaf such that its $k$th cohomology\nwith values in the circle group is isomorphic to the abelian group of\nCheeger-Simons differential characters. Further, we relate these higher\nholonomies to the only other existing model in the literature, developed by\nGajer based on the geometric loop group. The main motivation for us is to\nprovide a model where the differential refinement is established by refining\nthe underlying space, rather than the coefficient object. This has the\nadvantage of possible generalizations to non-abelian differential cohomology.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
