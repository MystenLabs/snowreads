Many studies focus on improving the\nperformance of the relevance model in search system. Recently, pre-trained\nlanguage models like BERT have achieved promising performance on the text\nrelevance task. While these models perform well on the offline test dataset,\nthere are still obstacles to deploy the pre-trained language model to the\nonline system as their high latency. The two-tower model is extensively\nemployed in industrial scenarios, owing to its ability to harmonize performance\nwith computational efficiency. Regrettably, such models present an opaque\n``black box'' nature, which prevents developers from making special\noptimizations. In this paper, we raise deep Bag-of-Words (DeepBoW) model, an\nefficient and interpretable relevance architecture for Chinese e-commerce. Our\napproach proposes to encode the query and the product into the sparse BoW\nrepresentation, which is a set of word-weight pairs. The weight means the\nimportant or the relevant score between the corresponding word and the raw\ntext. The relevance score is measured by the accumulation of the matched word\nbetween the sparse BoW representation of the query and the product. Compared to\npopular dense distributed representation that usually suffers from the drawback\nof black-box, the most advantage of the proposed representation model is highly\nexplainable and interventionable, which is a superior advantage to the\ndeployment and operation of online search engines. Moreover, the online\nefficiency of the proposed model is even better than the most efficient inner\nproduct form of dense representation ...\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
