We present simulations of the instability using an\nhybrid-Particle-in-Cell approach including Monte Carlo collisions, and\ndemonstrate that the development of the non-resonant mode is associated with\nimportant ion pressure anisotropies in the background plasma. Depending on the\ninitial conditions, the anisotropies may act on the instability by lowering its\ngrowth and trigger secondary micro-instabilities. Introducing collisions with\nneutrals yield a strong reduction of the magnetic field amplification as\npredicted by linear fluid theory. In contrast, Coulomb collisions in fully\nionized plasmas are found to mitigate the self-generated pressure anisotropies\nand promote the growth of the magnetic field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"rzL48mb2QIlAi_6Dju4YWrgPRAKJZZ7yM-J3z4yuE7w","pdfSize":"1289037"}
