In these new domains, robots are mostly employed to improve, in\nsome ways, the work done by humans. So, the need for effective Human-Robot\nTeaming (HRT) capabilities grows. These capabilities usually involve the\ndynamic collaboration between humans and robots at different levels of\ninvolvement, leveraging the strengths of both to efficiently navigate complex\nsituations. Crucial to this collaboration is the ability of robotic systems to\nadjust their level of autonomy to match the needs of the task and the human\nteam members.\n  This paper introduces a system designed to control attention using HRT\nthrough the use of ground robots and augmented reality (AR) technology.\nTraditional methods of controlling attention, such as pointing, touch, and\nvoice commands, sometimes fall short in precision and subtlety. Our system\novercomes these limitations by employing AR headsets to display virtual visual\nmarkers. These markers act as dynamic cues to attract and shift human attention\nseamlessly, irrespective of the robot's physical location.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KYiZLi7WSiioT224CTiJBqruhH_7bcy9JOi_fbcSLQk","pdfSize":"3804955"}
