However, it typically focus on providing generalization bounds with\nrespect to a chosen loss function. In classification tasks, due to the\nnon-convex nature of the 0-1 loss, a convex surrogate loss is often used, and\nthus current PAC-Bayesian bounds are primarily specified for this convex\nsurrogate. This work shifts its focus to providing misclassification excess\nrisk bounds for PAC-Bayesian classification when using a convex surrogate loss.\nOur key ingredient here is to leverage PAC-Bayesian relative bounds in\nexpectation rather than relying on PAC-Bayesian bounds in probability. We\ndemonstrate our approach in several important applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QPDmBOsn75KLxb-heWu4d_a1c5O1jqMFRQK0098GXjA","pdfSize":"209537"}
