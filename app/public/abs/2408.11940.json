The limited availability of qualified reporters and the high costs\nassociated with manual transcription underscore the need for more efficient\nsolutions. This paper examines the potential of Automatic Speech Recognition\n(ASR) systems to assist court reporters in transcribing legal proceedings. We\nbenchmark three ASR models, including commercial and open-source options, on\ntheir ability to recognize French legal speech using a curated dataset. Our\nstudy evaluates the performance of these systems using the Word Error Rate\n(WER) metric and introduces the Sonnex Distance to account for phonetic\naccuracy. We also explore the broader implications of ASR adoption on court\nreporters, copyists, the legal system, and litigants, identifying both positive\nand negative impacts. The findings suggest that while current ASR systems show\npromise, they require further refinement to meet the specific needs of the\nlegal domain.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b22QdUd3DLWpYxeyTA74QS1Qz6vUwUdrUxR-KeOmTss","pdfSize":"161974"}
