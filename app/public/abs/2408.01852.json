In this paper: (1) we propose S\\'olo\nEsc\\'uchame, the first open-source Spanish emotional assistance chatbot, based\non LLaMA-2-7b-Chat. (2) We introduced the HEAR (Hispanic Emotional\nAccompaniment Responses) dataset, compiled from multiple English sources\ntranslated into Spanish, as well as generic data generated using\nChatGPT-3.5-Turbo. Finally, (3) we propose an evaluation metric based on two\nsemi-automatic assessment methods. Our system outperforms a range of\nstate-of-the-art models in providing psychological assistance in Spanish. Our\nmodels and datasets are publicly available to facilitate reproducibility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
