Demand prediction plays an important role in\nsupporting planning, scheduling, fleet management, and other operational\ndecisions. In this study, we propose an Origin-Destination (OD) demand\nprediction model called Multi-Graph Inductive Representation Learning\n(mGraphSAGE) for large-scale URT networks under operational uncertainties. Our\nmain contributions are twofold: we enhance prediction results while ensuring\nscalability for large networks by relying simultaneously on multiple graphs,\nwhere each OD pair is a node on a graph and distinct OD relationships, such as\ntemporal and spatial correlations; we show the importance of including\noperational uncertainties such as train delays and cancellations as inputs in\ndemand prediction for daily operations. The model is validated on three\ndifferent scales of the URT network in Copenhagen, Denmark. Experimental\nresults show that by leveraging information from neighboring ODs and learning\nnode representations via sampling and aggregation, mGraphSAGE is particularly\nsuitable for OD demand prediction in large-scale URT networks, outperforming\nreference machine learning methods. Furthermore, during periods with train\ncancellations and delays, the performance gap between mGraphSAGE and other\nmethods improves compared to normal operating conditions, demonstrating its\nability to leverage system reliability information for predicting OD demand\nunder uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
