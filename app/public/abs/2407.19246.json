Here, using a synergistic\ncombination of experiment and theory, the microporous crystalline\nvanadomolybdates (MoVOx) as highly selective Kr sorbents are studied in detail.\nBy varying the Mo/V ratios, we show for the first time that their\none-dimensional pores can be fine-tuned for the size-selective adsorption of Kr\nover the larger Xe with selectivities reaching >100. Using extensive electronic\nstructure calculations and grand canonical Monte-Carlo simulations, the\ncompetition between Kr uptake with CO2 and N2 was also investigated. As most\nmaterials reported so far are selective toward the larger, more polarizable Xe\nthan Kr, this work constitutes an important step toward robust Kr-selective\nsorbent materials. This work highlights the potential use of porous crystalline\ntransition metal oxides as energy-efficient and selective noble gas capture\nsorbents for industrial applications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
