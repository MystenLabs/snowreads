Although the uncertainty\nrelation is formulated as the sum of variances for unitary operators has been\nconfirmed, its general forms for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators have not\nbeen yet investigated in detail. Thus, this study develops four sum uncertainty\nrelations for arbitrary non-Hermitian operators acting on system states by\nutilizing an appropriate Hilbert-space metric. The compatible forms of our sum\ninequalities with the conventional quantum mechanics are also provided via\n$G$-metric formalism. Concrete examples demonstrate the validity of the\npurposed sum uncertainty relations in both $\\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and\n$\\mathcal{PT}$-broken phases. The proposed methods and results can help the\nreader to understand in-depth the usefulness of $G$-metric formalism in\nnon-Hermitian quantum mechanics and the sum uncertainty relations of\nincompatible operators within.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
