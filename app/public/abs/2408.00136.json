Effective forecasting models are essential for grid\noperators to anticipate the net load - the difference between consumer\nelectrical demand and renewable power generation. This paper proposes a deep\nlearning (DL) model based on long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for net\nload forecasting in renewable-based microgrids, considering both solar and wind\npower. The model's architecture is detailed, and its performance is evaluated\nusing a residential microgrid test case based on a typical meteorological year\n(TMY) dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed\nLSTM-based DL model in predicting the net load, showcasing its potential for\nenhancing energy management in renewable-based microgrids.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
