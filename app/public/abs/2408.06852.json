Analytical\nintegrations for the equations of motion and linear shifts in orbital frequency\nare obtained. As a result, we found that both the nodal precession and the\nperiastron precession become larger when the tidal charge $b$ of brane-world\nspacetime becomes smaller. For the periastron precession, the effect is further\namplified as the spin increases. Our work can potentially be applied to the\nstudy of gravitational waveforms of Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals with spin in\nbrane-world spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PWWoEVZDOCYSW2BxZ1-YtWfHlJ48j8EDIzUkdcKDHt0","pdfSize":"532377"}
