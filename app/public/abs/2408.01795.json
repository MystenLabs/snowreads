As an important support to\npromote the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry, cloud\nservice optimization has received the attention of researchers. In recent\nyears, remarkable research results have been achieved in this field. For the\nsustainability of intelligent manufacturing platforms, in this paper we\nsummarize the process of cloud service optimization for intelligent\nmanufacturing. Further, to address the problems of dispersed optimization\nindicators and nonuniform/unstandardized definitions in the existing research,\n11 optimization indicators that take into account three-party participant\nsubjects are defined from the urgent requirements of the sustainable\ndevelopment of intelligent manufacturing platforms. Next, service optimization\nalgorithms are classified into two categories, heuristic and reinforcement\nlearning. After comparing the two categories, the current key techniques of\nservice optimization are targeted. Finally, research hotspots and future\nresearch trends of service optimization are summarized.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
