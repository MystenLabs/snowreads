This is\na non-proper version of the Shafarevich conjecture. More generally we define a\nclass of subset of the Betti stack for which the covering space trivializing\nthe corresponding local systems has this property. Secondly, we show that for\nany complex local system $V$ on a normal complex algebraic variety $X$ there is\nan algebraic map $f \\colon X\\to Y$ contracting precisely the subvarieties on\nwhich $V$ is isotrivial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O3jqaaHqhw6CH7DsjvIsxLdywjS9JuennoplDsjeXIY","pdfSize":"1642134"}
