A similar result is proved for universally defined cycles on\nproducts of smooth varieties. We also state a conjectural explicit form for\nuniversally defined cycles on powers of smooth varieties, and provide some\nsteps towards establishing it.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
