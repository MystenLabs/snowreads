In this work,\ndynamical structures in phase space are explored for the problem of spin-orbit\ncoupling by taking advantage of analytical and numerical methods. In\nparticular, the technique of Poincar\\'e sections is adopted to reveal numerical\nstructures, which are dependent on the total angular momentum, the Hamiltonian,\nmass ratio and asphericity parameter. Analytical study based on perturbative\ntreatments shows that high-order and/or secondary spin-orbit resonances are\nresponsible for numerical structures arising in Poincar\\'e sections. Analytical\nsolutions are applied to (65803) Didymos, (80218) ${\\rm VO}_{123}$ and (4383)\nSuruga to reveal their phase-space structures, showing that there is a high\npossibility for them to locate inside secondary 1:1 spin-orbit resonance.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
