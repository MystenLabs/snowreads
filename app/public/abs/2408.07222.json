While bioinformatical\ngene function prediction approaches can guide biologists in their experimental\nefforts, neither the performance of the gene function prediction methods nor\nthe number of experimental characterisation of genes has increased dramatically\nin recent years. In this review, we will discuss the status quo and the\ntrajectory of gene function elucidation and outline the recent advances in gene\nfunction prediction approaches. We will then discuss how recent artificial\nintelligence advances in large language models and knowledge graphs can be\nleveraged to accelerate gene function predictions and keep us updated with\nscientific literature.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"soQOKzqcX05MpagS0Kcae6NL6V80wUeQmsI0NYinGrU","pdfSize":"2069241"}
