Droop control is a well know decentralized control\nstrategy for power sharing among converter interfaced sources and loads in a DC\nmicrogrid. This work compares the stability assessment and control of four\ntypes of droops for boost converters using the concept of passivity. EN\nstandard 50388-2 for railway systems provides a reference to ensure system\nstability in perspectives of converters and system integration. Low pass filter\n(LPF) in the feedback of the droop control is used to ensure converter\npassivity. Bus impedance is derived to ensure system passivity with less\nconservativeness. Analytical approach for design of passive controller for all\nfour types of droops is verified through time domain simulations of a single\nboost converter based microgrid feeding a Constant Power Load (CPL).\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
