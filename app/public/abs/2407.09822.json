ISD aims to tackle the over-saturation and\nover-smoothing problems in Score Distillation Sampling (SDS). In this paper,\nSDS is decoupled into a weighted sum of two components: the reconstruction term\nand the classifier-free guidance term. We experimentally found that\nover-saturation stems from the large classifier-free guidance scale and\nover-smoothing comes from the reconstruction term. To overcome these problems,\nISD utilizes an invariant score term derived from DDIM sampling to replace the\nreconstruction term in SDS. This operation allows the utilization of a medium\nclassifier-free guidance scale and mitigates the reconstruction-related errors,\nthus preventing the over-smoothing and over-saturation of results. Extensive\nexperiments demonstrate that our method greatly enhances SDS and produces\nrealistic 3D objects through single-stage optimization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
