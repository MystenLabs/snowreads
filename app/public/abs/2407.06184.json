If $S$ is smooth quasi-projective of dimension $d$\nover a field and $\\pi \\colon X\\to S$ is a $g$-dimensional abelian scheme, we\nprove, under very mild assumptions on $X/S$, that all classical results about\nFourier duality, including the existence of a Beauville decomposition, are\nvalid for the Chow ring $\\mathrm{CH}(X;\\Lambda)$ with coefficients in the ring\n$\\Lambda = \\mathbb{Z}[1/(2g+d+1)!]$. If $X$ admits a polarization $\\theta$ of\ndegree $\\nu(\\theta)^2$ we further construct an $\\mathfrak{sl}_2$-action on\n$\\mathrm{CH}(X;\\Lambda_\\theta)$ with $\\Lambda_\\theta = \\Lambda[1/\\nu(\\theta)]$,\nand we show that $\\mathrm{CH}(X;\\Lambda_\\theta)$ is a sum of copies of the\nsymmetric powers $\\mathrm{Sym}^n(\\mathrm{St})$ of the $2$-dimensional standard\nrepresentation, for $n=0,\\ldots,g$. For an abelian variety over an\nalgebraically closed field, we use our results to produce torsion classes in\n$\\mathrm{CH}^i(X;\\Lambda_\\theta)$ for every $i\\in \\{1,\\ldots,g\\}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
