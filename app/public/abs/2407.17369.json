We compute completions of discrete\ncluster categories with respect to metrics induced by internal t-structures. In\nparticular, for a coaisle metric this yields a new triangulated category which\ncan be interpreted as a topological completion of the associated combinatorial\nmodel. Moreover, we show that the completion of any triangulated category with\nrespect to an internal aisle metric is a thick subcategory of the triangulated\ncategory itself.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
