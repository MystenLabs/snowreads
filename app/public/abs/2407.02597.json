When $\\mathbb{K}$ is algebraically closed, it is\nwell-known that the only invertible fusion category is\n$\\mathrm{Vec}_{\\mathbb{K}}$, and any invertible multi-fusion category is Morita\nequivalent to $\\mathrm{Vec}_{\\mathbb{K}}$. By contrast, we show that for\ngeneral $\\mathbb{K}$ the invertible multi-fusion categories over a field\n$\\mathbb{K}$ are classified (up to Morita equivalence) by\n$H^3(\\mathbb{K};\\mathbb{G}_m)$, the third Galois cohomology of the absolute\nGalois group of $\\mathbb{K}$. We explicitly construct a representative of each\nclass that is fusion (but not split fusion) in the sense that the unit object\nis simple (but not split simple). One consequence of our results is that fusion\ncategories with braided equivalent Drinfeld centers need not be Morita\nequivalent when this cohomology group is nontrivial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aN1CeQD0wcqekRyawXtY6Ia3_gwO9MibnbMsK8Humdc","pdfSize":"613755"}
