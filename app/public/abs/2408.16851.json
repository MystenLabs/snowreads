This brings up to date the previous studies which\nhad become incomplete due to the discovery of new materials. For each material,\nwe performed first-principle electronic calculations and diagnosed the topology\nas a function of the Hubbard U parameter. Our high-throughput calculation led\nus to the prediction of 250 experimentally relevant topologically non-trivial\nmaterials, which represent 47.89% of the newly analyzed materials. We present\nfive remarkable examples of these materials, each showcasing a different\ntopological phase: Mn${}_2$AlB${}_2$ (BCSID 1.508), which exhibits a nodal line\nsemimetal to topological insulator transition as a function of SOC, CaMnSi\n(BCSID 0.599), a narrow gap axion insulator, UAsS (BCSID 0.594) a 5f-orbital\nWeyl semimetal, CsMnF${}_4$ (BCSID 0.327), a material presenting a new type of\nquasi-symmetry protected closed nodal surface and FeCr${}_2$S${}_4$ (BCSID\n0.613), a symmetry-enforced semimetal with double Weyls and spin-polarised\nsurface states.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fjyHFfqqBSJbuZ4MeBu1-AgnBMP_1VsStDPBbVihCDI","pdfSize":"46636583"}
