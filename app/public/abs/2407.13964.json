In this model, the\nsender gathers information over time, and hence her posteriors' sequence forms\na discrete-time martingale. The sender commits to a dynamic revelation policy\nto persuade the agent to adopt a product. We demonstrate that under the\nassumption that the sender's martingale possesses Blackwell-preserving kernels,\nthe family of optimal strategies for the sender takes an interval form; namely,\nin every period the set of martingale realizations in which adoption occurs is\nan interval. Utilizing this, we prove that if the sender is sufficiently\nimpatient, then under a random walk martingale, the optimal policy is fully\ntransparent up to the moment of adoption; namely, the sender reveals the entire\ninformation she privately holds in every period.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KQz0wi4OXPhPWEa5A0B81vIIT1Gl9fEhQ7S5bKq0AfQ","pdfSize":"601969"}
