The\ncolumns appearing in such a tableau correspond to vanishing multiplicities of\ncertain rational functions on Schubert varieties. To build a framework for this\ncorrespondence we generalize Seshadri stratifications to multiprojective\nvarieties, which forms the largest part of this article.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5bTc_uyzeGWQjksIR5s5ifh6MxjvwoJR-_H-AkoQfhk","pdfSize":"640405"}
