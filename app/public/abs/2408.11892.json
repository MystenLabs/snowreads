We\nobtain a perturbative T-duality invariant theory on a double geometry, or\nConformal Double Field Theory (CDFT), incorporating Weyl gravity plus $b$-field\nand dilaton contributions at quadratic order, without the need to impose a\ngauge fixing condition. We also extend the formulation to cubic order for the\ncase of vanishing generalized dilaton, which still incorporates Weyl gravity\nwhen $\\Box h_{\\mu \\nu}=h=0$. CDFT, together with ordinary DFT, are examples of\nT-duality invariant theories constructed through classical DC maps, revealing a\npromising and deep connection between gauge theories and T-duality invariant\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HX_jPOm3B1mPDBrdW-lPKpKXUa4Dg0dXL0zMSez6XNg","pdfSize":"161591"}
