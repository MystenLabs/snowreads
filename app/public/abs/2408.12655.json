As\nmachine learning models become more complicated, this pipeline becomes more\ndifficult to manage effectively. In the physical sciences, there is an\never-increasing pool of metadata that is generated by the scientific research\ncycle. Tracking this metadata can reduce redundant work, improve\nreproducibility, and aid in the feature and training dataset engineering\nprocess. In this case study, we present a tool for machine learning metadata\nmanagement in dynamic radiography. We evaluate the efficacy of this tool\nagainst the initial research workflow and discuss extensions to general machine\nlearning pipelines in the physical sciences.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xgu6xTbFuE2XyG8XfAogccUFO7pAlkXR2VL0enFZJmU","pdfSize":"17125796"}
