In\naddition, tidychangepoint also provides model-fitting procedures for\ncommonly-used parametric models, tools for computing various penalized\nobjective functions, and graphical diagnostic displays. tidychangepoint wraps\nboth deterministic algorithms like PELT, and also flexible, randomized, genetic\nalgorithms that can be used with any compliant model-fitting function and any\npenalized objective function. By bringing all of these disparate tools together\nin a cohesive fashion, tidychangepoint facilitates comparative analysis of\nchangepoint detection algorithms and models.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
