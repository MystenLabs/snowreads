Approaches based on pre-processing\nthe data with a log transform and then solving the resulting linear inverse\nproblem are tempting since they are amenable to convex optimization methods;\nhowever, such methods perform poorly when the underlying image has high dynamic\nrange, as in X-ray imaging of tissue with embedded metal. We show that a\nsuitably initialized subgradient method applied to a natural nonsmooth,\nnonconvex loss function produces iterates that converge to the unknown signal\nof interest at a geometric rate under the statistical model proposed by\nFridovich-Keil et al. (arXiv:2310.03956). Our recovery program enjoys improved\nconditioning compared to the formulation proposed by the latter work, enabling\nfaster iterative reconstruction from substantially fewer samples.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
