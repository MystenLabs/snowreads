We examine\nsituations with simple relationships between the distinct and degenerate\nstresses, finding a closed form parameterizations for the case where the\ndistinct stress is equal to zero and finding new conditions in which the case\nwith all stresses equal has a closed form parameterization. We also use\nnumerical methods to illustrate possible behaviors for the case where the\ndistinct stress is the negative of the degenerate stresses.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0JUj99vPrvizIKByLT4nCu2kC1OnICn8NNKlUWuP_aM","pdfSize":"1645639","txDigest":"41LxMJBgW8mi8pkhABdvTVCq8asYwuU84ah7m5tyzv3q","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
