For certain totally disconnected locally compact groups\nacting on buildings, we establish and collect several results concerning, for\nexample, the rational discrete cohomological dimension (cf. Thm. A), the\nflat-rank (cf. Thm. C) and the number of ends (cf. Cor. K). Moreover, for an\narbitrary compactly generated totally disconnected locally compact group, we\nexpress the number of ends in terms of its cohomology groups (cf. Thm. J).\nFurthermore, generalising a result of F. Haglund and F. Paulin, we prove that\nvisual graph of groups decompositions of a Coxeter group $(W,S)$ can be used to\nconstruct trees from buildings of type $(W,S)$. We exploit the latter result to\nshow that all $\\sigma$-compact totally disconnected locally compact groups\nacting chamber-transitively on buildings can be decomposed accordingly to any\nvisual graph of groups decomposition of the type $(W,S)$ (cf. Thm. F and Cor.\nG).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
