The implementation of security\nmeasures such as anonymization is thus needed to protect individuals' privacy.\nOften, a trade-off arises as such techniques potentially decrease the utility\nof the data and limit its use. While much research on anonymization techniques\nexists, there is little information on the actual implementations by\npractitioners, especially outside the big tech context. Within our study, we\nconducted expert interviews to gain insights into practices in the field. We\ncategorize purposes, data sources, analysis, and modeling tasks to provide a\nprofound understanding of the context such data is used in. We survey\nprivacy-enhancing methods in use, which generally do not comply with\nstate-of-the-art standards of differential privacy. We provide groundwork for\nfurther research on practice-oriented research by identifying privacy needs of\npractitioners and extracting relevant mobility characteristics for future\nstandardized evaluations of privacy-enhancing methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"F5ChLTOZqLwNwIldvXg38mrElARuVAqCWBGyXmsNMmU","pdfSize":"418213"}
