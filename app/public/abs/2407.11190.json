We argue that LLMs can serve as a\nvaluable tool for sociological inquiry by enabling accurate simulation of\nrespondents from specific social and cultural contexts. Applying LLMs in this\ncapacity, we reconstruct the public opinion landscape of 2019 to examine the\nextent to which the future polarization over COVID-19 was prefigured in\nexisting political discourse. Using an LLM trained on texts published through\n2019, we simulate the responses of American liberals and conservatives to a\nbattery of pandemic-related questions. We find that the simulated respondents\nreproduce observed partisan differences in COVID-19 attitudes in 84% of cases,\nsignificantly greater than chance. Prompting the simulated respondents to\njustify their responses, we find that much of the observed partisan gap\ncorresponds to differing appeals to freedom, safety, and institutional trust.\nOur findings suggest that the politicization of COVID-19 was largely consistent\nwith the prior ideological landscape, and this unprecedented event served to\nadvance history along its track rather than change the rails.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"bEL5Ti_TchuM0ofGW40q-19sgq5dDkYVBoPLTG7rdTo","pdfSize":"8594637"}
