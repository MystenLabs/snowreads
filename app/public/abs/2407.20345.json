In particular, it may be the case that a suitable\naverage of the speed of sound squared exceeds the so-called conformal limit,\ni.e., $\\langle c_s^2 \\rangle > 1/3$, a condition that is equivalent to the\npositiveness of the trace of the energy-momentum tensor at the stellar center.\nThis property, that holds for highly compact neutron stars obeying many (but\nnot any) realistic equations of state, would turn these objects into\ninteresting laboratories for tests of several scalar extensions of general\nrelativity. In this paper, we investigate how rapid rotation influences the\nsuperconformality of the averaged speed of sound squared and modified gravity\neffects that depend thereupon, paying particular attention to scalar-tensor\ntheories prone to the spontaneous scalarization effect.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
