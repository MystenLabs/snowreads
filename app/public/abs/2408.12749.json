They are predicted to emerge as zero-energy modes localized at\nthe boundary of a topological superconductor. No intrinsic topological\nsuperconductor is known to date. However, by interfacing conventional\nsuperconductors and semiconductors with strong spin--orbit coupling it is\npossible to create a system hosting topological states. Hence epitaxial\nsuperconductors and semiconductors have emerged as an attractive materials\nsystem with atomically sharp interfaces and broad flexibility in device\nfabrications incorporating Josephson junctions. We discuss the basics of\ntopological superconductivity and provide insight on how to go beyond current\nstate-of-the-art experiments. We argue that the ultimate success in realizing\nMBS physics requires the observation of non-Abelian braiding and fusion\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
