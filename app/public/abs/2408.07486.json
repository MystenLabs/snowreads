First,\nwe extract a feature map for a current frame and detect a latent mask for\nobstacles occluding lanes. Then, we enhance the feature map by developing an\nocclusion-aware memory-based refinement (OMR) module. It takes the obstacle\nmask and feature map from the current frame, previous output, and memory\ninformation as input, and processes them recursively in a video. Moreover, we\napply a novel data augmentation scheme for training the OMR module effectively.\nExperimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing\ntechniques on video lane datasets.
