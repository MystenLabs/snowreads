We\nexplore the influence of model parameters on several characteristics of the\nMCG-motivated charged AdS black hole (MCG-AdSBH), including the geodesic\nstructure and some astrophysical phenomena such as null trajectories, shadow\nsilhouettes, light deflection angles, and the determination of greybody bounds.\nWe then discuss how the model parameters affect the Hawking temperature,\nremnant radius, and evaporation process of the MCG-AdSBH. Quasinormal modes are\nalso investigated using the eikonal approximation method. Constraints on the\nMCG-AdSBH parameters are derived from EHT observations of M87* and Sgr A*,\nsuggesting that MCG-AdSBH could be strong candidates for astrophysical black\nhole.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
