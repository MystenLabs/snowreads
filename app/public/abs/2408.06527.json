However, how to employ strategies, a set of motivational interviewing\n(MI) skills, to generate therapeutic-adherent conversations with explainability\nis underexplored. We propose an approach called strategy-aware dialogue\ngeneration with Chain-of-Strategy (CoS) planning, which first predicts MI\nstrategies as reasoning and utilizes these strategies to guide the subsequent\ndialogue generation. It brings the potential for controllable and explainable\ngeneration in psychotherapy by aligning the generated MI dialogues with\ntherapeutic strategies. Extensive experiments including automatic and human\nevaluations are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the MI strategy. Our\nfindings demonstrate the potential of LLMs in producing strategically aligned\ndialogues and suggest directions for practical applications in\npsychotherapeutic settings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
