The dog-agents continuously scan the environment and compute a\nsafe trajectory to guide the sheep to their final destination. The proposed\noptimization-based controller guarantees that the sheep reside within a desired\ndistance from the reference trajectory through the use of Control Barrier\nFunctions (CBF). Additional CBF constraints are employed simultaneously to\nensure inter-agent and obstacle collision avoidance. The efficacy of the\nproposed approach is rigorously tested in simulation, which demonstrates the\nsuccessful herding of the robotic-sheep within complex and cluttered\nenvironments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UY_jeSJwcGaJ6nSPLAq5EOErj7YGZa_2cIS1jZBr8Yw","pdfSize":"2690175"}
