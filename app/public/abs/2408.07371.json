This work\nstudied the survival probabilities of compound superheavy nuclei after multiple\nneutron emissions based on microscopic energy dependent fission barriers,\ndemonstrating a significant role of triaxial deformation in decreasing the\nfirst fission barriers in the heaviest region. Together with the fusion cross\nsections by the dinuclear system model, the optimal energy and the residual\ncross section of $^{243}$Am($^{48}$Ca, 3$n$)$^{288}$Mc are reproduced. Finally\nthe cross sections and optimal beam energies of $^{243}$Am+$^{54}$Cr and\n$^{249}$Bk+$^{50}$Ti reactions are estimated, providing clues for the synthesis\nof new elements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
