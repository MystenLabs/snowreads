Here, the\nrelativistic Schwarzschild geometry is mimicked by the Paczy{\\'n}sky-Wiita\npotential. We investigated two types of inflowing gases that can generate\ndifferent kinds of accretion flows around the central objects. The inflowing\ngases are presented on the local energies ($B_{ob}$) of the gases versus the\noutermost accretion boundary locations ($r_{ob}$) plane we named it the\noutermost boundary condition (OBC)-plane. Based on the energies of the\ninflowing gases we found two types of inflowing gas classified as cold-mode and\nhot-mode inflowing gases in the OBC-plane. Doing so we have found the initial\ntemperature of the inflowing gases can be a parameter for the study of the\naccretion process. As it can affect the disk structure and optical depth of the\naccretion flow, which in turn can impact the radiative emissions observed in\nmany accreting sources.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
