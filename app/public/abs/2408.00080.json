We find an EW - stellar mass anti-correlation with\nsteepening slopes $-0.18\\pm0.03$ to $-0.24^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ at $z \\sim 0.4$ and\n$z\\sim 2.2$, respectively. Typical EW increases as\n$(1+z)^{1.78^{+0.22}_{-0.23}}$ for a $10^{10}$ M$_\\odot$ emitter from\n$15^{+2.4}_{-2.3}$\\r{A} ($z \\sim 0.4$) to $67.7^{+10.4}_{-10.0}$\\r{A} ($z \\sim\n2.2$) and is steeper with decreasing stellar mass highlighting the high EW\nnature of low-mass high-$z$ systems. We model this redshift evolving\nanti-correlation, $W_0(M,z)$, and find it produces H$\\alpha$ luminosity and SFR\nfunctions strongly consistent with observations validating the model and\nallowing us to use $W_0(M,z)$ to investigate the relative contribution of\nH$\\alpha$ emitters towards cosmic SF. We find EW$_0 > 200$ \\r{A} emitters\ncontribute significantly to cosmic SF activity at $z \\sim 1.5 - 2$ making up\n$\\sim 40$% of total SF consistent with sSFR $> 10^{-8.5}$ yr$^{-1}$ ($\\sim 45 -\n55$%). Overall, this highlights the importance of high EW systems at high-$z$.\nOur $W_0(M,z)$ model also reproduces the cosmic sSFR evolution found in\nsimulations and observations and show that tension between the two can simply\narise from selection effects in observations. Lastly, we forecast Roman and\nEuclid grism surveys using $W_0(M,z)$ including observational efficiency and\nlimiting resolution effects where we predict $\\sim 24000$ and $\\sim 30000$ $0.5\n< z < 1.9$ H$\\alpha$ emitters per deg$^{-2}$, respectively, down to\n$>5\\times10^{-17}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ including $10^{7.2 - 8}$ M$_\\odot$\ngalaxies at $z > 1$ with EW$_0 >1000$\\r{A}. Both Roman and Euclid will enable\nus to observe with unprecedented detail some of the most bursty/high EW,\nlow-mass star-forming galaxies near cosmic noon.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
