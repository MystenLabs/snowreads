First, a\nclass of dynamic output feedback controllers are designed to stabilize the\nswitched system with measurable system outputs. Considering the improvement of\ntransient performance, the bumpless transfer control and finite-time control\nare further studied in the controller design. To avoid the control bumps, a\npractical filter is introduced to make the control signal smoother and\ncontinuous. Furthermore, to derive a finite-time bounded system state over\nshort-time intervals, the finite-time analysis is considered in managing the\nswitching process with the average dwell time. New criteria are proposed to\nanalyze the finite-time stability and finite-time boundedness for the\nclosed-loop system and solvable conditions are newly proposed to optimize the\ncontroller gain. Finally, the superiorities of the proposed method are\nvalidated through an application to a boost converter.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
