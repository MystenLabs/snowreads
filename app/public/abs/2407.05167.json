We show that in a range of cases,\nthe cohomology is a free module over the cohomology of the structure sheaf and\nthat the space of generators is an irreducible representation of the general\nlinear supergroup that can be constructed via explicit multilinear operations.\nOur techniques come from commutative algebra: we relate this cohomology\ncalculation to Tor groups of certain algebraic varieties.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
