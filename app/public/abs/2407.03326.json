To overcome this\nlimitation, we propose a new framework for the RPS method that utilizes a\ngeneral integral transform. This framework incorporates an explicit formula for\ncalculating coefficients, thereby eliminating repetitive computations and\nstreamlining the solution process. Moreover, it offers a universally applicable\napproach, remaining compatible with various RPS methods that employ\nLaplace-like transform variants.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
