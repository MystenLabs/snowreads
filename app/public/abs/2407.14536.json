While individual CFPs have been studied extensively in individual\ncomputational models, a unified approach to solving general CFPs in multiple\ncomputational models has been lacking. Against this background, we present the\nshell-decomposition algorithm, a model-agnostic meta-algorithm that efficiently\ncomputes a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation to CFPs for a broad class of forest\nfunctions. To demonstrate the power and flexibility of this result, we\ninstantiate our algorithm for 3 fundamental, NP-hard CFPs in 3 different\ncomputational models. For example, for constant $\\epsilon$, we obtain the\nfollowing $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximations in the Congest model:\n  1. For Steiner Forest specified via input components, where each node knows\nthe identifier of one of $k$ disjoint subsets of $V$, we achieve a\ndeterministic $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\\sqrt{n}+D+k)$ rounds, where\n$D$ is the hop diameter of the graph.\n  2. For Steiner Forest specified via symmetric connection requests, where\nconnection requests are issued to pairs of nodes, we leverage randomized\nequality testing to reduce the running time to $O(\\sqrt{n}+D)$, succeeding with\nhigh probability.\n  3. For Point-to-Point Connection, we provide a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation\nin $O(\\sqrt{n}+D)$ rounds.\n  4. For Facility Placement and Connection, a relative of non-metric Facility\nLocation, we obtain a $(2+\\epsilon)$-approximation in $O(\\sqrt{n}+D)$ rounds.\n  We further show how to replace the $\\sqrt{n}+D$ term by the complexity of\nsolving Partwise Aggregation, achieving (near-)universal optimality in any\nsetting in which a solution to Partwise Aggregation in near-shortcut-quality\ntime is known.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
