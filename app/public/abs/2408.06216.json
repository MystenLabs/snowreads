This versatility\nalso extends to the modes available to the instrument, such as Neutron Resonant\nSpin Echo, Spin Echo (Modulated) Small Angle Neutron Scattering and coherent\naveraging to produce structured wavefunctions for scattering. The instrument\nmay also be used as an interferometer, to probe fundamental questions in\nquantum mechanics. In this paper we detail both the continuous and Time of\nFlight options of the instruments. In addition we demonstrate the applicability\nof our interferometer to ultra small angle scattering in a white beam. Finally\nwe demonstrate a new spin echo interferometry tool, which uses incomplete\nrecombination of the two path states to generate composite wavefunctions with\nspecial structure. In particular we show that this method produces neutron\nwavefunctions that exist in a superposition of two quantum mechanical OAM\nmodes, l =+1 or -1 We illustrate that just as this method can be used to\ngenerate certain structured waves, it may also be used to characterize the\nstructure of the input wavefunction.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
