Time-resolved spectral\nanalysis of the prompt $\\gamma$-ray emission was conducted utilizing the\nBayesian block method to determine statistically optimal time bins. Based on\nthe Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), the data generally favor the\nBand+Blackbody (short as BB) model. We speculate that the main Band component\ncomes from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, while the additional BB component\ncomes from the neutrino annihilation process. The BB component becomes\nsignificant for a low-spin, high-accretion rate black hole central engine, as\nevidenced by our model comparison with the data. The afterglow light curve\nexhibits typical power-law decay, and its behavior can be explained by the\ncollision between the ejecta and constant interstellar medium (ISM). Model\nfitting yields the following parameters: $E_{K,iso} =\n(2.04^{+11.8}_{-1.50})\\times 10^{53}$ erg, $\\Gamma_0=354^{+578}_{-217}$,\n$p=2.09^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$, $n_{18}=(2.04^{+9.71}_{-1.87})\\times 10^{2}$\ncm$^{-3}$, $\\theta_j=24.0^{+6.50}_{-5.54}$ degree,\n$\\epsilon_e=1.66^{+4.09}_{-1.39})\\times 10^{-1}$ and\n$\\epsilon_B=(7.76^{+48.5}_{-5.9})\\times 10^{-6}$. In addition, we employed the\npublic Python package \\texttt{Prospector} perform a spectral energy\ndistribution (SED) modeling of the host galaxy. The results suggest that the\nhost galaxy is a massive galaxy ($\\log(M_\\ast /\nM_\\odot)=11.75^{+0.10}_{-0.09}$) with moderate star formation rate\n($\\mbox{SFR}=22.58^{+13.63}_{-7.22} M_{\\odot}$/yr). This SFR is consistent with\nthe SFR of $\\sim 34.2 M_{\\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ derived from the [OII] emission line\nin the observed spectrum.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
