Regarding the former, we just review the most\nfundamental approach to establishing an extended cosmological model. We\ndemonstrate that employing new methodologies allows us to obtain exact\nsolutions. Despite the corresponding standard models, we cannot use any\narbitrary scalar potentials; instead, it is determined from solving three\nindependent fractional field equations. This article concludes with an overview\nof a fractional quantum/semi-classical model that provides an inflationary\nscenario.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
