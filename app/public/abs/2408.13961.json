An ablation study involving 34 variable\ncombinations and ten state-of-the-art GNN operators reveals key insights into\nthe predictive power of various variables, particularly highlighting the\nsignificance of competition, demographic factors, and mobility patterns in\ninfluencing dealership location decisions. The analysis pinpoints seven\nspecific counties as promising targets for network expansion. This research not\nonly illustrates the effectiveness of GNNs in solving complex geospatial\ndecision-making problems but also provides actionable recommendations and\nvaluable methodological insights for industry practitioners.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
