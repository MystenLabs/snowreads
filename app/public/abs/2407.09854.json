Enabled by\nthe policy document citation data provided by Overton, a searchable index of\npolicy documents worldwide, the results show that there are 3.9% of\npublications in the dataset cited at least once by policy documents. Policy\ndocument citations present a citation delay towards newly published\npublications and show a stronger predominance to the document types of review\nand article. Based on the Overton database, publications in the field of Social\nSciences and Humanities have the highest relative presence in policy document\ncitations, followed by Life and Earth Sciences and Biomedical and Health\nSciences. Our findings shed light not only on the impact of scientific\nknowledge on the policy-making process, but also on the particular focus of\npolicy documents indexed by Overton on specific research areas.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
