It can alternatively be\nviewed as conditional weak positive logic. We provide semantics for\nsub-sub-intuitionistic logic by means of semilattices with a selection\nfunction, prove a categorical duality for the algebraic semantics of the logic,\nand use this to derive completeness. We then consider the extension of\nsub-sub-intuitionistic logic with a variety of axioms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
