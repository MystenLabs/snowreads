(2022). These images were obtained using the High-Acuity\nWidefield $K$-band Imager (HAWK-I) on the Very Large Telescope. Host galaxies\nare detected for 27 of the sources, with $K_{\\rm s} \\approx 21.6$$-$$23.0$ mag\n(2$''$ diameter apertures; AB). The remaining eight targets are not detected to\na median $3\\sigma$ depth of $K_{\\rm s} \\approx 23.3$ mag ($2''$ diameter\napertures). We examine the radio and near-infrared flux densities of the 35\nsources, comparing them to the known $z > 3$ powerful radio galaxies with\n500-MHz radio luminosities $L_{500\\,{\\rm MHz}} > 10^{27}$ W Hz$^{-1}$. By\nplotting 150-MHz flux density versus $K_{\\rm s}$-band flux density, we find\nthat, similar to the sources from the literature, these new targets have large\nradio to near-infrared flux density ratios, but extending the distribution to\nfainter flux densities. Five of the eight HAWK-I deep non-detections have a\nmedian $3\\sigma$ lower limit of $K_{\\rm s} \\gtrsim 23.8$ mag ($1.5''$ diameter\napertures); these five targets, along with a further source from Broderick et\nal. (2022) with a deep non-detection ($K_{\\rm s} \\gtrsim 23.7$ mag; $3\\sigma$;\n$2''$ diameter aperture) in the Southern H-ATLAS Regions $K_{\\rm s}$-band\nSurvey, are considered candidates to be ultra-high-redshift ($z > 5$) radio\ngalaxies. The extreme radio to near-infrared flux density ratios ($>10^5$) for\nthese six sources are comparable to TN J0924$-$2201, GLEAM J0856$+$0223 and\nTGSS J1530$+$1049, the three known powerful radio galaxies at $z > 5$. For a\nselection of galaxy templates with different stellar masses, we show that $z\n\\gtrsim 4.2$ is a plausible scenario for our ultra-high-redshift candidates if\nthe stellar mass $M_{\\rm *} \\gtrsim 10^{10.5}\\,{\\rm M}_\\odot$.
