Currently, no set $L \\notin \\mathrm{NP}$ is known that has\noptimal proof systems. Our main result shows that this is not surprising,\nbecause we can rule out relativizable proofs of optimality for all sets outside\n$\\mathrm{NTIME}(t)$ where $t$ is slightly superpolynomial. We construct an\noracle $O$, such that for any set $L \\subseteq \\Sigma^*$ at least one of the\nfollowing two properties holds: $L$ does not have optimal proof systems\nrelative to $O$. $L \\in \\mathrm{UTIME}^O(2^{2(\\log\nn)^{8+4\\log(\\log(\\log(n)))}})$. The runtime bound is slightly superpolynomial.\nSo there is no relativizable proof showing that a complex set has optimal proof\nsystems. Hence, searching for non-trivial optimal proof systems with\nrelativizable methods can only be successful (if at all) in a narrow range\nabove $\\mathrm{NP}$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
