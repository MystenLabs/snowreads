However, even a small angular displacement in the sensor's placement\ncan cause significant degradation in output, especially at long range. In this\npaper, we demonstrate a simple yet generic and efficient multi-task learning\napproach that not only detects misalignment between different sensor modalities\nbut is also robust against them for long-range perception. Along with the\namount of misalignment, our method also predicts calibrated uncertainty, which\ncan be useful for filtering and fusing predicted misalignment values over time.\nIn addition, we show that the predicted misalignment parameters can be used for\nself-correcting input sensor data, further improving the perception performance\nunder sensor misalignment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
