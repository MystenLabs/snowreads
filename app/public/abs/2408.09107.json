However, the\nfield of soft robotics is still young, and designing them often involves\nmimicking natural organisms or relying heavily on human experts' creativity. A\nformal automated design process is required. We propose the use of\nneuroevolution-based algorithms to automatically design initial sketches of\nsoft actuators that can enable the movement of future medical devices, such as\ndrug-delivering catheters. The actuator morphologies discovered by algorithms\nlike Age-Fitness Pareto Optimization, NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies\n(NEAT), and Hypercube-based NEAT (HyperNEAT) were compared based on the maximum\ndisplacement reached and their robustness against various control methods.\nAnalyzing the results granted the insight that neuroevolution-based algorithms\nproduce better-performing and more robust actuators under different control\nmethods. Moreover, the best-performing morphologies were discovered by the NEAT\nalgorithm. As a future work aspect, we propose using the morphologies\ndiscovered here as test beds to optimize specialized controllers, enabling more\neffective functionality towards the desired deflections of the suggested soft\ncatheters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
