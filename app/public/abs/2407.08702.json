Natural candidates for this\nresearch are spin mixtures of atomic species with large magnetic moments.\nHowever, the lifetime of such assemblies can be strongly affected by the\ndipolar relaxation that occurs in spin-flip collisions. Here we present\nexperimental results for a mixture composed of the two lowest Zeeman states of\n$^{162}$Dy atoms, that act as dark states with respect to a light-induced\nquadratic Zeeman effect. We show that, due to an interference phenomenon, the\nrate for such inelastic processes is dramatically reduced with respect to the\nWigner threshold law. Additionally, we determine the scattering lengths\ncharacterizing the s-wave interaction between these states, providing all\nnecessary data to predict the miscibility range of the mixture, depending on\nits dimensionality.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
