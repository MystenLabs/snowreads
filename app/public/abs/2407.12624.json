Control Barrier\nFunctions (CBFs) have been developed to provably ensure system safety through\nforward invariance. However, they often unnecessarily sacrifice performance for\nsafety since they are purely reactive. Receding horizon control (RHC), on the\nother hand, consider planned trajectories to account for the future evolution\nof a system. This work provides a new perspective on safety-critical control by\nintroducing Forward Invariance in Trajectory Spaces (FITS). We lift the problem\nof safe RHC into the trajectory space and describe the evolution of planned\ntrajectories as a controlled dynamical system. Safety constraints defined over\nstates can be converted into sets in the trajectory space which we render\nforward invariant via a CBF framework. We derive an efficient quadratic program\n(QP) to synthesize trajectories that provably satisfy safety constraints. Our\nexperiments support that FITS improves the adherence to safety specifications\nwithout sacrificing performance over alternative CBF and NMPC methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
