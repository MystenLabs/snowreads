Not\nonly is this analogous to the well-known Blaschke selection theorem for compact\nconvex sets, but it fits better to the study of normal families of holomorphic\nmaps with variable domains and ranges. In particular, it applies to the\nrescaling method initiated by Pinchuk.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DXnqswa7tRczHUbg44ODCtTk30Mxj_NWRiUyxYlu5UE","pdfSize":"202667"}
