The least squares loss function to fit fDistances\nto dissimilarity data is *fStress*. We give formulas and R/C code to compute\npartial derivatives of orders one to four of fStress, relying heavily on the\nuse of Fa\\`a di Bruno's chain rule formula for higher derivatives.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"kWgKv4H_w9Wv_bUgF0fyJ7jGTfHHuQAjGVecEI1qZ3c","pdfSize":"176385"}
