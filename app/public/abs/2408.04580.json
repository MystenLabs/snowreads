With the constant progress of computing and mathematics,\nnew cryptographic methods are being diligently developed. Quantum Key\nDistribution (QKD) is a promising technology that provides an\nInformation-Theoretically Secure (ITS) solution to the secret-key agreement\nproblem between two remote parties. QKD networks based on trusted repeaters are\nbuilt to provide service to a larger number of parties at arbitrary distances.\nThey function as an add-on technology to traditional networks, generating,\nmanaging, distributing, and supplying ITS cryptographic keys. Since key\nresources are limited, integrating QKD network services into critical\ninfrastructures necessitates effective key management. As a result, this paper\nprovides a comprehensive review of QKD network key management approaches. They\nare analyzed to facilitate the identification of potential strategies and\naccelerate the future development of QKD networks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
