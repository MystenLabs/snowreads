While several such graphs have been constructed and\nhave played important roles in applications like visual question answering and\nrecommendation systems, challenges persist in their development. These include\nthe scarcity of high-quality Chinese knowledge graphs and limited domain\ncoverage in existing multi-modal knowledge graphs. This paper introduces\nMMPKUBase, a robust and extensive Chinese multi-modal knowledge graph that\ncovers diverse domains, including birds, mammals, ferns, and more, comprising\nover 50,000 entities and over 1 million filtered images. To ensure data\nquality, we employ Prototypical Contrastive Learning and the Isolation Forest\nalgorithm to refine the image data. Additionally, we have developed a\nuser-friendly platform to facilitate image attribute exploration.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Q0OVpPSo69ZbanpSKyai-VDfHZOKxbfZJ_JeDd6pN58","pdfSize":"2476898","txDigest":"5DmvEV61x9eenmeb3p8zJUnRER2AA2oeRzWjS3k4FKU","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
