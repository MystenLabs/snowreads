The performance of these\nalgorithms should be known to ensure their reliable application. In certain\nfields, receiver operating characteristic and precision-recall curves are\nfrequently employed to assess machine learning algorithms without accounting\nfor the impact of process parameters. However, it may be essential to evaluate\nthe performance of these algorithms in relation to such parameters. As a\nperformance evaluation metric capable of considering the effects of process\nparameters, this paper uses a modified probability of detection (POD) approach\nto assess the reliability of ML-based algorithms. As an example, the POD-based\napproach is employed to assess ML models used for predicting the lane changing\nbehavior of a vehicle driver. The time remaining to the predicted (and\ntherefore unknown) lane changing event is considered as process parameter. The\nhit/miss approach to POD is taken here and modified by considering the\nprobability of lane changing derived from ML algorithms at each time step, and\nobtaining the final result of the analysis accordingly. This improves the\nreliability of results compared to the standard hit/miss approach, which\nconsiders the outcome of the classifiers as either 0 or 1, while also\nsimplifying evaluation compared to the \\^a versus a approach. Performance\nevaluation results of the proposed approach are compared with those obtained\nwith the standard hit/miss approach and a pre-developed \\^a versus a approach\nto validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The comparison shows that\nthis method provides an averaging conservative behavior with the advantage of\nenhancing the reliability of the hit/miss approach to POD while retaining its\nsimplicity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"aKZ74Fi9mw2YgR5ziJz7qyQuytZUiO6OJ67nL0K1vG4","pdfSize":"2032866"}
