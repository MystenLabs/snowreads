To manage different tasks requires a mechanism to\nconvey information about task identity or context into the model, which from a\nbiological perspective may involve mechanisms of neuromodulation. In this\nstudy, we use recurrent network models to probe the distinctions between two\nforms of contextual modulation of neural dynamics, at the level of neuronal\nexcitability and at the level of synaptic strength. We characterize these\nmechanisms in terms of their functional outcomes, focusing on their robustness\nto context ambiguity and, relatedly, their efficiency with respect to packing\nmultiple tasks into finite size networks. We also demonstrate distinction\nbetween these mechanisms at the level of the neuronal dynamics they induce.\nTogether, these characterizations indicate complementarity and synergy in how\nthese mechanisms act, potentially over multiple time-scales, toward enhancing\nrobustness of multi-task learning.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
