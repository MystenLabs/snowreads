While QAOA has\nbeen shown to perform well on small-scale instances and to provide an\nasymptotic speedup over state-of-the-art classical algorithms for some\nproblems, fault-tolerance is understood to be required to realize this speedup\nin practice. The low resource requirements of QAOA make it particularly\nsuitable to benchmark on early fault-tolerant quantum computing (EFTQC)\nhardware. However, the performance of QAOA depends crucially on the choice of\nthe free parameters in the circuit. The task of setting these parameters is\ncomplicated in the EFTQC era by the large overheads, which preclude extensive\nclassical optimization. In this paper, we summarize recent advances in\nparameter setting in QAOA and show that these advancements make EFTQC\nexperiments with QAOA practically viable.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
