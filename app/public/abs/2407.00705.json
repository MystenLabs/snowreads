The argument is based on well-known result of\nGordon and del Rio--Makarov--Simon, combined with a way to consider\nperturbations whose ranges are not necessarily cyclic. The main application of\nthe results is showing that a class of quasiperiodic operators with\nsawtooth-like potentials, for which such a version of stable localization is\nknown, has Cantor spectra. We also obtain several results on gap filling under\nrank one perturbations for some general (not necessarily monotone) classes of\nquasiperiodic operators with discontinuous potentials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
