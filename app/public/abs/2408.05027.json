We show that there are only finitely many $k$-vertex-critical\n(co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ when $H$ is any graph of order $4$ by\nshowing finiteness in the three remaining open cases, those are the cases when\n$H$ is $2P_2$, $K_3+P_1$, and $K_4$. For the first two cases we actually prove\nstronger results when forbidding graphs of order $5$ that contain the graphs of\ninterest as induced subgraphs and employ a novel application of Sperner's\nTheorem on the number of antichains in a partially ordered set. Our result for\n$K_4$ uses exhaustive computer search and actually shows the stronger result\nthat every $(\\text{co-gem, }K_4)$-free graph is $4$-colourable. Our results\nimply the existence of simple polynomial-time certifying algorithms to decide\nthe $k$-colourability of (co-gem, $H$)-free graphs for all $k$ and all $H$ of\norder $4$ by searching the vertex-critical graphs as induced subgraphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
