Employing an in-plane\nconfiguration, a deliberate 1:10 ratio of CuCl to PVDF-HFP has been selected.\nThis ratio aims to establish an in-situ copper channel within the device. The\nelectrical response exhibits consistent memory retention over an extended\nduration. The WORM characteristics are attributed to the development of\nmultiple conducting filaments or a highly conductive percolative path created\nby Cu ions within the polymer matrix. The UV-Vis study also reinforces the\nobtained results. Additionally, the memristor undergoes specific poling and\ncooling conditions. The fabrication approach employed in this research yields a\ndistinctive type of Resistive Switching Device (RSD). Once the device is\nactivated, it maintains its state even after the applied field is reduced. This\nspecialized device holds potential applications in Compact Disc-Recordable\n(CD-R), Digital Versatile Disc-Recordable (DVD-R), Blu-ray Disc Recordable\n(BD-R), and Write Once USB Drives.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
