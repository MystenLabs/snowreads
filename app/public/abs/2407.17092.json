We investigate the universal approximation properties of SA-NODEs\nfor dynamical systems from both a theoretical and a numerical perspective.\nWithin the assumption of a finite-time horizon, under general hypotheses we\nestablish an asymptotic approximation result, demonstrating that the error\nvanishes as the number of parameters goes to infinity. Under additional\nregularity assumptions, we further specify this convergence rate in relation to\nthe number of parameters, utilizing quantitative approximation results in the\nBarron space. Based on the previous result, we prove an approximation rate for\ntransport equations by their neural counterparts. Our numerical experiments\nvalidate the effectiveness of SA-NODEs in capturing the dynamics of various ODE\nsystems and transport equations. Additionally, we compare SA-NODEs with vanilla\nNODEs, highlighting the superior performance and reduced complexity of our\napproach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
