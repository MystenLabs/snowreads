We find the Floquet circuit network\nequations of motion to reveal a potential barrier which effectively acts as a\nboundary in frequency space. By implementing a Su-Shrieffer-Heeger Floquet\nlattice model and measuring the associated circuit Laplacian and characteristic\nresonances, we demonstrate how topological edge modes can nucleate at such a\nfrequency boundary.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
