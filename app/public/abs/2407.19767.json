The purpose of this paper is to completely determine the\nparameter space of ICSs and its subspace consisting of periodic ICSs. In\nparticular, we prove Goddyn's conjecture on periodic ICSs, which was\nindependently proven recently by Ardanuy. We also prove the existence of a\nperiodic ICS in any dimension.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
