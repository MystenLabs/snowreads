Photoluminescence characterization reveals a partial quenching\nand a change of the exciton-trion emission ratio in the heterostructure as\ncompared to the isolated MoSe$_2$ monolayer. Under circularly polarized\nexcitation, we find that the exciton-trion emission ratio depends on the\nrelative orientation of excitation helicity and Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$\nmagnetization, even though the photoluminescence emission itself is\nunpolarized. This observation hints at an ultrafast, spin-dependent interlayer\ncharge transfer that competes with exciton and trion formation and\nrecombination.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
