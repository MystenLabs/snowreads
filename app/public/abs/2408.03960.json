However, these\nbenefits come with significant security challenges, as the increased complexity\nof service interactions, expanded attack surfaces, and intricate dependency\nmanagement introduce a new array of cybersecurity vulnerabilities. While\nsecurity concerns are mounting, there is a lack of comprehensive research that\nintegrates a review of existing knowledge with empirical analysis of\nmicroservice vulnerabilities. This study aims to fill this gap by gathering,\nanalyzing, and synthesizing existing literature on security vulnerabilities\nassociated with microservice architectures. Through a thorough examination of\n62 studies, we identify, analyze, and report 126 security vulnerabilities\ninherent in microservice architectures. This comprehensive analysis enables us\nto (i) propose a taxonomy that categorizes microservice vulnerabilities based\non the distinctive features of microservice architectures; (ii) conduct an\nempirical analysis by performing vulnerability scans on four diverse\nmicroservice benchmark applications using three different scanning tools to\nvalidate our taxonomy; and (iii) map our taxonomy vulnerabilities with\nempirically identified vulnerabilities, providing an in-depth vulnerability\nanalysis at microservice, application, and scanning tool levels. Our study\noffers crucial guidelines for practitioners and researchers to advance both the\nstate-of-the-practice and the state-of-the-art in securing microservice\narchitectures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
