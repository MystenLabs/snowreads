However, it is generally challenging to model the dynamics\nof soft robots due to their high spatial dimensionality, making it difficult to\nuse model-based methods to accurately control soft robots. It often requires\ndirect numerical simulation of partial differential equations to simulate soft\nrobots. This not only requires an accurate numerical model, but also makes soft\nrobot modeling slow and expensive. Deep learning algorithms have shown promises\nin data-driven modeling of soft robots. However, these algorithms usually\nrequire a large amount of data, which are difficult to obtain in either\nsimulation or real-world experiments of soft robots. In this work, we propose\nKNODE-Cosserat, a framework that combines first-principle physics models and\nneural ordinary differential equations. We leverage the best from both worlds\n-- the generalization ability of physics-based models and the fast speed of\ndeep learning methods. We validate our framework in both simulation and\nreal-world experiments. In both cases, we show that the robot model\nsignificantly improves over the baseline models under different metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xkW9m4_PF_2nqqY1QCqREzw4WPefakb43gOOlqOWk3k","pdfSize":"3040462"}
