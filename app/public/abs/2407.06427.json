We examine the\n$U(1)$ subgroup of $SU(2)$ that is broken outside the isotropic point by\napplying conformal perturbation theory, which we complement with numerical\nsimulations on the lattice. We also analyse the entanglement asymmetry of the\nfull $SU(2)$ group. By relying on very generic scaling arguments, we derive an\nasymptotic expression for it.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
