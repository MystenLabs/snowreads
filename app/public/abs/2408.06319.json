This class of compounds is\nsignificant from application and fundamental standpoints. Here we report on the\nsynthesis and characterization of Janus TMD compound TiSeS, which is a subclass\nof TMDs. We observe characters of filamentary superconductivity in TiSeS, which\nwas not reported in earlier studies. Magnetization measurements (ZFCW& FCW) as\nwell as isothermal magnetization indicates towards type-II superconductivity\nwhereas transport measurements lacks of zero resistivity due to possible weak\ninter-grain connectivity. The observed behavior can be safely attributed to\nfilamentary superconductivity in TiSeS. Further studies need to be carried out\nto determine the origin of this superconducting phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
