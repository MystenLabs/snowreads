However, several works\nhave drawn attention to potential security risks involved with the training and\nimplementation of such networks. In this work, we introduce DeepBaR, a novel\napproach that implants backdoors on neural networks by faulting their behavior\nat training, especially during fine-tuning. Our technique aims to generate\nadversarial samples by optimizing a custom loss function that mimics the\nimplanted backdoors while adding an almost non-visible trigger in the image. We\nattack three popular convolutional neural network architectures and show that\nDeepBaR attacks have a success rate of up to 98.30\\%. Furthermore, DeepBaR does\nnot significantly affect the accuracy of the attacked networks after deployment\nwhen non-malicious inputs are given. Remarkably, DeepBaR allows attackers to\nchoose an input that looks similar to a given class, from a human perspective,\nbut that will be classified as belonging to an arbitrary target class.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
