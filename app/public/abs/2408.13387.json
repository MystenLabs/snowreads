Considering whether similar fundamental\nlimits exist on quantum processes, we derive no-go theorems for quantum\nexperiments realisable in classical background spacetimes. We account for\ngeneral processes allowed by quantum theory, including those with indefinite\ncausal order (ICO), which have also been the subject of recent experiments. Our\nfirst theorem implies that realisations of ICO processes that do not violate\nrelativistic causality must involve the non-localization of systems in\nspacetime. The second theorem shows that for any such realisation of an ICO\nprocess, there exists a more fine-grained description in terms of a definite\nand acyclic causal order process. This enables a general reconciliation of\nquantum and relativistic notions of causality and, in particular, applies to\nexperimental realisations of the quantum switch, a prominent ICO process. By\nshowing what is impossible to achieve in classical spacetimes, these no-go\nresults also offer insights into how causality and information processing may\ndiffer in future quantum experiments in relativistic regimes beyond classical\nspacetimes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
