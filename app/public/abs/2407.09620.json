We explore non-toxic buffer\nmaterials, specifically ZnSe, ZnMgO, 3C-SiC, and WS2, as potential replacements\nfor the traditional Cd-based CdS buffer layer. Our analysis includes a thorough\nevaluation of the electrical and optical performance of these buffer materials\nin conjunction with CdTe absorbers. We optimize the thickness of both the\nbuffer and absorber layers to achieve the best performance. Additionally, we\nexamine the impact of defect density variations in the buffer materials and\ntheir corresponding temperature effects. Among the tested materials, ZnSe and\nZnMgO demonstrate the highest potential, achieving power conversion\nefficiencies of 20.74% and 20.73%, respectively.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
