Graphene nanostructures with\n{\\pi}-magnetism offer a chemically tunable platform to explore quantum magnetic\ninteractions. However, realizing spin chains bearing controlled odd-even\neffects with suitable nanographene systems is challenging. Here, we demonstrate\nthe successful on-surface synthesis of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg\nchains with parity-dependent magnetization based on antiaromatic\ndiaza-hexa-peri-hexabenzocoronene (diaza-HBC) units. Using distinct synthetic\nstrategies, two types of spin chains with different terminals were synthesized,\nboth exhibiting a robust odd-even effect on the spin coupling along the chain.\nCombined investigations using scanning tunneling microscopy, non-contact atomic\nforce microscopy, density functional theory calculations, and quantum spin\nmodels confirmed the structures of the diaza-HBC chains and revealed their\nmagnetic properties, which has an S = 1/2 spin per unit through electron\ndonation from the diaza-HBC core to the Au(111) substrate. Gapped excitations\nwere observed in even-numbered chains, while enhanced Kondo resonance emerged\nin odd-numbered units of odd-numbered chains due to the redistribution of the\nunpaired spin along the chain. Our findings provide an effective strategy to\nconstruct nanographene spin chains and unveil the odd-even effect in their\nmagnetic properties, offering potential applications in nanoscale spintronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
