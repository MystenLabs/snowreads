Starting from a general ansatz, we\nobtain a relation for the parameters in which one can impose further symmetries\nor restrictions. One of the simplest restrictions leads to FLRW cases, while\ntransforming from the initial static to other static-type coordinates can lead\nto near horizon coordinates, Wheeler--Regge, and isotropic coordinates, among\nothers. As less restrictive cases, we show an indirect route for obtaining\nKruskal-Szekeres within this approach, as well as Lema\\^{\\i}tre coordinates. We\nuse Schwarzschild spacetime as a prototype for testing the procedure in\nindividual cases. However, application to other spacetimes, such as de-Sitter,\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"{o}m, and Schwarzschild de Sitter, can be readily\ngeneralized.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
