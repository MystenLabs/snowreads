We illustrate how AI could augment\nexisting SDM tools and provide empirical evidence from a leading accelerator\nprogram and a startup competition that current Large Language Models (LLMs) can\ngenerate and evaluate strategies at a level comparable to entrepreneurs and\ninvestors. We then examine implications for key cognitive processes underlying\nSDM -- search, representation, and aggregation. Our analysis suggests AI has\nthe potential to enhance the speed, quality, and scale of strategic analysis,\nwhile also enabling new approaches like virtual strategy simulations. However,\nthe ultimate impact on firm performance will depend on competitive dynamics as\nAI capabilities progress. We propose a framework connecting AI use in SDM to\nfirm outcomes and discuss how AI may reshape sources of competitive advantage.\nWe conclude by considering how AI could both support and challenge core tenets\nof the theory-based view of strategy. Overall, our work maps out an emerging\nresearch frontier at the intersection of AI and strategy.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
