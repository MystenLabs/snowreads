In previous work, we showed that (for each signature) there\nexists a universal homogeneous tensor space, which is unique up to isomorphism.\nHere we generalize that result: we show that each Zariski class of tensor\nspaces contains a weakly homogeneous space, which is unique up to isomorphism;\nhere, we say that two tensor spaces are \"Zariski equivalent\" if they satisfy\nthe same polynomial identities. Our work relies on the theory of\n$\\mathbf{GL}$-varieties developed by Bik, Draisma, Eggermont, and Snowden.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
