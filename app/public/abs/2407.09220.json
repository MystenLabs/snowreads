Our goal is to address the tendency of a\ncommonly used formulation to overestimate turbulence intensity within wind\nfarms and to overcome its limitations in predicting the streamwise evolution of\nturbulence intensity beyond them. To this end, we utilize high-fidelity data\nand adopt an optimization technique to derive an optimized functional form of\nthe wake-added turbulence. We then integrate the achieved formulation with a\nwidely used Gaussian wake model to study various intra-farm and farm-to-farm\nscenarios. The outcomes reveal that the new methodology effectively addresses\nthe overestimation of power in both standalone wind farms and those impacted by\nupstream counterparts. Our new approach meets the need for accurate and\nlightweight models, ensuring the effective coexistence of wind farms within\nclusters as the wind-energy capacity rapidly expands.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
