Inference dominates LLM workloads, presenting a critical challenge\nfor providers: minimizing energy costs under Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)\nthat ensure optimal user experience. In this paper, we present\n\\textit{throttLL'eM}, a framework that reduces energy consumption while meeting\nSLOs through the use of instance and GPU frequency scaling.\n\\textit{throttLL'eM} features mechanisms that project future KV cache usage and\nbatch size. Leveraging a Machine-Learning (ML) model that receives these\nprojections as inputs, \\textit{throttLL'eM} manages performance at the\niteration level to satisfy SLOs with reduced frequencies and instance sizes. We\nshow that the proposed ML model achieves $R^2$ scores greater than 0.97 and\nmiss-predicts performance by less than 1 iteration per second on average.\nExperimental results on LLM inference traces show that \\textit{throttLL'eM}\nachieves up to 43.8\\% lower energy consumption and an energy efficiency\nimprovement of at least $1.71\\times$ under SLOs, when compared to NVIDIA's\nTriton server.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"MhvM13KBhex7eCCHraz1xFURsc3Za8ZSfWmi1tZYfm0","pdfSize":"15964342"}
