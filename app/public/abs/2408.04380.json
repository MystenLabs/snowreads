Although the problem has been studied for years under names such as\nImitation Learning, Behavioral Cloning, or Inverse Reinforcement Learning,\nclassical methods have relied on models that don't capture complex data\ndistributions well or don't scale well to large numbers of demonstrations. In\nrecent years, the robot learning community has shown increasing interest in\nusing deep generative models to capture the complexity of large datasets. In\nthis survey, we aim to provide a unified and comprehensive review of the last\nyear's progress in the use of deep generative models in robotics. We present\nthe different types of models that the community has explored, such as\nenergy-based models, diffusion models, action value maps, or generative\nadversarial networks. We also present the different types of applications in\nwhich deep generative models have been used, from grasp generation to\ntrajectory generation or cost learning. One of the most important elements of\ngenerative models is the generalization out of distributions. In our survey, we\nreview the different decisions the community has made to improve the\ngeneralization of the learned models. Finally, we highlight the research\nchallenges and propose a number of future directions for learning deep\ngenerative models in robotics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
