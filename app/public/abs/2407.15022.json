Our method combines chatbot capabilities and generative AI to offer\ninteractive problem-solving exercises, enhancing learning through a stepby-step\napproach for varied problems, advocating for the responsible use of AI in\neducation. Our approach emphasizes that immediate answers from ChatGPT can\nimpede real learning. We introduce a reward-based system that requires students\nto solve mathematical problems effectively to receive the final answer. This\nencourages a progressive learning path from basic to complex problems,\nrewarding mastery with final solutions. The goal is to transition students from\nseeking quick fixes to engaging actively in a comprehensive learning\nexperience.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6tXxkPk4tE6RvnrPBkPcYeOCIRZiT6mNXuu8pOjGta0","pdfSize":"431800"}
