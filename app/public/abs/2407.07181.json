Multi-objective learning to rank\nhas been widely studied to balance primary and secondary objectives. But\ntraditional approaches in industry face some challenges including expensive\nparameter tuning leads to sub-optimal solution, suffering from imbalanced data\nsparsity issue, and being not compatible with ad-hoc objective. In this paper,\nwe propose a distillation-based ranking solution for multi-objective ranking,\nwhich optimizes the end-to-end ranking system at Airbnb across multiple ranking\nmodels on different objectives along with various considerations to optimize\ntraining and serving efficiency to meet industry standards. We found it\nperforms much better than traditional approaches, it doesn't only significantly\nincreases primary objective by a large margin but also meet secondary\nobjectives constraints and improve model stability. We also demonstrated the\nproposed system could be further simplified by model self-distillation. Besides\nthis, we did additional simulations to show that this approach could also help\nus efficiently inject ad-hoc non-differentiable business objective into the\nranking system while enabling us to balance our optimization objectives.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
