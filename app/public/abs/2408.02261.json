Traditional UDA\nresearch assumes consistent taxonomy between the source and target domains,\nthereby limiting their ability to recognize and adapt to the taxonomy of the\ntarget domain. This paper introduces a novel approach, Cross-Domain Semantic\nSegmentation on Inconsistent Taxonomy using Vision Language Models (CSI), which\neffectively performs domain-adaptive semantic segmentation even in situations\nof source-target class mismatches. CSI leverages the semantic generalization\npotential of Visual Language Models (VLMs) to create synergy with previous UDA\nmethods. It leverages segment reasoning obtained through traditional UDA\nmethods, combined with the rich semantic knowledge embedded in VLMs, to relabel\nnew classes in the target domain. This approach allows for effective adaptation\nto extended taxonomies without requiring any ground truth label for the target\ndomain. Our method has shown to be effective across various benchmarks in\nsituations of inconsistent taxonomy settings (coarse-to-fine taxonomy and open\ntaxonomy) and demonstrates consistent synergy effects when integrated with\nprevious state-of-the-art UDA methods.
