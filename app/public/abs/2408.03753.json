However, the choice\nof optimising the outgoing radiance of each Gaussian independently as spherical\nharmonics results in unsatisfactory view dependent effects. In response to\nthese limitations, our work, Factorised Tensorial Illumination for 3D Gaussian\nSplatting, or 3iGS, improves upon 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) rendering\nquality. Instead of optimising a single outgoing radiance parameter, 3iGS\nenhances 3DGS view-dependent effects by expressing the outgoing radiance as a\nfunction of a local illumination field and Bidirectional Reflectance\nDistribution Function (BRDF) features. We optimise a continuous incident\nillumination field through a Tensorial Factorisation representation, while\nseparately fine-tuning the BRDF features of each 3D Gaussian relative to this\nillumination field. Our methodology significantly enhances the rendering\nquality of specular view-dependent effects of 3DGS, while maintaining rapid\ntraining and rendering speeds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
