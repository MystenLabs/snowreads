{"id":"2408.05217","title":"Implementing a Restricted Function Space Class in Firedrake","authors":"Emma Rothwell","authorsParsed":[["Rothwell","Emma",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Wed, 24 Jul 2024 16:47:01 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-13","timestamp":1721839621000,"abstract":"  The implementation process of a $\\texttt{RestrictedFunctionSpace}$ class in\nFiredrake, a Python library which numerically solves partial differential\nequations through the use of the finite element method, is documented. This\nincludes an introduction to the current $\\texttt{FunctionSpace}$ class in\nFiredrake, and the key features that it has. With the current\n$\\texttt{FunctionSpace}$ class, the limitations of the capabilities of the\nsolvers in Firedrake when imposing Dirichlet boundary conditions are explored,\nas well as what the $\\texttt{RestrictedFunctionSpace}$ class does differently\nto remove these issues. These will be considered in both a mathematical way,\nand in the code as an abstraction of the mathematical ideas presented. Finally,\nthe benefits to the user of the $\\texttt{RestrictedFunctionSpace}$ class are\nconsidered, and demonstrated through tests and comparisons. This leads to the\nconclusion that in particular, the eigensolver in Firedrake is improved through\nthe use of the $\\texttt{RestrictedFunctionSpace}$, through the removal of\neigenvalues associated with the Dirichlet boundary conditions for a system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
