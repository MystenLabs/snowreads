The predominant discounting approach is to use the exponential\nform. Central to this approach is the discount rate, a unique parameter that\nconverts a future value into its present equivalent. However, a universally\naccepted discount rate remains a matter of ongoing debate and lacks consensus.\nThis paper provides a robust solution for resolving conflicts in discount\nrates, which recommends considering all discount rates but aims to assign\nvarying degrees of importance to these rates. Moreover, a considerable number\nof economists support a theory that suggests equal consideration of future and\npresent utilities. In response to this debate, we introduce a general criterion\ncapable of accommodating situations where it is feasible not to discount future\nutilities. This criterion encompasses and extends various existing criteria in\nthe literature.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
