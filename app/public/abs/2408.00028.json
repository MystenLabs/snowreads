This paper introduces novel fractal functions, such as the\nWeierstrass type and 3-adic Cantor type, as intriguing examples within these\nspaces and a few others. Employing prime elements, we develop a\nMulti-Resolution Analysis (MRA) and examine wavelet expansions, focusing on the\northogonality of both basic and fractal wavelet packets at various scales. We\nutilize convolution theory to construct Haar wavelet packets and demonstrate\nthe orthogonality of all discussed wavelet packets within\n$H^{\\mathfrak{s}}(K_q)$, enhancing the analytical capabilities of these Sobolev\nspaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Scj6SK-abDgZAjiXq2sb8dWxlUE5sKxXydtMMSc0qAU","pdfSize":"287258","txDigest":"2qnzeVL69TPXdkQUYae7Zfef8ERcyKmGW1niKh25uvud","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
