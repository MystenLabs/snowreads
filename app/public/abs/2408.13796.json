Specifically, we define a\nzero-sum game on a percolation configuration of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, where two\nplayers move a token along the non-oriented edges of $\\mathbb{Z}^2$, collecting\na cost of 1 for each edge that is open, and 0 otherwise. The total cost is\ngiven by the limit superior of the average cost. We demonstrate that the value\nof this game is deterministic and equals 1 if and only if the percolation\nparameter exceeds $p_c$, the critical exponent of oriented percolation.\nAdditionally, we establish that the value of the game is continuous at $p_c$.\nFinally, we show that for $p$ close to 0, the value of the game is equal to 0.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
