New spectra from MMT/Binospec confirm that the\ncompanion galaxy (\"galaxy B\") is part of the lensing system with $z_B =\n0.6835$. New three-color HST data reveal a full Einstein ring and allow a more\nprecise lens model. The new HST images also reveal extended emission around\ngalaxy A, and the spectra show extended [OII] emission with irregular\nmorphology and complex velocity structure. All indications are that the two\nlensing galaxies are a gravitationally interacting pair. Strong [OII] emission\nfrom both galaxies A and B suggests current star formation, which could be a\nconsequence of the interaction. This would indicate a younger stellar\npopulation than previously assumed and imply smaller stellar masses for the\nsame luminosity. The improved lens model and expanded spectral energy\ndistributions have enabled better stellar-mass estimates for the foreground\ngalaxies. The resulting dark matter fractions are ~0.8, higher than previously\ncalculated. Deeper Chandra imaging shows extended X-ray emission but no\nevidence for a point X-ray source associated with either galaxy. The detection\nof X-rays from the radio lobes of 3C 220.3 allows an estimate of ~3 nT for the\nmagnetic fields in the lobes, a factor of ~3 below the equipartition fields, as\ntypical for radio galaxies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
