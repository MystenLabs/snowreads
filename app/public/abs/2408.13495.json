However, due to effect of speckle noise in ultrasound im-ages, it is\nstill a challenge task to accurately detect hip landmarks. In this work, we\npropose a novel hip landmark detection model by integrating the Topological GCN\n(TGCN) with an Improved Conformer (TGCN-ICF) into a unified frame-work to\nimprove detection performance. The TGCN-ICF includes two subnet-works: an\nImproved Conformer (ICF) subnetwork to generate heatmaps and a TGCN subnetwork\nto additionally refine landmark detection. This TGCN can effectively improve\ndetection accuracy with the guidance of class labels. Moreo-ver, a Mutual\nModulation Fusion (MMF) module is developed for deeply ex-changing and fusing\nthe features extracted from the U-Net and Transformer branches in ICF. The\nexperimental results on the real DDH dataset demonstrate that the proposed\nTGCN-ICF outperforms all the compared algorithms.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Z21jCW34Lgz3MBMv450oRuk2XqZng9DS0eIKua5aEm4","pdfSize":"644347"}
