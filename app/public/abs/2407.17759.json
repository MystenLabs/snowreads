However,\nonly a few studies have experimentally detected such sidebands. Here, we apply\nmid-infrared pump near-infrared reflection probe spectroscopy to a\none-dimensional Mott insulator,\nbis(ethylendithio)tetrathianfulvalence-difluorotetracyanoquinodimethane\n(ET-F2TCNQ), to detect the transient change in reflectivity R,{\\Delta}R/R, due\nto the formation of excitonic Floquet states. Analyses, considering both odd-\nand even-parity excitons, demonstrate that the {\\Delta}R/R spectrum reflects\nthe formation of the first-order Floquet sidebands of excitons, and its\nspectral shape strongly depends on the widths of excitonic states. The\nexperimental and analytical approach reported here is effective in\ndemonstrating excitonic Floquet states in various solids.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
