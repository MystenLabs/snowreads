Just as quantum field theories are plagued\nwith loop divergences that need to be cancelled systematically by introducing\ncounterterms, gravitational path integrals are plagued by wormhole\ncontributions that spoil the factorization of the holographic dual. These\nwormholes must be cancelled by some stringy effects in a UV complete,\nholographic theory of quantum gravity. In a simple model of two-dimensional\ntopological gravity, we outline a gravitational analog of the recursive BPHZ\nprocedure in order to systematically introduce ``counter-wormholes\" which\nparametrize the unknown stringy effects that lead to factorization. Underlying\nthis procedure is a Hopf algebra of symmetries which is analogous to the\nConnes--Kreimer Hopf algebra underlying perturbative renormalization. The group\ndual to this Hopf algebra acts to reorganize contributions from spacetimes with\ndistinct topology, and can be seen as a gauge group relating various equivalent\nways of constructing a factorizing gravitational path integral.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
