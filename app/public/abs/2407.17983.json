This challenge limits the\ntransparency and credibility of EEG-based end-to-end models, hindering their\napplication in security-sensitive areas. To address this issue, we propose a\nmask perturbation method to explain the behavior of end-to-end models in the\nfrequency domain. Considering the characteristics of EEG data, we introduce a\ntarget alignment loss to mitigate the out-of-distribution problem associated\nwith perturbation operations. Additionally, we develop a perturbation generator\nto define perturbation generation in the frequency domain. Our explanation\nmethod is validated through experiments on multiple representative end-to-end\ndeep learning models in the EEG decoding field, using an established EEG\nbenchmark dataset. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of\nour method, and highlight its potential to advance research in EEG-based\nend-to-end models.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NiMd4p2FXkblvcRnKP4ZwaEwAzoxrgL_sk9m6OHU9s4","pdfSize":"4530575"}
