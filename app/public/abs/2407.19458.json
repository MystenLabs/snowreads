The class is characterized by twelve\nHiggs from the $\\mathcal{N}=2$ sector that precisely account for the Standard\nModel fermion masses and mixings without Wilson fluxes. Notably, there is a\nnatural prediction of Dirac neutrino-masses with normal ordering\n$(50.4,~10.5,~6.1)$~meV consistent with both experimental constraints and\nswampland bounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
