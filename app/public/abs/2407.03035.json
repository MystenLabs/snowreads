With this work we aim to provide an integrative view and framework to\ncombine methods from the fields of MCMC, constrained optimization, as well as\nrobotics, and gain insights in their strengths from empirical evaluations. We\npropose NLP Sampling as a general problem formulation, propose a family of\nrestarting two-phase methods as a framework to integrated methods from across\nthe fields, and evaluate them on analytical and robotic manipulation planning\nproblems. Complementary to this, we provide several conceptual discussions,\ne.g. on the role of Lagrange parameters, global sampling, and the idea of a\nDiffused NLP and a corresponding model-based denoising sampler.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
