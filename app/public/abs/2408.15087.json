So far, an equivalence relation is still\nmissing that is a congruence for parallel composition and adheres to the\nlimited discriminating power implied by quantum theory. In fact, defining an\nadequate bisimilarity for quantum-capable, concurrent systems proved a\ndifficult task, because unconstrained non-determinism allows to spuriously\ndiscriminate indistinguishable quantum systems. We investigate this problem by\nenriching a linear quantum extension of CCS with simple physically admissible\nschedulers. We show that our approach suffices for deriving a well-behaved\nbisimilarity that satisfies the aforementioned desiderata.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
