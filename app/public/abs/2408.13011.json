The permanent dipole moments (PDMs)\nsustained by polar systems can couple to the electromagnetic field, giving rise\nto a variety of processes such as difference-frequency and harmonic generation,\nreflected in complicated dynamics of the atomic system. Here, we demonstrate\nthat the dynamics can be described simply in a dynamic reference frame. We\nderive a Jaynes-Cummings-like framework with effective parameters describing\nfrequency shift, coupling strength with the driving field, and a rescaled\nrelaxation rate. The familiar linear scaling of the interaction strength with\nthe field amplitude is replaced with a nonlinear dependence, suggesting\npotential applications for improving the coherence of quantum system ensembles\nwith permanent dipoles.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
