They are, however, easily determined from the spectral\ndensity, motivating the task of estimating a spectral density from a Euclidean\ncorrelator. This spectral reconstruction problem can be written as an ill-posed\ninverse Laplace transform; incorporating positivity constraints allows one to\nobtain finite-sized bounds on the region of spectral density functions\nconsistent with the Euclidean data. Expressing the reconstruction problem as a\nconvex optimization problem and exploiting Lagrange duality, bounds on\narbitrary integrals of the spectral density can be efficiently obtained from\nEuclidean data. This paper applies this approach to reconstructing a smeared\nspectral density and determining smeared real-time evolution. Bounds of this\nform are information-theoretically complete, in the sense that for any point\nwithin the bounds one may find an associated spectral density consistent with\nboth the available Euclidean data and positivity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
