The congruence classes of\nindices for $K$-Fibonacci numbers that are multiples of the prime factors of\n$m$ completely determine the number of zeroes in the Pisano period modulo $m$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hUZj_Wxukh4jMx2HSAyJTifvvhYI1fB2fLaEDcs5aas","pdfSize":"233391"}
