While quantum computers have been implemented with different\ntypes of technologies, recently, analog Rydberg atom quantum computers have\nbeen demonstrated to have desirable properties such as reconfigurable qubit\n(quantum bit) positions and multi-qubit operations. To leverage the properties\nof this technology, we propose ReCon, the first work to implement quantum GANs\non analog Rydberg atom quantum computers. Our evaluation using simulations and\nreal-computer executions shows 33% better quality (measured using Frechet\nInception Distance (FID)) in generated images than the state-of-the-art\ntechnique implemented on superconducting-qubit technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2hv67yl4ptOji0OV3PmWJAMEa8Eyv7y7E0ct5Lj8k1k","pdfSize":"1337138"}
