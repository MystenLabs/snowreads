It supports\nphysically-based rendering (PBR), necessary for 3D asset relighting in\nreal-world applications. Additionally, 3DGen supports generative retexturing of\npreviously generated (or artist-created) 3D shapes using additional textual\ninputs provided by the user. 3DGen integrates key technical components, Meta 3D\nAssetGen and Meta 3D TextureGen, that we developed for text-to-3D and\ntext-to-texture generation, respectively. By combining their strengths, 3DGen\nrepresents 3D objects simultaneously in three ways: in view space, in\nvolumetric space, and in UV (or texture) space. The integration of these two\ntechniques achieves a win rate of 68% with respect to the single-stage model.\nWe compare 3DGen to numerous industry baselines, and show that it outperforms\nthem in terms of prompt fidelity and visual quality for complex textual\nprompts, while being significantly faster.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Graphics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
