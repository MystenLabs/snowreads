Unlike existing approaches, our method does not\nrequire iteratively simulating forward and backward diffusions or training\nneural networks to fit unknown drifts. Instead, we show that the potentials\nobtained from solving the static entropic optimal transport problem between the\nsource and target samples can be modified to yield a natural plug-in estimator\nof the time-dependent drift that defines the bridge between two measures. Under\nminimal assumptions, we show that our proposal, which we call the\n\\emph{Sinkhorn bridge}, provably estimates the Schr\\\"odinger bridge with a rate\nof convergence that depends on the intrinsic dimensionality of the target\nmeasure. Our approach combines results from the areas of sampling, and\ntheoretical and statistical entropic optimal transport.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vmnPGs2wLM9nUsWLVYtHMC41byR7fN1ZaZIF49TJ160","pdfSize":"3434812"}
