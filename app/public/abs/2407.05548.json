Here, using inelastic\nneutron scattering to study spin excitations in single-crystal samples, we\nreveal that the magnetic coupling between adjacent Fe layers is not only\nsignificant, as it affects excitations up to \\textcolor{black}{15} meV, but\nalso ferromagnetic in nature, making the system different from most\nunconventional superconductors including iron pnictides. Our observation\nprovides a new standpoint to understand the absence of magnetic order in\nFeSe$_{1-x}$S$_{x}$. Since intercalating between the Fe layers is known to\nenhance superconductivity and suppress the inter-layer coupling,\nsuperconductivity appears to be a more robust phenomenon in the two-dimensional\nlimit than antiferromagnetic order.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
