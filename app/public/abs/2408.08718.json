By studying the Torelli pullback of algebraic cycles classes\nfrom $\\mathcal{A}_g$ to the moduli space $\\mathcal{M}_g^{\\mathrm{ct}}$ of genus\n$g$ of curves of compact type, we prove that the product class\n$[\\mathcal{A}_1\\times \\mathcal{A}_5]\\in \\mathsf{CH}^{5}(\\mathcal{A}_6)$ is\nnon-tautological, the first construction of an interesting non-tautological\nalgebraic class on the moduli spaces of abelian varieties. For our proof, we\nuse the complete description of the the tautological ring\n$\\mathsf{R}^*(\\mathcal{M}_6^{\\mathrm{ct}})$ in genus 6 conjectured by Pixton\nand recently proven by Canning-Larson-Schmitt. The tautological ring\n$\\mathsf{R}^*(\\mathcal{M}_6^{\\mathrm{ct}})$ has a 1-dimensional Gorenstein\nkernel, which is geometrically explained by the Torelli pullback of\n$[\\mathcal{A}_1\\times \\mathcal{A}_5]$. More generally, the Torelli pullback of\nthe difference between $[\\mathcal{A}_1\\times \\mathcal{A}_{g-1}]$ and its\ntautological projection always lies in the Gorenstein kernel of\n$\\mathsf{R}^*(\\mathcal{M}_g^{\\mathrm{ct}})$.\n  The product map $\\mathcal{A}_1\\times \\mathcal{A}_{g-1}\\rightarrow\n\\mathcal{A}_g$ is a Noether-Lefschetz locus with general Neron-Severi rank 2. A\nnatural extension of van der Geer's tautological ring is obtained by including\nmore general Noether-Lefschetz loci. Results and conjectures related to cycle\nclasses of Noether-Lefschetz loci for all $g$ are presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"DZ-tbxsdDkJdU9a7JLqC-TUvX1l3YUGdHqQBUaUez3s","pdfSize":"545243"}
