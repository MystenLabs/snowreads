For\nmany applications in Bayesian meta-analysis and Bayesian transfer learning, the\nprior distribution is unknown and needs to be estimated from samples. In\npractice, the prior distribution can be high-dimensional, adding to the\ndifficulty of efficient posterior inference. In this paper, we propose a novel\nMarkov chain Monte Carlo algorithm, which we term graph-enabled MCMC, for\nposterior sampling with unknown and potentially high-dimensional prior\ndistributions. The algorithm is based on constructing a geometric graph from\nprior samples and subsequently uses the graph structure to guide the transition\nof the Markov chain. Through extensive theoretical and numerical studies, we\ndemonstrate that our graph-enabled MCMC algorithm provides reliable\napproximation to the posterior distribution and is highly computationally\nefficient.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
