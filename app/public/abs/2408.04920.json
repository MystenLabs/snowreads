Kociumaka et al. showed the\nnumber of parameterized squares, which are non-equivalent in parameterized\nequivalence, in a string of length $n$ that contains $\\sigma$ distinct\ncharacters is at most $2 \\sigma! n$ [TCS 2016]. In this paper, we show that the\nmaximum number of non-equivalent parameterized squares is less than $\\sigma n$,\nwhich significantly improves the best-known upper bound by Kociumaka et al.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
