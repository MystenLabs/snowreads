FSSMSC features linear\ncomputational and space complexity relative to the size of the data. The method\ngenerates a consensus anchor graph across all views, representing each data\npoint as a sparse linear combination of chosen landmarks. Unlike traditional\nmethods that manage the anchor graph construction and the label propagation\nprocess separately, this paper proposes a unified optimization model that\nfacilitates simultaneous learning of both. An effective alternating update\nalgorithm with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the unified\noptimization model. Additionally, the method employs the obtained anchor graph\nand landmarks' low-dimensional representations to deduce low-dimensional\nrepresentations for raw data. Following this, a straightforward clustering\napproach is conducted on these low-dimensional representations to achieve the\nfinal clustering results. The effectiveness and efficiency of FSSMSC are\nvalidated through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets of\nvarying scales.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
