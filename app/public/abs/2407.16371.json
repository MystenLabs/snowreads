Over\nthe last decade, this flux has been characterized by measurements in multiple\ndetection channels that are complementary with respect to the sensitive energy\nrange, flavor composition, sky coverage, and backgrounds. The origin of these\nneutrinos remains largely unknown. However, evidence has been found for\nneutrino emission from the directions of the blazar TXS 0506+056, Seyfert\ngalaxy NGC 1068. and the Galactic Plane. IceCube also has an active program of\nindirect dark matter searches with competitive constraints on dark matter\nmodels. In this talk, we will present recent results of the IceCube experiment,\nhighlighting the latest diffuse flux measurements, point source searches, and\ndark matter analyses.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
