Although thousands of VMP\nstars have been discovered, the identification of a VMP star with a PISN\nsignature has been elusive. Recently, the VMP star LAMOST J1010+2358 was\nclaimed to be the first star with a clear PISN signature. A subsequent study\nshowed that ejecta from low-mass core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) can also fit\nthe abundance pattern equally well and additional elements such as C and Al are\nrequired to differentiate the two sources. Follow-up observations of LAMOST\nJ1010+2358 by two independent groups were able to detect both C and Al.\nAdditionally, key odd elements such as Na and Sc were also detected whose\nabundances were found to be higher than the upper limits found in the original\ndetection. We perform a detailed analysis of the newly observed abundance\npatterns by exploring various possible formation channels for VMP stars. We\nfind that purely low-mass CCSN ejecta as well as the combination of CCSN and\nType 1a SN ejecta can provide an excellent fit to the newly observed abundance\npattern. Our results confirm earlier analysis that the newly observed abundance\npattern is peculiar but has no signatures of PISN.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
