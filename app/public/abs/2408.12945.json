Although assembly state recognition is gaining attention,\nnone of the current works investigate assembly error localization. Therefore,\nwe propose StateDiffNet, which localizes assembly errors based on detecting the\ndifferences between a (correct) intended assembly state and a test image from a\nsimilar viewpoint. StateDiffNet is trained on synthetically generated image\npairs, providing full control over the type of meaningful change that should be\ndetected. The proposed approach is the first to correctly localize assembly\nerrors taken from real ego-centric video data for both states and error types\nthat are never presented during training. Furthermore, the deployment of change\ndetection to this industrial application provides valuable insights and\nconsiderations into the mechanisms of state-of-the-art change detection\nalgorithms.
