We show that whenever\n$\\theta >0,$ there exists an $H^1$-solution, while for $\\theta <0$, there does\nnot exist a positive solution in a reasonably general class. Since the\nperturbation $ u \\ln u^2$ changes sign, Pohozaev type identities do not yield\nany non-existence results. The main contribution of this article is obtaining\nan ``almost\" precise lower asymptotic decay estimate on the positive solutions\nfor $\\theta <0,$ culminating in proving their non-existence assertion.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
