As humans,\nwe exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring,\nframing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as\nsuch biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs)\nare trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases?\nUnderstanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support\nhuman decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of\nmodern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs.\nUtility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior\nagainst benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To\ndemonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a\nvariety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of\ncurrent LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We\nalso find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic\nbehavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure\nthe effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
