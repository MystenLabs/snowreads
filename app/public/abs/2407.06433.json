We think of this as a random\nspatial process of particles in a random tree, and we introduce the notion of\nthe {\\em mean} canonical and grand canonical partition functions where in this\ncontext `mean' means averaged over the random environment. We give a recursion\nfor these mean partition functions and demonstrate that in certain instances,\ndetermined by the law for the branching process, these partition functions as a\nfunction of $\\beta$ have algebraic properties which generalize those that\nappear in the non-random and $p$-adic environments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
