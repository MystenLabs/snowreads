We designed optimized quantum adders and\nmultipliers based on Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), which significantly\nreduced the number of gates used compared to classical adders and multipliers.\nSubsequently, we construct a basic universal quantum matrix multiplication and\nextend it to the Strassen algorithm. We conduct comparative experiments to\nanalyze the performance of the quantum matrix multiplication and evaluate the\nacceleration provided by the optimized quantum adder and multiplier.\nFurthermore, we investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the quantum\nStrassen algorithm compared to basic quantum matrix multiplication.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
