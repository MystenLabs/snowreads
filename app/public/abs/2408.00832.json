We demonstrate that these fluctuations can\nbe leveraged to improve the sensitivity to stochastic gravitational wave\nbackgrounds (SGWBs) compared to the stationary noise scenario. This requires\noptimal use of data segments with downward noise fluctuations, and thus a data\nanalysis pipeline capable of analysing and combining shorter time segments of\nmission data. We propose that simulation based inference is well suited for\nthis challenge. In an approximate, but state-of-the-art, modeling setup, we\nshow by comparison with Fisher Information Matrix estimates that the optimal\ninformation gain can be achieved in practice.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aENWT20RG35jZrS2FB4lMDz_Wmw761ffaNaHPnjtgkg","pdfSize":"1465878","txDigest":"VQo2xmbUrb9Zt3hgHpo87TbJGxWAuN1BFEsaG7igqXh","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
