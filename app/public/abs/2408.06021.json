However, existing\nstudies typically use sparse click maps as model inputs to segment specific\ntarget objects, which primarily affect local regions and have limited abilities\nto focus on the whole target object, leading to increased times of clicks. In\naddition, most existing algorithms can not balance well between high\nperformance and efficiency. To address this issue, we propose a click attention\nalgorithm that expands the influence range of positive clicks based on the\nsimilarity between positively-clicked regions and the whole input. We also\npropose a discriminative affinity loss to reduce the attention coupling between\npositive and negative click regions to avoid an accuracy decrease caused by\nmutual interference between positive and negative clicks. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate that our approach is superior to existing methods and achieves\ncutting-edge performance in fewer parameters. An interactive demo and all\nreproducible codes will be released at\nhttps://github.com/hahamyt/ClickAttention.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
