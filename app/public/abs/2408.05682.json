Recent work has\nproposed a class of parallel GBFS algorithms which constrains search to\nexploration of the Bench Transition System (BTS), which is the set of states\nthat can be expanded by GBFS under some tie-breaking policy. However, enforcing\nthis constraint is costly, as such BTS-constrained algorithms are forced to\nspend much of the time waiting so that only states which are guaranteed to be\nin the BTS are expanded. We propose an improvement to parallel search which\ndecouples state generation and state evaluation and significantly improves\nstate evaluation rate, resulting in better search performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
