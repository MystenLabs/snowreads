Following the principles of the partition of the\nvariance advocated by Sir R.A. Fisher, the experimental responses are factored\ninto the quantitative contribution of main factors and interactions. A popular\napproach to perform this factorization in both ANOVA and ASCA(+) is through\nGeneral Linear Models. Subsequently, different inferential approaches can be\nused to identify whether the contributions are statistically significant or\nnot. Unfortunately, the performance of inferential approaches in terms of Type\nI and Type II errors can be heavily affected by missing data, outliers and/or\nthe departure from normality of the distribution of the responses, which are\ncommonplace problems in modern analytical experiments. In this paper, we study\nthese problem and suggest good practices of application.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
