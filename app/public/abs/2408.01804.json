Although, geometrically the Euclidean dimension of\nthe cubical shell is three, interestingly, the Ising ferromagnetic cubic shell\nundergoes ferromagnetic phase transition at a temperature which is very close\nto that for two-dimensional Ising ferromagnet. Surprisingly, the Ising\nferromagnetic cubic shell shows a strange (neither exponential nor stretched\nexponential) kind of relaxation behaviour, instead of exponential relaxation as\nusually observed in the two dimensional Ising ferromagnet. The metastable\nlifetime of a ferromagnetic Ising cubical shell is studied as a function of the\napplied magnetic field. Here also, the cubic shell behaves more likely a\ntwo-dimensional object as found from statistical analysis and comparison with\nBecker-D\\\"oring prediction of classical nucleation theory.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
