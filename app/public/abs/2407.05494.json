It is therefore essential that\ncommunication delays be accounted for, both in computational models of\nbiological neural networks and in large-scale neuromorphic systems.\nNonetheless, communication delays have yet to be comprehensively addressed in\neither domain. In this paper, we first show that delays prevent\nstate-of-the-art continuous-time neural networks called Latent Equilibrium (LE)\nnetworks from learning even simple tasks despite significant\noverparameterization. We then propose to compensate for communication delays by\npredicting future signals based on currently available ones. This conceptually\nstraightforward approach, which we call prospective messaging (PM), uses only\nneuron-local information, and is flexible in terms of memory and computation\nrequirements. We demonstrate that incorporating PM into delayed LE networks\nprevents reaction lags, and facilitates successful learning on Fourier\nsynthesis and autoregressive video prediction tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
