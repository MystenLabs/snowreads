Timely and accurate\ndetection of bearing faults plays an important role in preventing catastrophic\naccidents and ensuring product quality. Traditional signal analysis techniques\nand deep learning-based fault detection algorithms do not take into account the\nintricate correlation between signals, making it difficult to further improve\ndetection accuracy. To address this problem, we introduced Graph Sampling and\nAggregation (GraphSAGE) network and proposed GraphSAGE-based Bearing fault\nDiagnosis (GSABFD) algorithm. The original vibration signal is firstly sliced\nthrough a fixed size non-overlapping sliding window, and the sliced data is\nfeature transformed using signal analysis methods; then correlations are\nconstructed for the transformed vibration signal and further transformed into\nvertices in the graph; then the GraphSAGE network is used for training; finally\nthe fault level of the object is calculated in the output layer of the network.\nThe proposed algorithm is compared with five advanced algorithms in a\nreal-world public dataset for experiments, and the results show that the GSABFD\nalgorithm improves the AUC value by 5% compared with the next best algorithm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
