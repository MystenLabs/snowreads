However, the importance of studying homogenization results for parabolic\nequations with lower-order terms cannot be understated. In this study, we aim\nto extend the analysis to homogenization for the general parabolic equation\nwith random coefficients:\n  \\begin{equation*}\n  \\partial_{t}p^\\epsilon-\\nabla\\cdot\\left(\\mathbf{a}\\left(\n\\dfrac{x}{\\epsilon},\\dfrac{t}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)\\nabla\np^\\epsilon\\right)-\\mathbf{b}\\left(\n\\dfrac{x}{\\epsilon},\\dfrac{t}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)\\nabla p^\\epsilon\n-\\mathbf{d}\\left( \\dfrac{x}{\\epsilon},\\dfrac{t}{\\epsilon^2}\\right)\np^\\epsilon=0.\n  \\end{equation*}\n  Moreover, we establish the Caccioppoli inequality and Meyers estimate for the\ngeneralized parabolic equation. By using the generalized Meyers estimate, we\nget the weak convergence of $p^\\epsilon$ in $H^1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
