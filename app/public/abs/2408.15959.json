Recently, there has been increasing interest in enhancing\ntheir sensitivity to single photons in the mid-infrared spectrum, driven by\napplications in quantum communication, spectroscopy and astrophysics. Here, we\npresent our efforts to expand the spectral detection capabilities of U-shaped\nNbTiN-based superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors, fabricated in a\n2-wire configuration on a silicon-on-insulator substrate, into the mid-infrared\nrange. We demonstrate saturated internal detection efficiency extending up to a\nwavelength of 3.5 {\\mu}m for a 5 nm thick and 50 nm wide NbTiN nanowire with a\ndark count rate less than 10 counts per second at 0.9 K and a rapid recovery\ntime of 4.3 ns. The detectors are engineered for integration on waveguides in a\nsilicon-on-insulator platform for compact, multi-channel device applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ip1KI_q_rGi4ZVye06FngpUlL2M2MksrW4HjZ2i3HVs","pdfSize":"1194036"}
