In this work, we propose\nMonte Carlo physics-informed neural networks (MC-PINNs), which do not suffer\nfrom the \"curse of dimensionality\", to solve the phonon BTE to model the\nmultiscale heat conduction in solid materials. MC-PINNs use a deep neural\nnetwork to approximate the solution to the BTE, and encode the BTE as well as\nthe corresponding boundary/initial conditions using the automatic\ndifferentiation. In addition, we propose a novel two-step sampling approach to\naddress inefficiency and inaccuracy issues in the widely used sampling methods\nin PINNs. In particular, we first randomly sample a certain number of points in\nthe temporal-spatial space (Step I), and then draw another number of points\nrandomly in the solid angular space (Step II). The training points are\nconstructed using the tensor product of the data drawn from the above two\nsteps. The two-step sampling strategy enables MC-PINNs (1) to model the heat\nconduction from ballistic to diffusive regimes, and (2) is more\nmemory-efficient compared to conventional numerical solvers or existing PINNs\nfor BTE. A series of numerical examples including quasi-one-dimensional\n(quasi-1D) steady/unsteady heat conduction in a film, and the heat conduction\nin a quasi-two- and three-dimensional square domain, are conducted to justify\nthe effectiveness of the MC-PINN for heat conduction spanning diffusive and\nballistic regimes. Finally, we compare the computational time and memory usage\nof the MC-PINN and a state-of-art numerical methods to demonstrate the\npotential of the MC-PINN for large scale problems in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
