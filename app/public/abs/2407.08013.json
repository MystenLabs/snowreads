We study (finite type\n$\\mathbb{N}$-graded) upho lattices, with an eye towards their classification.\nAny upho lattice has associated to it a finite graded lattice called its core,\nwhich determines its rank generating function. We investigate which finite\ngraded lattices arise as cores of upho lattices, providing both positive and\nnegative results. On the one hand, we show that many well-studied finite\nlattices do arise as cores, and we present combinatorial and algebraic\nconstructions of the upho lattices into which they embed. On the other hand, we\nshow there are obstructions which prevent many finite lattices from being\ncores.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RMYK_YHEKEf9qhgz3vaRpnmuzhQapKoO3MzsX--EYAc","pdfSize":"443609"}
