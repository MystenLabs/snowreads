For instance, we establish a version of\nthe A'Campo-L\\^e Theorem adapted for foliations, which was originally\nformulated for hypersurfaces. More precisely, we show that, under certain\nconditions, the algebraic multiplicity equals to 1 of holomorphic\none-dimensional foliations is a topological invariant. As a consequence, we\nprove that saddle-nodes are also topological invariant. Additionally, we\naddress a fundamental result in the literature concerning Mattei's conjecture\nproved by Rosas-Bazan, which says that under the existence of a homeomorphism\nextending throughout a neighborhood of the exceptional divisor of the first\nblowing up, Mattei's conjecture has a positive answer. As a consequence of a\ncharacterization of the invariance of multiplicity proved here, we obtain that\nMattei's conjecture has a positive answer if the homeomorphism extends locally\nin a small neighborhood where there is a separatrix not contained in the\nexceptional divisor of the first blowing up, but not necessarily extends\nthroughout a neighborhood of whole exceptional divisor.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
