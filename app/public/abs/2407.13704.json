However, existing equation\ndiscovery algorithms rely on the availability of noisy measurements of the\nstate variables (i.e., displacement {and velocity}). This is a major bottleneck\nin structural dynamics, where we often only have access to acceleration\nmeasurements. To that end, this paper introduces a novel equation discovery\nalgorithm for discovering governing equations of dynamical systems from\nacceleration-only measurements. The proposed algorithm employs a library-based\napproach for equation discovery. To enable equation discovery from\nacceleration-only measurements, we propose a novel Approximate Bayesian\nComputation (ABC) model that prioritizes parsimonious models. The efficacy of\nthe proposed algorithm is illustrated using {four} structural dynamics examples\nthat include both linear and nonlinear dynamical systems. The case studies\npresented illustrate the possible application of the proposed approach for\nequation discovery of dynamical systems from acceleration-only measurements.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MO4_qPxlnatZadRjvDlYScsE7a_rBiIuhnEMwFWYVPI","pdfSize":"823914"}
