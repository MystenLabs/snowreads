Unlike traditional stacking methods,\nCDST allows model weights to vary flexibly as a function of covariates, thereby\nenhancing predictive performance in complex scenarios. We formulate the\ncovariate-dependent weights through combinations of basis functions, estimate\nthem by optimizing cross-validation, and develop an expectation-maximization\nalgorithm, ensuring computational efficiency. To analyze the theoretical\nproperties, we establish an oracle inequality regarding the expected loss to be\nminimized for estimating model weights. Through comprehensive simulation\nstudies and an application to large-scale land price prediction, we demonstrate\nthat the CDST consistently outperforms conventional model averaging methods,\nparticularly on datasets where some models fail to capture the underlying\ncomplexity. Our findings suggest that the CDST is especially valuable for, but\nnot limited to, spatio-temporal prediction problems, offering a powerful tool\nfor researchers and practitioners in various data analysis fields.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
