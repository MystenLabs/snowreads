However, when data are\navailable over time, this learning method is not suitable anymore. Online\nlearning is increasingly used to update the online models from stream data. A\nrehearsal technique is typically used, which entails re-training the model on a\nsmall training set that is updated each time new data is received.\n  The main challenge in this regard is the construction of the training set\nwith appropriate data samples to maintain good model performance. Typically, a\nrandom selection of samples is made, which can deteriorate the model's\nperformance. In this paper, we propose a memory-based online incremental\nlearning approach for updating an online classifier that predicts student\nperformance using stream data. The approach is based on the use of the genetic\nalgorithm heuristic while respecting the memory space constraints as well as\nthe balance of class labels. In contrast to random selection, our approach\nimproves the stability of the analytical model by promoting diversity when\ncreating the training set. As a proof of concept, we applied it to the open\ndataset OULAD. Our approach achieves a notable improvement in model accuracy,\nwith an enhancement of nearly 10% compared to the current state-of-the-art,\nwhile maintaining a relatively low standard deviation in accuracy, ranging from\n1% to 2.1%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
