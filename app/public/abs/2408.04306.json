In most practical applications, while the\nvoice identity should be sanitised, other attributes such as the spoken content\nshould be preserved. There is always a trade-off; all approaches reported thus\nfar sacrifice spoken content for anonymisation performance. We report what is,\nto the best of our knowledge, the first attempt to actively preserve spoken\ncontent in voice anonymisation. We show how the output of an auxiliary\nautomatic speech recognition model can be used to condition the vocoder module\nof an anonymisation system using a set of learnable embedding dictionaries in\norder to preserve spoken content. Relative to a baseline approach, and for only\na modest cost in anonymisation performance, the technique is successful in\ndecreasing the word error rate computed from anonymised utterances by almost\n60%.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
