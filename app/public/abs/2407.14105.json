We\ninvestigate several notions of quasi-isometric reductions between recursive\ninfinite strings and prove various results on the equivalence classes of such\nreductions. The main result is the construction of two infinite recursive\nstrings $\\alpha$ and $\\beta$ such that $\\alpha$ is strictly quasi-isometrically\nreducible to $\\beta$, but the reduction cannot be made recursive. This answers\nan open problem posed by Khoussainov and Takisaka.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Formal Languages and Automata Theory","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
