We assess whether the advanced\ncomputational capabilities of QGANs can enhance the modeling of complex\nstochastic distribution beyond the traditional mathematical models,\nparticularly the Markov model. The findings indicate that while QGANs\ndemonstrate potential in approximating complex distributions, the Markov model\nconsistently outperforms in accurately replicating the real data distribution.\nThis comparison underlines the challenges and avenues for refinement in time\nseries data generation using quantum computing techniques. It emphasizes the\nneed for further optimization of quantum models to better align with real-world\ndata characteristics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
