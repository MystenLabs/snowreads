In this study, we focus on a scenario where a\nconnected and autonomous vehicle (CAV) serves as the central agent, utilizing\nboth sensors and communication technologies to perceive its surrounding\ntraffics consisting of autonomous vehicles (AVs), connected vehicles (CVs), and\nhuman-driven vehicles (HDVs). Our trajectory prediction task is aimed at all\nthe detected surrounding vehicles. To effectively integrate the multi-source\ndata from both sensor and communication technologies, we propose a deep\nlearning framework called MSMA utilizing a cross-attention module for\nmulti-source data fusion. Vector map data is utilized to provide contextual\ninformation. The trajectory dataset is collected in CARLA simulator with\nsynthesized data errors introduced. Numerical experiments demonstrate that in a\nmixed traffic flow scenario, the integration of data from different sources\nenhances our understanding of the environment. This notably improves trajectory\nprediction accuracy, particularly in situations with a high CV market\npenetration rate.
