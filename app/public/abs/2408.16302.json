Combining with geometric\nphases of eigenstates gives rise to unique properties of non-Hermitian systems,\nand their classifications have been studied recently. However, the physical\nrealizations of classes of the classifications have been relatively limited\nbecause a small number of modes and exceptional points are involved. In this\nwork, we show in microcavities that all five classes [J.-W. Ryu, et al.,\nCommun. Phys. 7, 109 (2024)] of three modes can emerge with three exceptional\npoints. In demonstrations, we identified various combinations of exceptional\npoints within a two-dimensional parameter space of a single microcavity and\ndefined five distinct encircling loops based on three selected exceptional\npoints. According to the classification, these loops facilitate different mode\nexchanges and the acquisition of additional geometric phases during the\nadiabatic encircling of exceptional points. Our results provide a broad\ndescription of the geometric phases-associated topology induced by multiple\nexceptional points in realistic physical systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tzWKz1h8obZ4RsNckIQlRbv0AxBG2OWk4m456uj-sbo","pdfSize":"1584177"}
