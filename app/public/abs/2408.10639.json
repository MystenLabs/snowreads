Digitized control pulses are programmed\nin an open source software development kit, qiskit, to execute the shortcut\nprotocols. The obtained results shows the robustness of the NOBIE method, even\nthough it is tested for an effective Hamiltonian of a qubit irrespective of the\ninteraction with other qubits and noise associated with the control pulses.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
