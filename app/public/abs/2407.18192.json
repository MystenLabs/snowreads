The key is that these prefactorization algebras over\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ are equivalent to algebras over the little $n$-disc operad. For\ntopological field theories with defects, we get analogous results by replacing\n$\\mathbb{R}^n$ with the spaces modelling corners\n$\\mathbb{R}^p\\times\\mathbb{R}^{q}_{\\geq 0}$. As a toy example in $1d$, we\nquantize, once more, constant Poisson structures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
