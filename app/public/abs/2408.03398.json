To investigate whether\nmeasurement disturbance is a viable explanation for these counter-intuitive\nphenomena, we employ the first ever variable-strength measurement of a\nnon-local observable. As we decrease the measurement strength, we find the\nviolation of the sum rule decreases, yet the pigeonhole principle remains\nviolated. In the weak limit, the sum rule is restored due to the cancellation\nbetween two weak values with equal and opposite imaginary parts. We observe the\nsame kind of cancellation at higher measurement strengths, thus raising the\nquestion: do strong measurements have imaginary parts?\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
