Several properties of the nilpotent graph associated\nwith a finite non-nilpotent group G are studied in this work. Lower bounds for\nthe clique number and the number of connected components of the nilpotent graph\nof G are presented in terms of the size of its Fitting subgroup and the number\nof its strongly self-centralizing subgroups, respectively. It is proved the\nnilpotent graph of the symmetric group of degree n is disconnected if and only\nif n or n-1 is a prime number, and no finite non-nilpotent group has a\nself-complementary nilpotent graph. For the dihedral group Dn, it is determined\nthe number of connected components of its nilpotent graph is one more than n\nwhen n is odd; or one more than the 2'-part of n when n is even. In addition, a\nformula for the number of connected components of the nilpotent graph of\nPSL(2,q), where q is a prime power, is provided. Finally, necessary and\nsufficient conditions for specific subsets of a group, containing connected\ncomponents of its nilpotent graph, to contain one of its Sylow p-subgroups are\nstudied; and it is shown the nilpotent graph of a finite non-nilpotent group G\nwith nil(G) of even order is non-Eulerian.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
