Despite their\npromise, deploying neural ODEs in practical applications often encounters the\nchallenge of stiffness, a condition where rapid variations in some components\nof the solution demand prohibitively small time steps for explicit solvers.\nThis work addresses the stiffness issue when employing neural ODEs for model\norder reduction by introducing a suitable reparametrization in time. The\nconsidered map is data-driven and it is induced by the adaptive time-stepping\nof an implicit solver on a reference solution. We show the map produces a\nnonstiff system that can be cheaply solved with an explicit time integration\nscheme. The original, stiff, time dynamic is recovered by means of a map learnt\nby a neural network that connects the state space to the time\nreparametrization. We validate our method through extensive experiments,\ndemonstrating improvements in efficiency for the neural ODE inference while\nmaintaining robustness and accuracy. The neural network model also showcases\ngood generalization properties for times beyond the training data.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
