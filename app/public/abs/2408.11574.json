Key features include multi-agent workflows with delegation, dynamic\nprompt assembly, and model-agnostic design. The Drama Engine introduces unique\nelements such as companion development, mood systems, and automatic context\nsummarising. It is implemented in TypeScript. The framework's applications\ninclude multi-agent chats and virtual co-workers for creative writing. The\npaper discusses the system's architecture, prompt assembly process, delegation\nmechanisms, and moderation techniques, as well as potential ethical\nconsiderations and future extensions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
