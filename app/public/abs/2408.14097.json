However, with these advancements come challenges in managing\nintra-cell and inter-cell interference, particularly during the random-access\nprocedure. This article aims to explore the impact of UE (User Equipment) and\ncell configuration parameters on interference and establish improved\ninterference management strategies. To assess the effectiveness of these\nstrategies, Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as Correct Detection Rate\n(CDR) will be considered. Additionally, the Matched Filtering (MF)-Based PRACH\n(Physical Random-Access CHannel) detection algorithm will be studied to\nevaluate the PRACH performance. The findings underscore the critical role of\ninterference management and the configuration of User Equipment (UE)/Cell\nparameters in ensuring the robustness and reliability of the NR-PRACH\nperformance in 5G NR networks. Optimizing these configurations can lead to\nimproved network performance and enhanced communication quality.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"neiP8MXxv1XMxGbwtUEgx6Mmk7zydg-HnW0rn9pmXPo","pdfSize":"2157546"}
