Here, we introduce a novel architecture of\nphotonic circuits capable of implementing non-unitary transfer matrices,\nusually required by photonic neural networks, iterative equation solvers or\nquantum samplers. Our architecture exploits compact low-depth beam-splitter\nmeshes rather than bulky fully connected mixing blocks used in previous\ndesigns, making it more compatible with planar integrated photonics technology.\nWe have shown that photonic circuits designed with our architecture have lower\ndepth than their standard counterparts and are extremely tolerant to hardware\nerrors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
