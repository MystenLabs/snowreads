If the solute concentration decreases with height, the system is\nalways in a condition of stable mechanical equilibrium against gravity. We show\nexperimentally that this mechanical equilibrium becomes unstable in case\ncolloidal particles are dispersed uniformly within the mixture, and that the\nresulting colloidal suspension undergoes a transient convective instability\nwith the onset of convection patterns. By means of a numerical analysis, we\nclarify the microscopic mechanism from which the observed destabilisation\nprocess originates. The solute concentration gradient drives an upward\ndiffusiophoretic migration of colloids, in turn causing the development of a\nmechanically unstable layer within the sample, where the density of the\nsuspension increases with height. Convective motions arise to minimize this\nlocalized rise in gravitational potential energy.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
