The\nJohn ellipsoid has become fundamental in mathematics, with extensive\napplications in high-dimensional sampling, linear programming, and machine\nlearning. Designing faster algorithms to compute the John ellipsoid is\ntherefore an important and emerging problem. In [Cohen, Cousins, Lee, Yang COLT\n2019], they established an algorithm for approximating the John ellipsoid for a\nsymmetric convex polytope defined by a matrix $A \\in \\mathbb{R}^{n \\times d}$\nwith a time complexity of $O(nd^2)$. This was later improved to\n$O(\\text{nnz}(A) + d^\\omega)$ by [Song, Yang, Yang, Zhou 2022], where\n$\\text{nnz}(A)$ is the number of nonzero entries of $A$ and $\\omega$ is the\nmatrix multiplication exponent. Currently $\\omega \\approx 2.371$ [Alman, Duan,\nWilliams, Xu, Xu, Zhou 2024]. In this work, we present the first quantum\nalgorithm that computes the John ellipsoid utilizing recent advances in quantum\nalgorithms for spectral approximation and leverage score approximation, running\nin $O(\\sqrt{n}d^{1.5} + d^\\omega)$ time. In the tall matrix regime, our\nalgorithm achieves quadratic speedup, resulting in a sublinear running time and\nsignificantly outperforming the current best classical algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k1ET4OJzme8O2RjOH_7MspkNU-_tTlOoucwkTsjuklk","pdfSize":"339877"}
