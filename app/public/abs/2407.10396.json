By employing cyclic operators and a qudit T gate, we generalise the\ndihedral benchmarking scheme for single- and multi-qudit circuits. Our results\nestablish a path for experimentally benchmarking qudit systems and are of\ntheoretical and experimental interest because our scheme is optimal insofar as\nit does not require preparation of the full qudit Clifford gate set to\ncharacterise a non-Clifford gate. Moreover, combined with Clifford randomised\nbenchmarking, our scheme is useful to characterise the generators of a\nuniversal gate set.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
