Our model represents a systematic approach to constructing\nvisual representations of data or concepts following a predefined sequence of\nsteps. The initial step involves outlining the overall appearance of the\nvisualisation by creating a skeleton structure, referred to as a flowpath.\nSubsequently, we specify objects, visual marks, properties, and appearance,\nstoring them in a gene. Lastly, we map data onto the flowpath, ensuring\nsuitable morphisms. Alternative designs are created by exchanging values in the\ngene. For example, designs that share similar traits, are created by making\nsmall incremental changes to the gene. Our design methodology fosters the\ngeneration of diverse creative concepts, space-filling visualisations, and\ntraditional formats like bar charts, circular plots and pie charts. Through our\nimplementation we showcase the model in action. As an example application, we\nintegrate the output visualisations onto a smartwatch and visualisation\ndashboards. In this article we (1) introduce, define and explain the path model\nand discuss possibilities for its use, (2) present our implementation, results,\nand evaluation, and (3) demonstrate and evaluate an application of its use on a\nmobile watch.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
