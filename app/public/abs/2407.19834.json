We\npropose a new convolutional neural network (CNN) called FCA-Net, which combines\nmixer unit-based feature interaction with a two-dimensional convolution-based\nattention module. First, we introduce and compare lightweight attention methods\nto enhance noise robustness in CNN. Then, we propose an attention module that\ncreates fine-grained attention weights to capture channel and\nfrequency-specific information, boosting the model's ability to handle noisy\nconditions. By combining the mixer unit-based feature interaction with the\nattention module, we enhance performance. Additionally, we use a\ncurriculum-based multi-condition training strategy. Our experiments show that\nour system outperforms current state-of-the-art solutions for small-footprint\nKWS in noisy environments, making it reliable for real-world use.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
