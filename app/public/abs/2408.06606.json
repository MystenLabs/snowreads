We prove that the sequence generated\nby the proposed algorithm from any initial point converges to a solution of the\npseudomonotone variational inequality problem without assuming the Lipschitz\ncontinuity and contractive condition, which are used for convergence analysis\nof the extra gradient method and Anderson-accelerated method, respectively in\nexisting literatures. Numerical experiments, particular emphasis on Harker-Pang\nproblem, fractional programming, nonlinear complementarity problem and PDE\nproblem with free boundary, are conducted to validate the effectiveness and\ngood performance of the proposed algorithm comparing with the extra gradient\nmethod and Anderson-accelerated method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
