Specifically, we consider the dissipative versions of two\nwell known fractional maps: the Riemann-Liouville (RL) and the Caputo (C)\nfractional standard maps (fSMs). Both fSMs are two-dimensional nonlinear maps\nwith memory given in action-angle variables $(I_n,\\theta_n)$; $n$ being the\ndiscrete iteration time of the maps. In the dissipative versions these fSMs are\nparameterized by the strength of nonlinearity $K$, the fractional order of the\nderivative $\\alpha\\in(1,2]$, and the dissipation strength $\\gamma\\in(0,1]$. In\nthis work we focus on the average action $\\left< I_n \\right>$ and the average\nsquared action $\\left< I_n^2 \\right>$ when~$K\\gg1$, i.e. along strongly chaotic\norbits. We first demonstrate, for $|I_0|>K$, that dissipation produces the\nexponential decay of the average action $\\left< I_n \\right> \\approx\nI_0\\exp(-\\gamma n)$ in both dissipative fSMs. Then, we show that while $\\left<\nI_n^2 \\right>_{RL-fSM}$ barely depends on $\\alpha$ (effects are visible only\nwhen $\\alpha\\to 1$), any $\\alpha< 2$ strongly influences the behavior of\n$\\left< I_n^2 \\right>_{C-fSM}$. We also derive an analytical expression able to\ndescribe $\\left< I_n^2 \\right>_{RL-fSM}(K,\\alpha,\\gamma)$.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
