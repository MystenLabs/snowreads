Stellar irradiation dominates heating across much of these disks, so\nan uneven illumination can have interesting dynamical effects. Here, we focus\non transition disks. We carry out 3D Athena++ simulations, using a constant\nthermal relaxation time to describe the disk's response to changing stellar\nillumination. We find that an asymmetric shadow, a feature commonly observed in\nreal disks, perturbs the radial pressure gradient and distorts the fluid\nstreamlines into a set of twisted ellipses. Interactions between these\nstreamlines have a range of consequences. For a narrow ring, an asymmetric\nshadow can sharply truncate its inner edge, possibly explaining the steep\ndensity drop-offs observed in some disks and obviating the need for massive\nperturbers. For a wide ring, such a shadow can dismantle it into two (or\npossibly more) eccentric rings. These rings continuously exert torque on each\nother and drive gas accretion at a healthy rate, even in the absence of disk\nviscosity. Signatures of such twisted eccentric rings may have already been\nobserved as, e.g., twisted velocity maps inside gas cavities. We advocate for\nmore targeted observations, and for a better understanding on the origin of\nsuch shadows.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
