For a prime $p\\not\\in S$, the vanishing loci\nof the images of such functions under the $p$-adic period map contain the\nsolutions of the $S$-unit equation. In the case $\\vert S\\vert=2$, we explicitly\nconstruct a non-trivial motivic Chabauty-Kim function in depth 6 of degree 18,\nand prove that there do not exist any other Chabauty-Kim functions with smaller\ndepth and degree. The method, inspired by work of Dan-Cohen and the first\nauthor, enhances the geometric step algorithm developed by Corwin and\nDan-Cohen, providing a more efficient approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
