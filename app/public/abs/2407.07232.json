These baryons are some of the most interesting Standard\nModel particles which have not yet been detected, as they bear on the short\nrange (colour) behaviour of the nuclear force. The spectrum here obtained is\ncompatible with predictions from earlier works, with our uncertainty dominated\nby traditional few-body approximations (size of the variational basis, center\nof mass recoil, parameter estimation...) and not by the statistical error from\nthe quantum computer (deployed here as a small diagonalizer), which turns out\nto be negligible respect to the other sources of uncertainty, at least in the\npresent unsophisticated few-body approximation. We have also substituted one or\nmore heavy quarks for strange quarks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
