With monolayer\nGeS as an example, it is predicted that ballistic currents can exceed shift\ncurrents under experimentally accessible conditions. Moreover, these\nsimulations reveal recombination pathways that work to modify shift current\nmagnitudes beyond perturbation theory predictions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
