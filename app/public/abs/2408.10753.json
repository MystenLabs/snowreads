They may be considered to be long-sought\nstrongly electron-overdoped Ag(II)F2. Their crystal structures indicate that\nboth belong to the Class I (mixed-valence) family with frozen Ag(I) and Ag(II)\nvalences. The measured Raman spectra are well-correlated with the theoretical\nones. Density functional theory calculations reveal their smaller fundamental\nband gaps as compared to pristine AgF2, due to the presence of Ag(I) states in\nthe valence band.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
