The\nsystem is comprised of two embedded subsystems named \"Wearable\" and \"Benchtop\"\nwhich communicates with one another over UPD/IP protocol. The Wearable unit can\ndifferentiate the emotional arousal into three distinct classes (Normal, Medium\nand High) based on physiological data whilst the Benchtop unit can display\ndifferent colors on a 16 digit NEOPIXEL ring and, play tones to emulate\nactuation of peripheral devices in the smart home environment. Experiments with\nthree video clips were performed which showed that the system can classify\nemotional arousal with an average accuracy of 41%. An FSM model of the Benchtop\nunit was created using Ptolemy II which showed the model to be fully\ndeterministic and robust to communication disruption between the two units. The\nproposed project will add a new paradigm in smart home and IoT research by\nincorporating emotional feedback to automatically adjust the indoor environment\nfor greater comfort, ease of living and in-home assisted ambulatory care for\nthe residents.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
