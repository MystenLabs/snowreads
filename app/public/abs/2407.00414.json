Our method guarantees safety and local asymptotic\nstability without the need for an asymptotically stabilizing control law.\nFeasibility of the proposed program is ensured under a mild regularity\ncondition, termed relaxed compatibility between the CLF and CBF. The resulting\noptimal control law is guaranteed to be locally Lipschitz continuous. We also\nanalyze the closed-loop behaviour by characterizing the equilibrium points, and\nverifying that there are no equilibrium points in the interior of the control\ninvariant set except at the origin. For a polynomial system and a\nsemi-algebraic safe set, we provide a sum-of-squares program to design a\nrelaxed compatible pair of CLF and CBF. The proposed approach is compared with\nother methods in the literature using numerical examples, exhibits superior\nfilter performance and guarantees safety and local stability.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
