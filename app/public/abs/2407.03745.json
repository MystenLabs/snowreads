However, in the multi-party cloud\ncomputing scenario, how to select a Relying Party to verify the TEE of each\nparty and avoid leaking sensitive data to each other remains an open question.\nIn this paper, we propose SRAS, an open self-governed remote attestation scheme\nwith attestation and verification functions for verifying the trustworthiness\nof TEEs and computing assets, achieving decentralized unified trusted\nattestation and verification platform for multi-party cloud users. In SRAS, we\ndesign a Relying Party enclave, which can form a virtual verifiable network,\ncapable of local verification on behalf of other participants relying parties\nwithout leaking sensitive data to others. We provide an open-source prototype\nimplementation of SRAS to facilitate the adoption of this technology by cloud\nusers or developers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
