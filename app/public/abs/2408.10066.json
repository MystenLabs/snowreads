We consider general agent\nutility distributions and two standard settings: a finite horizon $T$ and an\ninfinite horizon with $\\gamma$ discounts. We provide general tools to\ncharacterize the convergence rate between the optimal mechanism for the central\nplanner and the first-best allocation if true agent utilities were available.\nThis heavily depends on the utility distributions, yielding rates anywhere\nbetween $1/\\sqrt T$ and $1/T$ for the finite-horizon setting, and rates faster\nthan $\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}$, including exponential rates for the infinite-horizon\nsetting as agents are more patient $\\gamma\\to 1$. On the algorithmic side, we\ndesign mechanisms based on the promised-utility framework to achieve these\nrates and leverage structure on the utility distributions. Intuitively, the\nmore flexibility the central planner has to reward or penalize any agent while\nincurring little social welfare cost, the faster the convergence rate. In\nparticular, discrete utility distributions typically yield the slower rates\n$1/\\sqrt T$ and $\\sqrt{1-\\gamma}$, while smooth distributions with density\ntypically yield faster rates $1/T$ (up to logarithmic factors) and $1-\\gamma$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Economics/Theoretical Economics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
