While clinicians consider this interplay between\nanatomy and pathology, recent deep learning algorithms specialize in\nrecognizing either one of the two, rarely considering the patient's body from\nsuch a joint perspective. In this paper, we develop a generalist segmentation\nmodel that combines anatomical and pathological information, aiming to enhance\nthe segmentation accuracy of pathological features. Our Anatomy-Pathology\nExchange (APEx) training utilizes a query-based segmentation transformer which\ndecodes a joint feature space into query-representations for human anatomy and\ninterleaves them via a mixing strategy into the pathology-decoder for\nanatomy-informed pathology predictions. In doing so, we are able to report the\nbest results across the board on FDG-PET-CT and Chest X-Ray pathology\nsegmentation tasks with a margin of up to 3.3% as compared to strong baseline\nmethods.
