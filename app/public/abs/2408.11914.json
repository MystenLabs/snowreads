The MUDF includes $\\sim$140h\nof VLT/MUSE data and 90 orbits of HST/G141M grism observations alongside\nVLT/UVES spectroscopy of the two quasars and several bands of HST imaging. We\ncompare the metal absorption around galaxies in this field as a function of\nimpact parameter, azimuthal angle and galaxy metallicity across redshifts 0.5\n$<$ z $<$ 3.2. Due to the depth of our data and a large field-of-view, our\nanalysis extends to low stellar masses ($<$ $10^{7}$ M$_{\\odot}$) and high\nimpact parameters ($>$ 600 kpc). We find a correlation between absorber\nequivalent width and number of nearby galaxies, but do not detect a significant\nanti-correlation with impact parameter. Our full sample does not show any\nsignificant change in absorber incidence as a function of azimuthal angle.\nHowever, we do find a bimodality in the azimuthal angle distribution of\nabsorption at small impact parameters ($<$2 r$_{vir}$) and around\nhighly-star-forming galaxies, possibly indicating disk-like accretion and\nbiconical outflows. Finally, we do not detect any systematic deviation from the\nfundamental metallicity relation (FMR) among galaxies with detected absorption.\nThis work is limited by gaps in the wavelength coverage of our current data;\nbroader-wavelength observations with JWST will allow us to unlock the full\npotential of the MUDF for studying the CGM.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"vcspsQyoseMDdefj3sIZR0Ind_4QOg1RhkLLeiJTVQU","pdfSize":"1647353"}
