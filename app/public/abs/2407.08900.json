In particular, it is shown that such a study\nis related to the preservation of k-smoothness and the extremal properties of\nthe unit ball of a Banach space. As an application of the results obtained in\nthis direction, we obtain a refinement of the well-known\nBlanco-Koldobsky-Turnsek characterization of isometries on some polyhedral\nBanach spaces, including $ \\ell_{\\infty}^n, \\ell_1^n. $\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
