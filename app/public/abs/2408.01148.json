This paper tries to add a new narrative and\nsome new facets with respect to this story under the auspices of the spectral\ntheorem. The latter states that any self-adjoint and bounded operator is\nunitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator on some (semi-finite) measure\nspace. We will exploit this fact and derive a distribution function from the\ncorresponding multiplier, the growth behavior of which at zero allows us to\ncharacterize the degree of ill-posedness. We prove that this new concept\ncoincides with the well-known one for compact operators (by means of their\nsingular values), and illustrate the implications along examples including the\nHausdorff moment operator and convolutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
