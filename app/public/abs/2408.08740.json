In\naddition to constraining the equation of state for anisotropic dark energy and\nother standard cosmological model parameters, we also constrain any underlying\nanisotropic axis using the latest Pantheon+ Type Ia Supernovae data set\naugmented by SH0ES Cepheid distance calibrators. The mean anisotropic dark\nenergy equation of state and corresponding difference in the equation of states\nin and normal to the plane of our axisymmetric Bianchi-I space-time are found\nto be $\\bar{w}=-0.90^{+0.16}_{-0.12}$ and $\\delta_w=-0.140^{+0.11}_{-0.082}$\nrespectively. We also find an axis of anisotropy in this planar Bianchi-I model\nwith anisotropic dark energy to be $\\approx(279^{\\circ} ,12^{\\circ})$ in\ngalactic coordinates. Our analysis of different cosmological models suggests\nthat while a Bianchi-I universe with anisotropic dark energy (the $w_b$CDM\nmodel) shows some preference over other anisotropic models, it is still less\nlikely than the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model or a model with a constant dark\nenergy equation of state ($w$CDM). Overall, the $\\Lambda$CDM model remains the\nmost probable model based on the Akaike Information Criterion.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
