The earlier evidence was derived from\nnewly precise measurements of the Universe, including its mass density, the\nHubble constant, the age of the oldest stars, the filamentary large-scale\nstructure, and the anisotropy of the cosmic microwave background. These\nmeasurements created tension for models assuming the cosmological constant was\nzero. This tension was alleviated by several insightful papers published before\n1996, which proposed a cosmological constant that increased the expansion rate.\nStatistical analysis here shows that the probability of the cosmological\nconstant being zero was demonstrably less than a few percent. Some models\nidentified a best-fit value close to the modern estimate of Omega_Lambda ~ 0.7.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
