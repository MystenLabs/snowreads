Hence, the ringdown properties, namely its start time,\ndepend on both functions. The unknown time-shift encoded in the Green's\nfunction introduces a \"time-shift problem\" for ringdown. We study the ringdown\ntime-shift problem by reconstructing a waveform via the excitation factors of\nquasi-normal modes (QNMs) of a spinning black hole. For the first time, we\nreconstruct ringdown with a significant number of QNMs weighted with their\nexcitation factors and confirm its excellent convergence. We then precisely\nidentify the ringdown starting time. We also find (i) that for moderate or\nlarge spins and $\\ell=m=2$, QNMs should be included up to around the $20$th\nprograde overtones and around fifth retrograde overtones to reconstruct the\nringdown waveform for the delta-function source with a mismatch threshold $ M <\nO(10^{-3})$. For higher angular modes, a more significant number of QNMs are\nnecessary to reconstruct it; (ii) that the time shift of ringdown caused by the\nGreen's function is the same for different $(\\ell, m, n)$ modes but that\nnontrivial sources can change this conclusion. Finally, we demonstrate (iii)\nthat the greybody factor can be reconstructed with the superposed QNM spectrum\nin the frequency domain.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
