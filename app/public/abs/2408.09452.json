However,\nthe addressee of the quotation is also important to construct the relationship\nbetween the speaker and the addressee. To tackle the problem of dataset\nscarcity, we annotate the first Chinese quotation corpus with elements\nincluding speaker, addressee, speaking mode and linguistic cue. We propose\nprompt learning-based methods for speaker and addressee identification based on\nfine-tuned pre-trained models. Experiments on both Chinese and English datasets\nshow the effectiveness of the proposed methods, which outperform methods based\non zero-shot and few-shot large language models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
