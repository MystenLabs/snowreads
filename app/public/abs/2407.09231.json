They are proving increasingly capable at more and\nmore challenges. Some educators argue that they pose a serious threat to\ncomputing education, and that we should ban their use in the classroom. While\nthere are serious GenAI issues that remain unsolved, it may be useful in the\npresent moment to step back and examine the overall trajectory of Computer\nScience writ large. Since the very beginning, our discipline has sought to\nincrease the level of abstraction in each new representation. We have\nprogressed from hardware dip switches, through special purpose languages and\nvisual representations like flow charts, all the way now to ``natural\nlanguage.'' With the advent of GenAI, students can finally change the\nabstraction level of a problem to the ``language'' they've been ``problem\nsolving'' with all their lives. In this paper, we argue that our programming\nabstractions were always headed here -- to natural language. Now is the time to\nadopt a ``Prompts First'' approach to Computer Science Education.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KTIaFek0kBPW5pgY6VdTUSMwt5lEkSmzPoODQ-3rdTU","pdfSize":"112318"}
