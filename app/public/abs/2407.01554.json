In \\cite{Qin2},\nQin conjectured that these reduced generating series are quasi-modular forms if\nthe canonical divisor of $X$ is numerically trivial. In this paper, we verify\nthat Qin's conjecture holds for $\\langle {\\rm ch}_1^{L_1}{\\rm ch}_1^{L_2}\n\\rangle'$. The main approaches are to use the methods laid out in \\cite{QY} and\nconstruct various relations regarding multiple $q$-zeta values and\nquasi-modular forms.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
