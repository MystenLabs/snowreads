The radiation reaction force on the electrons accounting for this\nstimulated radiation loss is classically described by the Lienard-Wiechert\npotential. Despite its being the foundation of beam physics for decades, we\nshow that using the \"acceleration field'' in Lienard-Wiechert potential to\ndescribe radiative interactions leads to divergences due to its implicit\ndependence on instantaneous interactions. Here, we propose an alternative\ntheory for electromagnetic radiation by decomposing the interactions into\ninstantaneous part and retarded part. It is shown that only the retarded part\ncontributes to the irreversible radiation loss and the instantaneous part\ndescribes the space charge related effects. We further apply this theory to\nstudy the coherent synchrotron radiation wake, which hopefully will reshape our\nunderstanding of coherent radiation and collective interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
