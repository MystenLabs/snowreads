This study presents a novel methodology for classifying\nhand gestures using EMG signals. To address the challenges associated with\nfeature extraction where, we explored 23 distinct morphological, time domain\nand frequency domain feature extraction techniques. However, the substantial\nsize of the features may increase the computational complexity issues that can\nhinder machine learning algorithm performance. We employ an efficient feature\nselection approach, specifically an extra tree classifier, to mitigate this.\nThe selected potential feature fed into the various machine learning-based\nclassification algorithms where our model achieved 97.43\\% accuracy with the\nKNN algorithm and selected feature. By leveraging a comprehensive feature\nextraction and selection strategy, our methodology enhances the accuracy and\nusability of EMG-based hand gesture recognition systems. The higher performance\naccuracy proves the effectiveness of the proposed model over the existing\nsystem. \\keywords{EMG signal, machine learning approach, hand gesture\nrecognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
