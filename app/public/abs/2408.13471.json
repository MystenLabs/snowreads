However, most existing\ngenerative graph representation learning (GRL) approaches rely on random\nmasking across the entire graph, which overlooks the entanglement of learned\nrepresentations. This oversight results in non-robustness and a lack of\nexplainability. Furthermore, disentangling the learned representations remains\na significant challenge and has not been sufficiently explored in GRL research.\nBased on these insights, this paper introduces DiGGR (Disentangled Generative\nGraph Representation Learning), a self-supervised learning framework. DiGGR\naims to learn latent disentangled factors and utilizes them to guide graph mask\nmodeling, thereby enhancing the disentanglement of learned representations and\nenabling end-to-end joint learning. Extensive experiments on 11 public datasets\nfor two different graph learning tasks demonstrate that DiGGR consistently\noutperforms many previous self-supervised methods, verifying the effectiveness\nof the proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
