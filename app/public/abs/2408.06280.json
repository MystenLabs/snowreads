After outlining the\nderivation of the magnetostatic balance equations and its associated boundary\nconditions, we propose a cell-centered Finite Volume framework for spatial\ndiscretization and a Block Gauss-Seidel multi-region scheme for solution. We\ndiscuss the structure of the solver, emphasizing its effectiveness and\naddressing stabilization and correction techniques to enhance computational\nrobustness. We validate the accuracy and efficacy of the approach through\nnumerical experiments and comparisons with the Finite Element method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ramEngMblKABLNrSckpTSlJOzfGxHS3CLwRAqR_VG1g","pdfSize":"15833196"}
