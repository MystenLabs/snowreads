Existing\nmethods for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) mainly focus on image\nclassification. This paper aims to enhance CZSL in object detection without\nforgetting prior learned knowledge. We use Grounding DINO and incorporate\nCompositional Soft Prompting (CSP) into it and extend it with Compositional\nAnticipation. We achieve a 70.5% improvement over CSP on the harmonic mean (HM)\nbetween seen and unseen compositions on the CLEVR dataset. Furthermore, we\nintroduce Contrastive Prompt Tuning to incrementally address model confusion\nbetween similar compositions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method\nand achieve an increase of 14.5% in HM across the pretrain, increment, and\nunseen sets. Collectively, these methods provide a framework for learning\nvarious compositions with limited data, as well as improving the performance of\nunderperforming compositions when additional data becomes available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
