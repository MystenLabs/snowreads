There are several\naspects in which DQ can be measured, called DQ dimensions (i.e. accuracy,\ncompleteness, consistency, etc.), also referred to as characteristics in\nliterature. ISO/IEC 25012 Standard defines a data quality model with fifteen\nsuch dimensions, setting the requirements a data product should meet. In this\nshort report, we aim to bridge the gap between lower-level functionalities\noffered by DQ tools and higher-level dimensions in a systematic manner,\nrevealing the many-to-many relationships between them. To this end, we examine\n6 open-source DQ tools and we emphasize on providing a mapping between the\nfunctionalities they offer and the DQ dimensions, as defined by the ISO\nstandard. Wherever applicable, we also provide insights into the software\nengineering details that tools leverage, in order to address DQ challenges.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
