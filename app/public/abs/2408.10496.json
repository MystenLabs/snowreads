We\ncollect thousands of 3D point cloud images in the actual test environment of\ntextiles and organize and label them as TextileNet8 dataset. To the best of our\nknowledge, it is the first publicly available eight-categories 3D point cloud\ndataset in the field of textile pilling assessment. Based on PointGPT, the\nGPT-like big model of point cloud analysis, we incorporate the global features\nof the input point cloud extracted from the non-parametric network into it,\nthus proposing the PointGPT+NN model. Using TextileNet8 as a benchmark, the\nexperimental results show that the proposed PointGPT+NN model achieves an\noverall accuracy (OA) of 91.8% and a mean per-class accuracy (mAcc) of 92.2%.\nTest results on other publicly available datasets also validate the competitive\nperformance of the proposed PointGPT+NN model. The proposed TextileNet8 dataset\nwill be publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
