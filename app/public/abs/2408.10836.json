Using a novel strongly nonlinear\noptical system,the work reveals a new buildup scenario for soliton molecules ,\nwhich includes a long-duration stage dominated by the emergence of transient\nNLPs modes to withstand strong disturbances arising from turbulence and extreme\nnonlinearity in the optical cavity. Systematic simulations reveal effects of\nthe PC rotation angle and intra-cavity nonlinearity on the periodic phase\ntransitions between the different soliton states, and accurately reproduce the\nexperimentally observed buildup and switching mechanisms. These findings could\nenhance our fundamental study and points to potential uses in designing\ninformation encoding systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
