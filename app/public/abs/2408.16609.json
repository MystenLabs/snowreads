The\ninternal space has weak $G_2$-holonomy, which is obtained from the lift of AdS\nvacua in massless type IIA on a specific SU(3)-structure with O6-planes. Such\nlifts require a local treatment of the O6-planes, therefore going beyond the\nusual smeared approximation. The setup is analysed by solving the pure spinor\nequations and the Bianchi identities perturbatively in a small backreaction\nparameter, preserving supersymmetry manifestly and therefore extending on\nprevious work. This approach is applicable to lifts of other type IIA vacua on\nhalf-flat SU(3)-structures, including those with D6-brane sources. The\nresulting 7d manifold presented here exhibits singularities originating from\nthe O6-planes loci in type IIA theory. Additionally, scale separation in\nM-theory arises from a decoupling between the Ricci curvature and the first\neigenvalue of the Laplacian of the proposed 7d manifold, thereby challenging\ncertain conjectures in the swampland program.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rtRfUvpIdf3bIOk-iljRiJ-K4kYkDuQ_LvBFcTWfFBc","pdfSize":"562022"}
