The\ntheory includes the effects of adhesion via Griffith's criterion applied only\nat the semi-major and semi-minor axes of the contact ellipse. Although JG's\nwork is in good agreement with numerical and experimental results for\nquasi-circular contacts, the agreement worsens as the eccentricity of the\ncontact region increases. In this paper, we show that including the effects of\nadhesion by instead minimizing the sum of elastic and surface energy yields\nresults that are in excellent agreement with previous numerical simulations\nover the full range of contact eccentricities.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
