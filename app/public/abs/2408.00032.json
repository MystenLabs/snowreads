Mainly, this paper is divided into two parts: inference from\nstatistical estimand for the causal estimand, in which we reviewed the\nassumptions for causal identification and the methodological strategies\naddressing the problems if some of the assumptions are violated. We also\ndiscuss the asymptotical analysis concerning the measure from the observational\ndata to the theoretical measure and replicate the deduction of the\nefficient/doubly robust average treatment effect estimator, which is commonly\nused in current social science analysis.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
