A finite-size scaling study\nsuggests that the model belongs to the Ising universality class. We\ncharacterize the off-equilibrium behavior of the model by measuring the entropy\nproduction rate and by studying the coarsening dynamics, which shows a\nsuper-diffusive relaxation. A coarse-grained equation of motion is in\ncompelling agreement with the numerical findings. A one-loop renormalization\ngroup calculation shows that the model belongs to the Model A universality\nclass.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B69IKniMkBNjnXxdvSIbQBw4IFK5OKS02SaXfo6p6JY","pdfSize":"892407"}
