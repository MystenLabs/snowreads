While the\ntheory of set-valued risk measures provide an axiomatic framework for assigning\nto a random vector its set of all capital requirements or allocation vectors,\nthe actual decision-making process requires an additional rule to select from\nthis set. In this paper, we define vector-valued risk measures by an analogous\nlist of axioms and show that, in the convex and lower semicontinuous case, such\nfunctionals always ignore the dependence structures of the input random\nvectors. We also show that set-valued risk measures do not have this issue as\nlong as they do not reduce to a vector-valued functional. Finally, we\ndemonstrate that our results also generalize to the conditional setting. These\nresults imply that convex vector-valued risk measures are not suitable for\ndefining capital allocation rules for a wide range of financial applications\nincluding systemic risk measures.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
