The newly\nrevealed stellar morphologies show striking similarities with the dust\ncontinuum morphologies at 870$\\mu$m, with the centers and position angles\nagreeing for most sources, clearly illustrating that the spatial offsets\nreported previously between the 870$\\mu$m and HST morphologies were due to\nstrong differential dust obscuration. The F444W sizes are 78$\\pm$21% larger\nthan those measured at 870$\\mu$m, in contrast to recent results from\nhydrodynamical simulations that predict larger 870$\\mu$m sizes. We report\nevidence for significant dust obscuration in F444W for the highest-redshift\nsources, emphasizing the importance of longer-wavelength MIRI imaging. The\nmajority of the sources show evidence that they are undergoing\nmergers/interactions, including tidal tails/plumes -- some of which are also\ndetected at 870$\\mu$m. We find a clear correlation between NIRCam colors and\n870$\\mu$m surface brightness on $\\sim$1 kpc scales, indicating that the\ngalaxies are primarily red due to dust -- not stellar age -- and we show that\nthe dust structure on $\\sim$kpc-scales is broadly similar to that in nearby\ngalaxies. Finally, we find no strong stellar bars in the rest-frame\nnear-infrared, suggesting the extended bar-like features seen at 870$\\mu$m are\nhighly obscured and/or gas-dominated structures that are likely early\nprecursors to significant bulge growth.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
