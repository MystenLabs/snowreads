Such methods have drawbacks compared to the computation of\nexplicit likelihoods, such as an inability to conduct statistical inference in\nhigh-dimensional parameter spaces, or a failure to make use of all available\ninformation. In this work, we implement a continuous approximation of an event\nsimulator model within a probabilistic programming framework, allowing for the\napplication of high performance gradient-based inference methods such as the\nNo-U-Turn Sampler. We demonstrate an improvement in inference results, with\npercent-level decreases in measurement uncertainties. Finally, in the case\nwhere some observables can be measured using multiple independent channels,\nsuch a method also enables the incorporation of additional information\nseamlessly, allowing for full use of the available information to be made.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"HaGVgfIjEbsgsJL7bY6TXsJC2A9t5Ge5U1H8YUSMmG4","pdfSize":"1403235"}
