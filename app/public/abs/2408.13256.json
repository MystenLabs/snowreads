Nonetheless, the\nprecise mechanism of compositionality and how it is acquired through training\nremains elusive. Inspired by cognitive neuroscientific approaches, we consider\na highly reduced setting to examine whether and when diffusion models learn\nsemantically meaningful and factorized representations of composable features.\nWe performed extensive controlled experiments on conditional Denoising\nDiffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) trained to generate various forms of 2D\nGaussian data. We found that the models learn factorized but not fully\ncontinuous manifold representations for encoding continuous features of\nvariation underlying the data. With such representations, models demonstrate\nsuperior feature compositionality but limited ability to interpolate over\nunseen values of a given feature. Our experimental results further demonstrate\nthat diffusion models can attain compositionality with few compositional\nexamples, suggesting a more efficient way to train DDPMs. Finally, we connect\nmanifold formation in diffusion models to percolation theory in physics,\noffering insight into the sudden onset of factorized representation learning.\nOur thorough toy experiments thus contribute a deeper understanding of how\ndiffusion models capture compositional structure in data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"IJGbmdmok0JbIvdr3HxJ_7sk-r3VqPdKG22nz-9tImI","pdfSize":"7179409"}
