This paper proposes an improved method\nbased on the spatial-temporal graph convolution net-work (UGCN) to address the\nissue of missing human posture skeleton sequences in single-view videos. We\npresent the improved UGCN, which allows the network to process 3D human pose\ndata and improves the 3D human pose skeleton sequence, thereby resolving the\nocclusion issue.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
