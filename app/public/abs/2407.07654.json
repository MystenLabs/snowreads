Furthermore, these findings extend to scenarios\nwhere the corners of the near Toeplitz matrices lack diagonal dominance\n($|\\widetilde{b}| < 1$). Additionally, we compute the row sums and traces of\nthe inverse matrices, thereby deriving upper bounds for their infinite norms.\nTo demonstrate the practical applicability of our theoretical results, we\npresent numerical examples addressing numerical solution of the Fisher problem\nusing the fixed point method. Our findings reveal that the convergence rates of\nfixed-point iterations closely align with the expected rates, and there is\nminimal disparity between the upper bounds and the infinite norm of the inverse\nmatrix. Specifically, this observation holds true for $|b| = 2$ with\n$|\\widetilde{b}| \\geq 1$. In other cases, there exists potential to enhance the\nobtained upper bounds.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Egzu0KScNmsKzgWsg1s9m7xXnKjOyk0CNlCJSeb-JTo","pdfSize":"2281716"}
