We use one-zone\ngalactic chemical evolution (GCE) models with a flexible star formation history\n(SFH) to model the age, [Mg/H], and [Mg/Fe] inferred from simple stellar\npopulation (SSP) fits to observed ellipticals at $z \\sim 0$ and $z \\sim 0.7$.\nWe show that an SSP fit to the spectrum computed from a full GCE model gives\nages and abundances close to the light-weighted, logarithmically averaged\nvalues of the composite stellar population, <age>, <[Mg/H]>, and <[Mg/Fe]>.\nWith supernova Mg and Fe yields fixed to values motivated by Milky Way stellar\npopulations, we find that predicted <[Mg/H]>-<age> and <[Mg/Fe]>-<age>\nrelations are surprisingly insensitive to SFH parameters: older galaxies have\nhigher <[Mg/Fe]>, but the detailed form of the SFH has limited impact. The star\nformation efficiency and outflow efficiency affect the early and late evolution\nof <[Mg/H]>, respectively; explaining observed trends requires higher star\nformation efficiency and lower outflows in more massive galaxies. With core\ncollapse supernova yields calibrated to the plateau [Mg/Fe]$_{\\rm cc}\n\\approx0.45$ observed in many Milky Way studies, our models underpredict the\nobserved <[Mg/Fe]> ratios of ellipticals by 0.05-0.1 dex. Increasing the core\ncollapse yield ratio to [Mg/Fe]$_{\\rm cc} = 0.55$ improves the agreement,\nthough the models still lie below the data. We discuss potential resolutions of\nthis discrepancy, including the possibility that many ellipticals terminate\ntheir star formation with a self-enriching, terminating burst that reduces the\nlight-weighted age and boosts <[Mg/Fe]>.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"72ElvX5bS9jjBNUirEUkVjkJX_LqzPluboviRtEV3sc","pdfSize":"3051049"}
