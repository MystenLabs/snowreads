We show how to use this purely-quantum effect to extract\nnet mechanical work from radiation pressure in a simple quantum photon engine.\nAlong the way, we demonstrate that the standard definition of work in quantum\nsystems is not appropriate in this context, as it does not capture the energy\nleaked to these quantum degrees of freedom. We use these results to design an\nOtto engine able to produce mechanical work from squeezing baths, in the\nabsence of thermal gradient. Interestingly, while work extraction from\nsqueezing generally improves for low temperatures, there exists a nontrivial\nsqueezing-dependent temperature for which work production is maximal,\ndemonstrating the complex interplay between thermal and squeezing effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
