Though it is a\nrichly studied area, a standalone, fast, and differentiable grasp planner that\ncan work with robot grippers of different DOFs has not been reported. In this\nwork, we present DiPGrasp, a grasp planner that satisfies all these goals.\nDiPGrasp takes a force-closure geometric surface matching grasp quality metric.\nIt adopts a gradient-based optimization scheme on the metric, which also\nconsiders parallel sampling and collision handling. This not only drastically\naccelerates the grasp search process over the object surface but also makes it\ndifferentiable. We apply DiPGrasp to three applications, namely grasp dataset\nconstruction, mask-conditioned planning, and pose refinement. For dataset\ngeneration, as a standalone planner, DiPGrasp has clear advantages over speed\nand quality compared with several classic planners. For mask-conditioned\nplanning, it can turn a 3D perception model into a 3D grasp detection model\ninstantly. As a pose refiner, it can optimize the coarse grasp prediction from\nthe neural network, as well as the neural network parameters. Finally, we\nconduct real-world experiments with the Barrett hand and Schunk SVH 5-finger\nhand.
