The single-port\nrectifier circuit, which comprises a 3-port network, optimized T-matching\ncircuits and voltage doubler, is designed, simulated and fabricated to obtain a\nhigh RF-to-DC power conversion efficiency (PCE). Measurement results show PCE\nof 26% and 22% at -20 dBm, and also 58% and 51% at -10 dBm with a maximum\namount of 69% and 65% at -2.5 dBm and -5 dBm, with single tone at 95 and 925\nMHz, respectively. Besides, the fractional bandwidth of 21% at FM and 11% at\nGSM band is achieved. The measurement and simulation results are in good\nagreement. Consequently, the proposed rectifier can be a potential candidate\nfor ambient RF energy harvesting and wireless power transfer (WPT). It should\nbe noted that a 3-port network as a duplexer is designed to be integrated with\nsingle-port antennas which cover both FM and GSM bands as a low-cost solution.\nMoreover, based on simulation results, PCE has small variations when the load\nresistor varies from 10 to 18 k$\\Omega$. Therefore, this rectifier can be\nutilized for any desired resistance within the range, such as sensors and IoT\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
