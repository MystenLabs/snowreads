Such pump-probe\nmeasurements allows for the exploration of nonlinear dynamics, driven by the\nlarge pump tone, by measuring the system response to a probe tone. In contrast,\nhere we report on the dynamics of a mechanical Duffing resonator driven with a\ncombination of two large tones at different frequencies. Our results indicate\nthe presence of various distinct regimes with very different dynamics. We\nsystematically investigate the impact of the relative strength and detuning\nbetween the two drives on the dynamical response. This provides an illustrative\nexample of dynamical phase transitions in out-of-equilibrium systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rQPzjJ9eUPZG9FRk0--zoTQUzXWgMc0rm_nYB5XbmCs","pdfSize":"2311799"}
