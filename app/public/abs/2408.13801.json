This rigidity connects spacetime positive mass theorem, dihedral rigidity\nand capillary marginally trapped surfaces. Our method is to extend the rigidity\nanalysis of spacetime positive mass theorem due to Beig-Chrusciel to the\nsettings of a twisted spinor bundle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
