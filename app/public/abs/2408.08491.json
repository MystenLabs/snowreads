To address this challenge, we introduce a concept\nof multifunctional deployable space structures for CubeSats based on ultrathin,\nelastically foldable, and self-deployable bistable composite structures\nintegrated with flexible electronics. The multifunctional bistable booms can be\nstored in a coiled configuration and self-deploy into a long structure upon\ninitiation by releasing the stored strain energy. The boom demonstrates the\ncapabilities of delivering power and transmitting data from the CubeSat to the\nflexible devices on the boom tip. The boom also shows the ability to monitor\nthe dynamics and vibration during and after the deployment. A payload boom has\nbeen installed in a 3U CubeSat as flight hardware for in-space testing and\ndemonstration. This effort combines morphable ultrathin composite structures\nwith flexible electronics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
