We compute an\nexplicit presentation of this ring via Soergel's result, which implies that it\nis a combinatorial invariant. We use the presentation to introduce the\nBott--Samelson ring associated with a word in arbitrary Coxeter system by\ngenerators and relations. In general, it is a split quadratic complete\nintersection algebra with a triangular pattern of relations. By a result of\nTate, it follows that it is a Koszul algebra and we provide a quadratic\n(reduced) Gr{\\\"o}bner basis. Furthermore, we prove that it satisfies the whole\nK\\\"ahler package, including the Poincar\\'e duality, the hard Lefschetz theorem,\nand the Hodge--Riemann bilinear relations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
