To address this, we propose a Digital\nTwin-based Driver Risk-Aware Intelligent Mobility Analytics (DT-DIMA) system.\nThe DT-DIMA system integrates real-time traffic information from\npan-tilt-cameras (PTCs), synchronizes this data into a digital twin to\naccurately replicate the physical world, and predicts network-wide mobility and\nsafety risks in real time. The system's innovation lies in its integration of\nspatial-temporal modeling, simulation, and online control modules. Tested and\nevaluated under normal traffic conditions and incidental situations (e.g.,\nunexpected accidents, pre-planned work zones) in a simulated testbed in\nBrooklyn, New York, DT-DIMA demonstrated mean absolute percentage errors\n(MAPEs) ranging from 8.40% to 15.11% in estimating network-level traffic volume\nand MAPEs from 0.85% to 12.97% in network-level safety risk prediction. In\naddition, the highly accurate safety risk prediction enables PTCs to\npreemptively monitor road segments with high driving risks before incidents\ntake place. Such proactive PTC surveillance creates around a 5-minute lead time\nin capturing traffic incidents. The DT-DIMA system enables transportation\nmanagers to understand mobility not only in terms of traffic patterns but also\ndriver-experienced safety risks, allowing for proactive resource allocation in\nresponse to various traffic situations. To the authors' best knowledge, DT-DIMA\nis the first urban mobility management system that considers both mobility and\nsafety risks based on digital twin architecture.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
