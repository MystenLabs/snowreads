This\nidea is motivated by a construction on the relative cohomology group of\nsurfaces. As an application of our theory, we reprove the celebrated Aztec\nDiamond theorem, and show how alternating sign matrices naturally arises\nthrough this framework.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
