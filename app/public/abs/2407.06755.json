The ASIC implements a\nrecently-proposed power-saving technique called sparsity-adaptive equalization\n(SPADE). SPADE exploits the inherent sparsity of mmWave channels in the\nbeamspace domain to reduce the dynamic power of matrix-vector products by\nskipping multiplications for which the magnitude of both operands are below\npre-defined thresholds. Simulations with realistic mmWave channels show that\nSPADE incurs less than 0.7dB SNR degradation at 1% target bit error rate\ncompared to antenna-domain equalization. ASIC measurement results demonstrate\nan equalization throughput of 46Gbps and show that SPADE offers up to 38% power\nsavings compared to antenna-domain equalization. A comparison with\nstate-of-the-art massive MIMO equalizer designs reveals that our ASIC achieves\nsuperior normalized energy efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
