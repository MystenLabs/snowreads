Unlike the mature cloud solutions for classical computing, quantum\ncomputing lacks effective infrastructure for resource optimization. We propose\na Quantum Resource Infrastructure Orchestrator (QRIO), a state-of-the-art cloud\nresource manager built on Kubernetes that is tailored to quantum computing.\nQRIO seeks to democratize access to quantum devices by providing customizable,\nuser-friendly, open-source resource management. QRIO's design aims to ensure\nequitable access, optimize resource utilization, and support diverse\napplications, thereby speeding up innovation and making quantum computing more\naccessible and efficient to a broader user base. In this paper, we discuss\nQRIO's various features and evaluate its capability in several representative\nusecases.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
