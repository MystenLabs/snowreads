Our procedure\nsystematically considers all possible binary-tree multiplexers that can be\nformed by a certain number of photon routers. Using this method one can select\nthe multiplexer structure that leads to the highest single-photon probability\nfor a given set of loss parameters characterizing the system. We determine the\noptimal general binary-tree multiplexers for experimentally realizable values\nof the transmission coefficients of the photon routers and that of the detector\nefficiency. We show that single-photon sources based on such optimal\nmultiplexers yield higher single-photon probabilities than that can be achieved\nwith single-photon sources based on any other spatial multiplexer considered in\nthe literature. Our approach improves the performance of multiplexed\nsingle-photon sources even for small system sizes which is the typical\nsituation in current experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
