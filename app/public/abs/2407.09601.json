As a theoretical benchmark for such\ninvestigations, we extend Kitaev's spin-1/2 honeycomb model to hyperbolic\nlattices and exploit their non-Euclidean space-group symmetries to solve the\nmodel exactly. We elucidate the ground-state phase diagram on the $\\{8,3\\}$\nlattice and find a gapped $\\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with Abelian anyons, a\ngapped chiral spin liquid with non-Abelian anyons and chiral edge states, and a\ncompressible spin liquid with low-energy density of states dominated by\nnon-Abelian Bloch states of Majorana fermions.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
