Evaluating voice likability is essential to designing\npreferable voices for speech systems, such as dialogue or announcement systems.\nIn this study, we let 885 listeners rate 1800 speech segments of a wide range\nof speakers regarding their likability. When constructing the corpus, we also\ncollected the multiple speaker attributes: genders, ages, and favorite YouTube\nvideos. Therefore, the corpus enables the large-scale statistical analysis of\nvoice likability regarding both speaker and listener factors. This paper\ndescribes the construction methodology and preliminary data analysis to reveal\nthe gender and age biases in voice likability. In addition, the relationship\nbetween the likability and two acoustic features, the fundamental frequencies\nand the x-vectors of given utterances, is also investigated.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing","Computing Research Repository/Sound"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"QuwAbToCdbQe32b9VFhQw-Zt1CdVeJ6V1y7MFHL0O1s","pdfSize":"596532"}
