The\ninternal degrees of freedom in the two metallic surfaces are assumed to be\nplasmons, while the excitations in the intermediate material are magnons,\nmodeling plasmons coupled to magnons. During relative sliding, one surface\nmoves uniformly parallel to the other, causing friction in the system. By\ncalculating the effective action of the magnons, we can determine the particle\nproduction probability, which shows a positive correlation between the\nprobability and the sliding speed. Finally, we derive the frictional force of\nthe system, with both theoretical and numerical results indicating that the\nfriction, like the particle production probability, also has a positive\ncorrelation with the speed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"7fpHAkLz5LdSGskWIYUgz2lXnUFM6LYUcP3JfGhEjW8","pdfSize":"391242"}
