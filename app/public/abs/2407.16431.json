These\ninherent biases often result in detrimental effects in various applications.\nCounterfactual Data Augmentation (CDA), which seeks to balance demographic\nattributes in training data, has been a widely adopted approach to mitigate\nbias in natural language processing. However, many existing CDA approaches rely\non word substitution techniques using manually compiled word-pair dictionaries.\nThese techniques often lead to out-of-context substitutions, resulting in\npotential quality issues. The advancement of model-based techniques, on the\nother hand, has been challenged by the need for parallel training data. Works\nin this area resort to manually generated parallel data that are expensive to\ncollect and are consequently limited in scale. This paper proposes FairFlow, an\nautomated approach to generating parallel data for training counterfactual text\ngenerator models that limits the need for human intervention. Furthermore, we\nshow that FairFlow significantly overcomes the limitations of dictionary-based\nword-substitution approaches whilst maintaining good performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
