The doping- and temperature-dependence of the OH\nconductivity have been investigated and compared with corresponding results for\nthe spin Hall conductivity (SHC). A strong difference has been found between\nthe results for undoped and doped metallic systems. For elemental systems at\nfinite temperature a dominating role of the intrinsic contribution to the\ntemperature-dependent OH and SH conductivities is found. Moreover, the\ndifferent temperature dependent behavior of the intrinsic SOC-independent OHC\nand SOC-driven SCH indicates a non-trivial relationship between these\nquantities. It is shown, that in contrast to the intrinsic part of the OH and\nSH conductivities, the extrinsic contributions in doped systems are determined\nby spin-orbit coupling for both of them. It is dominating at low temperature,\nstrongly decreasing at higher temperatures due to the increasing impact of the\nelectron-phonon scattering.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U5G3TSaMV7DfRowi4NZ9XIz0itVZVAwJz5vk5m8F0IE","pdfSize":"2039202"}
