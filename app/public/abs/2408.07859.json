Citizen ASAS-SN tasks users with classifying variable\nstars based on their light curves. We started with 94975 new variable\ncandidates and identified 4432 new variable stars. The users classified the new\nvariables as 841 pulsating variables, 2995 rotational variables, 350 eclipsing\nbinaries, and 246 unknown variables. We found 68% user agreement for\nuser-classified pulsating variables, 51% for rotational variables, and 77% for\neclipsing binaries. We investigate user statistics and compare new variables to\nknown variables. We present a sample of variables flagged as interesting or\nunusual.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
