The proposed UQ method is built upon a\nmixture-of-expert approach termed Test-Time Augmentation (TTA). Our key idea is\nto enrich and diversify the table representations, to spotlight the cells with\nhigh recognition uncertainties. To evaluate the effectiveness, we proposed two\nheuristics to differentiate highly uncertain cells from normal cells, namely,\nmasking and cell complexity quantification. Masking involves varying the pixel\nintensity to deem the detection uncertainty. Cell complexity quantification\ngauges the uncertainty of each cell by its topological relation with\nneighboring cells. The evaluation results based on standard benchmark datasets\ndemonstrate that the proposed method is effective in quantifying uncertainty in\nTSR models. To our best knowledge, this study is the first of its kind to\nenable UQ in TSR tasks.
