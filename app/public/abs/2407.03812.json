The function $f$ is said to\nbe a \\emph{Weak Roman Dominating function} (WRD function) if, for every vertex\n$u$ with $f(u) = 0$, there exists a neighbour $v$ of $u$ with $f(v) > 0$ and a\nnew function $f': V \\rightarrow \\{0, 1, 2\\}$ defined in the following way:\n$f'(u) = 1$, $f'(v) = f(v) - 1$, and $f'(w) = f(w)$, for all vertices $w$ in\n$V\\setminus\\{u,v\\}$; so that no vertices are undefended by $f'$. The total\nweight of $f$ is equal to $\\sum_{v\\in V} f(v)$, and is denoted as $w(f)$. The\n\\emph{Weak Roman Domination Number} denoted by $\\gamma_r(G)$, represents\n$min\\{w(f)~\\vert~f$ is a WRD function of $G\\}$. For a given graph $G$, the\nproblem of finding a WRD function of weight $\\gamma_r(G)$ is defined as the\n\\emph{Minimum Weak Roman domination problem}. The problem is already known to\nbe NP-hard for bipartite and chordal graphs. In this paper, we further study\nthe algorithmic complexity of the problem. We prove the NP-hardness of the\nproblem for star convex bipartite graphs and comb convex bipartite graphs,\nwhich are subclasses of bipartite graphs. In addition, we show that for the\nbounded degree star convex bipartite graphs, the problem is efficiently\nsolvable. We also prove the NP-hardness of the problem for split graphs, a\nsubclass of chordal graphs. On the positive side, we give polynomial-time\nalgorithms to solve the problem for $P_4$-sparse graphs. Further, we have\npresented some approximation results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
