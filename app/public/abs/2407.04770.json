When a system relaxes after the quench, thermal\nobservables emerge in the absence of constraints, provided long-time averaging\nor a large system. We demonstrate a thermalization mechanism based on averaging\nthe observables over realizations of a global quench protocol that does not\nrely on a system's size or long-time evolution. The quench abruptly establishes\nall-to-all couplings of random strength in a few-body system and initializes\nthe dynamics. Shortly after the quench, the observables averaged over\nrealizations of random couplings become stationary. The average occupation\nprobabilities of many-body energy states equilibrate toward the Gibbs\ndistribution with a finite positive or negative absolute temperature that\ndepends on the initial state's energy, with the negative temperatures occurring\ndue to the confined spectrum of the system. Running an experiment on an IBM\nQuantum computer (IBMQ) for four qubits, we report the utility of the digital\nquantum computer for predicting thermal observables and their fluctuations for\npositive or negative absolute temperatures. Implementing thermalization on\nIBMQ, this result facilitates probing the dynamical emergence of thermal\nequilibrium and, consequently, equilibrium properties of matter at finite\ntemperatures on noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
