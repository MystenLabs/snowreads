The analysis is based on the Gaussian prior covariance but\nthe approach also applies to other covariance kernels. Our geometric analysis\nreveals how the Gaussian kernel's bandwidth parameter and the spatial\ndistribution of the observations influence the posterior covariance as well as\nthe corresponding covariance matrix, enabling straightforward identification of\nareas with high or low covariance in magnitude. Drawing inspiration from the a\nposteriori error estimation techniques in adaptive finite element methods, we\nalso propose several estimators to efficiently measure the absolute posterior\ncovariance field, which can be used for efficient covariance matrix\napproximation and preconditioning. We conduct a wide range of experiments to\nillustrate our theoretical findings and their practical applications.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
