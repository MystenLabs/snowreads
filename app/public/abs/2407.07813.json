The\nresults $m_4\\approx 170$ GeV and $m_L\\approx 270$ GeVare extracted from the\ndispersive analyses of the $t\\to d e^+\\nu_4$ and $L^-\\to \\nu_1 \\bar t d$ decay\nwidths, respectively, where $t$ ($d$, $e^+$, $\\nu_1$) denotes a top quark (down\nquark, positron, light neutrino). The predictions are then cross-checked by\nexamining the $L^-\\to \\nu_4 \\bar u d$ decay, $\\bar u$ being an anti-up quark.\nIt is shown that the fourth generation leptons with the above masses survive\nthe current experimental bounds from Higgs boson decays into photon pairs and\nfrom the oblique parameters. We also revisit how the existence of the fourth\ngeneration leptons impacts the dispersive constraints on the neutrino masses\nand the Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) matrix elements. It is found\nthat the unitarity of the $3\\times 3$ PMNS matrix holds well up to corrections\nof $O(m_\\nu^2/m_W^2)$, $m_\\nu$ ($m_W$) being a light neutrino (the $W$ boson)\nmass, whose mixing angles and $CP$ phase prefer the values $\\theta_{12}\\approx\n34^\\circ$, $\\theta_{23}\\approx 46^\\circ$, $\\theta_{13}\\approx 4^\\circ$ and\n$\\delta\\approx 235^\\circ$ in the normal-ordering scenario for neutrino masses.\nOn the contrary, the unitarity of the $3\\times 3$ Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa\nmatrix is violated at the level $m_b^2/m_W^2\\sim 10^{-3}$, $m_b$ being the $b$\nquark mass, as the same formalism is applied to the quark mixing.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
