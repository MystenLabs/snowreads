This\npseudo-ME, which signifies the critical energy that distinguishes between\nergodic and weakly ergodic, or weakly ergodic and nonergodic states, is a\ncrucial concept in comprehending the transport and localization phenomena in\nWannier-Stark systems. Here we investigate the influence of dissipation on a\nfinite-height mosaic Wannier-Stark lattice that features such pseudo-MEs by\ncomputing the steady state density matrix. Our findings indicate that\nparticular dissipation can steer the system into specific states, regardless of\nits initial state, predominantly characterized by either ergodic or nonergodic\nstates. This suggests that dissipation can be harnessed as a novel method for\ninducing transitions between these states and manipulating particle\nlocalization behaviors in disorder-free systems.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
