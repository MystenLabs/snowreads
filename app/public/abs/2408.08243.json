However, the state of quantum systems is\nextremely fragile due to environment noise. A promising technique to combat\nagainst quantum decoherence is entanglement purification. To fully exploit its\nbenefit, two fundamental research questions need to be answered: (1) given an\nentanglement path, what is the optimal entanglement purification schedule? (2)\nhow to compute min-cost end-to-end entanglement paths subject to fidelity\nconstraint? In this paper, we give algorithmic solutions to both questions. For\nthe first question, we develop an optimal entanglement purification scheduling\nalgorithm for the single-hop case and analyze the \\textsc{purify-and-swap}\nstrategy in the multi-hop case by establishing the closed-form condition for\nits optimality. For the second question, we design a polynomial-time algorithm\nconstructing an $\\epsilon$-optimal fidelity-constrained path. The effectiveness\nof our algorithms are also numerically demonstrated by extensive simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
