Our goal is to assess those two\nquantities in the context of an inverse problem in subsurface flows. We begin\nby presenting a review of some popular methods for their estimation, and then\nsimulate their sample distributions on AR(1) sequences for which the exact\nvalues were known. We find that those ESS estimators may not be statistically\nconsistent, because their variance grows linearly in the number of sample\nvalues of the MCMC. Next, we analyze the output of two distinct MCMC algorithms\nfor the Bayesian approach to the simulation of an elliptic inverse problem.\nHere, the estimators cannot even agree about the order of magnitude of the ESS.\nOur conclusion is that the ESS has major limitations and should not be used on\nMCMC outputs of complex models.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
