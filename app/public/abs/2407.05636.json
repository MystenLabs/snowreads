To\novercome such a rate degradation, we propose new robust precoding designs which\ncan compensate for the quantization errors. In this paper, we first analyze the\nachievable rate of traditional precoding designs for limited feedback systems.\nThen, we obtain an approximation of the second-order statistics of quantized\nchannel state information. With the aid of the derived approximation, we\npropose robust precoding designs in terms of the mean square error (MSE) with\nconditional expectation in non-iterative and iterative fashions. For the\nnon-iterative precoding design, we study a robust minimum MSE (MMSE) precoding\nalgorithm by extending a new channel decomposition. Also, in the case of\niterative precoding, we investigate a robust weighted MMSE (WMMSE) precoding to\nfurther improve the achievable rate. Simulation results show that the proposed\nprecoding schemes yield significant improvements over traditional precoding\ndesigns.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
