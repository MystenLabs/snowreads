Rev. E 86, 051136 [2012]), originally obtained in the context of\nstatistical inference of continuous random variables, is extended in this work\nto the case of discrete variables. Using this new set of theorems we derive\nnovel thermodynamic identities for the canonical ensemble connecting\ntemperature with measurable observables.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
