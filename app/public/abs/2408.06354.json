It utilizes a convolutional neural network to predict\njoint locations, used for the calculation of various bio-mechanical markers\nsuch as the center of mass of the subject and various joint angles. This\ninformation is used in combination with data filtering techniques such as\nKalman Filters, and center of mass analysis which helped make accurate\ninferences about the relative weight distribution in the lateral and\nanterior-posterior axes, and provide an objective, mathematically based\ndiagnosis of this condition. In order to evaluate the performance of this\nmethod, testing was performed using dual weight scales and pre-annotated\ndiagnosis videos taken from medical settings. These two methods both quantified\nthe veritable weight distribution upon the ground surface with a ground truth\nand provided a real-world estimate of accuracy for the proposed method. A mean\nabsolute error of 0.2912 percent was found for the calculated relative weight\ndistribution difference, and an accuracy of 83.33 percent was achieved on\ndiagnoses.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
