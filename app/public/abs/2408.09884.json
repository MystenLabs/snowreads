Given\na coherent inverse system of random (bounded/ signed/positive/probability)\nhistograms on refining partitions, we study conditions for the existence and\nuniqueness of a corresponding random inverse limit measure, described by a\nRadon probability measure on the space of (bounded/signed/positive/probability)\nmeasures. Depending on the topology (vague, tight, weak or total-variational)\nand Kingman's notion of complete randomness, the limiting random (probability)\nmeasure is in one of four phases, distinguished by their degrees of\nconcentration (support, domination, discreteness). Results are applied in the\nwell-known Dirichlet and Polya tree families of random probability measures and\nin a new Gaussian family of signed inverse limit measures. In these three\nfamilies, examples of all four phases occur and we describe the corresponding\nconditions on defining parameters.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"3HgBvIioIObt2EGGZEz7dus-PCE03YVrZILgxpKyyys","pdfSize":"569993"}
