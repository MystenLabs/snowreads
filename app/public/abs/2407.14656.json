We prove an unconditional asymptotic result for the pair correlation\nand introduce a simplicity hypothesis for the zeros of this function, which if\ntrue means that multiple zeros of the original $ L $-function cannot be\nseparated by the same fixed distance. Our results provide macroscopic\ninformation in contrast to the pair correlation of the original $ L $-function\nwhich is of microscopic nature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
