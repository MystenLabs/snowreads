Since IoT devices are dispersed all over\nthe edge of the Internet, traditional centralized access control has problems.\nBlockchain based decentralized access control is thus the new solution trend.\nHowever, existing blockchain based access control methods do not focus on\nperformance issues and may incur a high communication overhead.\n  In this paper, we develop a Pruning Blockchain based Access Control (PBAC)\nprotocol to cutdown the unnecessary message rounds and achieve high efficiency\nin access validations and policy management. The protocol includes a shortcut\nand a Role and Device Hierarchy-Based Access Control (R&D-BAC) approaches for\ndifferent environment settings. To realize the PBAC protocol, it is necessary\nto carefully engineer the system architecture, which is also discussed in the\npaper. Experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the PBAC protocol, specifically,\nthe shortcut mechanism reduces access time by approximately 43%, and R&D-BAC\noutperforms traditional blockchain based RBAC by more than two folds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
