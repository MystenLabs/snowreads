This study involved the collection of Debian packages and the\nconstruction of the dependency graph of the Debian ecosystem. Utilizing\nhistoric snapshots of Debian mirrors, we were able to recover the evolution of\nthe dependency graph for all Debian releases, including obsolete ones. Through\nthe analysis of the dependency graph and its evolution, we investigated from\ntwo key aspects: (1) compatibility issues and (2) security threats in the\nDebian ecosystem. Our findings provide valuable insights into the use and\ndesign of Linux package managers. To address the challenges revealed in the\nempirical study and bridge the ecosystem gap between releases, we propose a\nnovel package management approach allowing for separate dependency environments\nbased on native Debian mirrors. We present a working prototype, named ccenv,\nwhich can effectively remedy the inadequacy of current tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
