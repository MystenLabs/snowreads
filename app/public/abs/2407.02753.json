In this work, we calculate the linear-order relativistic\npower spectrum in the spherical Fourier-Bessel (SFB) basis, a coordinate system\nthat preserves the geometry of the curved sky and fully accounts for the\nwide-angle effect. In particular, we model the GR effects present in the\ndiscrete SFB power spectrum, which is a more efficient and stable decomposition\nof the galaxy density field compared to the continuous SFB basis in the\npresence of radial windows. To validate our GR calculations, we introduce a\nmapping between the angular power spectrum and the SFB power spectrum, and we\ncompare our calculations with outputs from CLASS. We discuss the rich pattern\nof GR effects in the SFB basis and compare the GR effects to the local\nprimordial non-Gaussianity (PNG) effect. The Doppler and lensing effects have\ndifferent angular and Fourier dependence compared to the PNG in the SFB basis,\nwhile the gravitational potential term is more degenerate with the PNG and\ncomparable to a signal of $f_{\\rm NL}\\sim 1$. We also discuss the potential\nopportunities of extracting the lensing effect through SFB modes in upcoming\nLSS surveys.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
