This study investigates the efficiency of\ndeep learning models in distinguishing between Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC)\nand non-IDC in histopathology slides. We conducted a thorough comparison\nexamination of eight sophisticated models: ResNet-50, DenseNet-121, ResNeXt-50,\nVision Transformer (ViT), GoogLeNet (Inception v3), EfficientNet, MobileNet,\nand SqueezeNet. This analysis was carried out using a large dataset of 277,524\nimage patches. Our research makes a substantial contribution to the field by\noffering a comprehensive assessment of the performance of each model. We\nparticularly highlight the exceptional efficacy of attention-based mechanisms\nin the ViT model, which achieved a remarkable validation accuracy of 93\\%,\nsurpassing conventional convolutional networks. This study highlights the\npromise of advanced machine learning approaches in clinical settings, offering\nimproved precision as well as efficiency in breast cancer diagnosis.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
