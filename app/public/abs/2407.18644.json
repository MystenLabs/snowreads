To achieve improved accuracy in our quasinormal mode\ncomputations, we extend the Dolan and Ottewill inverse multipolar expansion\ntechnique and incorporate higher-order corrections from the WKB method of Iyer\nand Will. Our approach is carried out to a higher order than previous methods,\nthereby reducing the relative error, particularly for lower multipolar numbers.\nWe validate our results by comparing them with those obtained using the Mano,\nSuzuki, and Takasugi method, demonstrating excellent agreement. A key advantage\nof our method is its ability to extract quasinormal excitation factors, which\nare crucial for accurately modeling gravitational wave signals from binary\nblack hole mergers. This advancement provides a useful tool for future\ngravitational wave studies, enabling better quantification of quasinormal mode\nexcitations and more precise identification of individual modes during black\nhole ringdowns.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
