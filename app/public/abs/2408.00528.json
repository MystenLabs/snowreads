It is shown that the\ncrucial assumption is the use of the saddle point approximation after\nneglecting the quantum-pressure term. As an application, we analyze charged\nsuperfluid (superconductors) coupled to the electromagnetic field at zero\ntemperature. Our only-phase and minimally-coupled theory predicts the decay of\nthe electrostatic field inside a superconductor with a characteristic length\nmuch smaller than the London penetration depth of the static magnetic field.\nThis result is confirmed also by a relativistic only-phase Popov action we\nobtain from the Klein-Gordon Lagrangian.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"v1jrYWsEsaAp9DVgYeig3hbXczxqBDhKlPteZj-lPzE","pdfSize":"199559","txDigest":"HRxSMFi6s7Uw3CcA2YMqNDzJ1C8d2NG1fosEDTvJTf69","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
