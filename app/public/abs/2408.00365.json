VTS is also critical to various\ndownstream video understanding tasks. Traditional VTS methods using shallow\nfeatures or unsupervised approaches struggle to accurately discern the nuances\nof topical transitions. Recently, supervised approaches have achieved superior\nperformance on video action or scene segmentation over unsupervised approaches.\nIn this work, we improve supervised VTS by thoroughly exploring multimodal\nfusion and multimodal coherence modeling. Specifically, (1) we enhance\nmultimodal fusion by exploring different architectures using cross-attention\nand mixture of experts. (2) To generally strengthen multimodality alignment and\nfusion, we pre-train and fine-tune the model with multimodal contrastive\nlearning. (3) We propose a new pre-training task tailored for the VTS task, and\na novel fine-tuning task for enhancing multimodal coherence modeling for VTS.\nWe evaluate the proposed approaches on educational videos, in the form of\nlectures, due to the vital role of topic segmentation of educational videos in\nboosting learning experiences. Additionally, we introduce a large-scale Chinese\nlecture video dataset to augment the existing English corpus, promoting further\nresearch in VTS. Experiments on both English and Chinese lecture datasets\ndemonstrate that our model achieves superior VTS performance compared to\ncompetitive unsupervised and supervised baselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
