We focus our study on rational\nsurfaces $Z$. Setting $\\pi: Z \\rightarrow Z_0$ a composition of blowups giving\nrise to $Z$, where $Z_0$ is the projective plane or a Hirzebruch surface, we\ngive a common lower bound on $C^2/(H^* \\cdot C)^2$ whenever $H^*$ is the\npull-back of a nef divisor $H$ on $Z_0$. In addition, we prove that, only in\nthe case when a nef divisor $D$ on $Z$ approaches the boundary of the nef cone,\nthe quotients $C^2/(D\\cdot C)^2$ could tend to minus infinity.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
