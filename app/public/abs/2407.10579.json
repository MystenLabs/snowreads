For linear\nacoustics, divergence-free vector fields should remain stationary, but\nclassical Finite Difference methods add incompatible diffusion that\ndramatically restricts the set of discrete stationary states of the numerical\nmethod. Compatible diffusion should vanish on stationary states, e.g. should be\na gradient of the divergence. Some Finite Element methods allow to naturally\nembed this grad-div structure, e.g. the SUPG method or OSS. We prove here that\nthe particular discretization associated to them still fails to be constraint\npreserving. We then introduce a new framework on Cartesian grids based on\nsurface (volume in 3D) integrated operators inspired by Global Flux quadrature\nand related to mimetic approaches. We are able to construct\nconstraint-compatible stabilization operators (e.g. of SUPG-type) and show that\nthe resulting methods are vorticity-preserving. We show that the Global Flux\napproach is even super-convergent on stationary states, we characterize the\nkernels of the discrete operators and we provide projections onto them.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
