The existence of both dark matter lacking and dark matter\ndominated systems within the same family of astrophysical objects indeed\nrequires the gravity models to be versatile enough to describe very different\ngravitational regimes. In this work, we study a non-local extension of the\ntheory of General Relativity that has drawn increasing attention in recent\nyears due to its capability to account for the late time cosmic acceleration\nwithout introducing any dark energy fluid. We leverage the kinematic data of\nthree Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies: NGC 1052-DF2 and NGC 1052-DF4, which are dark\nmatter lacking, and Dragonfly 44, which exhibits a highly dominant dark matter\ncomponent. Our analysis shows that the non-local corrections to the Newtonian\npotential do not affect the kinematic predictions, hence no spoiling effects\nemerge when the Non-local Gravity model serves as a dark energy model. We\nadditionally provide the minimum value that the characteristic non-local radii\ncan reach at these mass scales.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
