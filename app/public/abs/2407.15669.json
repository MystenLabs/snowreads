In contrast to the Euler-Poisson system with pressure, when\nits smooth solutions experience $C^1$ blow-up, the $L^\\infty$ norm of the\ndensity becomes unbounded, which is often referred to as a delta-shock. We\nprovide a constructive proof of singularity formation to obtain an exact\nblow-up profile and the detailed asymptotic behavior of the solutions near the\nblow-up point in both time and space. Our result indicates that at the blow-up\ntime $t=T_\\ast$, the density function is unbounded but is locally integrable\nwith the profile of $\\rho(x,T_\\ast) \\sim (x-x_*)^{-2/3}$ near the blow-up point\n$x=x_\\ast$. This profile is not yet a Dirac measure. On the other hand, the\nvelocity function has $C^{1/3}$ regularity at the blow-up point. Loosely\nfollowing our analysis, we also obtain an exact blow-up profile for the\npressureless Euler equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
