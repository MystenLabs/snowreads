We\nextend this theorem to the spherical geometry by adapting a forgotten proof by\nChasles of the classical theorem. Compared to the existing results, this is a\nslightly stronger statement with a much shorter proof.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"P3-f9cIks3-YhJFnZ5QpPmxDftcm7JCuWhNTi5OuLAs","pdfSize":"308787"}
