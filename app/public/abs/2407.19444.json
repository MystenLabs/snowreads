As a corollary we show that a set $R\\subset\n\\mathbb{N}$ is a set of nice recurrence if and only if it is nicely\nintersective. Together, the inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle\nand it's corollary partially answer two questions of Moreira.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IiVZDnDz5vNlgqrBvDxzXDb1PEYrZprMcjCgdlpfNIo","pdfSize":"193335"}
