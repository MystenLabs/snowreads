Our approach utilizes an effective Lagrangian to construct the\nkernel amplitudes, which respect both heavy quark symmetry and hidden local\nsymmetry. After solving the coupled integral equations, we obtain the\ntransition amplitudes for $J/\\psi N$ scattering and various heavy meson and\nsingly heavy baryon scattering processes. We identify seven distinct peaks\nrelated to molecular states of heavy mesons $\\bar{D}$ ($\\bar{D}^*$) and singly\nheavy baryons $\\Sigma_c$ ($\\Sigma_c^*$). Four of these peaks can be associated\nwith the known $P_{c\\bar{c}}$ states: $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4312)$,\n$P_{c\\bar{c}}(4380)$, $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4440)$, and $P_{c\\bar{c}}(4457)$. We\npredict two additional resonances with masses around 4.5 GeV, which we\ninterpret as $\\overline{D}^* \\Sigma_c^*$ molecular states, and identify one\ncusp structure. Additionally, we predict two $P$-wave pentaquark states with\npositive parity, which may be candidates for genuine pentaquark configurations.\nNotably, these pentaquark states undergo significant modifications in the\n$J/\\psi N$ elastic channel, with some even disappearing due to interference\nfrom the positive parity channel. The present investigation may provide insight\ninto the absence of pentaquark states in $J/\\psi$ photoproduction observed by\nthe GlueX collaboration.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
