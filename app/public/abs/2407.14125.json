We selected CrGeSe$_3$, CrGeTe$_3$, and Janus\nCr$_2$Ge$_2$(Se,Te)$_3$ monolayers as case studies and calculated the full\nexchange tensors among all relevant atomic pairs and analyze their dependence\non different external parameters, such as biaxial and uniaxial strain, as well\nas gate voltage. We pay special attention to interactions that emerge or vanish\ndue to changes of the symmetry of the system. We find that biaxial and uniaxial\nstrains significantly modify isotropic exchange couplings, which can lead to a\ntransition from a ferromagnetic to an antiferromagnetic phase, while a gate\nvoltage induces Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, forming a vortex pattern\nwhose chirality is determined by the sign of the electric field. The electric\ndipole moment of the Janus material is large, raising the possibility of\nmultiferroic behaviour. The polarizability is similar for the three compounds.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
