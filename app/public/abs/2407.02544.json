We investigate the connection\nbetween Hoffman colorability and several graph operations, of which the tensor\nproduct is especially interesting in this context. We then introduce the\nDecomposition Theorem revealing structural properties that Hoffman colorings\nmust obey. Using the Decomposition Theorem we are able to completely classify\nHoffman colorability of cone graphs and line graphs. We also prove a partial\nconverse, the Composition Theorem, allowing us to find various new infinite\nfamilies of Hoffman colorable graphs, many of which are irregular. Lastly we\nintroduce a new parameterization and type system for strongly regular graphs,\nthat show connections between Hoffman colorability, spreadability,\npseudo-geometricity and unique vector colorability.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eYemt-bbfrLvRpHwfA-3kRD685zPINDmM2tirDuETb8","pdfSize":"976910"}
