We also provide upper and lower bounds\nfor the Szpiro ratio that hold for almost all elliptic curves in certain\none-parameter families. The results are achieved by proving that, given any\nmultivariate polynomial within a general class, the absolute value of the\npolynomial over an expanding box is typically bounded by a fixed power of its\nradical. The proof adapts work of Fouvry--Nair--Tenenbaum, which shows that\nalmost all elliptic curves have Szpiro ratio close to $1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
