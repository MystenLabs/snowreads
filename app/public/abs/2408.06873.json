We tackle these problems for so-called\nweighted tournament solutions by generalizing the notion of margin of victory\n(MoV) for tournament solutions by Brill et. al to weighted tournament\nsolutions. For these, the MoV of a winner (resp. loser) is the total weight\nthat needs to be changed in the tournament to make them a loser (resp. winner).\nWe study three weighted tournament solutions: Borda's rule, the weighted\nUncovered Set, and Split Cycle. For all three rules, we determine whether the\nMoV for winners and non-winners is tractable and give upper and lower bounds on\nthe possible values of the MoV. Further, we axiomatically study and generalize\nproperties from the unweighted tournament setting to weighted tournaments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
