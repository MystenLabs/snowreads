Revisiting first the case of parallel sheets, we find multiple equilibria\nwhich we classify in a parameter space. In solution branching diagrams we\nidentify hysteresis cycles and folds indicating abrupt transitions, yet not\nnecessarily leading to channel collapse. Between nonparallel sheets, a drop can\nstay in equilibrium away from the ends even when the liquid is totally wetting,\nwhich is impossible between nonparallel rigid plates. We also show that\nnonparallel sheets can delay or prevent collapse in comparison to straight\nchannels, suggesting thus a mechanism that protects slender structures inside\nmicro-devices from damage by surface tension.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
