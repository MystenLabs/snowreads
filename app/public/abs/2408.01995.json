Let \\phi_N^{(i)}\n(i=1,2) be the characteristic functions of the Sturm-Liouville problem on T_0\nrooted at v_i with Neumann conditions at the root and let \\phi_D^{(i)} (i=1,2)\nbe the characteristic functions of the Sturm-Liouville problem on T_0 with\nDirichlet conditions at the root. We prove that if attaching any tree to T_0 at\nthe vertices v_1 and v_2 leads to cospectral trees and d(v_1)=d(v_2) then\n\\phi_N(\\lambda)^{(1)}\\equiv \\phi_N(\\lambda)^{(2)} and\n\\phi_D(\\lambda)^{(1)}\\equiv \\phi_D(\\lambda)^{(1)} (which means that the\nscattering is the same at v_1 and v_2).\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
