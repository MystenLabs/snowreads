Our lightweight, in-house-built\nrobot is designed specifically for learning algorithms with low simulation\ncomplexity, anthropomorphic motion, and high reliability against falls. The\nrobot's narrow sim-to-real gap enables agile and robust locomotion across\nvarious terrains in outdoor environments, achieved with a simple reinforcement\nlearning controller using light domain randomization. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the robot traversing for hundreds of meters, walking on a steep\nunpaved trail, and hopping with single and double legs as a testimony to its\nhigh performance in dynamical walking. Capable of omnidirectional locomotion\nand withstanding large perturbations with a compact setup, our system aims for\nscalable, sim-to-real deployment of learning-based humanoid systems.
