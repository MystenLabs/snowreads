Using the conformal\ntransformation of the metric and the corresponding models with induced gravity\nterms, we obtain the general solutions in the spatially flat, open and closed\nFriedmann universes and the corresponding integrals of motion. The obtained\ngeneral solutions can be written in terms of the Jacobi elliptic functions of\nthe conformal time.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
