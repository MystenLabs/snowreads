We then\nfocus on its supersymmetric solutions with a null Killing vector and find three\nnew ones. Two of these, namely the null warped AdS$_3$ (also known as the\nSchr\\\"odinger spacetime) and the charged domain wall solutions, admit\nnon-trivial gauge fields which give rise to rotating solutions in 6-dimensions.\nThe uplift of the first one produces an interesting AdS$_3 \\times$S$^3$\nbackground with a non-trivial rotation in the $U(1)$ fiber direction of the\nS$^3$ which retains the Schr\\\"odinger scale invariance that the seed solution\nhas. The second one leads to the well-known rotating dyonic string solution.\nFinally, the uplift of the third one, which is a domain wall solution with no\ngauge fields, results in a distribution of dyonic strings.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
