Here we\npresent an experimental apparatus for performing quantum experiments with\nsingle nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. This apparatus is capable of\nbasic experiments such as single-qubit initialization, rotation, and\nmeasurement, as well as more advanced experiments investigating\nelectron-nuclear spin interactions. We describe the basic physics of the NV\ncenter and give examples of potential experiments that can be performed with\nthis apparatus. We also discuss the options and inherent trade-offs associated\nwith the choice of diamond samples and hardware. The apparatus described here\nenables students to write their own experimental control and data analysis\nsoftware from scratch all within a single semester of a typical lab course, as\nwell as to inspect the optical components and inner workings of the apparatus.\nWe hope that this work can serve as a standalone resource for any institution\nthat would like to integrate a quantum instructional lab into its undergraduate\nphysics and engineering curriculum.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
