We prove that if a backward shift\nadmits a non-zero frequently recurrent vector, then it supports a dense set of\nsuch vectors, so that the operator is frequently recurrent. As a consequence,\nwe provide two different characterizations for frequently recurrent backward\nshift operators and we show dense lineability of the set of the set of\nfrequently recurrent vectors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
