In this paper, the influence Equation of\nshock-to-detonation transition is summarized for the oblique detonation problem\nfrom aerodynamic analysis. The Equation integrates the effects of parameters\nsuch as chemical reaction, shock intensity and wall conditions, which\nquantitatively explains the physical mechanism of shock-to-detonation\ntransition in the form of mathematical expression. Comparison with numerical\nsimulation results as well as their gradients verified the reliability of the\ninfluence Equation. Further, the influence Equation can also be used to predict\nthe critical conditions for the transition from shock to detonation transition\nform. In addition to oblique detonation, the influence Equation is compatible\nwith the deflagration-to-detonation problem for normal detonation, which shows\na wide applicability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"hLveU2ZNO11-y9A-uETVi_cO7lphhSYVqL8h2v75mUQ","pdfSize":"570263"}
