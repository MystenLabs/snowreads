Such\noperator $d$-tuples satisfying this matrix-positivity condition are called,\nherein, Toeplitz-contractive, and a characterisation of the\nToeplitz-contractivity condition is presented. The matrix-positivity condition\nleads to definitions of new distance-measures in several variable operator\ntheory, generalising the notions of norm, numerical radius, and spectral radius\nto $d$-tuples of operators (commuting, for the spectral radius) in what appears\nto be a novel, asymmetric way. Toeplitz contractive operators form a\nnoncommutative convex set, and a scaling constant $c_d$ for inclusions of the\nminimal and maximal matrix convex sets determined by a stretching of the unit\ncircle $S^1$ across $d$ complex dimensions is shown to exist.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NZbnC2HSYQywY4EBp5C_FKijtJUf97R6BuuJnjJBKRE","pdfSize":"289422"}
