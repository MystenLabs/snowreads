Our research\nproposes an intuitive and effective framework for ABSA in low-resource\nlanguages such as Korean. It optimizes prediction labels by integrating\ntranslated benchmark and unlabeled Korean data. Using a model fine-tuned on\ntranslated data, we pseudo-labeled the actual Korean NLI set. Subsequently, we\napplied LaBSE and MSP-based filtering to this pseudo-NLI set as implicit\nfeature, enhancing Aspect Category Detection and Polarity determination through\nadditional training. Incorporating dual filtering, this model bridged dataset\ngaps, achieving positive results in Korean ABSA with minimal resources. Through\nadditional data injection pipelines, our approach aims to utilize high-resource\ndata and construct effective models within communities, whether corporate or\nindividual, in low-resource language countries. Compared to English ABSA, our\nframework showed an approximately 3% difference in F1 scores and accuracy. We\nrelease the dataset and our code for Korean ABSA, at this link.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
