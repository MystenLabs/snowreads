Most saliently, we show that, similarly to neutral\nexcitons and trions in monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides, the spectrum\nis sensitive to the Berry curvature and thus quantum-geometric effects\nunderlying the electron and hole wave functions. Due to the spatial separation\nbetween the electron and hole constituting the exciton in different layers, the\nBerry-curvature-induced splitting of the between the $2p_+$ and the $2p_-$\nexciton states is smaller than for monolayer excitons. Furthermore, we\ninvestigate the dependence of the exciton spectra on the dielectric environment\nand the twist angle between the two layers. Finally, the long-lived moir\\'e\ninterlayer exciton ground state ($1s$) enhances the possibility of creating\nbrightened $2p_{\\pm}$ states using a circularly polarized medium-infrared probe\nfrom the $1s$ ground state. As a result, we determine the polarizability of the\n$1s-2p_{\\pm}$ transition, following by two-level dressed model for the optical\nStark effect.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
