Using Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) derived from\nBayesian network models, we analyze the dependencies among domain scores and\ntheir influence on the global CDR. Our approach leverages the PC algorithm to\nestimate the DAG structures for both datasets, revealing notable differences in\ncausal relationships and edge strengths between the Western and Indian\npopulations. The analysis highlights a stronger dependency of CDR scores on\nmemory functions in both datasets, but with significant variations in edge\nstrengths and node degrees. By contrasting these findings, we aim to elucidate\npopulation-specific differences and similarities in dementia progression,\nproviding insights that could inform targeted interventions and improve\nunderstanding of dementia across diverse demographic contexts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
