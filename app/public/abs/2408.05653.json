Relevant models were\nthen established to analyze the relationships between capacity output, capacity\nutilization, and income, and the function of collecting taxes to control\nfishing capacity was quantitatively simulated. It was pointed out that the tax\nsystem would be effective for curtailing fishing capacity and improving the\nefficiency of the entire fishing industry in China, provided that the tax rate\nis not too low. Finally, it was suggested that collecting taxes at a proper\nrate be implemented for Chinese inshore fishing fleets.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
