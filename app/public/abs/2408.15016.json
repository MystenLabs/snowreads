However, evidence of SLA violations in Internet of Things\n(IoT) service monitoring data can be manipulated by the provider or consumer,\nresulting in an issue of trust between contracted parties. The following\nresearch aims to explore the use of blockchain technology in monitoring IoT\nsystems using smart contracts so that SLA violations captured are irrefutable\namongst service providers and clients. The research focuses on the development\nof a Java library that is capable of generating a smart contract from a given\nSLA. A smart contract generated by this library is validated through a mock\nscenario presented in the form of a Remote Patient Monitoring IoT system. In\nthis scenario, the findings demonstrate a 100 percent success rate in capturing\nall emulated violations.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I_VVK0hcQzIxC7jntEuWbsTFDdsu3zAU80hPz13wiTw","pdfSize":"806152"}
