We will first review the basic mechanisms of\nlight production in most organic liquid scintillators. For most practical\ndetector applications, the scintillators need to be optimized for choices of\nphotosensors and compatibility with optical windows. A summary of important\npast experimental projects with liquid scintillators is provided. We will\ncomplete the review with a list of modern practices, particularly of metal\ndoping, and development of water based hybrid materials that allow simultaneous\ndetection of Cherenkov and scintillation light.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"JnvdVtEjHyVHAUKnj7vudhfaT_iQPTrWWR0P0MNY7n4","pdfSize":"2010688","txDigest":"9LNyBgvuHATYMLwFypX7B6pkRzf7JBAFVF1EZn7q2qV2","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
