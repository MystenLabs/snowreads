This makes a $(3+1)$-dimensional\nEinstein-Maxwell system coupled to a free fermion fluid, known as an electron\ncloud, undergo a holographic renormalization group flow. The inner (Cauchy)\nhorizon is destroyed and the near-singularity metric instead adopts the form of\na positive-$p_t$ Kasner cosmology, signaling the collapse of the Einstein-Rosen\nbridge. Previous studies have suggested that this collapse hinders direct\nprobing of the singularity. Nonetheless, we propose and compute several CFT\nobservables that characterize the interior and near-singularity geometries.\nThese include the thermal $a$-function, which decays with a specific power of\n$p_t$ as nearly all CFT degrees of freedom are integrated out, and two-point\ncorrelators for neutral and charged operators, with the latter directly probing\nthe singularity despite the positive-$p_t$. We also calculate characteristic\nvelocities related to entanglement and complexity growth in the time-evolved\nthermofield double state, as well as the butterfly effect indicative of\noperator spreading. Notably, the deformed electron cloud features a Lifshitz IR\nfixed point and an additional Kasner trans-IR fixed point, absent in neutral RG\nflows.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
