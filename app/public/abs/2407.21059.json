The\nincreasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG,\nleading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary\ntechnologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems.\nHowever, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm,\nwith many methods struggling to be unified under the process of\n\"retrieve-then-generate\". In this context, this paper examines the limitations\nof the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By\ndecomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized\noperators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG\ntranscends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced\ndesign that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on\nextensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG\npatterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive\nanalysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents\ninnovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG\nsystems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators\nand paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical\nroadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG\ntechnologies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
