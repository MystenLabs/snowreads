How\ncan a theory of such complex biological states be developed? Here we note that\nfor a hierarchical biological system to be robust, it must achieve consistency\nbetween micro-scale (e.g. molecular) and macro-scale (e.g. cellular) phenomena.\nThis allows for a universal theory of adaptive change in cells based on\nbiological robustness and consistency between cellular growth and molecular\nreplication. Here, we show how adaptive changes in high-dimensional phenotypes\n(biological states) are constrained to low-dimensional space, leading to the\nderivation of a macroscopic law for cellular states. The theory is then\nextended to evolution, leading to proportionality between evolutionary and\nenvironmental responses, as well as proportionality between phenotypic\nvariances due to noise and due to genetic changes. The universality of the\nresults across several models and experiments is demonstrated. Then, by further\nextending the theory of evolutionary dimensional reduction to multicellular\nsystems, the relationship between multicellular development and evolution, in\nparticular the developmental hourglass, is demonstrated. Finally, the\npossibility of collapse of dimensional reduction under nutrient limitation is\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
