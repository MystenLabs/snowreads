We propose a spatial sign-based max-type test to handle\nsparse alternative cases. Additionally, we prove that this test is\nasymptotically independent of the spatial-sign-based sum-type test proposed by\nLiu et al. (2023). Based on this result, we introduce a Cauchy Combination test\nprocedure that combines both the max-type and sum-type tests. Simulation\nstudies and real data applications demonstrate that the new proposed test\nprocedure is robust not only for heavy-tailed distributions but also for the\nsparsity of the alternative hypothesis.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sahCUKrhlu7rk7OyK_t3g881L3iBkq9R9iov3I9FwI0","pdfSize":"496858"}
