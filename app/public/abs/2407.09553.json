Leveraging error regression\nand an efficient VMamba architecture, ResVMUNetX enhances brightness, recovers\nstructural details, and removes noise through a two-step process involving\ndirect pixel addition and a specialized Denoise CNN module. Demonstrating\nsuperior performance on the LOL dataset, ResVMUNetX significantly improves\nimage clarity and quality with reduced computational demands, achieving\nreal-time processing speeds of up to 70 frames per second. This confirms its\neffectiveness in enhancing low-light images and its potential for practical,\nreal-time applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
