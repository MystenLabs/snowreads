The addition of the coarse level\nnetwork improves scalability and convergence rates compared to the single level\nmethod. Tested on a Poisson equation with Dirichlet boundary conditions, the\ntwo-level deep DDM demonstrates superior performance, maintaining efficient\nconvergence regardless of the number of subdomains. This advance provides a\nmore scalable and effective approach to solving complex partial differential\nequations with machine learning.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
