A defective log-Sobolev\ninequality was already established implicitly in a previous joint work with F.\nChen and Z. Ren [arXiv:2212.03050 [math.PR]]. It remains only to tighten it by\na uniform Poincar\\'e inequality, which we prove by the method in a recent work\nof Guillin, W. Liu, L. Wu and C. Zhang [Ann. Appl. Probab., 32(3):1590-1614,\n2022]. As an application, we show that the particle system exhibits the\nconcentration of measure phenomenon in the long time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
