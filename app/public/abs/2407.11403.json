In the\nfirst part, we introduce a solution-generating method and classify black hole\nsolutions into three categories in standard double field theory. To solve the\nproblem of double time, we utilize space/time split double field theory in the\nsecond part to derive black hole solutions. By introducing a cosmological\nconstant and imposing the strong constraint, our findings indicate that when\nconsidering the entire doubled spacetime, the curvature signifies an AdS\nvacuum. However, in the subspace of the entire spacetime, black holes and\ncurvature singularities emerge.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"fKqq2Apl48uoWbYME2qLbCmZbByWqgHOUgBwfzNnUMM","pdfSize":"480380"}
