The DOM links both\nscattering and bound-state experimental data through a subtracted dispersion\nrelation which allows for fully-consistent, data-informed predictions for\nnuclei where such data exists. Large skins were predicted for both ${}^{48}$Ca\n($R^{48}_\\textrm{skin}=0.25 \\pm 0.023$ fm in 2017) and $^{208}$Pb\n($R^{208}_\\textrm{skin}=0.25 \\pm 0.05$ fm in 2020). While the DOM prediction in\n$^{208}$Pb is within 1$\\sigma$ of the subsequent PREX-2 measurement, the DOM\nprediction in $^{48}$Ca is over 2$\\sigma$ larger than the thin neutron skin\nresulting from CREX. From the moment it was revealed, the thin skin in\n${}^{48}$Ca has puzzled the nuclear-physics community as no adequate theories\nsimultaneously predict both a large skin in ${}^{208}$Pb and a small skin in\n${}^{48}$Ca. The DOM is unique in its ability to treat both structure and\nreaction data on the same footing, providing a unique perspective on this\n$R_\\textrm{skin}$ puzzle. It appears vital that more neutron data be measured\nin both the scattering and bound-state domain for ${}^{48}$Ca to clarify the\nsituation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zCjdKkBwBexWMfRApZbOjkKNb9OqTlpprc8S7w_Ejcs","pdfSize":"1182745"}
