As an extreme case of the narrow band\ndispersion, we investigate spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity in\ntwo-dimensional Hubbard models with an incipient flat band. For all of the\nsystems investigated in this study, the Kagome, Lieb, and bilayer square\nlattices with a flat band, we find that spin-singlet pairing superconductivity\nis enhanced when the flat band is nearly fully filled, due to the interband\npair scattering even when the flat band becomes dispersive by correlation\neffects. Among these models, enhancement of superconductivity is weak in the\nLieb lattice, possibly because the density of states of the wide band goes to\nzero at the Dirac point where the flat and wide bands intersect. Also, when the\nelectron density is smaller so that the flat band approaches half filling,\nferromagnetic spin fluctuations and spin-triplet pairing arises, which does not\ndevelop strongly compared to the case of the spin-singlet pairing for the\nincipient band situation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
