Our proofs rely on adapting recent arguments of\nWorkman which were used to study certain sequences of CMC hypersurfaces and\nwere in turn adapted from work on Da Lio-Gianocca-Riviere. Moreover, we are\nable to refine Workman's methods by using techniques related to polynomially\nweighted Sobolev spaces. This all also requires us to extend the analysis to\nhandle when the shrinkers we study are non-compact, which we can do due to the\navailability of a suitable notion of finite weighted volume. Finally, we\nidentify a technical condition which ensures the Morse index of an\nasymptotically conical shrinker is bounded below by the f-index of its\nasymptotic cone.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"k8YPSEfT0nVlAu4cJOlgO6kG-Ry-5D91pGdhnxYN1ts","pdfSize":"512155"}
