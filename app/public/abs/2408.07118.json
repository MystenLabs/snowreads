Leveraging the power of Destination Oriented\nDirected Acyclic Graphs (DODAGs), our protocol optimizes resource consumption\nand enhances robustness to noise in dynamic and lossy networks. Implementing a\nvariation on the X-protocol within the DODAG, we minimize graph verification\nand path-finding calculations, significantly reducing computational overhead\nwhen compared to other entanglement routing schemes. Additionally, our\nbenchmarks on grid lattice and small-world topologies reveal substantial\nmeasurement reduction compared to existing protocols. We demonstrate the\nsuccess of DODAG-X for generating maximal three-party entanglement in arbitrary\nnetworks, and describe the potential for scaling to generic $n$-party\nentanglement. The DODAG-X protocol provides a scalable and efficient solution\nfor entanglement routing, advancing current techniques for reliable quantum\ncommunication and network applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Information Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
