At the TeV scale, the gauge groups\n$SU(2)_R$ and $U(1)_{B-L}$ are assumed to act in a non-universal manner on\nlight- and third-generation fermions, while the Higgs emerges as a pseudo\nNambu-Goldstone boson of the spontaneous global symmetry breaking $Sp(4)\\to\nSU(2)_L\\times SU(2)_R^{[3]}$, attributed to new strong dynamics. The flavour\ndeconstruction means the couplings of the light families to the composite\nsector (and therefore the pNGB Higgs) are suppressed by powers of a heavy mass\nscale (from which the Higgs is nevertheless shielded by compositeness),\nexplaining the flavour puzzle. We present a detailed analysis of the\nradiatively generated Higgs potential, showing how this intrinsically-flavoured\nframework has the ingredients to justify the unavoidable tuning in the Higgs\npotential necessary to separate electroweak and composite scales. This happens\nfor large enough values of the $SU(2)_R^{[3]}$ gauge coupling and light enough\nflavoured gauge bosons resulting from the deconstruction, whose phenomenology\nis also investigated. The model is compatible with current experimental bounds\nand predicts new states at the TeV scale, which are within the reach of near\nfuture experimental searches.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
