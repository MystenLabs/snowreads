The estimator extracts information from a single\nsketch of the matrix, that is, the product of the matrix with a few standard\nGaussian random vectors. While this estimator has been proposed and used in the\nliterature before, the existing variance bounds are often pessimistic. Our work\nprovides a sharper upper bound on the variance and we also give estimates of\nthe variance that work well for numerically low-rank matrices. Our theoretical\nfindings are supported by numerical experiments, demonstrating that the new\nbounds are significantly tighter than the existing ones.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
