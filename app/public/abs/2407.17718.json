In practical applications, segmented models are\ncommonly used to describe an abrupt model change. For segmented models, the\ncomplicated uncertainty propagation during the transition region may lead to\ndifferent importance rankings of different GSA methods. If an unsuitable GSA\nmethod is applied, misleading results will be obtained, resulting in suboptimal\nor even wrong decisions. In this paper, four GSA indices, i.e., Sobol index,\nmutual information, delta index and PAWN index, are applied for a segmented\nfire spread model (Dry Eucalypt). The results show that four GSA indices give\ndifferent importance rankings during the transition region since segmented\ncharacteristics affect different GSA indices in different ways. We suggest that\nanalysts should rely on the results of different GSA indices according to their\npractical purpose, especially when making decisions for segmented models during\nthe transition region.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gvs5dlWyNAs5SC5gTViU_aAofbm1OfoljmfaUvkutDY","pdfSize":"1335367"}
