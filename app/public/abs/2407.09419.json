The blazar was followed up\nby the T60 robotic telescope in Turkey for 416 nights to obtain long-term\nvariability during this period. In order to search for intraday variability of\nthe object, we have carried out 21 nights of observations with the T100\ntelescope for at least 1 hour. The blazar showed a ~2.47 mag variation in the\noptical R-band during our monitoring period, the brightest state on 18.01.2020\n(MJD 58866) as R=12.109$\\pm$0.011 and the faintest state on 23.03.2019 (MJD\n58565) as R=14.580$\\pm$0.013. We employed the nested ANOVA test and the power\nenhanced F-test to quantify intraday variability which showed that the blazar\nwas significantly variable in the R-band on 12 out of 21 nights. Correlation\nanalysis of the light curves shows that the emission in the BVRI optical bands\nwas strongly correlated both in the short and long term without any time lag.\nThe blazar has likely quasi-periods of 186$\\pm$30, 532$\\pm$76 days in the\noptical R-band light curve according to the WWZ, and the LS periodogram. The\nIDV and LTV features are discussed within the frame of prospective scenarios.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VVarqtdSNyWPqTyDT3oPuUdVOSbsKTiFjd2keP285cg","pdfSize":"3337938"}
