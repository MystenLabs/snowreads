We provide the first infinite family of\ntriangle presentations that give rise to lattices in exotic buildings of type\n$\\widetilde{\\text{A}_2}$ of arbitrarily large order. Our method also gives rise\nto infinite families of triangle presentations for other link types, such as\nopposition complexes in Desarguesian projective planes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
