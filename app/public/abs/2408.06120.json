To investigate the effects it has on the\ndiscourse, we perform a mixed-method frame semantics-based analysis on a\ndataset of more than 49,000 sentences collected from 5846 news articles that\nmention AI. The dataset covers the twelve-month period centred around the\nlaunch of OpenAI's chatbot ChatGPT and is collected from the most visited\nopen-access English-language news publishers. Our findings indicate that during\nthe half year succeeding the launch, media attention rose\ntenfold$\\unicode{x2014}$from already historically high levels. During this\nperiod, discourse has become increasingly centred around experts and political\nleaders, and AI has become more closely associated with dangers and risks. A\ndeeper review of the data also suggests a qualitative shift in the types of\nthreat AI is thought to represent, as well as the anthropomorphic qualities\nascribed to it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
