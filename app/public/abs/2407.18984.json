A {\\it semi-covariety} is a non-empty family $\\mathcal{F}$ of\nnumerical semigroups such that it is closed under finite intersections, has a\nminimum, $\\min(\\mathcal{F}),$ and if $S\\in \\mathcal{F}$ being $S\\neq\n\\min(\\mathcal{F})$, then there is $x\\in S$ such that $S\\backslash \\{x\\}\\in\n\\mathcal{F}$. As examples, we will study the semi-covariety formed by all the\nnumerical semigroups containing a fixed numerical semigroup, and the\nsemi-covariety composed by all the numerical semigroups of coated odd elements\nand fixed Frobenius number.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
