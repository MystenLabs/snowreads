Modeling and solving optimization problems in a specific domain\ntypically require a combination of domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and\nprogramming ability, making it difficult for general users and even domain\nprofessionals. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called OptLLM that\naugments LLMs with external solvers. Specifically, OptLLM accepts user queries\nin natural language, convert them into mathematical formulations and\nprogramming codes, and calls the solvers to calculate the results for\ndecision-making. In addition, OptLLM supports multi-round dialogues to\ngradually refine the modeling and solving of optimization problems. To\nillustrate the effectiveness of OptLLM, we provide tutorials on three typical\noptimization applications and conduct experiments on both prompt-based GPT\nmodels and a fine-tuned Qwen model using a large-scale selfdeveloped\noptimization dataset. Experimental results show that OptLLM works with various\nLLMs, and the fine-tuned model achieves an accuracy boost compared to the\npromptbased models. Some features of OptLLM framework have been available for\ntrial since June 2023 (https://opt.alibabacloud.com/chat or\nhttps://opt.aliyun.com/chat).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
