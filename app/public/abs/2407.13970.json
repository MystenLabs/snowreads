The aim is to ensure valid\nfrequentist coverage of Bayes credible intervals when estimating continuous\nlinear functionals of the parameter. Our results show that Bayes credible\nintervals have conservative coverage under certain smoothness assumptions on\nthe parameter and a compatibility condition between the likelihood and the\nprior, regardless of whether an efficient limit exists and/or Bernstein\nvon-Mises theorem holds. In the latter case, our results yield a corollary with\nmore relaxed sufficient conditions than previous works. We illustrate practical\nutility of the results through the example of estimating the conductivity\ncoefficient of a second order elliptic PDE, where a near-$N^{-1/2}$ contraction\nrate and conservative coverage results are obtained for linear functionals that\nwere shown not to be estimable efficiently.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hIVTeX0Wwoq_2XHXUlz3zL1Y3fqomW-19Jl_feKiyD8","pdfSize":"1474904"}
