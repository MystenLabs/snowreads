However, the low qubit count on current quantum computers is a major\nobstacle in competing against classical methods. Here, we develop a\nqubit-efficient algorithm that overcomes this limitation by mapping a candidate\nbit string solution to an entangled wave function of fewer qubits. We propose a\nvariational quantum circuit generalizing the quantum approximate optimization\nansatz (QAOA). Extremizing the ansatz for Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass\nproblems, we show valuable properties such as the concentration of ansatz\nparameters and derive performance guarantees. This approach could benefit\nnear-term intermediate-scale and future fault-tolerant small-scale quantum\ndevices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"J1AanufoYlgwSXhXSoHAnKG0UcKzh4FhE5-lTZGZd14","pdfSize":"4014811"}
