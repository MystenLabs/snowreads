Monte Carlo simulations are\nroutinely performed on such random models to obtain statistics on their\nlong-term response. Such simulations, however, are prohibitively expensive and\ntime consuming for high-dimensional nonlinear systems. Here we propose to\ndecrease this numerical burden significantly by reducing the full system to\nvery low-dimensional, attracting, random invariant manifolds in its phase space\nand performing the Monte Carlo simulations on that reduced dynamical system.\nThe random spectral submanifolds (SSMs) we construct for this purpose\ngeneralize the concept of SSMs from deterministic systems under uniformly\nbounded random forcing. We illustrate the accuracy and speed of random SSM\nreduction by computing the SSM-reduced power spectral density of the randomly\nforced mechanical systems that range from simple oscillator chains to\nfinite-element models of beams and plates.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
