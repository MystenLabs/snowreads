The hypersurface defined by the polynomial F is called a hypersurface\nwith separable variables. A variety is called rigid if there are no nontrivial\nactions of the additive group of the ground field on it. If a variety is rigid,\nthen it is known that in the automorphism group there exists a unique maximal\ntorus. We describe the automorphism group of a rigid hypersurface with\nseparable variables, in particular we show that it is a finite extension of the\nmaximal torus.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
