Existing\nbenchmarks that assess this vulnerability primarily rely on manual\nconstruction, resulting in limited scale and lack of scalability. In this work,\nwe introduce an automated, scalable pipeline to create FPQs based on knowledge\ngraphs (KGs). The first step is modifying true triplets extracted from KGs to\ncreate false premises. Subsequently, utilizing the state-of-the-art\ncapabilities of GPTs, we generate semantically rich FPQs. Based on the proposed\nmethod, we present a comprehensive benchmark, the Knowledge Graph-based False\nPremise Questions (KG-FPQ), which contains approximately 178k FPQs across three\nknowledge domains, at six levels of confusability, and in two task formats.\nUsing KG-FPQ, we conduct extensive evaluations on several representative LLMs\nand provide valuable insights.
