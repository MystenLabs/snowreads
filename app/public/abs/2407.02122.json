By highlighting the pivotal\nrole of dataset quality and diversity, it underscores the significance of these\nelements in the effectiveness and robustness of detection models. The survey\nmeticulously outlines the key features of datasets, various labeling systems\nemployed, and prevalent biases that can impact model performance. Additionally,\nit addresses critical ethical issues and best practices, offering a thorough\noverview of the current state of available datasets. Our contribution to this\nfield is further enriched by the provision of GitHub repository, which\nconsolidates publicly accessible datasets into a single, user-friendly portal.\nThis repository is designed to facilitate and stimulate further research and\ndevelopment efforts aimed at combating the pervasive issue of fake news.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
