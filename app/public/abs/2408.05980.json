We obtain estimates for the eigenvalue counting\nfunction, for individual eigenvalues and estimates of the Lieb-Thirring type. A\ncrucial tool for our estimates is Otelbaev's function, a certain average of the\nmeasure potential $\\mu$, which is used both in the proofs and the formulation\nof most of the results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
