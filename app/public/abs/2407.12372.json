We then proceed to a\nworst-case analysis of box-constrained bilevel polynomial optimization. We show\nin particular that any extended-real-valued semi-algebraic function, possibly\nnon-continuous, can be expressed as the value function of a polynomial bilevel\nprogram. Secondly, from a computational complexity perspective, the decision\nversion of polynomial bilevel programming is one level above NP in the\npolynomial hierarchy ($\\Sigma^p_2$-hard). Both types of difficulties are\nuncommon in non-linear programs for which objective functions are typically\ncontinuous and belong to the class NP. These results highlight the irremediable\nhardness attached to general bilevel optimization and the necessity of imposing\nsome form of regularity on the lower level.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
