In real-world\nscenarios, leveraging the impact of asymmetric item affiliations is crucial for\neffective bundle modeling and understanding user preferences. To address this,\nwe present BunCa, a novel bundle recommendation approach employing item-level\ncausation-enhanced multi-view learning. BunCa provides comprehensive\nrepresentations of users and bundles through two views: the Coherent View,\nleveraging the Multi-Prospect Causation Network for causation-sensitive\nrelations among items, and the Cohesive View, employing LightGCN for\ninformation propagation among users and bundles. Modeling user preferences and\nbundle construction combined from both views ensures rigorous cohesion in\ndirect user-bundle interactions through the Cohesive View and captures explicit\nintents through the Coherent View. Simultaneously, the integration of concrete\nand discrete contrastive learning optimizes the consistency and\nself-discrimination of multi-view representations. Extensive experiments with\nBunCa on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of this novel\nresearch and validate our hypothesis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
