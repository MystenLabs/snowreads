The optical Kerr effect, a\nthird-order nonlinear optical phenomenon, induces anisotropic changes in the\nrefractive index of a material under intense laser illumination. This effect is\ninherently weak, limiting its practical use in free-space nanophotonics. In\nthis work, we demonstrate an enhancement of the optical Kerr effect by more\nthan three orders of magnitude using guided-mode resonance in a dielectric\ndiffraction grating with an overall thickness of less than 300 nm. Our study\ninvolves the design, fabrication, and measurement of the transmittance of a\nresonant silicon nitride crossed grating illuminated with short light pulses.\nWe observe spectral resonance shifts with varying pulse power, leading to more\nthan fifty percent modulation of the resonance magnitude and enabling\ntransitions between `Off' and `On' states of transmission. We also demonstrate\nthe capability of the grating for dynamic pulse shaping. The results presented\nhere reveal promising directions for developing advanced all-optical devices\nbased on free-space nanophotonics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9PI86ua0-6D5BRL3oKo-atOGcaZO5n02VkaqGnnwO-0","pdfSize":"3759115"}
