Despite their societal significance, video games face ongoing\ncriticism for lacking diversity in both the workforce and content, excluding\nmarginalized gamers. This study explores game-based learning (GBL) while\nemphasizing the importance of accurate representation, particularly in\neducational settings to enhance engagement and learning outcomes. Our research\nfindings revolve around the perspectives of a professional in the gaming\nindustry and the challenges associated with creating accessible games. By\nproviding actionable insights, it aims to influence regulatory reforms,\nindustry practices, and game creation itself, to foster diversity,\nrepresentation, and accessibility in the video game industry. In doing so, we\nseek to promote a more inclusive and equitable future in the educational gaming\nworld.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
