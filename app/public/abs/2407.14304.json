We first extend the notion of convertible codes to\nallow initial and final codes with different parameters. Then, we investigate\nthe relationship between these parameters and thus establish new lower bounds\non the access cost in the merge and split regimes. To gain a deeper\nunderstanding of access-optimal MDS convertible codes in the merge regime, we\ncharacterize them from the perspective of parity check matrices. Consequently,\nwe present a necessary and sufficient condition for the access-optimal MDS\nconvertible code in the merge regime. Finally, as an application of our\ncharacterization, we construct MDS convertible codes in the merge regime with\noptimal access cost based on the extended generalized Reed-Solomon codes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
