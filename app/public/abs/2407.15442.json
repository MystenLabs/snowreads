Synergies between functional\nblocks and constructs of NFV, and components of TSN networks, are investigated\nin order to arrive at an integrated architecture. Additionally, mechanisms and\nconfiguration procedures to enable TSN-compliant, real-time, and virtualized\nend stations under the NFV framework are explored.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"6IhHWfti1MGoAYhCgh4i2hEKyzM17iui73mF-dED3j8","pdfSize":"795550"}
