Given that a discovery would\njustify more significant investments, the present work assesses the prospects\nof ambitious light-shining-through-a-wall (LSW) experiments to target the QCD\naxion band. Thanks to the excellent mass determination in haloscopes, we show\nhow to design HyperLSW, an LSW experiment with suitably aligned magnetic fields\nto reach a wide range of well-motivated axion models and to determine whether\naxions are the dominant form of DM in the Universe. In addition to presenting a\nconcrete plan for post-discovery experimental efforts, we also briefly discuss\ncomplementary experiments and future directions beyond LSW experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jdukdsmU2PX0wDV3K8iG2VLsUdKum8wABdx2VtAcZeQ","pdfSize":"1618475"}
