These distortions present a formidable\nchallenge across various applications, from surveillance to astronomy,\nnecessitating robust mitigation strategies. While model-based approaches\nachieve good results, they are very slow. Deep learning approaches show promise\nin image and video restoration but have struggled to address these\nspatiotemporal variant distortions effectively. This paper proposes a new\nframework that combines geometric restoration with an enhancement module.\nRandom perturbations and geometric distortion are removed using a pyramid\narchitecture with deformable 3D convolutions, resulting in aligned frames.\nThese frames are then used to reconstruct a sharp, clear image via a\nmulti-scale architecture of 3D Swin Transformers. The proposed framework\ndemonstrates superior performance over the state of the art for both synthetic\nand real atmospheric turbulence effects, with reasonable speed and model size.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xdqtXsFHlh8IF-4BYxsa_FK4NWX4fWhqm-BkyPzCD0Q","pdfSize":"7878009","objectId":"0x947b60f4972c2bb6e6c06292b07f6b31216f372b5a88e87e1a9f653a3d40471b","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
