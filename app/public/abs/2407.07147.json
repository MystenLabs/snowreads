While the down-type fermions from\n$W$ boson decay are known to be effective spin analyzers, charged leptons have\ntypically been the main target for most analyses. In this paper, we investigate\nthe relevance of global jet dynamics -- considering kinematics, jet charges,\nand particle multiplicity -- for hadronic top quark polarimetry. The formalism\nused allows for analytical derivations obtained throughout the manuscript,\noffering deeper insights into the corresponding phenomenology.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
