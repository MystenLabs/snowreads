Designing a high-order algorithm for geometric flows that can\nalso be theoretically proven to be energy-stable poses a significant challenge.\nMotivated by the new scalar auxiliary variable approach [F.Huang, J.Shen,\nZ.Yang, SIAM J. SCI. Comput., 42 (2020), pp. A2514-A2536], we propose novel\nenergy-stable parametric finite element approximations for\nisotropic/anisotropic surface diffusion flows, achieving both first-order and\nsecond-order accuracy in time. Additionally, we apply the algorithms to\nsimulate the solid-state dewetting of thin films. Finally, extensive numerical\nexperiments validate the accuracy, energy stability, and efficiency of our\ndeveloped numerical methods. The designed algorithms in this work exhibit\nstrong versatility, as they can be readily extended to other high-order time\ndiscretization methods (e.g., BDFk schemes). Meanwhile, the algorithms achieve\nremarkable computational efficiency and maintain excellent mesh quality. More\nimportantly, the algorithm can be theoretically proven to possess unconditional\nenergy stability, with the energy nearly equal to the original energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
