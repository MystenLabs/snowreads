Building upon this concept, C. E. Hre\\c{t}canu\nand M. Crasmareanu laid the foundation for metallic Riemannian manifolds in\n2013. The field's rich potential and diverse applications have since attracted\nsignificant research efforts, leading to a wealth of valuable insights. This\nreview delves into the latest advances in metallic Riemannian geometry, a\nrapidly progressing area within the broader field of differential geometry.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
