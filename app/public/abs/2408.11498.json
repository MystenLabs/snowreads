This challenge has become more significant in\nVolunteer Crowdsourcing Services (VCS). This study introduces Workforce\nComposition Balance (WCB), a novel framework designed to maintain workforce\ndiversity in VCS by dynamically adjusting retention decisions. The WCB\nframework integrates the Volunteer Retention and Value Enhancement (VRAVE)\nalgorithm with advanced skill-based task assignment methods. It ensures\nefficient remuneration policy for both assigned and unassigned potential\nvolunteers by incorporating their potential levels, participation dividends,\nand satisfaction scores. Comparative analysis with three state-of-the-art\nbaselines on real dataset shows that our WCB framework achieves 1.4 times\nbetter volunteer satisfaction and a 20% higher task retention rate, with only a\n12% increase in remuneration. The effectiveness of the proposed WCB approach is\nto enhance the volunteer engagement and their long-term retention, thus making\nit suitable for functioning of social good applications where a potential and\nskilled volunteer workforce is crucial for sustainable community services.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"MrhduKYoav9Jskk2P4Zzz4u8K_nl8B5gNGcfUu3op70","pdfSize":"2479031"}
