Horak and Jost showed that the largest eigenvalue\nof $\\Delta_i^{up}(K)$ is at most $i+2$, and characterized the equality case by\nthe orientable or non-orientable circuits. In this paper, by using the\nbalancedness of signed graphs, we show that $\\Delta_i^{up}(K)$ has an\neigenvalue $i+2$ if and only if $K$ has an $(i+1)$-path connected component\n$K'$ such that the $i$-th signed incidence graph $B_i(K')$ is balanced, which\nimplies Horak and Jost's characterization. We also characterize the\nmultiplicity of $i+2$ as an eigenvalue of $\\Delta_i^{up}(K)$, which generalizes\nthe corresponding result in graph case. Finally we gave some classes of\ninfinitely many simplicial complexes $K$ with $\\Delta_i^{up}(K)$ having an\neigenvalue $i+2$ by using wedge, Cartesian product and duplication of motifs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
