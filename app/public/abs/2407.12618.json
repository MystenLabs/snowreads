We discuss QML\ntechniques in supervised learning tasks, such as Quantum Variational\nClassifiers, Quantum Kernel Estimation, and Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs),\nalong with quantum generative AI techniques like Quantum Transformers and\nQuantum Graph Neural Networks (QGNNs). The financial applications considered\ninclude risk management, credit scoring, fraud detection, and stock price\nprediction. We also provide an overview of the challenges, potential, and\nlimitations of QML, both in these specific areas and more broadly across the\nfield. We hope that this can serve as a quick guide for data scientists,\nprofessionals in the financial sector, and enthusiasts in this area to\nunderstand why quantum computing and QML in particular could be interesting to\nexplore in their field of expertise.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6NHd5TfPEe0_g9d-onFOmmVR4PnKfbA2C-qpyLSTz68","pdfSize":"212463","objectId":"0x0590692ea09156e773506ee78667a172b60ac786a9e2817bec161ba566929af6","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
