In this work we present a new perturbiner expansion for\nself-dual spacetimes based on Plebanski's second heavenly equation. Our\nexpansion is naturally organized as a sum over ``marked tree graphs'' where\neach node corresponds to a positive helicity graviton and can have an arbitrary\nnumber of edges. Negative helicity gravitons must be added in by hand.\n  We then use this perturbiner expansion to give a first principles derivation\nof the NSVW tree formula for the MHV amplitude in Einstein gravity. A unique\nfeature of this proof is that it does not use BCFW recursion or twistor theory.\nIt works by plugging the spacetime with arbitrarily many $+$ gravitons and two\n$-$ gravitons into the on-shell gravitational action and evaluating it. The\naction we use is the self-dual Plebanski action plus an additional boundary\nterm. Interestingly, the amplitude comes entirely from the boundary term.\n  In the appendix we give another way to express our perturbiner expansion\nusing binary tree graphs instead of marked tree graphs, and prove the\nequivalence of these two expansions diagrammatically. We also provide an\nintroduction to self-dual gravity aimed at non-experts, as well as a proof of\nthe Parke-Taylor formula in Yang Mills theory analogous to our proof of the\nNSVW formula in gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
