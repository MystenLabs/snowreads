This has made it an ideal model system to study the\nemergence of collective behaviours in interdisciplinary research efforts lying\nat the intersection of biology and physics, especially in the growing field of\nactive matter research. Often, challenges arise when setting up reliable and\nreproducible culturing protocols. This tutorial provides a clear and\ncomprehensive guide on the culture, growth, development, and experimental\nsample preparation of \\textit{M. xanthus}. Additionally, it includes some\nrepresentative examples of experiments that can be conducted using these\nsamples, namely motility assays, fruiting body formation, predation, and\nelasticotaxis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
