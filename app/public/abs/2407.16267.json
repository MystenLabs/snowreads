Singular values\nand vectors distinguish and highlight various physical mechanisms and scales,\nrevealing previously challenging elements. SVD emerges as a powerful tool for\nnavigating complex experimental landscapes, showing promise for diverse\nexperimental measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
