Based on the reward shaping strategy, we propose a novel\nmulti-task reinforcement learning framework, that integrates a centralized\nreward agent (CRA) and multiple distributed policy agents. The CRA functions as\na knowledge pool, which aims to distill knowledge from various tasks and\ndistribute it to individual policy agents to improve learning efficiency.\nSpecifically, the shaped rewards serve as a straightforward metric to encode\nknowledge. This framework not only enhances knowledge sharing across\nestablished tasks but also adapts to new tasks by transferring valuable reward\nsignals. We validate the proposed method on both discrete and continuous\ndomains, demonstrating its robustness in multi-task sparse-reward settings and\nits effective transferability to unseen tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
