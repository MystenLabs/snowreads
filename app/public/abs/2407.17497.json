This necessitates the strategic integration of\nadvanced Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) and the Internet of\nThings (IoT) to address the emerging challenges. Grid resilience is paramount,\nas a dependable energy supply is the cornerstone of societal well-being and\neconomic activity. The primary contribution of this research is to investigate\nthe implementation of a novel grid resiliency strategy for the Irish context,\nemploying Fault Location, Isolation and Service Restoration (FLISR) techniques\nin conjunction with Edge Computing. Through a comprehensive review of existing\nliterature, original research activities, and meticulous data analysis, we aim\nto develop a solution that bolsters grid resilience and mitigates the impact of\nservice disruptions for both consumers and utilities. Additionally, our work\ndelves into the specific context of the Irish energy grid, including relevant\npolicies and regulations, to ensure the proposed FLISR strategy is not only\neffective but also readily implementable.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
