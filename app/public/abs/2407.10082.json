In this paper, we give an explicit combinatorial formula of the Chow\nweight of $\\widetilde{X}$ in terms of the base toric manifold $X$ and the\nsymplectic cuts of the Delzant polytope. We then apply this blow-up formula to\nthe projective plane and see the difference of Chow stability between the toric\nblow-up manifolds and the manifolds of blow-ups at general points. Finally, we\ndetect the blow-up formula of the Futaki-Ono invariant which is an obstruction\nfor asymptotic Chow semistability of a polarized toric manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
