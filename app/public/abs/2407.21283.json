The\nresulting quasi-interpolation takes the form of Schoenberg's tensor-product\ngeneralized Gaussian kernels restricted over circles. Notably, theoretical\nanalysis shows that it achieves the highest approximation order equal to the\norder of the generalized Strang-Fix condition satisfied by the generalized\nGaussian kernels. This is in sharp contrast to classical quasi-interpolation\ncounterparts, which often provide much lower approximation orders than those\ndictated by the generalized Strang-Fix conditions satisfied by the kernels.\nFurthermore, we construct a sparse grid counterpart for high-dimensional\nperiodic function approximation to alleviate the curse of dimensionality.\nNumerical simulations provided at the end of the paper demonstrate that our\nquasi-interpolation scheme is simple and computationally efficient.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
