Our case in point is the Poincar\\'e duality\ntheorem for Rabinowitz Floer homology. We prove that Rabinowitz Floer homology\nis a locally linearly compact vector space in the sense of Lefschetz, or,\nequivalently, a Tate vector space in the sense of Beilinson-Feigin-Mazur.\nPoincar\\'e duality and the graded Frobenius algebra structure on Rabinowitz\nFloer homology then hold in the topological sense. Along the way, we develop in\na largely self-contained manner the theory of linearly topologized vector\nspaces, with special emphasis on duality and completed tensor products,\ncomplementing results of Beilinson-Drinfeld, Beilinson, Rojas, Positselski, and\nEsposito-Penkov.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
