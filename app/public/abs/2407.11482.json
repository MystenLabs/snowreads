We present quadrature schemes to set up the\nstiffness matrix and load vector that preserve the exponential convergence of\n$hp$-FEM on geometric meshes. The schemes are based on Gauss-Jacobi and\nGauss-Legendre rules. We show that taking a number of quadrature points\nslightly exceeding the polynomial degree is enough to preserve root exponential\nconvergence. The total number of algebraic operations to set up the system is\n$\\mathcal{O}(N^{5/2})$, where $N$ is the problem size. Numerical example\nillustrate the analysis. We also extend our analysis to the fractional\nLaplacian in higher dimensions for $hp$-finite element spaces based on shape\nregular meshes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
