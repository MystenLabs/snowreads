We report here\nthat a hybrid transition can occur if each node rewires its links to restrict\nthe growth of large clusters using local information continuously up to a\nfinite number of rewirings. For example, on a branch of a Bethe lattice with\ncoordination number $4$, each node rewires its outgoing links to its\ndescendants several times in ascending order of cluster size to reach a steady\nstate. Then a hybrid transition with nontrivial critical exponents occurs as a\nfunction of the link fraction at the steady state. We observe this phenomenon\neven on a Bethe lattice without hierarchy, supporting that such a phenomenon\nmay occur on diverse tree networks with finite degrees.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
