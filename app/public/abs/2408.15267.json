Accurate\nprediction of concentrate grades is important for the automatic control and\noptimization of mineral processing. Both first-principles and data-driven\nmachine learning methods have been used to model the flotation process. The\ncomplexity of models based on first-principles restricts their direct use,\nwhile purely data-driven models often fail in dynamic industrial environments,\nleading to poor generalization. To address these limitations, this study\nintegrates classical mathematical models of froth flotation processes with\nconventional deep learning methods to construct physics-informed neural\nnetworks. These models demonstrated superior generalization and predictive\nperformance compared to purely data-driven models, on simulated data from two\nflotation cells, in terms of mean squared error and mean relative error.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
