In\nforced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type\nbackground states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long\ncyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts.\nDespite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed\nscaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by\n$O(f)$ vorticity and convergence, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale\nflows. Simulations of QG$^\\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced\nfrontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a finite time\nblow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic\nequations. The inversions in the QG$^\\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward\nelliptic problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the\nPV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate\ntransformation. Together, these results suggest QG$^\\mathrm{+1}$ as a useful\ntool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
