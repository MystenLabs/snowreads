The non-trivial\ninterplay between Green's function poles and zeros leads to an exotic quantum\nspin-Hall insulator exhibiting two chiral branches of edge Green's function\npoles and one of zeros. When symmetry breaking is allowed, a non-topological\nexcitonic insulator is found to intrude between quantum spin-Hall and Mott\ninsulators. We find evidence that excitons in the Mott insulator, which become\nsoft at the transition to the excitonic insulator, are actually bound states\nbetween valence and conduction bands of Green's function zeros, rather than\nbetween lower and upper Hubbard bands.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gYR0i8-Oh5mOCi2g49dfzt_XavetUwINimyGTpdFtdc","pdfSize":"1924170","objectId":"0x816214f7a25a79aad783500cc19a8a472a6398bc69d172d743941f91183a1b49","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
