We focus on expansions in Euclidean signature, where the\nmethod of regions can also be formulated as an expansion by subgraph. We show\nthat for such expansions valid around small/large masses and momenta the graph\ncombinatorial operations can be formulated in terms of what we call the\nasymptotic Hopf algebra. This Hopf algebra is closely related to the motic Hopf\nalgebra underlying the $R^*$ operation, an extension of Bogoliubov's $R$\noperation, to subtract both IR and UV divergences of Feynman integrals in the\nEuclidean. We focus mostly on the leading power, for which the Hopf algebra\nformulation is simpler. We uncover a close connection between Bogoliubov's $R$\noperation in the Connes-Kreimer formulation and the remainder $\\mathcal{R}$ of\nthe series expansion, whose Hopf algebraic structure is identically formalised\nin the corresponding group of characters. While in the Connes-Kreimer\nformulation the UV counterterm is formalised in terms of a twisted antipode, we\nshow that in the expansion by subgraph a similar role is played by the\nintegrand Taylor operator. To discuss the structure of higher power expansions\nwe introduce a novel Hopf monoid formulation.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
