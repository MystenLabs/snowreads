We show that for any $\\delta > 0$ and for any $1\n\\leq k \\leq (1-\\delta)m^*(G)$, the down-up walk on matchings of size $k$ in $G$\nmixes in time polynomial in $n$. Previously, polynomial mixing was not known\neven for graphs with maximum degree $\\Delta$, and our result makes progress on\na conjecture of Jain, Perkins, Sah, and Sawhney [STOC, 2022] that the down-up\nwalk mixes in optimal time $O_{\\Delta,\\delta}(n\\log{n})$.\n  In contrast with recent works analyzing mixing of down-up walks in various\nsettings using the spectral independence framework, we bound the spectral gap\nby constructing and analyzing a suitable multi-commodity flow. In fact, we\npresent constructions demonstrating the limitations of the spectral\nindependence approach in our setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qEmMuuuaONc74YPaXsHvqsBwgU7H9VJ8oyWpJB2nF_8","pdfSize":"237538"}
