Due to the diffraction limit, characterizing\nthese inhomogeneities is challenging. Recently, the visualization of stacking\ndomains in encapsulated four-layer graphene (4LG) has been demonstrated with\nphonon polariton (PhP)-assisted near-field imaging. However, the underlying\ncoupling mechanism and ability to image subdiffractional-sized inhomogeneities\nremain unknown. Here, we retrieve direct replicas and magnified images of\nsubdiffractional-sized inhomogeneities in hBN-covered trilayer graphene (TLG)\nand encapsulated 4LG, enabled by the hyperlensing effect. This hyperlensing\neffect is mediated by hBN's hyperbolic PhP that couple to the FLG's plasmon\npolaritons. Using near-field microscopy, we identify the coupling by\ndetermining the polariton dispersion in hBN-covered TLG to be\nstacking-dependent. Our work demonstrates super-resolution and magnified\nimaging of inhomogeneities, paving the way for the realization of homogeneous\nencapsulated FLG transport samples to study correlated physics.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
