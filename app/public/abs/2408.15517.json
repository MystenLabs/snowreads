In this work,\nwe focus on formaldehyde deuteration in the protobinary system NGC\\,1333\nIRAS\\,4A, located in the Perseus molecular cloud. Using high-resolution\n($\\sim$\\,100\\,au) ALMA observations, we investigate the [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO] ratio\nalong the cavity walls of the outflows emanating from IRAS\\,4A1. Our analysis\nreveals a consistent decrease in the deuteration ratio (from $\\sim$\\,60-20\\% to\n$\\sim$\\,10\\%) with increasing distance from the protostar (from\n$\\sim$\\,2000\\,au to $\\sim$\\,4000\\,au). Given the large measured\n[D$_2$CO]/[HDCO], both HDCO and D$_2$CO are likely injected by the shocks along\nthe cavity walls into the gas-phase from the dust mantles, formed in the\nprevious prestellar phase. We propose that the observed [D$_2$CO]/[HDCO]\ndecrease is due to the density profile of the prestellar core from which\nNGC\\,1333 IRAS\\,4A was born. When considering the chemical processes at the\nbase of formaldehyde deuteration, the IRAS\\,4A's prestellar precursor had a\npredominantly flat density profile within 3000\\,au and a decrease of density\nbeyond this radius.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dRR2mlOuvv1y5SJ5AZp27mpG7anohVQysJmk0qqz1Gg","pdfSize":"1234748"}
