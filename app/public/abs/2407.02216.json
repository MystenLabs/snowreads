Such maps induce completely positive maps between the\nassociated full cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras in a functorial way. Under the\nassumption that the kernel of the homomorphism connecting the groups under\nconsideration is amenable, they also induce completely positive maps between\nthe associated reduced cross-sectional $C^*$-algebras. As an application, we\ndefine an approximation property for a Fell bundle over a discrete group which\ngeneralizes Exel's approximation property and still implies the weak\ncontainment property. Both approximation properties coincide when the unit\nfibre is nuclear.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"8MPK8Uh0V3gSFoS7I81ynSSJkxl6UlL-mxU11bvmLY8","pdfSize":"356452"}
