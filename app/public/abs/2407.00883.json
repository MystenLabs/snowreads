For various joins of all-positive or all-negative signed\ncomplete graphs, we derive a closed-form expression for their chromatic\npolynomials. As a generalisation of the chromatic polynomials for a signed\ngraph, we introduce a new pair of bivariate chromatic polynomials. We establish\nrecursive dominating-vertex deletion formulae for these bivariate chromatic\npolynomials. Finally, we show that for certain families of signed threshold\ngraphs, isomorphism is equivalent to the equality of bivariate chromatic\npolynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
