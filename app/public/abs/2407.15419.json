The radius distribution of\nfalse vacuum bubbles causes FBs and PBHs to have extended mass distributions.\nWe show how gravitational wave (GW), microlensing and Hawking evaporation\nsignals deviate from the case of monochromatic distributions. The peak of the\nGW spectrum is shifted to lower frequencies and the spectrum is broadened at\nfrequencies below the peak frequency. Thus, the radius distribution of true\nvacuum bubbles introduces another uncertainty in the evaluation of the GW\nspectrum from a FOPT. The extragalactic gamma-ray signal at AMEGO-X/e-ASTROGAM\nfrom PBH evaporation may evince a break in the power-law spectrum between 5~MeV\nand 10~MeV for an extended PBH mass distribution. Optical microlensing surveys\nmay observe PBHs lighter than $10^{-10}M_\\odot$, which is not possible for\nmonochromatic mass distributions. This expands the FOPT parameter space that\ncan be explored with microlensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
