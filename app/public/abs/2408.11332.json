However, this process invariably introduces optical\npath differences in the electron beam across different sample positions,\nsignificantly compromising image quality, particularly over large fields of\nview. To address this challenge, we developed path difference ptychography\n(PDP), a method capable of decoupling path differences from the\nfour-dimensional data during reconstruction. This enables the acquisition of\nhigh-quality, large-scale images, facilitating a more comprehensive\nunderstanding and analysis of materials microstructure. Moreover, PDP has the\npotential to promote the widespread application of ptychographic tomography in\nthe analysis of planar samples.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
