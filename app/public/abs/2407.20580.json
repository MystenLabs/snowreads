However, existing\napproaches that are known to enjoy strong statistical guarantees often struggle\nto cope with the computational demands arising from the high dimensionality. To\naddress this issue, we propose a novel Laplace approximation method based on Le\nCam's one-step procedure (\\textsf{OLAP}), designed to effectively tackles the\ncomputational burden. Under some classical high-dimensional assumptions we show\nthat \\textsf{OLAP} is a statistically consistent variable selection procedure.\nFurthermore, we show that the approach produces a posterior distribution that\ncan be explored in polynomial time using a simple Gibbs sampling algorithm.\nToward that polynomial complexity result, we also made some general, noteworthy\ncontributions to the mixing time analysis of Markov chains. We illustrate the\nmethod using logistic and Poisson regression models applied to simulated and\nreal data examples.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
