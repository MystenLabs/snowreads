Implicit models, distinguished by their adaptability in\nlayer depth and incorporation of feedback within their computational graph, are\nput to the test across various extrapolation scenarios: out-of-distribution,\ngeographical, and temporal shifts. Our experiments consistently demonstrate\nsignificant performance advantage with implicit models. Unlike their\nnon-implicit counterparts, which often rely on meticulous architectural design\nfor each task, implicit models demonstrate the ability to learn complex model\nstructures without the need for task-specific design, highlighting their\nrobustness in handling unseen data.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Gsal1HZkQpqLTsSBKZyHUyQ3ZjX0n7UBN3gwi9RhaKw","pdfSize":"1520417","objectId":"0x8a1cfe8c2b9ec6c2afffcad8e89fd6736b5cf58488f3b5f6a544b010cb0fe840","registeredEpoch":"1","certifiedEpoch":"1","startEpoch":"1","endEpoch":"201"}
