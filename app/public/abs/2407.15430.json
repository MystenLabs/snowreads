The perturbation $K$ is\nrepresented by a matrix-valued function defined on $\\mathbb{S}^2$ with values\nin $\\mathbb{R}^{3 \\times 3}$. Under natural regularity conditions on $K$, we\nshow that the family of perturbed Dirichlet energies converges, in the sense of\n$\\Gamma$-convergence, to a simplified energy functional on $\\gamma$. The\nreduced energy unveils how part of the antisymmetric exchange interactions\ncontribute to an anisotropic term whose specific shape depends on the curvature\nof $\\gamma$.\n  We also discuss the significant implications of our results for studies of\nferromagnetic nanowires when Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is\npresent.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
