Although the\nconstruction is very simple, its analyses are notoriously complicated. Meeting\nthe demand for both simplicity and accuracy, this work establishes sharp\nsub-poissonian tail bounds for the distribution of sparse random projections.\nCompared to other works, this analysis provide superior numerical guarantees\n(exactly matching impossibility results) while being arguably less complicated\n(the technique resembles Bennet's Inequality and is of independent interest).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tchwwNTYUMtGX0kbCIUJeSWZZ2pSZF3eF-16CE2QshM","pdfSize":"628135"}
