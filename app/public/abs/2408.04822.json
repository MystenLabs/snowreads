Agents perform tasks away from the hub like foraging for food\nor gathering information about future nest sites. Modeling hub-based colonies\nis challenging because the size of the collective state space grows rapidly as\nthe number of agents grows. This paper presents a graph-based representation of\nthe colony that can be combined with graph-based encoders to create\nlow-dimensional representations of collective state that can scale to many\nagents for a best-of-N colony problem. We demonstrate how the information in\nthe low-dimensional embedding can be used with two experiments. First, we show\nhow the information in the tensor can be used to cluster collective states by\nthe probability of choosing the best site for a very small problem. Second, we\nshow how structured collective trajectories emerge when a graph encoder is used\nto learn the low-dimensional embedding, and these trajectories have information\nthat can be used to predict swarm performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VRfTE8Xk94mocXKZF3id0_Q_0KjQbpoSVjT94M_M-4Y","pdfSize":"1082166"}
