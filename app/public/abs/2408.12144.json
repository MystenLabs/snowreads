Using chiral perturbation theory, we find that\nthis leads to an upper bound on the dark-matter--nucleon scattering\ncross-section that is orders of magnitude stronger than existing astrophysical\nconstraints. Furthermore, we compute new bounds from rare Kaon decays and find\nthat these provide even stronger constraints. Our results have implications for\nfuture direct detection experiments aiming to search for MeV-scale dark matter.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
