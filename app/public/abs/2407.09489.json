As a popular open source toolkit, Whisper\nperforms fast in human voice recognition. However, the recognition performance\nis dependent on the computing resource, which makes the low computing memory\nrunning Whisper become difficult. Our paper presents an available solution to\nextract the human voice from the video and gain the high quality text\ngeneration from the voice. The generated voice can be used in video language\ntranslation and translated voice simulation. To improve the extraction and\ntransform quality of human voice, we present ecVoice, a method using the idioms\nsimilarity computation and analysis to improve the quality of audio text\nextraction. Relative experiments are held to verify that the ecVoice can\nimprove the idiom grammar correction rate to 90\\% on average. The method is\nsimple but fast which means this method will cause less bad influence of\nconsuming computing resources when improving the voice recognition rate. Our\nmethod and solution can significantly enhance the Whisper recognition with low\ncomputing memory.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
