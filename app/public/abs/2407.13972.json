To achieve secure and\nreliable transmission, we propose an artificial noise (AN)-aided robust\nmulti-beam array transceiver scheme. Leveraging beamforming, we aim to minimize\ntransmit power by jointly designing the information and AN beamforming, while\nsatisfying valid reception for legitimate users (LUs), per-antenna power\nconstraints for transmitter, as well as all interception power constraints for\neavesdroppers (Eves). In particular, the interception power formulation is\ntaken into account for protecting the information against hybrid Eves with\nimperfect AE channel state information (CSI) and no PE CSI. In light of the\nintractability of the problem, we reformulate the considered problem by\nreplacing non-convex constraints with tractable forms. Afterwards, a two-stage\nalgorithm is developed to obtain the optimal solution. Additionally, we design\nthe received beamforming weights by means of minimum variance distortionless\nresponse, such that the jamming caused by AEs can be effectively suppressed.\nSimulation results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed scheme in terms\nof energy efficiency and security.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
