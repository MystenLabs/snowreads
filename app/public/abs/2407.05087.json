Compared to normal noises, multiplicative noise has a\ngenerally stronger effect on the visual expression of images. Aiming at the\ndenoising problem of multiplicative noise, we linearize the nonlocal means\nalgorithm with deep learning and propose a linear attention mechanism based\ndeep nonlocal means filtering (LDNLM). Starting from the traditional nonlocal\nmeans filtering, we employ deep channel convolution neural networks to extract\nthe information of the neighborhood matrix and obtain representation vectors of\nevery pixel. Then we replace the similarity calculation and weighted averaging\nprocesses with the inner operations of the attention mechanism. To reduce the\ncomputational overhead, through the formula of similarity calculation and\nweighted averaging, we derive a nonlocal filter with linear complexity.\nExperiments on both simulated and real multiplicative noise demonstrate that\nthe LDNLM is more competitive compared with the state-of-the-art methods.\nAdditionally, we prove that the LDNLM possesses interpretability close to\ntraditional NLM.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
