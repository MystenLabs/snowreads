For a germ of an analytic function $f$\nwhose Bernstein-Sato's polynomial's roots are contained in $(-2,0)$, we: give a\nsimple algebraic formula for the zeroeth piece of the Hodge filtration; bound\nthe first step of the Hodge filtration containing $f^{-1}$. If we additionally\nrequire $f$ to be Euler homogeneous and parametrically prime, then we extend\nour algebraic formula to compute every piece of the canonical Hodge filtration,\nproving in turn that the Hodge filtration is contained in the induced order\nfiltration. Finally, we compute the Hodge filtration in many examples and\nidentify several large classes of divisors realizing our theorems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
