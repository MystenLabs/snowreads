However, most biological nervous\nsystem, especially the tactile system, have various powerful functions. This is\na big challenge for bionic system design. Here we report a universal fully\nflexible neuromorphic tactile perception system with strong compatibility and a\nmultithreshold signal processing strategy. Like nervous system, signal in our\nsystem is transmitted as pulses and processed as threshold information. For\nfeasibility verification, recognition of three different type pressure signals\n(continuous changing signal, Morse code signal and symbol pattern) is tested\nrespectively. Our system can output trend of these signals accurately and have\na high accuracy in the recognition of symbol pattern and Morse code. Comparing\nto conventional system, consumption of our system significantly decreases in a\nsame recognition task. Meanwhile, we give the detail introduction and\ndemonstration of our system universality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
