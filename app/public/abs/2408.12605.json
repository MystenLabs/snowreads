Through the experimental comparison on the authoritative LIDC-IDRI\ndataset, we found that compared with the traditional ResNet-50, Pro-HRnet-CNN\nshowed better performance in the feature extraction and recognition of\nsmall-size nodules, significantly improving the detection accuracy.\nParticularly within the domain of detecting smaller targets, the model has\nexhibited a remarkable enhancement in accuracy, thereby pioneering an\ninnovative avenue for the early identification and prognostication of pulmonary\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
