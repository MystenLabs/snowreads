This follows from the validity of\nSoergel's conjecture and the existence of injective morphisms between Rouquier\ncomplexes in the mixed perverse Hecke category. The monotonicity property is\ngeneralised to parabolic Kazhdan-Lusztig polynomials.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
