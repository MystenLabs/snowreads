More recently, new vacua associated to soft theorems and asymptotic\nsymmetries have been found. This paper takes some first steps towards a\ncomplete picture of the infrared geometry of $\\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory\nincorporating both of these infrared structures.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
