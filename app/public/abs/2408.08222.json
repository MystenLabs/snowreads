The SAM update consists of one\nstep for computing the perturbation and the other for computing the update\ngradient. Within the two steps, the choice of the perturbation radius is\ncrucial to the performance of SAM, but finding an appropriate perturbation\nradius is challenging. In this paper, we propose a bilevel optimization\nframework called LEarning the perTurbation radiuS (LETS) to learn the\nperturbation radius for sharpness-aware minimization algorithms. Specifically,\nin the proposed LETS method, the upper-level problem aims at seeking a good\nperturbation radius by minimizing the squared generalization gap between the\ntraining and validation losses, while the lower-level problem is the SAM\noptimization problem. Moreover, the LETS method can be combined with any\nvariant of SAM. Experimental results on various architectures and benchmark\ndatasets in computer vision and natural language processing demonstrate the\neffectiveness of the proposed LETS method in improving the performance of SAM.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
