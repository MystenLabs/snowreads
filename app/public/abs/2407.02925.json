However, none of the designs used or proposed so far achieve\nsimultaneously a high spatial resolution at the pupil of the tested optics and\nabsolute measurement accuracy comparable to those of modern\nlaser-interferometers. This paper presents an improved wavefront sensor concept\nthat reaches both previous goals. This device named Crossed-sine phase sensor\n(CSPS) is based on a fully transparent gradient phase filter (GPF) placed at an\nintermediate location between the virtual pupil and image planes of the tested\noptics. The theoretical principle of the sensor is described in Fourier optics\nformalism. Numerical simulations confirm that a measurement accuracy of\nLambda/100 RMS is achievable. The CSPS also offers the advantages of being\nquasi-achromatic and working on spatially or spectrally extended, natural or\nartificial light sources\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
