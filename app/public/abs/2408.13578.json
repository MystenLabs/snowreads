In terms of this\nissue, many authors proposed many methods based on rank reduction, sparse\ntransformation, domain transformation, and deep learning. However, when the\nseismic data is noisy, complex and uneven, these methods often lead to\nover-denoising or under-denoising. To solve this problems, we proposed a novel\nmethod called noise level estimation and similarity segmentation for graded\ndenoising. Specifically, we first assessed the average noise level of the\nentire seismic data and denoised it using block matching and three-dimensional\nfiltering (BM3D) methods. Then, the denoised data is contrasted with the\nresidual using local similarity, pinpointing regions where noise levels deviate\nsignificantly from the average. The remaining data is retained intact. These\nareas are then re-evaluated and denoised. Finally, we integrated the data\nretained after the first denoising with the re-denoising data to get a complete\nand cleaner data. This method is verified on theoretical model and actual\nseismic data. The experimental results show that this method has a good effect\non seismic data with uneven noise.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
