Growth of the homoepitaxial films was performed on\nFe-doped (010) $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ substrates at a growth rate of 1.9 $\\mu$m/hr\nusing TEGa as the Gallium precursor. To probe the background electron\nconcentration, an unintentionally doped film was grown with a Hall\nconcentration of 3.43 x 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ and Hall mobility of 196\ncm$^2$/V.s. Growth of intentionally Si-Doped films was accomplished by fixing\nall growth conditions and varying only the silane flow, with controllable Hall\nelectron concentrations ranging from 4.38 x 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ to 8.30 x\n10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ and exceptional Hall mobilities ranging from 194 - 200\ncm$^2$/V.s demonstrated. C-V measurements showed a flat charge profile with the\nN$_D^+$ - N$_A^-$ values correlating well with the Hall-measured electron\nconcentration in the films. SIMS measurements showed the silicon atomic\nconcentration matched the Hall electron concentration with Carbon and Hydrogen\nbelow detection limit in the films. The Hall, C-V, and SIMS data indicate the\ngrowth of high-quality 4.5 $\\mu$m thick $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ films and\ncontrollable doping into the mid 10$^{15}$ cm$^{-3}$ range. These results\ndemonstrate MOCVD growth of electronics grade record-high mobility, low carrier\ndensity, and thick $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ drift layers for next generation\nvertical $\\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ power devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"r9lphywA3uAKuTq2l-4bnvWZfJyDLWJyyfXW5GtMqEQ","pdfSize":"1094830"}
