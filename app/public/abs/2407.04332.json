The big-data era urgently\ndemands low-latency and low-energy optimization at the edge, which cannot be\nhandled by digital processors due to their non-parallel von Neumann\narchitecture. Recent efforts using massively parallel hardware (such as\nmemristor crossbars and quantum processors) employing annealing algorithms,\nwhile promising, have handled relatively easy and stable problems with sparse\nor binary representations (such as the max-cut or traveling salesman\nproblems).However, most real-world applications embody three features, which\nare encoded in the knapsack problem, and cannot be handled by annealing\nalgorithms - dense and non-binary representations, with destabilizing\nself-feedback. Here we demonstrate a post-digital-hardware-friendly randomized\ncompetitive Ising-inspired (RaCI) algorithm performing knapsack optimization,\nexperimentally implemented on a foundry-manufactured CMOS-integrated\nprobabilistic analog memristor crossbar. Our solution outperforms digital and\nquantum approaches by over 4 orders of magnitude in energy efficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Emerging Technologies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
