While\nGalactic supernova explosions may supply the required energy, there is growing\nevidence that they cannot explain all of the observed properties of cosmic\nrays, such as their maximum particle energy and isotopic composition. Among\nGalactic objects, winds from stellar clusters meet the energetic requirement\nand provide a suitable environment for particle acceleration. The recent\ndetection of some of these objects in gamma rays confirms that they indeed\nharbor high-energy particles.However, as most supernovae explode inside stellar\nclusters, it is difficult to distinguish the contribution of winds to particle\nacceleration. Here we report the detection of young star clusters in the nearby\nVela molecular ridge star forming region. The young age of the systems\nguarantees an unbiased estimate of the stellar CR luminosity free from any\nsupernova or pulsar contamination and allows us to draw conclusions on the\nacceleration efficiency and the total power supplied by these objects. We\ndemonstrate that much more than 1% of the wind mechanical power is converted\ninto CRs and consequently conclude that a small but non-negligible fraction ~\n1-10% of the CR population is contributed by stellar clusters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
