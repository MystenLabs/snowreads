We study\nexplicit Runge-Kutta methods with PEP order higher than their classical order.\nWe provide examples of such methods up to PEP order six, and test them on\nHamiltonian ODE and PDE systems. We find that these methods behave similarly to\nexactly energy-conservative methods over moderate time intervals and exhibit\nsignificantly smaller errors, relative to other Runge-Kutta methods of the same\norder, for moderately long-time simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
