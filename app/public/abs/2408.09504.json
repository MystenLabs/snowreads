It presents the application\nof vacuum suction in grabbing technology, a technique that has revolutionized\nthe handling and manipulation to grasp the various fabric materials in a range\nof garment industries. Vacuum suction, being non-intrusive and non-invasive,\noffers several advantages compared to traditional grabbing methods. It is\nparticularly useful in scenarios where soft woven fabric and air-impermeable\nfabric items need to be handled with utmost care. The paper delves into the\nworking principles of vacuum suction, its various components, and the\nunderlying physics involved. Furthermore, it explores the various applications\nof vacuum suction in the garment industry into the automation exploration. The\npaper also highlights the challenges and limitations of vacuum suction\ntechnology and suggests potential areas for further research and development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"WbsJKvqEh3QIkAp6cyewkzt8FBNPNAHF4ybscUrUef0","pdfSize":"875758"}
