This paper presents a blueprint to the mission designer for the\ndevelopment of a modular and efficient deep learning payload to address\nmultiple onboard inference tasks. In particular, we design a self-supervised\nlightweight backbone that provides features to efficient task-specific heads.\nThe latter can be developed independently and with reduced data labeling\nrequirements thanks to the frozen backbone. Experiments on three sample tasks\nof cloud segmentation, flood detection, and marine debris classification on a\n7W embedded system show competitive results with inference quality close to\nhigh-complexity state-of-the-art models and high throughput in excess of 8\nMpx/s.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"avd8Yb7J0rV79R0Jj5e7POTdb2gRKf_BOLlxvY7CHH4","pdfSize":"5525875"}
