We do so by proving a\ncriterion which must be satisfied by local systems which do come from abelian\nvarieties, inspired by an analogous Hodge theoretic criterion in characteristic\nzero. Our tools include $F$-isocrystals and some $p$-adic Hodge theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pEdKEzgMU3mhpKou0FDHLwBTmWWrRHHN_jmeqCUgQr8","pdfSize":"401975","txDigest":"5sopEVM6c9F5rrqHmpPTYiDKs4yLvXVDC92fiBKeGruA","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
