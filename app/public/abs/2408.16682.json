The Hamiltonian describing the system is derived from the standard\nJaynes-Cummings model by deforming the field operators based on the\nKerr-induced interaction. The total and reduced density matrices are obtained\nand the temporal evolution of nonclassical properties such as the Mandel Q\nparameter, quantum entanglement, and the position-momentum uncertainty relation\n(squeezing) of the field are examined. The impacts of coupling constant,\ngeneralized Kerr medium, and the intensity-dependent coupling function on the\nnonclassical indicators are thoroughly analyzed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
