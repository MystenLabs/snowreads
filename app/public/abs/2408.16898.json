We\npropose a refinement: the guarantee must be approximately satisfied at priors\nnear the ambiguity set (in the weak topology). We call such a guarantee robust.\nThe payoff guarantees from some maxmin-optimal mechanisms in the literature are\nnot robust. We show, however, that over certain standard ambiguity sets (such\nas continuous moment sets), every mechanism's payoff guarantee is robust. We\ngive a behavioral characterization of our refined robustness notion by imposing\na new continuity axiom on maxmin preferences.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"XQBZKNZgGmStf_tfoR56obgthn0y0pKBYl_qFLcD_sE","pdfSize":"615520"}
