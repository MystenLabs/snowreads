This letter\ndetails the relationship between the amplitude-only TM method and the\namplitude-only TCLF. The random fluctuations of different pixels on a digital\nmicromirror device (DMD) in the amplitude-only TCLF method can be regarded as\northogonal bases, sharing the same role as the Hadamard bases in the\namplitude-only TM method. This insight explains why the computational\ncomplexity of the TCLF method is significantly lower than that of the TM\nmethods and also indicates that the amplitude-only TM is essentially a special\ncase of the TCLF method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
