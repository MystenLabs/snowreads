We give the first\ngeneral treatment of the coloring of virtual graphs, where the graph $H$ to be\ncolored is locally embedded within the communication graph $G$. Besides\ngeneralizing classical distributed graph coloring (where $H=G$), this captures\nother previously studied settings, including cluster graphs and power graphs.\n  We find that the complexity of coloring a virtual graph depends on the edge\ncongestion of its embedding. The main question of interest is how fast we can\ncolor virtual graphs of constant congestion. We find that, surprisingly, these\ngraphs can be colored nearly as fast as ordinary graphs. Namely, we give a\n$O(\\log^4\\log n)$-round algorithm for the deg+1-coloring problem, where each\nnode is assigned more colors than its degree.\n  This can be viewed as a case where a distributed graph problem can be solved\neven when the operation of each node is decentralized.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kpayG6tKgg0RIYxhmV-ZWRvCq9G28wY0zqmOEYGNHPY","pdfSize":"1005642"}
