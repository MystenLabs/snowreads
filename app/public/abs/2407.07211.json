As a by-product we obtain that Robinson's ordinary weight conjecture\nholds for the principal $3$-block of Aut$(G_2(3))$, the principal $5$-blocks of\n$HN$, $BM$, Aut$(HN)$, $Ly$, the principal $7$-block of $M$, and the principal\n$p$-blocks of $G_2(p)$ for $p\\geq 3 $.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory","Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
