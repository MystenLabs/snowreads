Recently, it is proved that in 199 out of 230 space groups,\ntopological superconductivity coexists with an $s$-wave-like pairing symmetry,\nraising the hope of finding more candidates for this exotic phase. However, a\ncomprehensive and efficient method for diagnosing topological superconductivity\nin realistic materials remains elusive. Here, we derive Fermi-surface formulas\nfor gapped and gapless topological phases of time-reversal symmetric\nsuperconductors with $s$-wave-like pairing symmetries in all layer and space\ngroups, applicable to thin-film and bulk materials. Our diagnosis uses only the\nsign of the pairing and the Fermi velocity at several Fermi points, and yields\ncomplete (partial) diagnosis for gapped topological superconductivity in 159\n(40) out of the 199 space groups. This provides a fundamental basis for the\nfirst-principles prediction of new topological superconductors.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
