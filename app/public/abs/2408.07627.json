Then an extended clustering coefficient is introduced and is studied for\n$G \\times H$. Restriction to the standard clustering coefficient has a direct\nrelation to the local efficiency of the graph, and the results are also\ninterpreted in terms of the efficiency. As a last statistic of interest, the\nnumber of isolated vertices is analyzed for $G \\times H$. The paper is\nconcluded with a discussion of the modular product of random graphs, and the\nrelation to the maximum common subgraph problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
