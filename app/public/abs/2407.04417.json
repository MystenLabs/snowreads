Notably, GPs have the attractive\nproperty that the sound field is a linear function of the measurements,\nallowing the field to be estimated efficiently from distributed microphone\nmeasurements. However, to ensure analytical tractability, most existing kernels\nfor sound field estimation have been formulated in the frequency domain, formed\nindependently for each frequency. To address the analytical intractability of\nspatio-temporal kernels, we here propose to instead learn the kernel directly\nfrom data by the means of deep kernel learning. Furthermore, to improve the\ngeneralization of the deep kernel, we propose a method for regularizing the\nlearning process using the wave equation. The representational advantages of\nthe deep kernel and the improved generalization obtained by using the wave\nequation regularization are illustrated using numerical simulations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
