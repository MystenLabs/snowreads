This paper addresses the critical need for optimizing task\noffloading in secure UAV-assisted smart farm networks, aiming to reduce total\ndelay and energy consumption while maintaining robust security in data\ncommunications. We propose a multi-agent deep reinforcement learning\n(DRL)-based approach using a deep double Q-network (DDQN) with an action mask\n(AM), designed to manage task offloading dynamically and efficiently. The\nsimulation results demonstrate the superior performance of our method in\nmanaging task offloading, highlighting significant improvements in operational\nefficiency by reducing delay and energy consumption. This aligns with the goal\nof developing sustainable and energy-efficient solutions for next-generation\nnetwork infrastructures, making our approach an advanced solution for achieving\nboth performance and sustainability in smart farming applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"U2DK5sjYKevTF5ELpPTrs35kdrxRWFVDHio5W2rl9ng","pdfSize":"1115777","objectId":"0x3f5153a0ae14475c00154fe5a9d8140919f09b1f2f664213ff7aa23ca9831e32","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
