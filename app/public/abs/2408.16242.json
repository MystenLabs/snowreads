Harada's conjecture II states that the ratio of\nthe product of all the number of elements in conjugacy classes over that of all\ndegrees of irreducible complex characters of $G$ is an integer. The ratio is\ncalled Harada's number. In this article, we discuss the Harada's number from\nthe view point of Gramian determinants for suitable inner spaces and introduce\nan invariants generalizing the square of Harada's number associated to central\ncharacters of $G$. We also give a necessary and sufficient condition so that\nHarada's conjecture II holds. We calculate explicitly Harada's numbers in some\nexamples by using the method given in this article.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"O7d0bBklrmzQ-IgH0z597Ze2qtF3CAAe82j4k5ayT_0","pdfSize":"229834"}
