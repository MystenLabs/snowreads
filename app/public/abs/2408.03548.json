These ensembles are\ngenerated through the stout smeared clover fermion action and Symanzik gauge\nactions with the tadpole improvement. Using QED-subtracted $D_s$ meson mass and\nnon-perturbative renormalization, we predict the charm quark mass in the\ncontinuum with physical light and strange quark masses to be\n{$m_c(m_c)=1.289(17)$} GeV in $\\overline{\\textrm{MS}}$ scheme, with the\nsystematic uncertainties from lattice spacing determination, renormalization\nconstant, {and fit ansatz} included. Predictions of the open and close charm\nmesons using this charm quark mass agree with the experimental value at 0.3\\%\nlevel uncertainty. We obtained {$D_{(s)}$ decay constants and also by far the\nmost precise $D_{(s)}^*$ decay constants $f_{D^*}=0.2321(43)$ GeV and\n$f_{D^*_s}=0.2743(34)$ GeV}, with the charm quark improved vector current\nnormalization.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
