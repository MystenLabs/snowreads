We show that the $\\Gamma$-limit of suitable scaled versions of the\nmodel leads to an energy describing a continuum mechanical model depending on\npartial dislocations and stacking faults. Our result highlights the necessary\nmultiscale character of the energies setting the groundwork for more\ncomprehensive models that can better explain and predict the mechanical\nbehavior of materials with complex defect structures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
