Enhancing detection sensitivity in absorption\nspectroscopy hinges on bright sources that cover molecular resonances and fast\nsignal modulation techniques to implement lock-in detection schemes\nefficiently. Yb:YAG thin-disk lasers, combined with optical parametric\noscillators (OPO), present a compelling solution to fulfill these requirements.\nIn this work, we report on a bright OPO pumped by a Yb:YAG thin-disk Kerr-lens\nmode-locked oscillator delivering 2.8 W, 114 fs pulses at 2.06 {\\mu}m with an\naveraged energy of 90 nJ. The OPO cavity operates at 30.9 MHz pulse repetition\nrates, the second harmonic of the pump cavity, allowing for broadband,\nefficient, and dispersion-free modulation of the OPO output pulses at 15.45 MHz\nrate. With 13% optical-to-optical conversion efficiency and a high-frequency\nintra-cavity modulation, this scalable scheme holds promise to advance the\ndetection sensitivity and frontiers of field-resolved spectroscopic techniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
