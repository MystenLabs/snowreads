This paper explores text-based speech\nediting methods that modify audio via text transcripts without manual waveform\nediting. These approaches ensure edited audio is indistinguishable from the\noriginal by altering the mel-spectrogram. Recent advancements, such as\ncontext-aware prosody correction and advanced attention mechanisms, have\nimproved speech editing quality. This paper reviews state-of-the-art methods,\ncompares key metrics, and examines widely used datasets. The aim is to\nhighlight ongoing issues and inspire further research and innovation in speech\nediting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
