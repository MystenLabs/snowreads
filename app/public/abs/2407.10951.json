We first show that\nfor any given $m \\ge 1$, the second coefficient of the characteristic\npolynomial of $T_m(N, k, \\chi)$ is nonvanishing for all but finitely many\ntriples $(N,k,\\chi)$. Furthermore, for $\\chi$ trivial and any fixed $m$, we\ndetermine the sign of the second coefficient for all but finitely many pairs\n$(N,k)$. Finally, for $\\chi$ trivial and $m=3,4$, we compute the sign of the\nsecond coefficient for all pairs $(N,k)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
