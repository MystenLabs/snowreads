We present results on nucleon charges and second Mellin moments of\nparton distribution functions and generalized parton distributions,\nhighlighting results obtained at the continuum limit using only gauge ensembles\nsimulated with physical quark masses. The tensor charge and transversity\nmoments are determined with controlled systematics and used to extract nucleon\ntransverse density distributions. We also discuss progress towards the direct\nevaluation of generalized parton distributions in lattice QCD and the impact\nthey are having on phenomenology.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Uc_73tcduOMFHFROmZnVqa0eD3egSNBgBJB3g6RKuPM","pdfSize":"1398928"}
