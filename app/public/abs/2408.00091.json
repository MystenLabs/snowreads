The problem relates to characterizing the structure of the space of\nhypoelliptic sub-Laplacian type operators, and results going back to\nRothschild-Stein and Helffer-Nourrigat. In two degrees of nilpotency, there is\na rich index theory by work of van Erp-Baum on contact manifolds, that was\nlater extended to polycontact manifolds by Goffeng-Kuzmin. We provide a\nplethora of examples in higher degree of nilpotency where the index theory is\ntrivial.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
