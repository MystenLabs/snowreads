By varying the gravitational and the Yukawa\ncoupling constants, we investigate the spectral flow of the fermion eigenvalue\nassociated with a zero mode in the absence of gravity. We demonstrate that the\nbackreaction of the fermion can strongly influence the Skyrmion-fermion\nconfigurations. In particular, the energy conditions may be violated, and\nregular anti-gravitating asymptotically flat solutions with negative ADM mass\nmay emerge.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z5cMDYNghRTZhJlkZ2Hx1lRNzoZyTVJdkCC25uuNdNo","pdfSize":"799656","objectId":"0x408b3a5dae636090d34512bbbf551e70de9e03402d063d687a3e68c92a802c38","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
