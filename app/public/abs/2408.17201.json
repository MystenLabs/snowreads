Upon\nevaluation of quantizable morphisms at $\\hbar = \\tfrac{\\sqrt{-1}}{k}$, we\nobtain an enriched category $\\mathsf{DQ}_{\\operatorname{qu}, k}$. We show that,\nwhen $M$ is prequantizable, $\\mathsf{DQ}_{\\operatorname{qu}, k}$ is equivalent\nto the category $\\mathsf{GQ}$ of holomorphic vector bundles over $M$ with\nmorphisms being holomorphic differential operators, via a functor obtained from\nBargmann-Fock actions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
