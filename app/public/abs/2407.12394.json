We measure the angular correlation of\ngalaxies from the second data release of the GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky\nMurchison Widefield Array eXtended survey (GLEAM-X) survey, a low-frequency\nradio survey covering declinations below +30 degrees. We find an angular\ndistribution consistent with the LambdaCDM cosmological model assuming the best\nfitting cosmological parameters from Planck Collaboration et al. (2020). We fit\na bias function to the discrete tracers of the underlying matter distribution,\nfinding a bias that evolves with redshift in either a linear or exponential\nfashion to be a better fit to the data than a constant bias. We perform a\ncovariance analysis to obtain an estimation of the properties of the errors, by\nanalytic, jackknife and sample variance means. Our results are consistent with\nprevious studies on the topic, and also the predictions of the LambdaCDM\ncosmological model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
