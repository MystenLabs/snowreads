Traditional image restoration\nmethods require manual selection of specific tasks, algorithms, and execution\nsequences, which is time-consuming and may yield suboptimal results. All-in-one\nmodels, though capable of handling multiple tasks, typically support only a\nlimited range and often produce overly smooth, low-fidelity outcomes due to\ntheir broad data distribution fitting. To address these challenges, we first\ndefine a new pipeline for restoring images with multiple degradations, and then\nintroduce RestoreAgent, an intelligent image restoration system leveraging\nmultimodal large language models. RestoreAgent autonomously assesses the type\nand extent of degradation in input images and performs restoration through (1)\ndetermining the appropriate restoration tasks, (2) optimizing the task\nsequence, (3) selecting the most suitable models, and (4) executing the\nrestoration. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of\nRestoreAgent in handling complex degradation, surpassing human experts.\nFurthermore, the system modular design facilitates the fast integration of new\ntasks and models, enhancing its flexibility and scalability for various\napplications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
