The proposed system\nleverages channel state information (CSI) disruptions caused by movements to\ndetect falls in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios, offering non-intrusive\nmonitoring. Besides, a companion robot is utilized to provide assistance\ncapabilities to navigate and respond to incidents autonomously, improving\nefficiency in providing assistance in various environments. The experimental\nresults demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in detecting falls\nand responding effectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
