We show that its\ngraph equivariant cohomology is generated by three types of subgraphs in the\nGKM graph, which are subject to four different types of relations. Furthermore,\nwe consider the relationship between the two graph equivariant cohomology rings\ninduced by odd- and even-dimensional complex quadrics.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TcwOi8I9aBVOZbK2oY6KqPs0dt-2cUlk3DOwhXVafJU","pdfSize":"337997"}
