Multi-scenario Recommendation (MSR) is an important topic\nthat improves ranking performance by leveraging information from different\nscenarios. Recent methods for MSR mostly construct scenario shared or specific\nmodules to model commonalities and differences among scenarios. However, when\nthe amount of data among scenarios is skewed or data in some scenarios is\nextremely sparse, it is difficult to learn scenario-specific parameters well.\nBesides, simple sharing of information from other scenarios may result in a\nnegative transfer. In this paper, we propose a unified model named\nCross-Scenario Information Interaction (CSII) to serve all scenarios by a\nmixture of scenario-dominated experts. Specifically, we propose a novel method\nto select highly transferable features in data instances. Then, we propose an\nattention-based aggregator module, which can adaptively extract relative\nknowledge from cross-scenario. Experiments on the production dataset verify the\nsuperiority of our method. Online A/B test in Meituan Waimai APP also shows a\nsignificant performance gain, leading to an average improvement in GMV (Gross\nMerchandise Value) of 1.0% for overall scenarios.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
