The proposed approach involves\nconstructing a PGM from a training dataset, which is then shared as common\nknowledge between the transmitter and receiver. We evaluate the importance of\nvarious semantic features and present a PGM-based compression algorithm\ndesigned to eliminate predictable portions of semantic information.\nFurthermore, we introduce a technique to reconstruct the discarded semantic\ninformation at the receiver end, generating approximate results based on the\nPGM. Simulation results indicate a significant improvement in transmission\nefficiency over existing methods, while maintaining the quality of the\ntransmitted images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
