It is a natural question to ask\nif such a homeomorphism can be chosen so as to have some Sobolev regularity.\nThis prompts the simplified question: for a homeomorphic embedding of the unit\ncircle into the plane, when can we find a homeomorphism from the unit disk that\nhas the same boundary values and integrable first-order distributional\nderivatives?\n  We give the optimal geometric criterion for the interior Jordan domain so\nthat there exists a Sobolev homeomorphic extension for any homeomorphic\nparametrization of the Jordan curve. The problem is partially motivated by\ntrying to understand which boundary values can correspond to deformations of\nfinite energy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
