Let $p$ in\n$M$ be its hyperbolic fixed point with stable and unstable manifolds $W_S$ and\n$W_U$, respectively. Assume that $W_S$ is a curve. Suppose that $W_U$ and $W_S$\nhave a degenerate homoclinic crossing at a point $B\\ne p$, i.e., they cross at\n$B$ tangentially with a finite order of contact.\n  It is shown that, subject to $C^1$-linearizability and certain conditions on\nthe invariant manifolds, a transverse homoclinic crossing will arise\narbitrarily close to $B$. This proves the existence of a horseshoe structure\narbitrarily close to $B$, and extends a similar planar result of Homburg and\nWeiss.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
