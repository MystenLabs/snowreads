This motivated us to re-animate the\ndiscussion of possible Quark-Hadron Duality violations. There seems that there\nis currently no evidence of a failure of the Heavy Quark Expansion (HQE) used\nto compute observables for these decays. However, we might arrive at a point\nwhere an asymptotic behaviour of the HQE would limit a further increase of\nprecision. We discuss this possibility and suggest a simple model, which can be\nused to study the effects of higher orders in the $1/m_b$ expansion and\npossible quark-hadron duality violations. We devise observables sensitive only\nto such higher-order effects to test the behaviour of the HQE. Using these\nobservables we obtain a first estimate of possible quark-hadron duality\nviolations using the measured $q^2$ moments.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
