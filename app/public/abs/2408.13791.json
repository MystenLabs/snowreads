The estimates are taken in equivalent inner products, defined through\npowers of the Stokes Operator with a specific choice of Navier boundary\nconditions. We exploit fine properties of the noise in relation to the Stokes\nOperator to achieve cancellation of derivatives in the presence of the Leray\nProjector. As a result, we achieve an additional degree of regularity in the\ncorresponding Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equation to attain a true strong\nsolution of the original Stratonovich equation. Furthermore for any order of\nsmoothness, we can construct a strong solution of a hyperdissipative version of\nthe Stochastic Navier-Stokes Equation with the given regularity;\nhyperdissipation is only required to control the nonlinear term in the presence\nof a boundary. We supplement the result by obtaining smoothness without\nhyperdissipation on the torus, in 2D and 3D on the lifetime of solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ajRqhQYxIEQyLEPWrLdr5IaIK55VaFWNLfWtHMeJbKg","pdfSize":"452023"}
