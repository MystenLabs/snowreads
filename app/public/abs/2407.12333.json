To this end, we will focus on the subgroup $\\mathcal{K}[G]$ of the\nMather's group $\\mathcal{K}$, whose action to constraint map-germs preserves\nthe corresponding feasible set-germs (i.e.~the set consisting of points\nsatisfying the constraints). We will classify map-germs with small stratum\n$\\mathcal{K}[G]_e$-codimensions, and calculate the codimensions of the\n$\\mathcal{K}[G]$-orbits of jets represented by germs in the classification\nlists and those of the complements of these orbits. Applying these results and\na variant of the transversality theorem, we will show that families of\nconstraint mappings whose germ at any point in the corresponding feasible set\nis $\\mathcal{K}[G]$-equivalent to one of the normal forms in the classification\nlist compose a residual set in the entire space of constraint mappings with at\nmost $4$-parameters. These results enable us to quantify genericity of given\nconstraint mappings, and thus evaluate to what extent known test suites are\ngeneric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
