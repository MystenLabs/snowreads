In this paper, we provide a brief overview of what has been achieved\nin QAI so far and point to some open questions for future research. In\nparticular, we summarize some major key findings on the feasability and the\npotential of using quantum computing for solving computationally hard problems\nin various subfields of AI, and vice versa, the leveraging of AI methods for\nbuilding and operating quantum computing devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oNdsK1rEj3scmqRdgjikuJJUo1XwQJ0KzbQUy4gM2ZE","pdfSize":"906721"}
