A major one is how to\ntune the fragility of a glass-forming liquid. Here, we study a two-dimensional\n(2D) system composed of vortices in a superconducting film, which effectively\nbehaves as a 2D glass-forming liquid. We show that the kinetic fragility in\nthis system can be experimentally varied by tuning a single parameter: the\nexternal magnetic field $H$ applied transversely to the film. This conclusion\nis supported by the direct comparison between the analysis of experimental\nmeasurements in an amorphous MoGe superconducting film and Monte Carlo\nsimulations in a disordered XY model, that captures the universality class of\nthe two-step melting transition. We show that by increasing disorder strength a\nfragile-to-strong transition is induced, in close similarity with the\nexperimental findings in a magnetic field. Our numerical results shed light on\nthe evolution of the dynamical heterogeneity from a fragile to strong glass, as\ndue to the subtle interplay between caging effects arising from hexatic order\nand strong random pinning.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
