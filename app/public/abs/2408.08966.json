We analytically solve the energy gap equation in various\nlimit cases. The solution provides simple tools for further studies, compared\nto more complex numerics, and highlights the basic characteristics of the\ntheory. First, in the critical limit of pair-breaking scattering, we derive\n(inspired by the famous BCS ratio) $\\Delta_0/T_c = \\sqrt{2/3}\\pi$. Next, we\nderive the dependence $ \\Delta(T)$ close to critical temperature and look at\nits behavior for general (and also critical) pair-breaking scattering rate\n$\\Gamma$. Furthermore, we compare our result - analytical dependence of\n$\\Delta(T)$ - with the numerical solution of the gap equation assuming general\ntemperature. We show the range of temperatures, for which the analytical\napproximation is valid. In the end, we introduce the heuristic formula of\n$\\Delta(0\\leq T\\leq T_c)$, assuming general pair-breaking scattering,\nemphasizing its exact behavior close to $T_c$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
