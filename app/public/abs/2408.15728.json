It was left as an open\nproblem to generalize the method to the case when the multiplication is also\npartial in the sense that only a subset of the entries need to be computed. We\nprove a variant of a more general case: reducing large weighted matrix\nmultiplications to tensor powers of a partial matrix multiplication in the\nsense that every entry of the result is a partial version of the inner product\nof the corresponding row and column of the factors that would appear in the\nusual matrix product. The implication is that support rank upper bounds on\npartial matrix multiplication tensors in this general sense give upper bounds\non the support rank exponent of matrix multiplication.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
