We use fusion and modular kernels of the super-Liouville theory to\ncompute the necklace-channel conformal block and showcase formalism by proving\nthat the inner product holds for superconformal blocks, defined as states in\nthe Hilbert space. Finally, we compute the out-of-time-order correlator for the\ntorus topology with superconformal primary insertions as matter using the tools\nof super-Virasoro TQFT and investigate its early-time behaviour.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
