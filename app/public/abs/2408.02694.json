Our model\noffers enhanced flexibility in approximating exposures as nonlinear functions\nof asset characteristics, while simultaneously providing users with an\nintuitive framework for interpreting latent factors. Empirical backtesting\ndemonstrates our model's superior ability to explain cross-sectional risk\nexposures. Moreover, long-short portfolios constructed using our model's\npredictions achieve higher Sharpe ratios, highlighting its practical value in\ninvestment management.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YiwxUj3qW7i0vfGfUOx3CYTRuMJ6o0V76A49Dauao90","pdfSize":"723598","txDigest":"4mbqu4FL1VmCra6Uyp74nVuKSzKzUBoGgMhoyY6eHjfX","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
