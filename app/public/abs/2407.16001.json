Here we investigate single-particle\ndiffraction with a pilot-wave model originally developed to describe the\nhydrodynamic system. We study single-particle interactions with a barrier and\nslits of increasing width by focusing on the near field. We find\nsingle-particle diffraction arising as wavelike patterns in the particles'\nposition statistics, which we compare to the predictions of quantum mechanics.\nWe provide a mechanism that rationalizes the diffractive behavior in our\nsystem.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mImrwaWltmZUlUogd6a74Ow5afHQo6-mReFdaBPNgv4","pdfSize":"11032323"}
