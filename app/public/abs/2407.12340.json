Although quantum informatics is\nequally relevant to computer science education, little research has been done\non how to teach it with a focus on computer science concepts and knowledge. In\nthis study, we position quantum informatics within Denning's Great Principles\nof Computing and propose Quantum Informatics Standards for secondary schools.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
