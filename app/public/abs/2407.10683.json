However, these models often generate factually inconsistent\nimages, failing to accurately reflect the factual information and common sense\nconveyed by the input text prompts. We refer to this issue as Image\nhallucination. Drawing from studies on hallucinations in language models, we\nclassify this problem into three types and propose a methodology that uses\nfactual images retrieved from external sources to generate realistic images.\nDepending on the nature of the hallucination, we employ off-the-shelf image\nediting tools, either InstructPix2Pix or IP-Adapter, to leverage factual\ninformation from the retrieved image. This approach enables the generation of\nimages that accurately reflect the facts and common sense.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
