We prove some results on the\nstructure of normalized families, presenting a new way of reducing such a\nfamily to a smaller one using dual families. Applying our reduction method, we\nprove a refinement of a conjecture originally proposed by Poonen. Finally, we\nshow that Frankl Conjecture holds for the class of families obtained from\nsuccessively applying the reduction process to a power set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
