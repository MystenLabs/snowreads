Quantum machine learning\n(QML) exemplifies one of the important quantum computing applications that are\nexpected to surpass classical machine learning in a wide range of instances.\nThis paper addresses the performance of QML in the context of high-energy\nphysics (HEP). As an example, we focus on the top-quark tagging, for which\nclassical convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been effective but fall\nshort in accuracy when dealing with highly energetic jet images. In this paper,\nwe use a quantum convolutional neural network (QCNN) for this task and compare\nits performance with CNN using a classical noiseless simulator. We compare\nvarious setups for the QCNN, varying the convolutional circuit, type of\nencoding, loss function, and batch sizes. For every quantum setup, we design a\nsimilar setup to the corresponding classical model for a fair comparison. Our\nresults indicate that QCNN with proper setups tend to perform better than their\nCNN counterparts, particularly when the convolution block has a lower number of\nparameters. This suggests that quantum models, especially with appropriate\nencodings, can hold potential promise for enhancing performance in HEP tasks\nsuch as top quark jet tagging.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u5-VZsnHO0bP46BoOZXIvymd14sFJRxXghAxXdSIy3I","pdfSize":"1897607"}
