Both second-virial density-functional theory and\nfurther Monte Carlo numerical simulations find that the positional one-particle\ndensity function is undulate in the direction transverse to the axes of the\nfilaments while further Monte Carlo numerical simulations find that the\nmobility of the hard minor circular arcs across the filaments occurs via a\nmechanism reminiscent of the mechanism of diffusion in a smectic phase: the\nfilamentary phase is not a {``modulated'' [``splay(-bend)'']} nematic phase.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
