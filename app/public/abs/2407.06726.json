The control appears in the state\nequation as the argument of a regularization of the Heaviside function, while\nthe nonsmoothness is locally Lipschitz-continuous and directionally\ndifferentiable. Because of the lack of G\\^ateaux-differentiability, the\napplication of standard adjoint calculus is excluded. We derive conditions\nunder which a strong stationary optimality system can be established, i.e., a\nsystem that is equivalent to the purely primal optimality condition saying that\nthe directional derivative of the reduced objective in feasible directions is\nnonnegative. For this, two assumptions are made on the unknown optimizer. These\nare fulfilled if the non-smoothness is locally convex around its\nnon-differentiable points and if an estimate involving only the given data is\ntrue. The presented findings open the door to future research regarding limit\noptimality systems for non-smooth shape optimization problems [7].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"B6629d0ARfx_i-GaotaO3Zp_ZeqRnXeLySdgzS6pVhY","pdfSize":"609444"}
