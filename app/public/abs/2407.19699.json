Such edge modes are\nthe eigenmodes of the PDE operator for a joint optical structure formed by\nconnecting together two photonic crystals with distinct topological invariants,\nand the corresponding eigenfrequencies are located in the shared band gap of\ntwo individual photonic crystals. This work is concerned with maximizing the\nshared band gap of two photonic crystals with different topological features in\norder to increase the bandwidth of the edge modes. We develop a semi-definite\noptimization framework for the underlying optimal design problem, which enables\nefficient update of dielectric functions at each time step while respecting\nsymmetry constraints and, when necessary, the constraints on topological\ninvariants. At each iteration, we perform sensitivity analysis of the band gap\nfunction and the topological invariant constraint function to linearize the\noptimization problem and solve a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) problem\nefficiently. Numerical examples show that the proposed algorithm is superior in\ngenerating optimized optical structures with robust edge modes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
