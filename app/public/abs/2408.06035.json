As a first step, we present a repair\napproach for the temporal logic HyperLTL based on symbolic execution,\nconstraint generation, and syntax-guided synthesis of repair expression\n(SyGuS). To improve the repair quality, we introduce the notation of a\ntransparent repair that aims to find a patch that is as close as possible to\nthe original program. As a practical realization, we develop an iterative\nrepair approach. Here, we search for a sequence of repairs that are closer and\ncloser to the original program's behavior. We implement our method in a\nprototype and report on encouraging experimental results using off-the-shelf\nSyGuS solvers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Programming Languages"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jilT_M2Y3TAWLwy8i-kOueS8S51-1qkz1hyLLorxT28","pdfSize":"1110846"}
