These outbursts arrive as pairs, quasi-periodically every $\\sim 12$\nyears, based on the unique 130-year-long, well-sampled optical light curve\navailable for this blazar. For its three well-known, large quasi-periodic\noptical outbursts (QPOOs), observed in 1983, 2007 and 2015, optical\nphoto-polarimetric monitoring has been reported in the literature. For these\ninitially radio-undetected QPOOs, widely acclaimed as `bremsstrahlung flares',\nwe have scrutinised the available measurements of optical polarisation and\nspectral index during the rising phase. Several inconsistencies of these data\nwith the optical bremsstrahlung interpretation are noted, which point towards a\nsynchrotron-dominated alternative interpretation for all these prominent QPOOs,\njust as for the optical emission observed between the outbursts. Possible\nreasons for the radio non-detection of the QPOOs during the initial stage are\noutlined.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
