We give a uniform\npresentation through free-field realizations, which turns out to be a\nparticularly suitable framework for this task. The elementary building blocks\nof the construction are dictated by the low energy degrees of freedom on the\nHiggs branch, which are well understood for rank-one theories. We further\nanalyze the interplay between Higgs and Coulomb data on the moduli space of\nvacua, which tightly constrain the overall structure of the free field\nrealizations. Our results suggest a plausible bottom-up classification scheme\nfor low-rank SCFTs incorporating vertex algebra techniques.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
