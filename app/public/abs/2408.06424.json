This study\npresents electrical transport and magnetization measurements conducted on\nhigh-quality single crystals of PdTe. Anisotropy in the upper critical magnetic\nfield is observed in resistivity versus temperature data measured under various\napplied magnetic fields for in-plane (B II ab ) and out-of-plane (B II c)\norientations. The magnetic field versus temperature (H - T) phase diagram\nextracted from resistivity data exhibits an upward curvature akin to several\nmultigap superconductors. Additionally, magnetization measurements reveal de\nHaas-Van Alphen (dHvA) oscillations in both B II ab and B II c orientations.\nFourier analysis of the quantum oscillations identifies two Fermi pockets.\nMoreover, the Landau fan diagram for a small Fermi pocket confirms a\nnon-trivial Berry phase {\\pi}, indicative of the Dirac nature of PdTe. Based on\nquantum oscillation data, a plausible band diagram is constructed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
