In this sense, the MathPartner service provides\nartificial intelligence that allows us to formulate questions and receive\nanswers to questions formulated in a mathematical language. For mathematicians\nand physicists today, such a language is \\LaTeX. The MathPartner service uses a\ndialect of \\LaTeX, which is called Mathpar. The service is a cloud-based\ncomputer algebra system and provides users with the opportunity to solve many\nmathematical problems. In this publication, we focus only on a small class of\nextremum problems, which are widely applied in economics, management,\nlogistics, and in many engineering fields. In particular, we consider the\nshortest path problem and discuss an algorithm that is based on the tropical\nmathematics. The ability to work with many types of classical and tropical\nalgebras, which are freely available to users, is an important distinguishing\nfeature of this intelligent tool for symbolic-numerical calculations. We also\nconsider the use of the simplex algorithm for solving optimization problems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Symbolic Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GXM5z4IT5A2TK3PIs2nlCG7s809DyJGJTN9C42s8fHs","pdfSize":"158097"}
