We present an algorithm that can modify\nany classifier to produce a prediction set containing the true label with a\nuser-specified probability, such as 90%. We train a network to predict an\ninstance-based version of the Conformal Prediction threshold. The threshold is\nthen conformalized to ensure the required coverage. We applied the proposed\nalgorithm to several standard medical imaging classification datasets. The\nexperimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms current approaches\nin terms of smaller average size of the prediction set while maintaining the\ndesired coverage.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
