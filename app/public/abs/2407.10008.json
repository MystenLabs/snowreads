On the gravity side, we consider\na planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole. Our junction is connected by the\nboundary $Q$ with tension $\\Sigma$ of the boundary CFT. Our computations on the\ngravity side reproduce the standard relation between the current across the\njunction and the phase difference of the condensate controlled by the tension\n$\\Sigma$. We also study the maximum current's dependence on the junction's\ntension and size and reproduce familiar results.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
