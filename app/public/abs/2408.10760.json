Existing\nweakly-supervised COD approaches exhibit significantly inferior performance\ncompared to fully-supervised methods and struggle to simultaneously support all\nthe existing types of camouflaged object labels, including scribbles, bounding\nboxes, and points. Even for Segment Anything Model (SAM), it is still\nproblematic to handle the weakly-supervised COD and it typically encounters\nchallenges of prompt compatibility of the scribble labels, extreme response,\nsemantically erroneous response, and unstable feature representations,\nproducing unsatisfactory results in camouflaged scenes. To mitigate these\nissues, we propose a unified COD framework in this paper, termed SAM-COD, which\nis capable of supporting arbitrary weakly-supervised labels. Our SAM-COD\nemploys a prompt adapter to handle scribbles as prompts based on SAM.\nMeanwhile, we introduce response filter and semantic matcher modules to improve\nthe quality of the masks obtained by SAM under COD prompts. To alleviate the\nnegative impacts of inaccurate mask predictions, a new strategy of\nprompt-adaptive knowledge distillation is utilized to ensure a reliable feature\nrepresentation. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we have\nconducted extensive empirical experiments on three mainstream COD benchmarks.\nThe results demonstrate the superiority of our method against state-of-the-art\nweakly-supervised and even fully-supervised methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
