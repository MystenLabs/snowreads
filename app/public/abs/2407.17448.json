We consider the\nexponential form factor for the nucleon-quark-diquark vertex and the\naxial-vector diquark with light-cone transverse polarization. We analyze the\ndependence of GPDs on the longitudinal momentum fraction $x$ at different\n$\\xi$, and on the square of the transverse momentum transfer $\\Delta^2_T$ at\ndifferent $x$. Our numerical results reveal distinct discontinuities in all\ntwist-3 GPDs except $G_1$ and $\\tilde{G}_1$. By taking the forward limit, we\nobtain the twist-3 parton distribution function $g_T$, which encodes the\ntransverse spin distribution of quarks. We also compare the kinetic orbital\nangular momentum and the spin-orbit correlations of quarks defined by the\ntwist-2 and twist-3 GPDs, respectively.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
