A generalized Gleason theorem that gives the mathematical form of the\ncorresponding hybrid states is shown. This form simplifies when the classical\nsubsystem probabilities are described by a probability density function with\nrespect to a natural reference measure. We formulate a requirement for the\ntransformations of hybrid probability measures analogous to the complete\npositive assumption for quantum operations. For hybrid systems with reference\nmeasure, we prove a generalized Kraus theorem that fully determines the\nconsidered transformations provided they are continuous with respect to an\nappropriate metric. Explicit expressions for these transformations are derived\nwhen the classical and quantum subsystems are non-interacting, the classical\nsubsystem is discrete, or the Hilbert space of the quantum subsystem is\nfinite-dimensional. We also discuss the quantification of the correlations\nbetween the classical and quantum subsystems and a generalization of the\nquantum operations usually considered in the study of quantum entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
