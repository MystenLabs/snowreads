We show that applying the texture\nfilter after evaluating shading generally gives more accurate imagery than\nfiltering textures before BSDF evaluation, as is current practice. These\nbenefits are not merely theoretical, but are apparent in common cases. We\ndemonstrate that practical and efficient filtering after shading is possible\nthrough the use of stochastic sampling of texture filters.\n  Stochastic texture filtering offers additional benefits, including efficient\nimplementation of high-quality texture filters and efficient filtering of\ntextures stored in compressed and sparse data structures, including neural\nrepresentations. We demonstrate applications in both real-time and offline\nrendering and show that the additional error from stochastic filtering is\nminimal. We find that this error is handled well by either spatiotemporal\ndenoising or moderate pixel sampling rates.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Graphics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
