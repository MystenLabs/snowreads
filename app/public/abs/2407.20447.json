This work at the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab focuses on\ndeveloping the proof-of-concept agent, PrecAIse, a domain-adaptable\nconversational agent equipped with a suite of causal and prescriptive tools to\nhelp enterprise users make better business decisions. The objective is to make\nadvanced, novel causal inference and prescriptive tools widely accessible\nthrough natural language interactions. The presented Natural Language User\nInterface (NLUI) enables users with limited expertise in machine learning and\ndata science to harness prescriptive analytics in their decision-making\nprocesses without requiring intensive computing resources. We present an agent\ncapable of function calling, maintaining faithful, interactive, and dynamic\nconversations, and supporting new domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
