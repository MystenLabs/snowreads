It utilizes a pre-trained DDPM as a prior and generates\ninpainting results by conditioning on the reverse diffusion process, namely\ndenoising process. However, this process is significantly time-consuming. In\nthis paper, we propose an efficient DDPM-based image inpainting method which\nincludes three speed-up strategies. First, we utilize a pre-trained\nLight-Weight Diffusion Model (LWDM) to reduce the number of parameters. Second,\nwe introduce a skip-step sampling scheme of Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models\n(DDIM) for the denoising process. Finally, we propose Coarse-to-Fine Sampling\n(CFS), which speeds up inference by reducing image resolution in the coarse\nstage and decreasing denoising timesteps in the refinement stage. We conduct\nextensive experiments on both faces and general-purpose image inpainting tasks,\nand our method achieves competitive performance with approximately 60 times\nspeedup.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
