While this trend brings\nconvenience to our daily life, it also introduces cyber risks. To mitigate such\nrisks, the demand for smart home cyber insurance has been growing rapidly.\nHowever, there are no studies on analyzing the competency of smart home cyber\ninsurance policies offered by cyber insurance vendors (i.e., insurers), where\n`competency' means the insurer is profitable and smart home owners are not\noverly charged with premiums and/or deductibles. In this paper, we propose a\nnovel framework for pricing smart home cyber insurance, which can be adopted by\ninsurers in practice. Our case studies show, among other things, that insurers\nare over charging smart home owners in terms of premiums and deductibles.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
