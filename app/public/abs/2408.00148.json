The\nIPP model integrates mechanisms of persuasion and repulsion, where individuals\ninfluence each other through interactions that can either align opinions\nincrementally or lead to greater divergence. The probability of each\ninteraction type is governed by a parameter $\\alpha$, representing the\npopulation's receptiveness to persuasion. We investigate how these interaction\ndynamics shape the long-term distribution of opinions, examining conditions\nthat promote consensus or polarization. By deriving a system of nonlinear and\nautonomous ordinary differential equations (ODEs), we provide a rigorous\nmathematical framework for analyzing the distributional behavior of opinions in\nlarge populations. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of social\ninfluence dynamics and their implications in complex social systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
