However, most existing clinical diagnostic\ntasks are single-step processes, which does not align with the complex\nmulti-step diagnostic procedures found in real-world clinical settings. In this\npaper, we propose a multi-step diagnostic task and annotate a clinical\ndiagnostic dataset (MSDiagnosis). This dataset includes primary diagnosis,\ndifferential diagnosis, and final diagnosis questions. Additionally, we propose\na novel and effective framework. This framework combines forward inference,\nbackward inference, reflection, and refinement, enabling the LLM to\nself-evaluate and adjust its diagnostic results. To assess the effectiveness of\nour proposed method, we design and conduct extensive experiments. The\nexperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. We\nalso provide a comprehensive experimental analysis and suggest future research\ndirections for this task.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
