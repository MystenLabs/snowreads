The method assumes spherical symmetry and a moderately small\nconvergence, $\\kappa \\lesssim 1$. The assumption of spherical symmetry is an\nimportant restriction, which is, however, quite common in practice, for example\nin methods that fit lensing data to an NFW profile. Unlike other methods, our\nmethod relies on spherical symmetry only at radii larger than the radius $r$ at\nwhich the mass $M$ is inferred. That is, the method works even if there is a\nnon-symmetric inner region. We provide an efficient implementation in Julia\ncode that runs in a few milliseconds per galaxy cluster. We explicitly\ndemonstrate the method by using data from KiDS DR4 to infer mass profiles for\ntwo example clusters, Abell 1835 and Abell 2744, finding results consistent\nwith existing literature.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kp8DEqG3zhaDlGc90eS0LTPATihfv1JodtwuMyCrbAI","pdfSize":"553838"}
