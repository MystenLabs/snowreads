Most of these are constructed using real-world\ndata. It has been shown that RE models trained on real-world data suffer from\nfactual biases. To evaluate and address this issue, we present CovEReD, a\ncounterfactual data generation approach for document-level relation extraction\ndatasets using entity replacement. We first demonstrate that models trained on\nfactual data exhibit inconsistent behavior: while they accurately extract\ntriples from factual data, they fail to extract the same triples after\ncounterfactual modification. This inconsistency suggests that models trained on\nfactual data rely on spurious signals such as specific entities and external\nknowledge $\\unicode{x2013}$ rather than on the input context $\\unicode{x2013}$\nto extract triples. We show that by generating document-level counterfactual\ndata with CovEReD and training models on them, consistency is maintained with\nminimal impact on RE performance. We release our CovEReD pipeline as well as\nRe-DocRED-CF, a dataset of counterfactual RE documents, to assist in evaluating\nand addressing inconsistency in document-level RE.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
