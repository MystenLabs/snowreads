In time-reversal\nsymmetric systems, the Majorana multipole response relates to Cooper pair\nsymmetry in the underlying superconducting material, which provides a way to\nidentify pairing symmetries through surface-spin-sensitive measurements. Here,\nwe extend the concept of Majorana multipole response to systems with magnetic\npoint group symmetry that break time-reversal symmetry and clarify how the\nresponse of MFs includes information about underlying superconductors. From a\ntopological classification of symmetry-protected MFs and an effective surface\ntheory, we classify possible magnetic and electric responses for MFs, which\nmanifests a direct connection to Cooper pair symmetry for a symmetry-enforced\npair of MFs. Additionally, we find several time-reversal-even higher-order\nmultipole responses, such as the quadrupole response, which are forbidden in\ntime-reversal symmetric systems, whereby indicating breaking of time-reversal\nsymmetry. The theory is applied to the odd-parity chiral superconductor UTe$_2$\nand the ferromagnetic superconductor UCoGe, demonstrating the appearance of a\nmagnetic quadrupole response on a surface.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
