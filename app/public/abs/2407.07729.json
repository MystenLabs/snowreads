Arbitrary control of the KNO confined\nwithin the steady state subspace allows extraction of the Berry curvature\nthrough the linear response of the physical observable to the quench velocity\nof the system, providing an effective method for the characterization of\ntopology in the KNO. As an alternative, the control adopting the \"shortcut to\nadiabaticity\" to the KNO enables the exploration of the topology through\naccelerated adiabatic eigenstate evolution to measure all three physical\nobservables. Topological transitions are revealed by the jump of the first\nChern number, obtained respectively from the integral of the Berry curvature\nand of the new polar angle relation, over the whole parameter space. Our\nstrategy paves the way for measuring topological transitions in continuous\nvariable systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
