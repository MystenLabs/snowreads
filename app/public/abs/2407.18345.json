This functor is a subfunctor of the\nfunctor of order-preserving functionals and contains the idempotent measure\nfunctor as subfunctor. The main aim of this paper is to show that this functor\nis isomorphic to the capacity functor. We establish such isomorphism using the\nfuzzy max-plus integral. In fact, we can consider this result as an idempotent\nanalogue of Riesz Theorem about a correspondence between the set of\n$\\sigma$-additive regular Borel measures and the set of linear positively\ndefined functionals.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"m-PP9rnGfPspL5T6GLLPN6-E9xICUyz1_Ck0vuyw2HY","pdfSize":"163869","objectId":"0x1d2ed7b2cbfdc37c81a6632e1dcb0ef1f2d2f058b5d52c46a13c2d30ed4f52c3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
