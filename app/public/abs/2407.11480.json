Not\nlimited to text and images, generative models can generate industrial time\nseries data, addressing challenges such as the difficulty of data collection\nand data annotation. Due to their outstanding generation ability, they have\nbeen widely used in Internet of Things, metaverse, and cyber-physical-social\nsystems to enhance the efficiency of industrial production. In this paper, we\npresent a comprehensive overview of generative models for industrial time\nseries from deep generative models (DGMs) to large generative models (LGMs).\nFirst, a DGM-based AIGC framework is proposed for industrial time series\ngeneration. Within this framework, we survey advanced industrial DGMs and\npresent a multi-perspective categorization. Furthermore, we systematically\nanalyze the critical technologies required to construct industrial LGMs from\nfour aspects: large-scale industrial dataset, LGMs architecture for complex\nindustrial characteristics, self-supervised training for industrial time\nseries, and fine-tuning of industrial downstream tasks. Finally, we conclude\nthe challenges and future directions to enable the development of generative\nmodels in industry.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
