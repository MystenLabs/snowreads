In this paper, various theoretical aspects of this phenomenon in\nbulk ferromagnets are studied by using group theory, perturbation expansion,\nand calculations for model and real systems. The group-theoretical analysis of\nthe spin-current tensor shows that the absence of space-inversion symmetry is\nnot a sufficient condition for appearance of the intrinsic spin currents. The\nperturbation expansion proves that in the regime of exchange splitting\ndominating over spin-orbit interaction, the spin polarization of the intrinsic\ncurrents is nearly perpendicular to the direction of magnetization.\nFirst-principles calculations are carried out for NiMnSb and CoMnFeSi\nferromagnetic compounds, both featured by a tetrahedral crystallographic point\ngroup. The dependence of the spin-current tensor on the direction of\nmagnetization is approximated by a simple quadratic formula containing two\nconstants; the relative error of this approximation is found as small as a few\npercent for both compounds.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
