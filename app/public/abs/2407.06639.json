Estimation of battery state-of-health (SOH) is a crucial\nbut yet still challenging task. Pure model-based methods may suffer from\ninaccuracy and instability of parameter estimations in lifelong aging. While\npure data-driven methods rely heavily on quality and quantity of training set,\ncausing lack of generality when extrapolating into unseen cases. In this paper,\nwe propose an aging-aware equivalent circuit model (ECM), which combines\nmodel-based and data-driven techniques for SOH estimation. Gaussian process\n(GP) regression is incorporated in ECM to modelling parameters dependency on\noperating condition and aging time. The state space formulation of GP is used\nto enable a computationally efficient co-estimation framework of both\nparameters and states. Samples from two Open datasets are used to validate\nmodel performance, which gives accurate estimation for capacity and impedance.\nThe learnt impedance function can be lined to the shape change of open circuit\nvoltage (OCV) versus SOC curve and thus providing a way to further estimate\nchanges of differential voltage (dV/dQ) curves.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
