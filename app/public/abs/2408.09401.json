Despite this equivalence, the\ndistributions of occurrences of the patterns 123 and 132 are distinct. When\nconsidering 123 and 132 as mesh patterns and selectively shading boxes, similar\nscenarios arise, even when avoidance is defined by the Bell numbers or other\nsequences, rather than the Catalan numbers.\n  However, computer experiments suggest that mesh patterns 123 and 132 may\nindeed be equidistributed. Furthermore, by considering symmetric shadings\nrelative to the anti-diagonal, a maximum of 93 such equidistributed pairs can\npotentially exist. This paper establishes 75 such equidistributions, leaving\nthe justification of the remaining cases as open problems. As a by-product, we\nalso prove 36 relevant non-symmetric equidistributions. All our proofs are\nbijective and involve swapping occurrences of the patterns in question, thereby\ndemonstrating their joint equidistribution. Our findings are a continuation of\nthe systematic study of distributions of short-length mesh patterns initiated\nby Kitaev and Zhang in 2019.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"USZX9Av7PzEUDIq84RNp0OQ-g_cm6FXqB1Z7ko81_CQ","pdfSize":"433693"}
