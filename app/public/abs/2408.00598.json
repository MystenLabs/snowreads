We particularly focus on an\nefficient implementation of the HOT algorithm for the case where the supports\nare in $\\mathbb{R}^2$ with ground distances calculated by $L_2^2$-norm.\nSpecifically, we design a Halpern accelerating algorithm to solve the\nequivalent reduced model of the discrete OT problem. Moreover, we derive a\nnovel procedure to solve the involved linear systems in the HOT algorithm in\nlinear time complexity. Consequently, we can obtain an\n$\\varepsilon$-approximate solution to the optimal transport problem with $M$\nsupports in $O(M^{1.5}/\\varepsilon)$ flops, which significantly improves the\nbest-known computational complexity. We further propose an efficient procedure\nto recover an optimal transport plan for the original OT problem based on a\nsolution to the reduced model, thereby overcoming the limitations of the\nreduced OT model in applications that require the transport map. We implement\nthe HOT algorithm in PyTorch and extensive numerical results show the superior\nperformance of the HOT algorithm compared to existing state-of-the-art\nalgorithms for solving the OT problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
