MO provides a structured\napproach to tackling complex optimization problems. By leveraging the geometric\nproperties of the manifold, more efficient and effective solutions can be found\ncompared to conventional optimization methods. This paper provides a tutorial\non MO technique and provides some applications of MO in the context of wireless\ncommunications systems. In particular, to corroborate the effectiveness of MO\nmethodology, we explore five application examples in RIS-aided mMIMO system,\nfocusing on fairness, energy efficiency (EE) maximization, intracell pilot\nreuse interference mitigation, and grant-free (GF) random access (RA).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
