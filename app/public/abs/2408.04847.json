We compare models that leverage\nautomatically-learned structural features against models trained on a large set\nof biophysical features determined by subject-matter experts (SME). Our models,\nbased only on topological features of the protein structures, achieved 92%-99%\nof the performance of SME-based models in terms of the average precision score.\nBy interrogating model performance and feature importance metrics, we extract\nnumerous insights that uncover high correlations between topological features\nand SME features. We further showcase how combining topological features and\nSME features can lead to improved model performance over either feature set\nused in isolation, suggesting that, in some settings, topological features may\nprovide new discriminating information not captured in existing SME features\nthat are useful for protein stability prediction.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
