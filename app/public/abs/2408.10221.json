We show that there is a\nlattice isomorphism between the ideal lattice of $\\mathcal{M}^+(X,\\mathcal{A})$\nand the ideal lattice of its ring of differences $\\mathcal{M}(X,\\mathcal{A})$.\n  Moreover, we infer that each ideal of $\\mathcal{M}^+(X,\\mathcal{A})$ is a\nsemiring $z$-ideal.\n  We investigate the duality between cancellative congruences on\n$\\mathcal{M}^{+}(X,\\mathcal{A})$ and $Z_{\\mathcal{A}}$-filters on $X$. We\nobserve that for $\\sigma$-algebras, compactness and pseudocompactness coincide,\nand we provide a new characterization for compact measurable spaces via\nalgebraic properties of $\\mathcal{M}^+(X,\\mathcal{A})$. It is shown that the\nspace of (real) maximal congruences on $\\mathcal{M}^+(X,\\mathcal{A})$ is\nhomeomorphic to the space of (real) maximal ideals of the\n$\\mathcal{M}(X,\\mathcal{A})$. We solve the isomorphism problem for the\nsemirings of the form $\\mathcal{M}^+(X,\\mathcal{A})$ for compact and\nrealcompact measurable spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"kST4mXN2_JYzB10n0vpqI1XllRIQYv99_vgzsPlf7n8","pdfSize":"458964"}
