Because of the highly non-linear dependency of input\nmaterials like ash, water, cement, superplastic, etc; with the resultant\nstrength of concrete, it gets difficult for machine learning models to\nsuccessfully capture this relation and perform cost optimizations. This paper\nhighlights how PINNs (Physics Informed Neural Networks) can be useful in the\ngiven situation. This state-of-the-art model shall also get compared with\ntraditional models like Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting,\nand Deep Neural Network. Results of the research highlights how well PINNs\nperformed even with reduced dataset, thus resolving one of the biggest issues\nof limited data availability for ML models. On an average, PINN got the loss\nvalue reduced by 26.3% even with 40% lesser data compared to the Deep Neural\nNetwork. In addition to predicting strength of the concrete given the quantity\nof raw materials, the paper also highlights the use of heuristic optimization\nmethod like Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in predicting quantity of raw\nmaterials required to manufacture concrete of given strength with least cost.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Lpnm5iIz1fqDnayME4h8lblOpNLJjT07Gz09PS-HgFs","pdfSize":"1162611"}
