The generality of the procedure\nallows it to be directly applied to the computation of both tree and loop-level\nsoft limits. We also give a detailed study of Yang-Mills equations under the\nradial expansion, giving a thorough construction of the radiative phase space\nfor decays compatible with tree-level amplitudes for both light-cone and radial\ngauges. This gives rise to useful recursion relations at all orders between the\nfield strength and the vector gauge coefficients. We construct the\nsub$^n$-leading charges recursively, and show a hierarchical truncation such\nthat each charge subalgebra is closed, and their action in the extended phase\nspace is canonical. We relate these results with the infinite-dimensional\nalgebras that have been recently introduced in the context of conformal field\ntheories at null infinity.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9MW8XHRdKxvBJm6FsT26I7dI7GKqbtMu1CWifAFWemo","pdfSize":"1153698"}
