Recently, Si-group compounds have attracted\nincreasing attention in electrocatalysis, considering the abundant Si-group\nelements on Earth. However, Si-group compounds for HER electrocatalysis have\nnot been systematically studied. In this study, we unveil the activity trends\nof non-noble metal catalyst A15-type V3M (i.e., V3Si, V3Ge, and V3Sn)\nsuperconductors and show that V3Si is the most efficient HER catalyst because\nof the high electronic conductivity and suitable d-band center. Among them, the\nV3Si only requires 33.4 mV to reach 10 mA cm-2, and only 57.6 mV and 114.6 mV\nare required to attain a high current density of 100 mA cm-2 and 500 mA cm-2,\nrespectively. These low overpotentials are close to the 34.3 mV at 10 mA cm-2\nof state-of-art Pt/C (20 %) but superior to 168.5 mV of Pt/C (20 %) at 100 mA\ncm-2. Furthermore, the V3Si illustrates exceptional durability with no obvious\ndecay in the 120 h at the different current densities (i.e., 10 - 250 mA cm-2).\nThe excellent HER activity of V3Si alloy can be ascribed to the synergies of\nsuperior electronic conductivity and suitable d-band center. Moreover, DFT\ncalculations reveal that the absolute hydrogen adsorption Gibbs free energy is\ndecreased after introducing the V to Si. Beyond offering a stable and\nhigh-performance electrocatalyst in an acidic medium, this work inspires the\nrational design of desirable silicide electrocatalysts.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
