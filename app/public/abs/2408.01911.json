This paper provides an overview of the state-of-the-art\ntechniques in social media mining, with a practical application in analyzing\ntrends in the 2024 French legislative elections. We leverage natural language\nprocessing (NLP) tools to gauge public opinion by extracting and analyzing\ncomments and reactions from the AgoraVox platform. The study reveals that the\nNational Rally party, led by Marine Le Pen, maintains a high level of\nengagement on social media, outperforming traditional parties. This trend is\ncorroborated by user interactions, indicating a strong digital presence. The\nresults highlight the utility of advanced AI models, such as transformers and\nlarge language models (LLMs), in capturing nuanced public sentiments and\npredicting political leanings, demonstrating their potential in real-time\nreputation management and crisis response.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"J1EMUOBZ-_e5tRT3AnPsOlF0TXeh8dYVrR_SDXSi89I","pdfSize":"3997352"}
