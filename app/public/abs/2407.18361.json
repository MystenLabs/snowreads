Up on assuming the inaccessible part to\nbe flat, we seek for the unique determination of the time-dependent convection\nand the density terms from the knowledge of the boundary data measured outside\nthe inaccessible part. In the process, we show that there is a natural gauge in\nthe perturbations, and we prove that this is the only obstruction in the\nuniqueness result.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
