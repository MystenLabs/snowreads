Here we assumed the primaries as the source of\nradiation and have variable mass. The gravitational perturbation from disk-like\nstructure are also considered in this study. There exist five equilibrium\npoints in this system. By considering the combined effect from disk-like\nstructure and the mass transfer, we found that the classical collinear\nequilibrium points depart from x-axis. Meanwhile, this combined effect also\nbreaks the symmetry of tringular equlibrium point positions. We noted that the\nquasi-equilibrium points are unstable whereas the triangular equilibrium points\nare stable if the mass ratio $\\mu$ smaller than critical mass $\\mu_c$. It shows\nthat the stability of triangular equilibrium points depends on time.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"55EFISRBVqjTI9JdmD9mKSNzWUblAYd3_nSgihXfhjY","pdfSize":"1153750"}
