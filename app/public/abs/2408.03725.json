The current cosmological electromagnetic\nobservations including the cosmic microwave background anisotropies (CMB), the\nbaryon acoustic oscillations(BAO), the type Ia supernovae (SN) and the direct\nmeasurements of H(z), combined with the simulated gravitational-wave data are\nused to constrain the $f(Q)$ models. We find that the Hubble tension can be\nsignificantly alleviated to $1.40\\sigma$ level in the $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model. The\nfitting $\\chi^2$ of the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model is $9.75\\sigma$ poorer than that of\nthe $f(Q)_{EXP}$ model, implying the $f(Q)_{HT}$ model would be excluded by\nfuture gravitational-wave observation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
