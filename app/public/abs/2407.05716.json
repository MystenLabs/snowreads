While the LHC has delivered an integrated luminosity of $\\simeq$ 235\nfb$^{-1}$ since the start of Run 2, the 3D sensors have received a non-ionising\nenergy deposition corresponding to a fluence of ${\\simeq} 8.5\\times10^{14}$ 1\nMeV neutron-equivalent cm$^{-2}$ averaged over the sensor area. This paper\npresents results of measurements of the 3D pixel sensors' response during Run 2\nand the first two years of Run 3, with predictions of its evolution until the\nend of Run 3 in 2025. Data are compared with radiation damage simulations,\nbased on detailed maps of the electric field in the Si substrate, at various\nfluence levels and bias voltage values. These results illustrate the potential\nof 3D technology for pixel applications in high-radiation environments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"djb9-w8IbepwcoIHtmGWmoniaOo27hIPMl3hNvmYTs0","pdfSize":"4220421"}
