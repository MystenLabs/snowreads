We prove local energy decay of global solutions\nunder suitable hypotheses. Assuming the global bound of the $H^1(\\mathbb R)$\nnorm, we show local energy decay along sequences of time in an expanding region\naround the origin. If we assume nonnegativity for an initial momentum, $m_0(x)\n= (u - \\partial_x^2 u)(0,x)$, we show strict decay on a similar region.\nMoreover, we show decay in an exterior region given the same nonnegativity\ncondition.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"lWPXg1YGkU1moKd5AAK7in6g4sjZEe1_zW2YBZBSpMw","pdfSize":"236656"}
