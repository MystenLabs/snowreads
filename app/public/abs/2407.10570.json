In the multiple peg-in-hole task for large-sized parts, it is\nchallenging for a single manipulator to simultaneously align multiple distant\npegs and holes, necessitating tightly coupled multi-manipulator systems. For\nsuch Multi-manipulator Multiple Peg-in-Hole (MMPiH) tasks, we proposes a\ncollaborative visual servo control framework that uses only the monocular\nin-hand cameras of each manipulator to reduce positioning errors. Initially, we\ntrain a state classification neural network and a positioning neural network.\nThe former is used to divide the states of peg and hole in the image into three\ncategories: obscured, separated and overlapped, while the latter determines the\nposition of the peg and hole in the image. Based on these findings, we propose\na method to integrate the visual features of multiple manipulators using\nvirtual forces, which can naturally combine with the cooperative controller of\nthe multi-manipulator system. To generalize our approach to holes of different\nappearances, we varied the appearance of the holes during the dataset\ngeneration process. The results confirm that by considering the appearance of\nthe holes, classification accuracy and positioning precision can be improved.\nFinally, the results show that our method achieves an 85% success rate in\ndual-manipulator dual peg-in-hole tasks with a clearance of 0.2 mm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
