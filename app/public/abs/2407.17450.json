Most methods\nfor extracting brain regions are applied to scans from study participants\nindependently, resulting in wide variability in shape and volume estimates of\nthese regions over time in longitudinal studies. To address this problem, we\npropose a longitudinal principal manifold estimation method, which seeks to\nrecover smooth, longitudinally meaningful manifold estimates of shapes over\ntime. The proposed approach uses a smoothing spline to smooth over the\ncoefficients of principal manifold embedding functions estimated at each time\npoint. This mitigates the effects of random disturbances to the manifold\nbetween time points. Additionally, we propose a novel data augmentation\napproach to enable principal manifold estimation on self-intersecting\nmanifolds. Simulation studies demonstrate performance improvements over naive\napplications of principal manifold estimation and principal curve/surface\nmethods. The proposed method improves the estimation of surfaces of\nhippocampuses and thalamuses using data from participants of the Alzheimer's\nDisease Neuroimaging Initiative. An analysis of magnetic resonance imaging data\nfrom 236 individuals shows the advantages of our proposed methods that leverage\nregional longitudinal trends for segmentation.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
