This proof is based on a statement that a function $f$ is a\n$(\\lambda, \\mu)$-eigenfunction if and only if $f$ and $f^2$ are eigenfunctions\nfor Laplace-Beltrami operator. Also, minimal submanifolds in spheres of\ncodimension 1 are constructed. In the case of $\\mathbb{S}^3$ two immersions of\nClifford torus and all Lawson $\\tau_{n, m}$ surfaces are described in terms of\n$(\\lambda, \\mu)$-eigenfunctions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
