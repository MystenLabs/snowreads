We consider two $f(T,\\mathcal{T})$\nfunctions, specifically $f(T,\\mathcal{T})=\\alpha T + \\beta \\mathcal{T}$ and\n$f(T,\\mathcal{T})=\\alpha \\sqrt{-T} + \\beta \\mathcal{T}$, where $\\alpha$ and\n$\\beta$ are arbitrary constants, along with the fluid part incorporating the\ncoefficient of bulk viscosity $\\zeta=\\zeta_0 > 0$. We calculate the analytical\nsolutions of the corresponding field equations for a flat FLRW environment, and\nthen we constrain the free parameters of the obtained solution using CC,\nPantheon+, and the CC+Pantheon+ samples. We perform the Bayesian statistical\nanalysis to estimate the posterior probability utilizing the likelihood\nfunction and the MCMC random sampling technique. Further, to assess the\neffectiveness of our MCMC analysis, we estimate the corresponding AIC and BIC\nvalues, and we find that there is strong evidence supporting the assumed\nviscous modified gravity models for all three data sets. Also, we find that the\nlinear model precisely mimics the $\\Lambda$CDM model. We also investigate the\nevolutionary behavior of some prominent cosmological parameters. We observe\nthat the effective equation of state parameter for both models predict the\naccelerating behavior of the cosmic expansion phase. In addition, from the\nstatefinder test, we find that the parameters of the considered MOG models\nfavor the quintessence-type behavior.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
