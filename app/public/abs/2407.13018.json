Proof-of-Work (PoW),\none of the most influential implementations of consensus mechanisms, consumes\nan extraordinary amount of energy for a task that lacks direct productive\noutput. In this paper, we propose Proof-of-Collaborative-Learning (PoCL), a\nmulti-winner federated learning validated consensus mechanism that redirects\nthe computation power of blockchains to train federated learning models. In\naddition, we present a novel evaluation mechanism to ensure the efficiency of\nthe locally trained models of miners. We evaluated the security of our\nevaluation mechanism by introducing and conducting probable attacks. Moreover,\nwe present a novel reward distribution mechanism to incentivize winning miners\nfairly, and demonstrate that our reward system is fair both within and across\nall rounds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
