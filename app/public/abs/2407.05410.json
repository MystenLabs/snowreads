Provisioning of such test environments,\nfor information-intensive services, involves setting up databases that are\nrich-enough to enable simulating a wide variety of user scenarios. While\nproduction data is perhaps the gold-standard here, many organizations,\nparticularly within the public sectors, are not allowed to use production data\nfor testing purposes due to privacy concerns. The alternatives are to use\nanonymized data, or synthetically generated data. In this paper, we elaborate\non these alternatives and compare them in an industrial context. Further we\nfocus on synthetic data generation and investigate the use of recurrent neural\nnetworks for this purpose. In our preliminary experiments, we were able to\ngenerate representative and highly accurate data using a recurrent neural\nnetwork. These results open new research questions that we discuss here, and\nplan to investigate in our future research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Databases","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
