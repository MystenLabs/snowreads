This paper introduces Character\nComplexity, a novel measure that bridges Group-theoretic concepts with\npractical quantum computing concerns. By leveraging tools from representation\ntheory, I prove several key properties of character complexity and establish a\nsurprising connection to the classical simulability of quantum circuits. This\nnew measure offers a fresh perspective on the complexity landscape of quantum\nalgorithms, potentially reshaping our understanding of quantum-classical\ncomputational boundaries. I present innovative visualization methods for\ncharacter complexity, providing intuitive insights into the structure of\nquantum circuits. The empirical results reveal intriguing scaling behaviors\nwith respect to qubit and gate counts, opening new avenues for quantum\nalgorithm design and optimization. This work not only contributes to the\ntheoretical foundations of quantum complexity but also offers practical tools\nfor the quantum computing community. As quantum hardware continues to advance,\ncharacter complexity could play a crucial role in developing more efficient\nquantum algorithms and in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum\ncomputation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"DngFqpksPWu-OH1FfhrxQfk6whwww-HMZjIrDQ7Nhao","pdfSize":"4419825"}
