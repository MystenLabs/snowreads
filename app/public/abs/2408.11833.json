We explored this question utilizing authorship data from the Web\nof Science Conference Proceedings Citation Index for 180 conferences in 30\nconference series held between 2017 and 2023. At least one edition of each\nanalyzed conference series was launched in a virtual or hybrid form. This\nsample enables a comparison of differences in the gender participation of\nconference authors while controlling for heterogeneity among conference series.\nUsing linear and logistic regression models, we identified a positive\ndifference in women's involvement in virtual and hybrid conferences compared to\nonsite events. However, this effect was due less to the increased participation\nof women in virtual and hybrid conferences than to the decreased participation\nof women in the onsite editions of the analyzed conference series.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
