The analysis utilises 140\nfb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data collected with the ATLAS detector at\nthe Large Hadron Collider at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. Fiducial\ncross-sections are extracted in a final state featuring one electron and one\nmuon, with at least three or four $b$-jets. Results are presented at the\nparticle level for both integrated cross-sections and normalised differential\ncross-sections, as functions of global event properties, jet kinematics, and\n$b$-jet pair properties. Observable quantities characterising $b$-jets\noriginating from the top quark decay and additional $b$-jets are also measured\nat the particle level, after correcting for detector effects. The measured\nintegrated fiducial cross-sections are consistent with $t\\bar{t}b\\bar{b}$\npredictions from various next-to-leading-order matrix element calculations\nmatched to a parton shower within the uncertainties of the predictions.\nState-of-the-art theoretical predictions are compared with the differential\nmeasurements; none of them simultaneously describes all observables.\nDifferences between any two predictions are smaller than the measurement\nuncertainties for most observables.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
