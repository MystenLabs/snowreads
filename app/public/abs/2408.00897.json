Analyzing electronic structures by calculating structural\nstability, band structure, density of states, Bader charge transfer, and work\nfunctions utilizing first principle calculations, we revealed that titanium\nnitride Mxenes, namely Ti$_2$N and Ti$_3$N$_2$, have excess anionic electrons\nin their pseudo-atomic structure inside the crystal lattice, making them MXene\nelectrides. Bulk Ti$_3$N$_2$ has competing antiferromagnetic (AFM) and\nferromagnetic(FM) configurations with slightly more stable AFM configurations,\nwhile the Ti$_2$N MXene is nonmagnetic. Although Ti$_3$N$_2$ favors AFM\nconfigurations with hexagonal crystal systems having $6/mmm$ point group\nsymmetry, Ti$_3$N$_2$ does not support altermagnetism. The monolayer of the\nTi$_3$N$_2$ MXene is a ferromagnetic electride. These unique properties of\nhaving non-nuclear interstitial anionic electrons in the electronic structure\nof titanium nitride MXene have not yet been reported in the literature. Density\nfunctional theory calculations show TiN is neither an electride, MXene, or\nmagnetic.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
