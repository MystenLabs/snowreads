Studying phylogenetic networks under a statistical model\nof DNA sequence evolution can aid the inference of phylogenetic networks. Most\nnotably Markov models like the Jukes-Cantor or Kimura-3 model can been employed\nto infer a phylogenetic network using phylogenetic invariants. In this article\nwe determine all quadratic invariants for sunlet networks under the random walk\n4-state Markov model, which includes the aforementioned models. Taking toric\nfiber products of trees and sunlet networks, we obtain a new class of\ninvariants for level-1 phylogenetic networks under the same model. Furthermore,\nwe apply our results to the identifiability problem of a network parameter. In\nparticular, we prove that our new class of invariants of the studied model is\nnot sufficient to derive identifiability of quarnets (4-leaf networks).\nMoreover, we provide an efficient method that is faster and more reliable than\nthe state-of-the-art in finding a significant number of invariants for many\nlevel-1 phylogenetic networks.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
