In particular, we model three scenarios: monthly mean\nand monthly maximum precipitation as well as the maximum length of a dry spell\nper month with a gamma, blended generalised extreme value and negative binomial\ndistribution, respectively, over the periods 1973-1982 and 2013-2022. In order\nto model the spatial dependencies in the data more realistically, we intend to\ntake the mountainous landscape of Austria into account. Therefore, we have\nchosen a non-stationary version of the Mat\\'ern covariance function, which\naccounts for elevation differences, as a spatial argument of the latent field\nin the GAM. The temporal part of the latent field is captured by an AR(1)\nprocess. We use the stochastic partial differential equation approach in\ncombination with integrated nested Laplace approximation to perform inference\ncomputationally efficient. The model outputs are visualised and support\nexisting climate change studies in the Alpine region obtained with, for\nexample, projections from regional climate models.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
