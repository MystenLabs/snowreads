Our forecasts do not\ndepend on these particles comprising a significant fraction of the dark matter.\nRather, these experiments are sensitive to the irreducible abundance produced\nin the early universe through the freeze-in mechanism. We find that ongoing and\nproposed direct detection experiments will have world-leading sensitivity to\neffective charges $Q\\sim 10^{-12}$ across nine orders of magnitude in mass,\ncorresponding to a dark matter sub-fraction as low as $\\sim 10^{-3}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
