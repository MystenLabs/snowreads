With the Fisher\nanalysis, we find that the scale-PKHF and scale-VLYDF are capable of capturing\na wealth of primordial information about the Universe. Specifically, the\nconstraint on the scalar spectral index $n_s$ obtained from the scale-VLYDF\n(scale-PKHF) is 12.4 (8.6) times tighter than that from the power spectrum, and\n3.9 (2.7) times tighter than that from the bispectrum. The combination of the\ntwo statistics yields constraints on $\\{f_\\mathrm{NL}^\\mathrm{local},\nf_\\mathrm{NL}^\\mathrm{equil}\\}$ similar to those from the bispectrum and power\nspectrum combination, but provides a 1.4-fold improvement in the constraint on\n$f_\\mathrm{NL}^\\mathrm{ortho}$. After including the power spectrum, its\nconstraining power well exceeds that of the bispectrum and power spectrum\ncombination by factors of 1.1--2.9 for all parameters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
