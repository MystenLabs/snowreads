Denote the minimum size of a base for $G$ by\n$b(G)$. There is a natural greedy algorithm for constructing a base of\nrelatively small size; denote by $\\mathcal{G}(G)$ the maximum size of a base it\nproduces. Motivated by a long-standing conjecture of Cameron, we determine\n$\\mathcal{G}(G)$ for every almost simple primitive group $G$ with socle a\nsporadic simple group, showing that $\\mathcal{G}(G)=b(G)$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"h6tNBrsMDIt1UivEUOl3BPGWIm4mVgya53x7xsGcQbw","pdfSize":"178285"}
