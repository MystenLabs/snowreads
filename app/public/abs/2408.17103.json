Web search datasets, such as MS\nMARCO, primarily provide short keyword queries without accompanying intent or\ndescriptions, posing a challenge in comprehending the underlying information\nneed. This paper proposes an approach to augmenting such datasets to annotate\ninformative query descriptions, with a focus on two prominent benchmark\ndatasets: TREC-DL-21 and TREC-DL-22. Our methodology involves utilizing\nstate-of-the-art LLMs to analyze and comprehend the implicit intent within\nindividual queries from benchmark datasets. By extracting key semantic\nelements, we construct detailed and contextually rich descriptions for these\nqueries. To validate the generated query descriptions, we employ crowdsourcing\nas a reliable means of obtaining diverse human perspectives on the accuracy and\ninformativeness of the descriptions. This information can be used as an\nevaluation set for tasks such as ranking, query rewriting, or others.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
