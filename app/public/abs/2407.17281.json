The high energy electric theory features gauge dynamics\ninvolving only fermionic matter fields, while the low energy magnetic\ndescription features a quasi-supersymmetric spectrum testable at colliders. The\nflavour theory is constructed via operators generated at the Planck scale. We\nfurther show that duality opens novel avenues for theories of grand\nunification.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
