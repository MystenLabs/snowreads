In this\npaper, we focus on studying whether the entanglement entropy and Husimi Q\nfunction, as diagnostic tools for quantum chaos in quantum systems, are\ninvalidated by quantum collapse and revival. It is shown that the saturation\nvalues of entanglement entropy for initial states located in the chaotic sea of\nQRM are higher than that in the regular regions. When the system reaches\ndynamic equilibrium, the Husimi Q function which initial states located in the\nchaotic sea are more dispersed than that in the regular regions. Moreover, we\nobserve a good correspondence between the the time-average entanglement entropy\nand classical phase space structures. Our results imply that entanglement\nentropy and Husimi Q function maintain the function for diagnosing chaos in the\nQRM and the corresponding principle does not be invalidated by quantum collapse\nand revival effects in this system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VDP39sJvr7UfFugaCqdXQeCyLRFunNK14Umpc8TaNbg","pdfSize":"1435440"}
