However, there has been comparatively less effort devoted to\nthe consideration of temporal dependencies in emotion distributions which\nencodes ambiguity in perceived emotions that evolve smoothly over time.\nRecognizing the benefits of using constrained dynamical neural ordinary\ndifferential equations (CD-NODE) to model time series as dynamic processes, we\npropose an ambiguity-aware dual-constrained Neural ODE approach to model the\ndynamics of emotion distributions on arousal and valence. In our approach, we\nutilize ODEs parameterised by neural networks to estimate the distribution\nparameters, and we integrate additional constraints to restrict the range of\nthe system outputs to ensure the validity of predicted distributions. We\nevaluated our proposed system on the publicly available RECOLA dataset and\nobserved very promising performance across a range of evaluation metrics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
