This study focuses on\nanalyzing the legal implications of the decentralized nature of DAOs, with a\nparticular emphasis on the aspects of participant liability. Such\nconsiderations are essential for understanding how current legal systems might\nbe adapted or reformed to effectively address these novel challenges.\n  The paper examines the specificity of DAOs, highlighting their decentralized\ngovernance structure and reliance on smart contracts, which introduce unique\nissues related to the blurring of liability boundaries. It underscores how the\nanonymity of DAO participants and the automatic execution of smart contracts\ncomplicate the traditional concept of legal liability, both within the DAO\ncontext and in interactions with external parties.\n  The analysis also includes a comparison between DAOs and traditional\norganizational forms, such as corporations and associations, to identify\npotential analogies and differences in participant liability. It explores how\nexisting regulations on partner liability might be insufficient or inapplicable\nin the DAO context, prompting the search for new, innovative legal solutions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
