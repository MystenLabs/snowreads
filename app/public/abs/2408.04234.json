For\na pair comparison, we evaluate the statistical separation, where one hypothesis\nplays the role of the true signal while the other corresponds to the test\nsignal. The beyond-standard neutrino oscillation hypotheses under scrutiny\ninclude neutrino decay (invisible and visible), non-standard interactions,\nquantum decoherence, and the violation of the equivalence principle. When taken\nas the true model, we found that either quantum decoherence or the violation of\nthe equivalence principle are the easiest to differentiate compared to the rest\nof the hypotheses. Additionally, from our statistical test, we investigate\npotential discrepancies between the measured CP-violation phase $\\delta_{CP}$\nrelative to its true value, which could occur for a given comparison. In our\nanalysis, we will take the true values of $\\delta_{CP}$ as $-90^\\circ$ and\n$180^\\circ$. Notably, even in cases where the beyond-standard neutrino\noscillation hypotheses scenarios are statistically indistinguishable, the\nmeasured value can exhibit significant deviations from its true value.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mFCCjrxhuVk9vqZziMHj5pkj8BzG2aYoK2KtoknEZZc","pdfSize":"1580848"}
