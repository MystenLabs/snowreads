There has been a wealth of\nresearch on machine translations and related reviews. However, there are few\nworks on sign language machine translation considering the particularity of the\nlanguage being continuous and dynamic. This paper aims to address this void,\nproviding a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of sign language\nmachine translation algorithms and a taxonomy of the Transformers\narchitectures, the most used approach in language translation. We also present\nthe requirements of a real-time Quality-of-Service sign language ma-chine\ntranslation system underpinned by accurate deep learning algorithms. We propose\nfuture research directions for sign language translation systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WKLX6yMjgQ4qi6Je7DkCjTKQWyeOgMb9-Bd07mhSV84","pdfSize":"1739872"}
