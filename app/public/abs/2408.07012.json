This can be regarded as `lattice reduction with\nsymmetries'. We make this algorithm explicit for the classical groups $G =\n\\mathrm{Sp}_{2g}$, $\\mathrm{SO}_{2g}$, and for the exceptional group $G = G_2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
