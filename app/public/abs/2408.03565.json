This release paper describes recent improvements to FIAT\naimed at improving its run time and the accuracy and efficiency of code\ngenerated using FIAT-provided information. In the first category, we have\ngreatly streamlined the implementation of orthogonal polynomials out of which\nfinite element bases are built. The second category comprises several more\nadvances. For one, we have built an interface to the $\\texttt{recursivenodes}$\npackage to enable more accurate Lagrange bases at high order. We have also\nimplemented integral-type degrees of freedom for $H(\\mathrm{div})$ and\n$H(\\mathrm{curl})$ elements, which match the mathematical definitions of the\nelements more closely and also avoid loss of accuracy in interpolation. More\nfundamentally, we have included families of simplicial quadrature rules that\nrequire many fewer quadrature points than the Stroud rules previously used in\nFIAT. Finally, FIAT now provides support for fast diagonalization methods,\nwhich enable fast solution algorithms at very high order. In each case, we\ndescribe the new features in FIAT and illustrate some of the gains obtained\nthrough simple numerical tests.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
