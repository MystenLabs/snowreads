About half of a century ago, Lov\\'{a}sz and\nSimonovits (1975) provided a supersaturation phenomenon, which asserts that for\n$q< n/2$, every graph with $\\lfloor n^2/4 \\rfloor +q$ edges contains at least\n$q\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ triangles. This result solved a conjecture proposed by\nErd\\H{o}s in 1962. In this paper, we establish a spectral version of the result\nof Lov\\'{a}sz and Simonovits. Let $Y_{n,2,q}$ be the graph obtained from the\nbipartite Tur\\'{a}n graph $T_{n,2}$ by embedding a matching with $q$ edges into\nthe vertex part of size $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$. Using the supersaturation-stability\nmethod and the classical spectral techniques, we firstly prove that for $n\\ge\n300q^2$, each graph $G$ on $n$ vertices with $\\lambda (G) \\ge \\lambda\n(Y_{n,2,q})$ contains at least $q\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ triangles. Moreover, let\n$T_{n,2,q}$ be the graph obtained from $T_{n,2}$ by embedding a star with $q$\nedges into the vertex part of size $\\lceil n/2\\rceil$. Secondly, we show\nfurther that $T_{n,2,q}$ is the unique spectral extremal graph that contains at\nmost $q\\lfloor n/2 \\rfloor$ triangles and attains the maximum of the spectral\nradius. This result answers a spectral triangle counting problem due to Ning\nand Zhai (2023). Thirdly, we present an asymptotically spectral stability\nresult under a specific constraint on the triangle covering number. The third\nresult could be regarded as a spectral extension of a recent result proved by\nBalogh and Clemen (2023), and independently by Liu and Mubayi (2022).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8Dj0YtO7FFavv7ZXwmcHMbmCX5fxeTBFvF9wMu-8MoM","pdfSize":"869115","txDigest":"51FuBHJEA8WhYGy7RvwrgGMkQkc3McWzy56mv41qbmAN","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
