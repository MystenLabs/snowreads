Most previous works follow a single-label\nclassification style, classifying an event pair into either a specific temporal\nrelation (e.g., \\textit{Before}, \\textit{After}), or a special label\n\\textit{Vague} when there may be multiple possible temporal relations between\nthe pair. In our work, instead of directly making predictions on\n\\textit{Vague}, we propose a multi-label classification solution for ETRE\n(METRE) to infer the possibility of each temporal relation independently, where\nwe treat \\textit{Vague} as the cases when there is more than one possible\nrelation between two events. We design a speculation mechanism to explore the\npossible relations hidden behind \\textit{Vague}, which enables the latent\ninformation to be used efficiently. Experiments on TB-Dense, MATRES and UDS-T\nshow that our method can effectively utilize the \\textit{Vague} instances to\nimprove the recognition for specific temporal relations and outperforms most\nstate-of-the-art methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ujl75VQFfRMsy2qDRZiBu7U_KQYN6RMwuoPZF2ucWB0","pdfSize":"688752"}
