Building on top of\nthis regularity and assuming a local Lipschitz regularity of the map, we\nestablish a weak version of the Bochner-Eells-Sampson inequality in such a\nnon-smooth setting. Finally we study the boundary regularity of such maps.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
