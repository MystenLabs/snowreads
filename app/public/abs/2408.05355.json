Among the available metal ions like Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+ etc., the\nrole that play the Mg2+ ion is very significant related to the stability of the\nstructures of RNA and this is quite well studied. But it is not possible to\ngrasp the entire functionality of Mg2+ ion in the structure of RNA. So, to have\na better understanding of the Mg-RNA complexes, in the present study, we have\ninvestigated 1541 non-redundant crystal structures of RNA and generated reports\nfor various statistics related to these Mg-RNA complexes by computing base\npairs and Mg2+ binding statistics. In this study, it has also been reported\nwhether the presence of Mg2+ ions can alter the stability of base pairs or not\nby computing and comparing the base pairs stability. We noted that the Mg2+\nions do not affect the canonical base pair G:C W:WC while majority of the\nnon-canonical base pair G:G W:HC, which is important also in DNA telomere\nstructures, has Magnesium ion binding to O6 or N7 atoms of one of the Guanines.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
