High-precision estimation models are necessary to create areal\ndata for solar irradiance. In this study, we developed a novel estimation model\nby utilizing machine learning and multiband data from meteorological satellite\nobservations. Particularly under clear-sky and thin clouds, satellite\nobservations can be influenced by surface reflections, which may lead to\noverfitting to ground observations. To make the model applicable at any\nlocation, we constructed the model incorporating prior information such as\nradiative transfer models and clear-sky probability, based on physical and\nmeteorological knowledge. As a result, the estimation accuracy significantly\nimproved at validation sites.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
