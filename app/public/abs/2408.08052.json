We demonstrate that the\ncorresponding ensemble-averaged entanglements (EAEs) between two subsystems can\neffectively identify entanglement phases. In volume-law entangled states, EAE\nconverges to a nonzero value with increasing distance between subsystems. For\ncritical systems, EAE exhibits power-law decay, and it decays exponentially for\narea-law systems. Thus, entanglement phase transitions can be viewed as a\ndisorder-order phase transition. We also apply BPE and EAE to measured random\nClifford circuits to probe measurement-induced phase transitions. We show that\nEAE serves not only as a witness to phase transitions, but also unveils\nadditional critical phenomena properties, including dynamical scaling and\nsurface critical exponents. Our findings provide an alternative approach to\ndiagnosing entanglement laws, thus enhancing the understanding of entanglement\nphase transitions. Moreover, given the scalability of measuring EAE in quantum\nsimulators, our results hold promise for impacting quantum simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Jczs_BxeSY8YAQChb2Itex9txH9kOGqfpJfDgpPl_lI","pdfSize":"3053089"}
