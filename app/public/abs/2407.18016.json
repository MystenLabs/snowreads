It is assumed that the nonlinear $f$ is close to a\nfunction $g:[0,\\infty)\\to [0,1]$ with $g(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi>1$. The fact\n$g(\\xi)=0$ for all $\\xi>1$ allows to construct stable periodic orbits for the\nequation $x'(t)=-cx(t)+dg(x(t-1))$ with some parameters $d>c>0$. Then it is\nshown that the equation $ y'(t)=-ay(t)+bf(y(t-1)) $ also has a stable periodic\norbit provided $a,b,f$ are sufficiently close to $c,d,g$ in a certain sense.\nThe examples include $f(\\xi)=\\frac{\\xi^k}{1+\\xi^n}$ for parameters $k>0$ and\n$n>0$ together with the discontinuous $g(\\xi)=\\xi^k$ for $\\xi\\in[0,1)$, and\n$g(\\xi)=0$ for $\\xi>1$. The case $k=1$ is the famous Mackey--Glass equation,\nthe case $k>1$ appears in population models with Allee effect, and the case\n$k\\in(0,1)$ arises in some economic growth models. The obtained stable periodic\norbits may have complicated structures.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
