As compared to the conventional\nfixed-position antennas (FPAs), their geometry can be dynamically reconfigured,\nsuch that more flexible beamforming can be achieved for signal coverage and/or\ninterference nulling. In this paper, we investigate the use of MAs to achieve\nuniform coverage for multiple regions with arbitrary number and width in the\nspatial domain. In particular, we aim to jointly optimize the MAs weights and\npositions within a linear array to maximize the minimum beam gain over the\ndesired spatial regions. However, the resulting problem is non-convex and\ndifficult to be optimally solved. To tackle this difficulty, we propose an\nalternating optimization (AO) algorithm to obtain a high-quality suboptimal\nsolution, where the MAs weights and positions are alternately optimized by\napplying successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Numerical results\nshow that our proposed MAbased beam coverage scheme can achieve much better\nperformance than conventional FPAs.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
