Cloud-based version management services like GitHub\nare commonly used for source code and other files. However, a challenge arises\nwhen developers from different companies or organizations share the platform,\nas sensitive data should be encrypted to restrict access to certain developers\nonly. This paper discusses existing tools addressing this issue, highlighting\ntheir shortcomings. The authors propose their own solution, Encrypted Container\nFiles, designed to overcome the deficiencies observed in other tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
