Wang use this to derive several\nother Chebyshev and Chernoff-type inequalities (Hoeffding, Bernstein, empirical\nBernstein) in the Loewner anti-order, including self-normalized matrix\nmartingale inequalities. These imply upper tail bounds on the maximum\neigenvalue, such as those developed by Tropp and howard et al. The current\npaper develops analogs of all these inequalities in the Loewner order, rather\nthan anti-order, by deriving a new matrix Markov inequality. These yield upper\ntail bounds on the minimum eigenvalue that are a factor of d tighter than the\nabove bounds on the maximum eigenvalue.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
