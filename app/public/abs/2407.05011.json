The convergence of $\\widehat C_N$\nis established for the Hausdorff distance under uniform conditions on the\ndistribution of $H$, but also in a pointwise sense under less demanding\nconditions. Some of these convergence results on $\\widehat C_N$ are applied to\nthe estimation of the time-dependent constraint set involved in a discrete-time\nSkorokhod problem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
