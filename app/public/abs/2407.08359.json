While testing\nprocesses and methodologies are well established, structured guidance and\nexecution support for field tests are still weak. This paper identifies\nrequirements for field testing of drone missions, and introduces the Field\nTesting Scenario Management (FiTS) approach for adaptive field testing\nguidance. FiTS aims to provide sufficient guidance for field testers as a\nfoundation for efficient data collection to facilitate quality assurance and\niterative improvement of field tests and CPSs. FiTS shall leverage concepts\nfrom scenario-based requirements engineering and Behavior-Driven Development to\ndefine structured and reusable test scenarios, with dedicated tasks and\nresponsibilities for role-specific guidance. We evaluate FiTS by (i) applying\nit to three use cases for a search-and-rescue drone application to demonstrate\nfeasibility and (ii) interviews with experienced drone developers to assess its\nusefulness and collect further requirements. The study results indicate FiTS to\nbe feasible and useful to facilitate drone field testing and data analysis\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
