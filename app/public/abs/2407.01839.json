These objects exhibit short rotational periods (minutes to\nhours), where measured. We find that the strengths required to prevent\ncatastrophic disintegration are consistent with those measured in cometary\nnuclei and expected in rubble pile objects. We hypothesize that these dark\ncomets are the end result of a rotational fragmentation cascade, which is\nconsistent with their measured physical properties. We calculate the predicted\nsize-frequency distribution for objects evolving under this model. Using\ndynamical simulations, we further demonstrate that the majority of these bodies\noriginated from the $\\nu_6$ resonance, implying the existence of volatiles in\nthe current inner main belt. Moreover, one of the dark comets, (523599) 2003\nRM, likely originated from the outer main belt, although a JFC origin is also\nplausible. These results provide strong evidence that volatiles from a\nreservoir in the inner main belt are present in the near-Earth environment.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3S7FQBe57Pu4r1AI0GiczS7SiHeSnYJ7tDEs7J9voqA","pdfSize":"5876422"}
