Following a recent approach developed for Majorana chains, we derive\na field theory description for the purity and bipartite entanglement at large\nspace and time scales. We focus on a multi-flavor one-dimensional chain with\nrandom complex hoppings and continuous monitoring of the local fermion density.\nBy means of the replica trick, and using the number of flavors as a large\nparameter controlling our approximations, we derive an effective field theory\nmade up of a SU(N) non-linear sigma model (NL$\\sigma$M) coupled to fluctuating\nhydrodynamics. Contrary to the case of non-interacting Majorana fermions,\ndisplaying no U(1) symmetry, we find that the bipartite entanglement entropy\nsatisfies an area law for all monitoring rates, but with a nontrivial scaling\nof entanglement when the correlation length is large. We provide numerical\nevidence supporting our claims. We briefly show how imposing a reality\ncondition on the hoppings can change the NL$\\sigma$M and also discuss higher\ndimensional generalizations.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
