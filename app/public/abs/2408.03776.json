The energy excludes the\ncontribution of phase boundaries in the cracked region, providing a heuristic\napproximation of the interfacial energy in the current material configuration.\nOur primary result shows that the sharp energy may be recovered via\nGamma-convergence from a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy coupled with an\nAmbrosio-Tortorelli-type approximation of the (linear) elastic and fracture\nenergy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
