One of\nthe cornerstones of this duality is the description of thermal states as black\nholes with asymptotically Anti-de Sitter boundary conditions. This idea has led\nto valuable insights into such fields as transport theory and relativistic\nhydrodynamics. The quasinormal modes of such black holes play a decisive role\nand therefore their stability properties are of upmost interest for the\nholographic duality. We review recent results using the method of pseudospectra\nin this context.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hi6JQhRLbOAc1ePqV8CxthnDfgAM_OJCZWEfOO2Iv3A","pdfSize":"731833"}
