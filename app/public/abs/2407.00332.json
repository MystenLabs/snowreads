With\nlimited direct treatment or vaccination currently available, prevention through\nvector control is widely believed to be the most effective form of managing\noutbreaks. This study examines traditional state space models (moving average,\nautoregressive, ARIMA, SARIMA), supervised learning techniques (XGBoost, SVM,\nKNN) and deep networks (LSTM, CNN, ConvLSTM) for forecasting weekly dengue\ncases in Singapore. Meteorological data and search engine trends were included\nas features for ML techniques. Forecasts using CNNs yielded lowest RMSE in\nweekly cases in 2019.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
