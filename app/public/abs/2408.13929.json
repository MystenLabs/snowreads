This study introduces a method for detecting driver fatigue using\nthe SEED-VIG dataset, a well-established benchmark in EEG-based vigilance\nanalysis. By employing advanced pattern recognition technologies, including\nmachine learning and deep neural networks, EEG signals are meticulously\nanalyzed to discern patterns indicative of fatigue. This methodology combines\nfeature extraction with a classification framework to improve the accuracy of\nfatigue detection. The proposed NLMDA-Net reached an impressive accuracy of\n83.71% in detecting fatigue from EEG signals by incorporating two novel\nattention modules designed specifically for EEG signals, the channel and depth\nattention modules. NLMDA-Net effectively integrate features from multiple\ndimensions, resulting in improved classification performance. This success\nstems from integrating temporal convolutions and attention mechanisms, which\neffectively interpret EEG data. Designed to capture both temporal and spatial\ncharacteristics of EEG signals, deep learning classifiers have proven superior\nto traditional methods. The results of this study reveal a substantial\nenhancement in detection rates over existing models, highlighting the efficacy\nof the proposed approach for practical applications. The implications of this\nresearch are profound, extending beyond academic realms to inform the\ndevelopment of more sophisticated driver assistance systems. Incorporating this\nfatigue detection algorithm into these systems could significantly reduce\nfatigue-related incidents on the road, thus fostering safer driving conditions.\nThis paper provides an exhaustive analysis of the dataset, methods employed,\nresults obtained, and the potential real-world applications of the findings,\naiming to contribute significantly to advancements in automotive safety.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tC0vBkQesDV6sDBzePFA51OFSJYRz5EK51laEvWMPT0","pdfSize":"320197"}
