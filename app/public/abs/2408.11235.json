We use a\ntime adaptive velocity space to deal with fast particles leaving the\ncomputational domain, a block structured mesh to resolve the sharp gradient in\nthe plasma sheath, and limiters to avoid oscillations in the density function.\nIn particular, we propose a limiter that can be computed directly from the\ninformation used in the semi-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin advection step.\nThis limiter is particularly efficient on graphic processing units (GPUs) and\ncompares favorable with limiters from the literature. We provide numerical\nresults for a set of benchmark problems and compare different limiting\nstrategies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
