In this paper, we show that, if $\\Gamma$ satisfies the\ndescending chain condition, then so does\n$\\mathrm{Ivol}_\\mathrm{lc}^\\Gamma(d,\\kappa)$ for $d\\leq 3$. In case $d\\leq 3$\nand $\\kappa=1$, $\\Gamma$ and $\\mathrm{Ivol}_\\mathrm{lc}^\\Gamma(d,\\kappa)$ are\nshown to share more topological properties, such as closedness in $\\mathbb{R}$\nand local finiteness of accumulation complexity. In higher dimensions, we show\nthat the set of Iitaka volumes for $d$-dimensional klt pairs with Iitaka\ndimension $\\geq d-2$ satisfies the DCC, partially confirming a conjecture of\nZhan Li.\n  We give a more detailed description of the sets of Iitaka volumes for the\nfollowing classes of projective log canonical surfaces: (1) smooth properly\nelliptic surfaces, (2) projective log canonical surfaces with coefficients from\n$\\{0\\}$ or $\\{0,1\\}$. In particular, the minima as well as the minimal\naccumulation points are found in these cases.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
