PDEs are notoriously hard to solve, due to their the intricate\nnature, and finding solutions to PDEs often exceeds the capabilities of\ntraditional computational approaches. Recent advances in quantum computing have\ntriggered a growing interest from researchers for the design of quantum\nalgorithms for solving PDEs. In this work, we introduce two different\narchitectures of a novel variational quantum algorithm (VQA) with Lagrange\npolynomial encoding in combination with derivative quantum circuits using the\nHadamard test differentiation to approximate the solution of PDEs. To\ndemonstrate the potential of our new VQA, two well-known PDEs are used: the\ndamped mass-spring system from a given initial value and the Poisson equation\nfor periodic, Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions. It is shown that the\nproposed new VQA has a reduced gate complexity compared to previous variational\nquantum algorithms, for a similar or better quality of the solution.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
