One of the main drivers\nthat limits the reliability of a GEO satellite is the electric power system,\nand in particular, anomalies related to batteries and degradation of the solar\narrays. Given the high cost and relatively short lifespan of GEO satellites,\nthere has been increased research activity towards developing on-orbit\nservicing systems. However, most of the existing servicing systems are\nexpensive, highly customized, and focus on refueling tasks. On-orbit refueling\ncan be very useful, however, it does not improve satellite reliability which is\ncrucial for long-term missions. Therefore, we propose SSPARE (Space Solar Power\nAutonomously Reconfigurable Elements), a cost-effective, self-servicing power\nsystem. Aside from improving satellite reliability, SSPARE enables to generate\nup to 6 times more power per launch compared to a traditional GEO communication\nsatellite. This study explores why GEO satellites fail and elaborates on the\nSSPARE concept. A comparison of SSPARE against a traditional on-orbit servicing\nmission highlights the benefits of the proposed concept. With humanity striving\nto become more and more Earth-independent, this work aims to build a foundation\nfor future systems such as large solar power farms on-orbit.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
