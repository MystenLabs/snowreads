This study examines the potential of\nquantum simulations to address these challenges, utilizing Noisy Intermediate\nScale Quantum era (NISQ) quantum computational capabilities and quantum error\nmitigation techniques to optimize thermal conductivity calculations. Employing\nthe Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm, we simulate phonon-phonon\ncontributions based on the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE). Our methodology\ninvolves mapping multi-phonon scattering systems to fermionic spin operators,\nnecessitating the creation of a customized ansatz to balance circuit accuracy\nand depth. We construct the system within Fock space using bosonic operators\nand transform the Hamiltonian into the sum of Pauli operators suitable for\nquantum computation. By addressing the impact of depolarization and non-unitary\nnoise effects, we benchmark the noise influence and implement error mitigation\nstrategies to develop a more efficient model for quantum simulations in the\nNISQ era.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
