A classical verification problem for\nprobabilistic programs is temporal inference: to compute the likelihood that\nthe execution traces satisfy a given temporal property. This paper presents a\ngeneral framework for temporal inference, which applies to a rich variety of\nquantitative models including those that arise in the operational semantics of\nprobabilistic and weighted programs.\n  The key idea underlying our framework is that in a variety of existing\napproaches, the main construction that enables temporal inference is that of a\nproduct between the system of interest and the temporal property. We provide a\nunifying mathematical definition of product constructions, enabled by the\nrealisation that 1) both systems and temporal properties can be modelled as\ncoalgebras and 2) product constructions are distributive laws in this context.\nOur categorical framework leads us to our main contribution: a sufficient\ncondition for correctness, which is precisely what enables to use the product\nconstruction for temporal inference.\n  We show that our framework can be instantiated to naturally recover a number\nof disparate approaches from the literature including, e.g., partial expected\nrewards in Markov reward models, resource-sensitive reachability analysis, and\nweighted optimization problems. Further, we demonstrate a product of weighted\nprograms and weighted temporal properties as a new instance to show the\nscalability of our approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
