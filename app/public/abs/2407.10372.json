However, their utility for automated construction of\nlarge-scale spatial models has been limited by gaps in existing modeling\nsoftware packages. MPAT addresses this gap by supporting the development of\nmodular Petri Net models with flexible spatial geometries.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
