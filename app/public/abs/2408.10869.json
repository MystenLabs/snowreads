A single spin coupled to a\nbosonic sub-Ohmic bath exhibits a quantum phase transition at a certain\nstrength of spin-boson coupling. When the bias field is ramped from a large\nvalue to zero at this critical coupling strength, the system initialized at the\nground state ends up with a finite magnetization due to the critical slowing\ndown near the transition. On the basis of the pulse-impulse approximation, we\nderive a scaling law between the residual magnetization and the ramp speed. The\nobtained scaling relation is examined using a numerical simulation based on the\ntensor network. The data are in favor of the scaling law to hold. We discuss\nthe demonstration of our theoretical results by means of quantum simulation\nusing the quantum annealer.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CqprZA4aBPpbXneTD21wK3Lb_YHgdsGmHQVwFvHQIEk","pdfSize":"471014"}
