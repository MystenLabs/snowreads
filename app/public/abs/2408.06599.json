We calculate the eigenfrequencies and\ncorresponding oscillation functions, which show different characteristics in\ndifferent mass regions. In the low-mass region around 1.4 solar mass, the\nradial oscillation frequencies are lowered by large entropy and neutrino\ntrapping, along with a reduction of the average adiabatic index. In the region\nclose to the maximum mass, the fundamental oscillation frequency drops rapidly\nand vanishes at the maximum mass, in accordance with the critical stability\ncriterion $\\partial M /\\partial \\rho_c = 0$, as for cold neutron stars.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"oiuFoK9XZunQFktRrAVI6gpOmRGcJV11jbOoIZAbglY","pdfSize":"363138"}
