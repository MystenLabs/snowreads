However, significant intrinsic\nconstraints stemming from their large feature sizes and low integration density\npose design challenges that hinder their practicality. In this work, we conduct\na holistic exploration of printed neural network accelerators, starting from\nthe analog-to-digital interface - a major area and power sink for sensor\nprocessing applications - and extending to networks of ternary neurons and\ntheir implementation. We propose bespoke ternary neural networks using\napproximate popcount and popcount-compare units, developed through a\nmulti-phase evolutionary optimization approach and interfaced with sensors via\ncustomizable analog-to-binary converters. Our evaluation results show that the\npresented designs outperform the state of the art, achieving at least 6x\nimprovement in area and 19x in power. To our knowledge, they represent the\nfirst open-source digital printed neural network classifiers capable of\noperating with existing printed energy harvesters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Hardware Architecture"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
