It is shown that the resulting dynamics correctly accounts for\nnonreactive charge transfer, reactive non charge transfer and reactive charge\ntransfer processes. In addition, it leads to the formation of triatomic DH2+\nspecies as well.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
