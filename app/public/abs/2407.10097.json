We examine two key\nproperties of thermal operations, the Gibbs preserving property and the\ncovariant property. The state convertibility of a Gibbs preserving operation is\nfully characterized by the second law of thermodynamics with the nonequilibrium\nfree energy. The state convertibility of a covariant operation is shown to be\nfree as long as an initial state has finite coherence. We finally show that\nthese two findings can be combined in the enhanced thermal operation (covariant\nGibbs-preserving operation).\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
