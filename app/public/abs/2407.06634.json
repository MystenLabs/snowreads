Stemming from the\nfact that finite size low-dimensional systems are allowed only to have\nquasi-ordered phase, we consider the self-consistent harmonic approximation to\ncompute the fraction of quasi-condensate and its scaling with the system size.\nIt allows us to understand the important role played by finite size and\ntemperature across the dimensional crossover for deciding the condensate\nnature. Furthermore, we consider a mean-field approximation to compute the\nfinite size effect on the crossover temperature for both weak and strong\ninteraction. All the physical quantities we discuss here provide essential\ninformation for quantum gas at dimensional crossover and are directly\ndetectable in cold atom experiments\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
