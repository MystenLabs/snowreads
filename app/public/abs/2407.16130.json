This is\nwell known in the case of the left regular action on $X=\\Gamma$. This also\ngeneralizes Sako's theorem, which states that exactness of the uniform Roe\nalgebra $\\mathrm{C}^*_{\\mathrm{u}}(X)$ characterizes property A of $X$ when $X$\nis uniformly locally finite.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
