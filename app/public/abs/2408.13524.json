This upper bound generalizes a result from Kobayashi,\nwho established an upper bound for the problem with $f = 0$. We show, that the\nupper bound can be used to establish existence and uniqueness of Euler\nsolutions as limits of solutions of Euler schemes as well as regularity of\nEuler solutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
