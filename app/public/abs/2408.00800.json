To\nenhance the quality and precision of outcomes, additional textual information\nfrom established domain-specific standards is integrated into the ontology for\nprecise descriptions of its concepts and relationships. An experimental study\nassesses the accuracy of generated SPARQL queries, revealing significant\nbenefits of using LLMs for querying ontologies and highlighting areas for\nfuture research.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
