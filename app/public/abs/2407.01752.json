This is particularly significant in the\ncontext of systems that leverage AI technology, such as autonomous driving\nsystems and human-robot interaction. Trust facilitates appropriate utilization\nof these systems, thereby optimizing their potential benefits. If humans\nover-trust or under-trust an AI, serious problems such as misuse and accidents\noccur. To prevent over/under-trust, it is necessary to predict trust dynamics.\nHowever, trust is an internal state of humans and hard to directly observe.\nTherefore, we propose a prediction model for trust dynamics using dynamic\nstructure equation modeling, which extends SEM that can handle time-series\ndata. A path diagram, which shows causalities between variables, is developed\nin an exploratory way and the resultant path diagram is optimized for effective\npath structures. Over/under-trust was predicted with 90\\% accuracy in a drone\nsimulator task,, and it was predicted with 99\\% accuracy in an autonomous\ndriving task. These results show that our proposed method outperformed the\nconventional method including an auto regression family.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
