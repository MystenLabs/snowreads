Burgos-Garc\\'ia and Gidea extended Hill's approach in the CR3BP\nto the spatial equilateral CR4BP, which can be used to approximate the dynamics\nof a small body near a Trojan asteroid of a Sun--planet system. Our main result\nin this paper is that this Hill four-body system also has the contact property.\nIn other words, we can \"contact\" the Trojan. Such a result enables to use\nholomorphic curve techniques and Floer theoretical tools in this dynamical\nsystem in the energy range where the contact property holds.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
