The typical reader, however, perfectly\ninterprets predicate-argument relations in a much wider context than just the\nsentence where the predicate was evoked. In this work, we reformulate the\nproblem of argument detection through textual entailment to capture semantic\nrelations across sentence boundaries. We propose a method that tests whether\nsome semantic relation can be inferred from a full passage by first encoding it\ninto a simple and standalone proposition and then testing for entailment\nagainst the passage. Our method does not require direct supervision, which is\ngenerally absent due to dataset scarcity, but instead builds on existing NLI\nand sentence-level SRL resources. Such a method can potentially explicate\npragmatically understood relations into a set of explicit sentences. We\ndemonstrate it on a recent document-level benchmark, outperforming some\nsupervised methods and contemporary language models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"13L0zCia4Kd0MjhdgCjJMVVtgKs8rWOSPTy3m9hyvK0","pdfSize":"941464"}
