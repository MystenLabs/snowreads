We propose a new task\ncalled 3D reasoning grounding and introduce a new benchmark ScanReason which\nprovides over 10K question-answer-location pairs from five reasoning types that\nrequire the synerization of reasoning and grounding. We further design our\napproach, ReGround3D, composed of the visual-centric reasoning module empowered\nby Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) and the 3D grounding module to\nobtain accurate object locations by looking back to the enhanced geometry and\nfine-grained details from the 3D scenes. A chain-of-grounding mechanism is\nproposed to further boost the performance with interleaved reasoning and\ngrounding steps during inference. Extensive experiments on the proposed\nbenchmark validate the effectiveness of our proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
