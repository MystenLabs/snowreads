However, most of the results are on pure states. Here\nwe consider the property for a class of mixed states, which are the reduced\ndensity matrices of generalized W-class states in multipartite higher\ndimensional systems. First we show the class of mixed states satisfies the\nentanglement polygon inequalities in terms of Tsallis-q entanglement, then we\npropose a class of tighter inequalities for mixed states in terms of Tsallis-q\nentanglement. At last, we get an inequality for the mixed states, which can be\nregarded as a relation for bipartite entanglement.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"t2ojQACLtgQNiDLLlkCxsO8J12ygIoaCierjNe8mFGs","pdfSize":"366295"}
