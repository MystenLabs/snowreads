While numerous deepfake detection\nmethods have been proposed as countermeasures against malicious face swapping,\nthey can only output binary labels (Fake/Real) for distinguishing fake content\nwithout reliable and traceable evidence. To achieve visual forensics and target\nface attribution, we propose a novel task named face retracing, which considers\nretracing the original target face from the given fake one via inverse mapping.\nToward this goal, we propose an IDRetracor that can retrace arbitrary original\ntarget identities from fake faces generated by multiple face swapping methods.\nSpecifically, we first adopt a mapping resolver to perceive the possible\nsolution space of the original target face for the inverse mappings. Then, we\npropose mapping-aware convolutions to retrace the original target face from the\nfake one. Such convolutions contain multiple kernels that can be combined under\nthe control of the mapping resolver to tackle different face swapping mappings\ndynamically. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the IDRetracor exhibits\npromising retracing performance from both quantitative and qualitative\nperspectives.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"DSJzFGX0a1flj5vqsAAjfiRc1Nc-zmJz4ZbCzPGG0Xw","pdfSize":"3926713"}
