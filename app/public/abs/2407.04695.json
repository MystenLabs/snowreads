This field is vexed by the interplay of disorder,\ncorrelations and long-range order, whose properties are challenging to control\nand disentangle. We study the entropy-carrying excitations of a leading\ncandidate in this search, the material NaYbSe$_2$, as a function of site\ndilution to directly address this challenge. We map the evolution of the\nentangled spins across the percolation transition, showing unequivocal evidence\nfor the presence of an energy gap in the excitations of the system. However, we\nalso show that this gap onsets at the percolation transition where disorder is\nthe greatest, strongly suggesting that it is unlikely be associated with a\nquantum spin liquid. Instead we suggest the more universal scenario of a\nshort-range ordered state with entropy-carrying boundaries.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
