This chapter\ncovers some of the pressing challenges encountered when doing research in this\narea, and it is intended to raise questions and provide food for thought for\nthose aiming to enter this research field. The chapter first discusses various\nsources of bias, including data collection, model training, and clinical\ndeployment, and their impact on the fairness of machine learning algorithms in\nmedical image computing. We then turn to discussing open challenges that we\nbelieve require attention from researchers and practitioners, as well as\npotential pitfalls of naive application of common methods in the field. We\ncover a variety of topics including the impact of biased metrics when auditing\nfor fairness, the leveling down effect, task difficulty variations among\nsubgroups, discovering biases in unseen populations, and explaining biases\nbeyond standard demographic attributes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
