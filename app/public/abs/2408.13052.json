Our analysis revealed a transient quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO)\nwith a period of 93$\\pm$2.6 days. We employed a variety of Fourier-based\nmethods, including the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram (LSP) and Weighted Wavelet\nZ-Transform (WWZ), as well as time domain analysis techniques such as Seasonal\nand Non-Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and\nthe Stochastic modeling with Stochastically Driven Damped Harmonic Oscillator\n(SHO) models. Consistently, the QPO with a period of 93 days was detected\nacross all methods used. The observed peak in LSP and time-averaged WWZ plots\nhas a significance level of 4.06$\\sigma$ and 3.96$\\sigma$, respectively. To\nunderstand the source of flux modulations in the light curve, we explored\nvarious physical models. A plausible scenario involves the precession of the\njet with a high Lorentz factor or the movement of a plasma blob along a helical\ntrajectory within the relativistic jet.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
