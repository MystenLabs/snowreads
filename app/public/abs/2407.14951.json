Its utility is significant because in real-world\nscenarios, the exact model equations are unknown. This Letter shows how the\ntheory of dynamical system provides the underlying mechanism behind the\nprediction. Using numerical methods, by considering dynamical systems which\nshow Hopf bifurcation, we demonstrate that the map produced by the reservoir\nafter a successful training undergoes a Neimark-Sacker bifurcation such that\nthe critical point of the map is in immediate proximity to that of the original\ndynamical system. In addition, we have compared and analyzed different\nstructures in the phase space. Our findings provide insight into the\nfunctioning of machine learning algorithms for predicting critical transitions.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
