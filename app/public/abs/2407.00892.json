We also estimate the minimal number\n$N$ such that $\\mathcal{A}= \\sum^N [\\mathcal{A}, \\mathcal{A}][\\mathcal{A},\n\\mathcal{A}]$. Furthermore, if $\\operatorname{char}\\mathbb{D}\\neq 2$, we prove\nthat $\\mathfrak{M}(\\mathbb{D}, m, n, P)$ is additively spanned by Jordan\nproducts of idempotents. For a field $\\mathbb{F}$ with\n$\\operatorname{char}\\mathbb{F}\\neq 2, 3$, we show that the Munn algebra\n$\\mathfrak{M}(\\mathbb{F}, m, n, P)$ is zero product determined and zero Jordan\nproduct determined.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
