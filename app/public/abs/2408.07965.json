However, this becomes a\ndrawback when applied to quantum chemistry calculations for large systems, as\nentangled orbitals often span broad ranges in energy and space, with notably\ninhomogeneous interactions. In this study, we propose addressing strong\nintra-fragment and weak inter-fragment correlations separately using a\nmulti-configurational block interaction product state (BIPS) framework. The\nstrong correlation is captured in electronic states on fragments, considering\nentanglement between fragments and their environments. This method has been\ntested in various chemical systems and shows high accuracy and efficiency in\naddressing inhomogeneous effects in quantum chemistry.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
