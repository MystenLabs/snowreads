A general\nparametrization of the $ \\beta $-function is compared to known $ \\beta\n$-functions for specific theories to fix all coefficients. Three-loop $ \\beta\n$-functions for the cubic coupling and scalar mass terms also follow from the\nresult, which is made available in software packages.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RVz7XQxaijdrZZfETPsLvI_-l_FHqyCu8Yj0NtHJBGU","pdfSize":"346440"}
