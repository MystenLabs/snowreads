In\nprevious studies, Final cooling used absorbers within very high field solenoids\nto cool low-momentum muons. Simulations of the systems did not reach the\ndesired cooling design goals. In this study, we develop and optimize a\ndifferent conceptual design for the final 4D cooling channel, which is based on\nusing dense wedge absorbers. We used G4Beamline to simulate the channel and\nPython to generate and analyze particle distributions. We optimized the design\nparameters of the cooling channel and produced conceptual designs\n(corresponding to possible starting points for the input beam) which achieve\ntransverse cooling in both x and y by a factor of $\\approx$ 3.5. These channels\nachieve a lower transverse and longitudinal emittance than the best previously\npublished design.\n","subjects":["Physics/Accelerator Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
