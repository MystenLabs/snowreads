This work\ndemonstrates that when the matrix coefficients of the equation are\nquasiseparable, the solution also exhibits numerical quasiseparability. This\nproperty enables us to develop two efficient Riccati solvers. The first solver\nis applicable to the general quasiseparable case, while the second is tailored\nto the particular case of banded coefficients. Numerical experiments confirm\nthe effectiveness of the proposed algorithms on both synthetic examples and\ncase studies from the control of partial differential equations and agent-based\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
