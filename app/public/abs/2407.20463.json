The\nThird Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) has started introducing positioning\ntechniques from Release-16 based on time, angle, and signal strength using\nreference signals. However, validating these techniques with experimental\nprototypes is crucial before successful real-world deployment. This work\nprovides useful tools and implementation details that are required in\nperforming 5G positioning experiments with OpenAirInterface (OAI). As an\nexample use case, we present an round trip time (RTT) estimation test-bed based\non OAI and discusses the real-word experiment and measurement process.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
