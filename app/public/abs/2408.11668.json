If the Fermi energy of such a system\nis near these nondispersive states interaction among charge carriers\nsubstantially impacts their electronic structure. The emergence of magnetism in\nthese surface states is one of the possible consequences. Ca3P2 an already\nsynthesized material possesses a remarkably large nodal loop which is situated\nexactly at the Fermi level of the bulk system. In the present work, we\ninvestigate how surface magnetism is impacted by surface reconstruction and\nlattice termination in finite slabs in this material. We show that a slight\ndeviation from the stoichiometric occupation of Ca sites results in the\nstabilization of magnetic patterns.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
