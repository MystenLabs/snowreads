But the situation is not so clear when we consider multi-colourings\nof graphs. A graph is $(n,k)$-colourable if we can assign each vertex a\n$k$-subset of $\\{1,2,\\ldots,n\\}$ so that adjacent vertices receive disjoint\nsubsets. In this note we consider the following problem: if a graph is\n$(n,k)$-colourable, then for what pairs $(n', k')$ is it also\n$(n',k')$-colourable? This question can be translated into a question regarding\nmulti-colourings of Kneser graphs, for which Stahl formulated a conjecture in\n1976. We present new results, strengthen existing results, and in particular\npresent much simpler proofs of several known cases of the conjecture.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
