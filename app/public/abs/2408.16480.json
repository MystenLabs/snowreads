This paper proposes a\nsystematic convex optimization approach to studying and generating\nconcentration inequalities with independent random variables. Specifically, we\nextend the generalized problem of moments to independent random variables.\n  We first introduce a variational approach that extends classical\nmoment-generating functions, focusing particularly on first-order moment\nconditions. Second, we develop a polynomial approach, based on a hierarchy of\nsum-of-square approximations, to extend these techniques to higher-moment\nconditions. Building on these advancements, we refine Hoeffding's, Bennett's\nand Bernstein's inequalities, providing improved worst-case guarantees compared\nto existing results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
