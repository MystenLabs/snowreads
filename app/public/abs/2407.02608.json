In\ncontrast, even in the narrow setting of terminal singularities of dimension 3,\nwe show that Cohen-Macaulayness can fail in characteristic $p$ or mixed\ncharacteristic $(0,p)$ for $p$ equal to 2, 3, or 5. This is optimal, by work of\nArvidsson-Bernasconi-Lacini.\n  The examples are quotients of regular schemes by the cyclic group $G$ of\norder $p$. In characteristic $p$ or mixed characteristic, such quotients can\nexhibit a wide range of behavior. Our key technical tool is a sufficient\ncondition for quotients by $G$ to have only toric singularities.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
