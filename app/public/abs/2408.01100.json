In this article, we examine the\nconcept of 1-absorbing prime elements in C-lattices. We investigate the\nC-lattices in which every element is a finite product of 1-absorbing prime\nelements (we denote them as OAFLs for short). Moreover, we study C-lattices\nhaving 2-absorbing factorization (we denote them as TAFLs for short).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Commutative Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
