This\npaper proposes a novel space adaptive search (SAS) approach that greatly\nreduces the computation cost of nonholonomic mobile robot path planning. The\nclassic search-based path planning only updates the state on the current\nlocation in each step, which is very inefficient, and, therefore, can easily be\ntrapped by local minimum. The SAS updates not only the state of the current\nlocation, but also all states in the neighborhood, and the size of the\nneighborhood is adaptively varied based on the clearance around the current\nlocation at each step. Since a great deal of states can be immediately updated,\nthe search can explore the local minimum and get rid of it very fast. As a\nresult, the proposed approach can effectively deal with clustered environments\nwith a large number of local minima. The SAS also utilizes a set of predefined\nmotion primitives, and dynamically scales them into different sizes during the\nsearch to create various new primitives with differing sizes and curvatures.\nThis greatly promotes the flexibility of the search of path planning in more\ncomplex environments. Unlike the A* family, which uses heuristic to accelerate\nthe search, the experiments shows that the SAS requires much less computation\ntime and memory cost even without heuristic than the weighted A* algorithm,\nwhile still preserving the optimality of the produced path. However, the SAS\ncan also be applied together with heuristic or other path planning algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
