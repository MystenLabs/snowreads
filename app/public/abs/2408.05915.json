One of the key features of a heterojunction is the proper band\nalignment between the two materials. Estimation of the correct relative band\npositions with density functional theory (DFT) based electronic structure\ncalculations is often constrained by the accuracy and cost associated with the\nvarious DFT functionals. In this study, we introduce a novel computational\napproach that achieves band alignments closely matching experimental results\nwith the widely used PBE functional. We specifically examine the\nwell-documented MoO3/MoS2 system, a type-II heterojunction. In our setup, the\nMoS2 layers are kept as it is but for MoO3 the individual layers are chosen\ndifferently. These alternative layers have higher surface energy, and hence,\nthe band edges are higher than the conventional layers. This shift in band\nedges of the alternative MoO3 layers changes the band alignment in MoO3/MoS2\nheterojunction from type-III to the experimentally observed type-II character.\nWe also extend this computational strategy to additional systems, demonstrating\nits versatility and effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"lE8G86o2LiX0JgSARGA0rOc_ECn7_x1JLBCO70L5pMk","pdfSize":"2695950"}
