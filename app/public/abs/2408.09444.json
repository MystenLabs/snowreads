We classify various WCCC violation scenarios proposed in\nrecent decades, including Hubeny, mixed, and the latest Sorce-Wald (SW). We\nprovide general formulae in each case, and resolve contradictions in numerous\nstudies. Following SW type, our analysis reveals that WCCC depends on the sign\nchoice of the parameter $W\\equiv \\big(\\frac{\\partial S}{\\partial T}\\big)_{Q_i;\nT=0}$ of the extremal black holes. $W > 0$ preserves WCCC and $W < 0$ would\nindicate potential violation. We show explicitly that $W>0$ for\nspherically-symmetric and static black holes, and for general case, we argue\nthat it is protected by the black hole no-hair theorem. We also consider\nasymptotically-(A)dS black holes and argue that there can be no violation\neither.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"-s8GpRsyffaXhIqzgEgINtpDLbwsKHoMlpbAuU6aWEU","pdfSize":"234500"}
