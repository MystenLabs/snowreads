Key initiatives driving this transformation\nincluded Plan V\\'elo I and II, during which the city created over 1,000\nkilometres of new bike paths to encourage cycling. For this, substantial road\ncapacity has been removed from the system. This transformation provides a\nunique opportunity to investigate the impact of the large-scale network\nre-configuration on the network-wide traffic flow. Using the Network\nFundamental Diagram (NFD) and a re-sampling methodology for its estimation, we\ninvestigate with empirical loop detector data from 2010 and 2023 the impact on\nthe network's capacity, critical density, and free-flow speed resulting from\nthese policy interventions. We find that in the urban core with the most policy\ninterventions, per lane capacity decreased by over 50%, accompanied by a 60%\ndrop in free-flow speed. Similarly, in the zone with fewer interventions,\ncapacity declined by 34%, with a 40% reduction in free-flow speed. While these\nchanges seem substantial, the NFDs show that overall congestion did not\nincrease, indicating a modal shift to other modes of transport and hence\npresumably more sustainable urban mobility.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"J_-OUaftVwlbeutFvfnvLkgZ7TYBT2LXspuby_r3n5A","pdfSize":"29603121"}
