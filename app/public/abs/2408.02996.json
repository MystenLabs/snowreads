In 2021, we\ndiscovered a novel size effect with a period of 25 {\\AA} on strongly correlated\ncompound CaRuO_3. The change in film thickness of only one nanometer leads to\nan increase in electrical resistivity at 4 K by a factor of several billion.\nHowever, the excitation energy of 2.4 eV on insulating CaRuO_3 is too large to\nexplain the mechanism by conventional quantum well. In this study, we clarify\nthat the increases in electrical resistivity are accompanied by lattice\nexpansion and caused by the Mott transitions. We measured in-plane X-ray\ndiffraction on CaRuO_3 films and found a 24.8 {\\AA} periodic thickness\noscillation of the lattice spacing d_{(004)}. We determined the nesting vector\nfrom the Fermi surface and revealed the spin density wave with a period\nequivalent to the size effect. We concluded that the antiferromagnetic\ncorrelation appearing in the boundary conditions triggers the periodic Mott\ninsulators depending on the film thickness. We refer to the remarkable size\neffect stemming from strong electron correlation as the 'Mott size effect'.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
