These simulations involve solving numerous\nlarge and complex linear systems arising from the implicit Finite Volume (FV)\ndiscretization of PDEs governing subsurface fluid flow. Compounded with highly\ndetailed geomodels, solving linear systems is computationally and memory\nexpensive, and accounts for the majority of the simulation time. Modern memory\nhierarchies are insufficient to meet the latency and bandwidth needs of\nlarge-scale numerical simulations. Therefore, exploring algorithms that can\nleverage alternative and balanced paradigms, such as dataflow and in-memory\ncomputing is crucial. This work introduces a matrix-free algorithm to solve\nFV-based linear systems using a dataflow architecture to significantly minimize\nmemory latency and bandwidth bottlenecks. Our implementation achieves two\norders of magnitude speedup compared to a GPGPU-based reference implementation,\nand up to 1.2 PFlops on a single dataflow device.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
