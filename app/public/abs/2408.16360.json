We use the complex coordinate rotation method to properly\naccount for the resonant nature of the states. Our calculations show that some\nof the states are not stable with respect to collisional quenching in a dense\nhelium target and should not be detected in the experiment.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rSn56heXeUR40TWY7uc12vekJRH-df39LvoqvH1fGII","pdfSize":"105274"}
