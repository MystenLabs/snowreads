In this paper, we introduce a novel filtering method\nfor graph-based signals by employing ideas from topological data analysis. We\nbegin by working with signals over general graphs and then extend our approach\nto what we term signals over graphs with faces. To construct the filter, we\nintroduce a new structure called the Basin Hierarchy Tree, which encodes the\npersistent homology. We provide an efficient algorithm and demonstrate the\neffectiveness of our approach through examples with synthetic and real\ndatasets. This work bridges topological data analysis and signal processing,\npresenting a new application of persistent homology as a topological data\nprocessing tool.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
