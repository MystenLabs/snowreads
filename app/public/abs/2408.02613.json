Kr\"atzel and the results of\nG. Kuba. On the other hand, for the cases 0 < p < 2, the method via this series\nrepresentation cannot make progress. Therefore, in such cases, it is necessary\nto consider another method. In this paper, we prove that certain functions\nclosely related to the problems can be displayed as series by newly generalized\nBessel functions based on the property p-radial, generalization of spherical\nsymmetry, and highlight the possibility that attempts to solve the problems via\nthis display are suitable especially for the cases 0 < p < 1 or p=1. This study\nis based on the harmonic-analytic method by S. Kuratsubo and E. Nakai, using\ncertain functions generalizing the error term of the circle problem by\nvariables and series representation of the functions by the Bessel functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
