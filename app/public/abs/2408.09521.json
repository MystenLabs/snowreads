We find that the shape of the\nCMB $EB$ angular power spectrum is sensitive to the background cosmological\nparameters. Unlike previous articles which fix the background cosmology and fit\n% \\lu{with fitting} the coupling constant and rotation angles, we run Markov\nchain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations to fit the $\\Lambda$CDM + EDE parameters\nsimultaneously. We find that the EDE model with $n$=3 can provide a good fit to\nthe observed CMB $EB$ spectra, consistent with a Hubble constant value that is\nin good agreement with the locally measured value. Our result is the first to\nshow that axion-like EDE can provide a unified explanation for the observed\ncosmic birefringence and the Hubble tension.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
