Counter-intuitively, this frequency downconversion\nreduces noise and transmission losses. We introduce a multi-octave\nasymmetrically threaded SQUID circuit (MOATS) capable of the required\nefficient, high-rate transduction. For a 100-meter cable with $Q_i = 10^5$ at\n10 mK, our approach achieves single-photon fidelities of 0.962 at 200 MHz\nversus 0.772 at 8 GHz, and triples the lower bound on quantum channel capacity.\nThis method enables kilometer-scale quantum links while maintaining high\nfidelities, combining improved performance with the practical advantages of\nflexible, compact coaxial cables.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
