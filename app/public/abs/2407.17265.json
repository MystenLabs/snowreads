Imaging biomarkers obtained from\nmagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans can predict the functional recovery of\nindividuals with SCI and help choose the optimal treatment strategy. Currently,\nmost studies employ manual quantification of these MRI-derived biomarkers,\nwhich is a subjective and tedious task. In this work, we propose (i) a\nuniversal tool for the automatic segmentation of intramedullary SCI lesions,\ndubbed \\texttt{SCIsegV2}, and (ii) a method to automatically compute the width\nof the tissue bridges from the segmented lesion. Tissue bridges represent the\nspared spinal tissue adjacent to the lesion, which is associated with\nfunctional recovery in SCI patients. The tool was trained and validated on a\nheterogeneous dataset from 7 sites comprising patients from different SCI\nphases (acute, sub-acute, and chronic) and etiologies (traumatic SCI, ischemic\nSCI, and degenerative cervical myelopathy). Tissue bridges quantified\nautomatically did not significantly differ from those computed manually,\nsuggesting that the proposed automatic tool can be used to derive relevant MRI\nbiomarkers. \\texttt{SCIsegV2} and the automatic tissue bridges computation are\nopen-source and available in Spinal Cord Toolbox (v6.4 and above) via the\n\\texttt{sct\\_deepseg -task seg\\_sc\\_lesion\\_t2w\\_sci} and\n\\texttt{sct\\_analyze\\_lesion} functions, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VRYY7R4LPi6QK4cCMfBgyFgXAtOKqpGaxNax0dwrC8U","pdfSize":"2036455"}
