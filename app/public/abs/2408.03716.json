For\nbiological samples such as cysts of cells, however, the observed\nforce-displacement relation cannot be expected to follow predictions for simple\nmaterials. Here, by solving the Pogorelov problem of a point force indenting an\nelastic shell for a purely nonlinear material, we discover that complex\nmaterial behaviour can even give rise to new scaling exponents in this\nforce-displacement relation. In finite-element simulations, we show that these\nexponents are surprisingly robust, persisting even for thick shells indented\nwith a sphere. By scaling arguments, we generalise our results to pressurised\nand pre-stressed shells, uncovering additional new scaling exponents. We find\nthese predicted scaling exponents in the force-displacement relation observed\nin cyst indentation experiments. Our results thus form the basis for inferring\nthe mechanisms that set the mechanical properties of these biological\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Tissues and Organs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
