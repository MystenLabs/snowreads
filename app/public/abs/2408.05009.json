This technique probes\nthe photoluminescence decays upon a periodic excitation by short laser pulses.\nHerein, we demonstrate that this approach cannot directly detect hidden\nphotoexcitations with much slower dynamics than the photoluminescence decay. We\ndemonstrate a new method based on a multi-pulse excitation scheme that enables\nan unambiguous detection and an easily interpreted tracking of these hidden\nspecies. The multi-pulse excitation consists of a single pulse (Read) followed\nby a burst of many closely separated pulses (Write) and finally another single\npulse (Read). To illustrate the efficacy of the Read-Write-Read excitation\nscheme, we apply it to metal halide perovskites to directly visualize carrier\ntrapping, extract the concentration of trapped charges and determine the rate\nconstant of trap depopulation. The developed approach allows studying\nperformance-limiting processes in energy devices using a versatile, highly\napplicable all-optical method.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Chemical Physics","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mrUWjKYns1T9g6pPPn8FlNYGrmCzy0yKdcVwk0U7JCA","pdfSize":"2919359"}
