However, it is challenging for\nusers to discern whether the responses are generated with certainty or are\nfabricated to meet user expectations. Estimating the uncertainty of LLMs is\nparticularly challenging due to their vast scale and the lack of white-box\naccess. In this work, we propose a novel Uncertainty Tripartite Testing\nParadigm (Unc-TTP) to classify LLM uncertainty, via evaluating the consistency\nof LLM outputs when incorporating label interference into the sampling-based\napproach. Based on Unc-TTP outputs, we aggregate instances into certain and\nuncertain categories. Further, we conduct a detailed analysis of the\nuncertainty properties of LLMs and show Unc-TTP's superiority over the existing\nsampling-based methods. In addition, we leverage the obtained uncertainty\ninformation to guide in-context example selection, demonstrating that Unc-TTP\nobviously outperforms retrieval-based and sampling-based approaches in\nselecting more informative examples. Our work paves a new way to classify the\nuncertainty of both open- and closed-source LLMs, and introduces a practical\napproach to exploit this uncertainty to improve LLMs performance.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
