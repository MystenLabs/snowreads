The approach\ninvokes a general functional form that accurately describes $g(t) \\equiv\n\\langle (\\Delta x(t))^{2} \\rangle$ for all times at which $g(t)$ was measured,\nand that gives values for the logarithmic derivative of $g(t)$ for the same\ntimes. By these means we can readily distinguish between regimes in which\n$g(t)$ follows a power law in time, does not follow a power law in time, or has\nan inflection point. In a power-law regime, the method accurately determines\nthe exponent, without imposing any assumption as to the exponent's value.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
