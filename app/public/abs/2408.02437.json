We employ this fact, to extend the definition of localisation\noperators to symbols $a$ having very fast super-exponential growth by allowing\nthem to be mappings from ${\\mathcal D}^{\\{M_p\\}}(\\mathbb R^d)$ into ${\\mathcal\nD}'^{\\{M_p\\}}(\\mathbb R^d)$, where $M_p$, $p\\in\\mathbb N$, is a\nnon-quasi-analytic Gevrey type sequence. By choosing the windows $\\varphi_1$\nand $\\varphi_2$ appropriately, our main results show that one can consider\nsymbols with growth in position space of the form $\\exp(\\exp(l|\\cdot|^q))$,\n$l,q>0$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
