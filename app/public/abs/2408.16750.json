So far,\nhowever, this could only be verified in the context of conformal field\ntheories. Here we present an exact confirmation of this expectation in a class\nof interacting microscopic Floquet systems on the lattice, i.e., dual-unitary\ncircuits. These systems can either have zero or a super extensive number of\nconserved charges: the latter case is achieved via fine-tuning. We show that,\nfor almost all dual unitary circuits the asymptotic entanglement dynamics\nagrees with what is expected for chaotic systems. On the other hand, if we\nrequire the systems to have conserved charges, we find that the entanglement\ndisplays the qualitatively different behaviour expected for integrable systems.\nInterestingly, despite having many conserved charges, charge-conserving\ndual-unitary circuits are in general not Yang-Baxter integrable.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
