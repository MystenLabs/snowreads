In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to solving\nparameterized models of cardiac action potentials by combining meta-learning\ntechniques with Systems Biology-Informed Neural Networks (SBINNs). The proposed\nmethod, HyperSBINN, effectively addresses the challenge of predicting the\neffects of various compounds at different concentrations on cardiac action\npotentials, outperforming traditional differential equation solvers in speed.\nOur model efficiently handles scenarios with limited data and complex\nparameterized differential equations. The HyperSBINN model demonstrates robust\nperformance in predicting APD90 values, indicating its potential as a reliable\ntool for modeling cardiac electrophysiology and aiding in preclinical drug\ndevelopment. This framework represents an advancement in computational\nmodeling, offering a scalable and efficient solution for simulating and\nunderstanding complex biological systems.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
