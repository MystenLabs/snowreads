This model enables us to learn pose by\nperforming shape representation at a target pose from RGB image input. We\nperform shape representation as an auxiliary task which helps us in learning\nrotations space for an object based on 2D images. An image encoder predicts the\nrotation in the embedding space and the DeepSDF based decoder learns to\nrepresent the object's shape at the given pose. As our approach is shape based,\nthe pipeline is suitable for any type of object irrespective of the symmetry.\nMoreover, we need only a CAD model of the objects to train SABER. Our pipeline\nis synthetic data based and can also handle symmetric objects without symmetry\nlabels and, thus, no additional labeled training data is needed. The\nexperimental evaluation shows that our method achieves close to benchmark\nresults for both symmetric objects and asymmetric objects on Occlusion-LineMOD,\nand T-LESS datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-iaqW4BEBC6-MmS1ZFzrdyxO9qXs8aKvhoBpLQYJf-o","pdfSize":"1370031"}
