In this study, we address\nthe role of metallization technique by fabricating prototypical metal/Nb-doped\nSrTiO$_3$ (M/NSTO) Schottky contacts via Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD).\nUltrathin Pt and Au electrodes are deposited by PLD onto single-crystal\n(001)-terminated NSTO substrates and interfacial transport is characterized by\nconventional macroscale methods and nanoscale Ballistic Electron Emission\nMicroscopy. We show that PLD metallization gives Schottky contacts with highly\nreversible current-voltage characteristics under cyclic polarization.\nRoom-temperature transport is governed by thermionic emission with Schottky\nbarrier height $\\phi_B$(Pt/NSTO)=0.71-0.75eV, $\\phi_B$(Au/NSTO)=0.70-0.83eV and\nideality factors as small as n(Pt/NSTO)=1.1 and n(Au/NSTO)=1.6. RS remains\nalmost completely suppressed upon imposing broad variations of the Nb doping\nand of the external stimuli (polarization bias, working temperature, ambient\nair exposure). At the nanoscale, we find that both systems display high spatial\nhomogeneity of $\\phi_B$(<50meV), which is only partially affected by the NSTO\nmixed termination (|$\\phi_B$ (M/SrO) - $\\phi_B$ (M/TiO$_2$)|<35meV).\nExperimental evidences and theoretical arguments indicate that the PLD\nmetallization mitigates interfacial layer effects responsible for RS. This\noccurs thanks either to a reduction of the interfacial layer thickness and to\nthe creation of an effective barrier against the permeation of ambient gas\nspecies affecting charge trapping and redox reactions. This description allows\nto rationalize interfacial aging effects, observed upon several-months-exposure\nto ambient air, in terms of interfacial re-oxidation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
