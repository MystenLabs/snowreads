As an\napplication, we prove superrigidity for algebraic groups over fields with\nnon-Archimedean valuation, thereby generalizing the rank 1 $p$-adic\nsuperrigidity results of Gromov and Schoen and casting the Bader-Furman\ngeneralization of Margulis' higher rank superrigidity result in a geometric\nsetting. We also prove an existence theorem for a pluriharmonic map from a\nK\\\"ahler manifold to a Euclidean building.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZPiAJbR5xLg2pNmnuRxcrnx6nH47eAKH9aGRoFEDNg4","pdfSize":"1445052"}
