They\noffer an advantage over traditional numerical methods for high-dimensional,\nparametric, and data-driven problems. However, they perform poorly on problems\nwhere the solution exhibits high frequencies, such as discontinuities or sharp\ngradients. In this work, we develop a PINN-based solver for modeling\nthree-dimensional, transient and static, parametric electromagnetic problems in\ndiscontinuous media. We use the first-order Maxwell's equations to train the\nneural network. We use a level-set function to represent the interface with a\ncontinuous function, and to enrich the network's inputs with high-frequencies\nand interface information. Finally, we validate the proposed methodology on\nmultiple 3D, parametric, static, and transient problems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"mwbILBHY5D6gOm32tGHUu6TPDKCJTIM3g_RHsi6thZc","pdfSize":"2360447"}
