The resulting MCSCF/FQ\napproach is validated by exploiting the CASSCF scheme through application to\ncompute vertical excitation energies of formaldehyde and para-nitroaniline in\naqueous solution. The procedure is integrated with molecular dynamics\nsimulations to capture the solute's conformational changes and the dynamic\naspects of solvation. Comparative analysis with alternative solvent models,\ngas-phase calculations, and experimental data provides insights into the\nmodel's accuracy in reproducing solute-solvent molecular interactions and\nspectral signals.\n","subjects":["Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
