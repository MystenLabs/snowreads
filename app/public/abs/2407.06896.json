These simple transformations enhance the\nquality of results from HMC calculations without compromising the speed of the\nalgorithm. This method enables us to efficiently calculate systems that are\notherwise inaccessible due to a severe sign problem. To support this claim, we\npresent observables of the C20 and C60 fullerenes. Furthermore, we demonstrate\nthat at a certain offset, the sign problem is completely lifted in the limit of\nlarge chemical potential.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
