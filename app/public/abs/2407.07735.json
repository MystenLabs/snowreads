With the rising prominence and influence of NeRF, safeguarding\nits intellectual property has become increasingly important. In this paper, we\npropose \\textbf{NeRFProtector}, which adopts a plug-and-play strategy to\nprotect NeRF's copyright during its creation. NeRFProtector utilizes a\npre-trained watermarking base model, enabling NeRF creators to embed binary\nmessages directly while creating their NeRF. Our plug-and-play property ensures\nNeRF creators can flexibly choose NeRF variants without excessive\nmodifications. Leveraging our newly designed progressive distillation, we\ndemonstrate performance on par with several leading-edge neural rendering\nmethods.
