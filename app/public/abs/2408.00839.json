N-body simulations,\nwhich exclusively model dark matter and its purely gravitational interactions,\nrepresent a less resource-intensive alternative, however, they do not model\ngalaxies, and as such cannot directly be compared to observations. In this\nstudy, we use conditional score-based models to learn a mapping from N-body to\nhydrodynamical simulations, specifically from dark matter density fields to the\nobservable distribution of galaxies. We demonstrate that our model is capable\nof generating galaxy fields statistically consistent with hydrodynamical\nsimulations at a fraction of the computational cost, and demonstrate our\nemulator is significantly more precise than traditional emulators over the\nscales 0.36 $h\\ \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$ $\\leq$ k $\\leq$ 3.88 $h\\ \\text{Mpc}^{-1}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u-_AauDGPD2h_-_c94Twpas7OgpebA8L4ILQfnnIqbU","pdfSize":"1684962"}
