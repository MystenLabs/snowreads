At low energies, this leads to a conformal interface separating two CFTs\nwhich are related by RG flow. We set up the large $N$ expansion of these models\nby employing a Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation over half space, and use\nthis approach to compute some of the defect CFT data. We also calculate the\nfree energy of the theory in the case of spherical interface, which encodes a\nconformal anomaly coefficient for even dimensional interface, and the analog of\nthe $g$-function for odd-dimensional interface. These models have a dual\ndescription in terms of a gravitational theory in AdS where a bulk scalar field\nsatisfies different boundary conditions on each half of the AdS boundary. We\nreview this construction and show that the results of the large $N$ expansion\non the CFT side are in precise agreement with the holographic predictions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZEWffMPbq5L3kKHv51iKaRUTBf0TcZAmOmxvlDSM2Gk","pdfSize":"1576061"}
