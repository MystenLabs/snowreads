Disks can drive\nbinaries into wider and more eccentric orbits, while gravitational waves harden\nand circularise them. We combine cutting-edge evolution prescriptions for\ndisk-driven binaries with well-known equations for gravitational-wave-driven\nevolution, and study the evolution of stellar-mass binary black holes. We find\nthat binaries are driven by their disk to an equilibrium eccentricity,\n$0.2\\lesssim e_\\mathrm{eq} \\lesssim0.5$, that dominates their evolution. Once\nthey transition to the GW-dominated regime their eccentricity decreases\nrapidly; we find that stellar-mass binary black holes with long-lived disks\nwill likely be observed in LISA with detectable eccentricities $\\sim 10^{-2}$\nat $0.01$ Hz, with the precise value closely correlating with the binary's\ninitial mass ratio. This may lead stellar-mass binary black holes with CBDs\nobserved in LISA to be confused with dynamically-formed binary black holes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"R8bU0J4z-_etUpTDx30DRfD3xnmMFpnt67LMWQ453xM","pdfSize":"515344"}
