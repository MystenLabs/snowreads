The structure of\nconstraints and symplectic potentials primarily dictates the strong-weak dual\ncoupling sectors of the theory, ensuring the equivalence of the Noether and\ntopological currents. It is computed analytical fermion excited bound states\nlocalized on the kink, accounting for back-reaction. The total energy depends\non the topological charge parameters for kink-fermion system satisfying first\norder differential equations and chiral current conservation equation. Our\nresults demonstrate that the excited fermion bound states significantly alter\nthe properties of the kink, and notably resulting in a pumping mechanism for\nthe topological charge of the in-gap kink due to fermionic back-reaction, as\nwell as the appearance of kink states in the continuum (KIC).\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"WUpgVn2Sw533g5feOwzGtKDijhTEflJYp1pY35GaAbI","pdfSize":"535697"}
