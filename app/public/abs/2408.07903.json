A fundamental first\nstep towards this goal is particle detection. Given the small size of the\nparticles, their detection is greatly affected by image noise. Recent studies\nhave shown that applying image denoising as a preprocessing step indeed\nimproves particle detection and their subsequent tracking. Deep learning based\nparticle detection methods have shown superior results compared to traditional\ndetection methods. However, they do not explicitly aim to remove noise from the\nimages to facilitate detection. Thus we hypothesize that their performance\ncould be further improved. In this paper, we propose a new deep neural network,\ncalled DENODET (denoising-detection network), which performs image denoising\nand particle detection simultaneously. We show that integrative denoising and\ndetection yields more accurate detection results. Our method achieves superior\nresults compared to state-of-the-art particle detection methods on the particle\ntracking challenge dataset and our own real fluorescence microscopy image data.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
