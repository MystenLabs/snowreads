Such surfaces\ncome equipped with an involution, known as a Prym involution. They were\noriginally discovered by McMullen and only arise in genus 2, 3 and 4. Moreover,\nthey are classified by two invariants: discriminant and spin.\n  We study how the fixed points for the Prym involution of Weierstrass Prym\neigenforms are permuted. In previous work, the authors computed the permutation\ngroup induced by affine transformations in the case of genus 2, showing that\nthey are dihedral groups depending only on the residue class modulo 8 of the\ndiscriminant $D$. In this work, we complete this classification by settling the\ncase of genus 3, showing that the permutation group induced by the affine group\non the set of its three (regular) fixed points is isomorphic to\n$\\mathrm{Sym}_2$ when $D$ is even and a quadratic residue modulo 16, and to\n$\\mathrm{Sym}_3$ otherwise. The case of genus 4 is trivial as the Pyrm\ninvolution fixes a single (regular) point. In both cases, these same groups\narise when considering only parabolic elements of the affine group.\n  By recent work of Freedman, when the Teichm\\\"uller curve induced by\nWeierstrass Prym eigenform is not arithmetic, the fixed points of the Prym\ninvolution coincide with the periodic points of the surface. Hence, in this\ncase, our result also classifies how periodic points are permuted.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
