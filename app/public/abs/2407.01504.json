They capture the\nquality of a set of trade-off solutions by reducing it to a scalar number. One\nof the most commonly used set-based metrics is the R2 indicator, which\ndescribes the expected utility of a solution set to a decision-maker under a\ndistribution of utility functions. Typically, this indicator is applied by\ndiscretizing this distribution of utility functions, yielding a weakly\nPareto-compliant indicator. In consequence, adding a nondominated or dominating\nsolution to a solution set may - but does not have to - improve the indicator's\nvalue.\n  In this paper, we reinvestigate the R2 indicator under the premise that we\nhave a continuous, uniform distribution of (Tchebycheff) utility functions. We\nanalyze its properties in detail, demonstrating that this continuous variant is\nindeed Pareto-compliant - that is, any beneficial solution will improve the\nmetric's value. Additionally, we provide an efficient computational procedure\nto compute this metric for bi-objective problems in $\\mathcal O (N \\log N)$. As\na result, this work contributes to the state-of-the-art Pareto-compliant unary\nperformance metrics, such as the hypervolume indicator, offering an efficient\nand promising alternative.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
