Most schemes proposed\nor implemented for the generation of such modes are probabilistic in nature and\nrely on heralding by detection of a photon or on conditional methods where\nphotons are separated from the original field mode by a beam splitter. In this\nLetter we demonstrate theoretically, using a cascaded-quantum-systems model,\nthe possibility of deterministic generation of Wigner-negativity in temporal\nmodes of the steady-state emission of a two-level system driven by\nfinite-bandwidth quadrature-squeezed light. Optimal negativity is obtained for\na squeezing bandwidth similar to the linewidth of the transition of the\ntwo-level system. While the Wigner distribution associated with the incident\nsqueezed light is Gaussian and everywhere positive, the Wigner functions of the\noutgoing temporal modes show distinct similarities and overlap with a\nsuperposition of displaced squeezed states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
