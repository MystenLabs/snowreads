It contains about 860K code\nfunctions and more than 2.7M related comments from 12 open-source projects. To\nthe best of our knowledge, no such dataset is publicly available. MADE-WIC aims\nto provide researchers with a curated dataset on which to test and compare\ntools designed for the detection of code weaknesses and technical debt. As we\nhave fused existing datasets, researchers have the possibility to evaluate the\nperformance of their tools by also controlling the bias related to the\nannotation definition and dataset construction.
