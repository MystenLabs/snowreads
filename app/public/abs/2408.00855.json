However, conventional image search methods often yield\nirrelevant results, impeding the design process. Moreover, creating and\ncoloring sketches can be time-consuming and demanding, acting as a bottleneck\nin the design workflow. In this work, we introduce HAIGEN (Human-AI\nCollaboration for GENeration), an efficient fashion design system for Human-AI\ncollaboration developed to aid designers. Specifically, HAIGEN consists of four\nmodules. T2IM, located in the cloud, generates reference inspiration images\ndirectly from text prompts. With three other modules situated locally, the I2SM\nbatch generates the image material library into a certain designer-style sketch\nmaterial library. The SRM recommends similar sketches in the generated library\nto designers for further refinement, and the STM colors the refined sketch\naccording to the styles of inspiration images. Through our system, any designer\ncan perform local personalized fine-tuning and leverage the powerful generation\ncapabilities of large models in the cloud, streamlining the entire design\ndevelopment process. Given that our approach integrates both cloud and local\nmodel deployment schemes, it effectively safeguards design privacy by avoiding\nthe need to upload personalized data from local designers. We validated the\neffectiveness of each module through extensive qualitative and quantitative\nexperiments. User surveys also confirmed that HAIGEN offers significant\nadvantages in design efficiency, positioning it as a new generation of aid-tool\nfor designers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
