Unfortunately, the consumer blockchain often\naccepts these results without executing the smart contracts for validation,\nposing potential security risks. To address this, we propose a method for\nvalidating cross-chain smart contract results. Our approach emphasizes consumer\nblockchain execution of cross-chain smart contracts of producer blockchain,\nallowing comparison of results with the transmitted ones to detect potential\ndiscrepancies and ensure data integrity during cross-chain data dissemination.\nAdditionally, we introduce the confirmation with proof method, which involves\nincorporating the chain of blocks and relevant cross-chain smart contract data\nfrom the producer blockchain into the consumer blockchain as evidence (or\nproof), establishing a unified and secure perspective of cross-chain smart\ncontract results. Our verification results highlight the feasibility of\ncross-chain validation at the smart contract level.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OFev9sUiksdWd9JFmxPbK4uoLU9R2F7J80UB2i70uOw","pdfSize":"586036"}
