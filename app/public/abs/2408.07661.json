In their unconstrained form, graph neural networks fall into this\ncategory, and they have further limited abilities to handle heterogeneous data.\nTo overcome these limitations, an approach is proposed, called IGNH\n(Interpretable Graph Neural Network for Heterogeneous tabular data), which\nhandles both categorical and numerical features, while constraining the\nlearning process to generate exact feature attributions together with the\npredictions. A large-scale empirical investigation is presented, showing that\nthe feature attributions provided by IGNH align with Shapley values that are\ncomputed post hoc. Furthermore, the results show that IGNH outperforms two\npowerful machine learning algorithms for tabular data, Random Forests and\nTabNet, while reaching a similar level of performance as XGBoost.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
