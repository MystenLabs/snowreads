We derive a\ntargeted mapping from the quantum to the classical Hamiltonian to realize this\nphenomenon in a dynamically stable form. As a result, fast wavepackets of any\nfrequency supported by the lattice are propagating in time domain with a\nnon-growing amplitude. We demonstrate the system experimentally in a\ntopoelectrical metamaterial, where the non-Hermiticity is generated by embedded\noperational amplifiers in a feedback setup. Our design paves the way to realize\nincreased group velocities, and other wave phenomena inspired by quantum\nsystems in a form that preserves the original system properties, while\nsupporting an inherently stable dynamics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
