However, the quantities involved in the relations\nare, in fact, normalized by a parameter $M_0$ that arises in the usual\nperturbative analytical approach as the mass of the background configuration.\nSince $M_0$ is not the mass of the rotating star $M_S$, it is not an\nobservational quantity, which may affect the application of the relations to\nactual observations. This situation is usually ignored in most studies by\ntaking $M_0$ to be the mass of the star, an approximation that can, in some\ncases, be inconsistent. In this paper we extract the value of $M_0$ using an\n$\\textit{extended}$ version of the universal relations that involve a fourth\nparameter, $\\delta M$, proportional to the difference $M_S-M_0$. We analyze to\nwhich degree this extended set of relations yields a more precise inference of\ncompact star properties and equation of state parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
