However, the current\nphotonic biosensor designs are not suitable for highly integrated and\nmultiplexing device architectures that can achieve the detection of complex\ncombinations of many biomarkers. Here, we propose a topological scheme for the\nintegration of miniature biosensors in photonic crystal chips that can meet the\nabove requirement. Using photonic topological edge states as robust\none-dimensional waveguides that connect many photonic biosensors, we propose\nhere the topologically integrated photonic biosensor circuits. We demonstrate\nthat the performance of the topologically integrated photonic biosensors is\nmuch more robust against disorders than that of the photonic biosensors\nconnected by the normal photonic waveguides, due to the robust transport of\nphotons along the edge channel. Since disorders arising from the fabrication\nimperfection and the random distribution of the biomarkers are inevitable in\ngenuine devices, resilience against disorders is a necessity for on-chip\nintegration of biosensors. The topological scheme proposed here thus opens a\npromising path toward reliable integration of photonic biosensors for\nnext-generation biomedical applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
