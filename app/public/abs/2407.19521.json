Recent observations, however, begin to challenge FDM\nin return. We focus on the arguments between the solution to CDM small-scale\ncuriosities and recent observations on matter power spectrum, and find its\nimplication on an earlier formation of small-scale structure. In this article,\nwe propose a scheme of k-ULDM scalar field with a differently-evolving sound\nspeed, thanks to the non-canonical kinetics. With the help of the\nDirac-Born-Infeld (DBI) theory, we illustrate to change the behavior of the\nquantum pressure term countering collapse, therefore change the history of\nstructure growth. We find that it can truly reopen the ULDM mass window closed\nby the Lyman-$\\alpha$ problem. We will discuss such examples in this paper,\nwhile more possibilities remain to be explored.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
