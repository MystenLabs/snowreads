It\nutilizes the ITU-R P.1812-6 model as its backbone, enhances predictions with\nthe physics-based Radiative Energy Transfer (RET) model and makes use of\nhigh-resolution terrain and clutter elevation datasets\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
