Although these methods have yielded promising results, they still\nstruggle with problems of low overlap, thus limiting their practical usage. In\nthis paper, we propose ML-SemReg, a plug-and-play point cloud registration\nframework that fully exploits semantic information. Our key insight is that\nmismatches can be categorized into two types, i.e., inter- and intra-class,\nafter rendering semantic clues, and can be well addressed by utilizing\nmulti-level semantic consistency. We first propose a Group Matching module to\naddress inter-class mismatching, outputting multiple matching groups that\ninherently satisfy Local Semantic Consistency. For each group, a Mask Matching\nmodule based on Scene Semantic Consistency is then introduced to suppress\nintra-class mismatching. Benefit from those two modules, ML-SemReg generates\ncorrespondences with a high inlier ratio. Extensive experiments demonstrate\nexcellent performance and robustness of ML-SemReg, e.g., in hard-cases of the\nKITTI dataset, the Registration Recall of MAC increases by almost 34 percentage\npoints when our ML-SemReg is equipped.
