In other words, we rigorously rule out the possibility that the\nmodel has a unique gapped ground state that is topologically trivial. To be\nprecise, we assume that the models on open finite chains with boundary magnetic\nfield have unique ground states with a uniform gap and prove that the ground\nstate of the infinite chain has a nontrivial topological index. This implies\nthe presence of a gapless edge excitation in the model on the half-infinite\nchain and the existence of a topological phase transition in the model (9).\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
