In this paper, we provide a combinatorial expansion of the flagged\nrefined skew stable Grothendieck polynomial in terms of key polynomials. We\npresent this expansion by imposing a Demazure crystal structure on the set of\nflagged semi-standard set-valued tableaux of a given skew shape and a flag. We\nalso provide expansions of the row-refined stable Grothendieck polynomials and\nrefined dual stable Grothendieck polynomials in terms of stable Grothendieck\npolynomials $G_{\\lambda}$ and in terms of dual stable Grothendieck polynomials\n$g_{\\lambda}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
