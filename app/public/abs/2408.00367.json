As the cost of generating these data decreases, these\ntechnologies provide an exciting opportunity to create large-scale atlases that\nintegrate SRT data across multiple tissues, individuals, species, or phenotypes\nto perform population-level analyses. Here, we describe unique challenges of\nvarying spatial resolutions in SRT data, as well as highlight the opportunities\nfor standardized preprocessing methods along with computational algorithms\namenable to atlas-scale datasets leading to improved sensitivity and\nreproducibility in the future.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
