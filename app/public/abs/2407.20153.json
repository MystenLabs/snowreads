The diameter of the holes is of size \\epsilon^3, where \\epsilon\nis a small parameter measuring the mutual distance between the holes. We show\nthat when \\epsilon tends to 0, the velocity and density converge to a solution\nof the non-homogeneous incompressible Navier-Stokes system with a friction term\nof Brinkman type.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
