Traditional control methods rely on\ncontroller design models, but real-world scenarios often require online model\nretuning or learning. FL offers a distributed approach to model training,\nenabling collaborative learning across distributed devices while preserving\ndata privacy. By keeping data localized, FL mitigates concerns regarding\nprivacy and security while reducing network bandwidth requirements for\ncommunication. This survey summarizes the state-of-the-art concepts and ideas\nof combining FL and control. The methodical benefits are further discussed,\nculminating in a detailed overview of expected applications, from dynamical\nsystem modeling over controller design, focusing on adaptive control, to\nknowledge transfer in multi-agent decision-making systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ioTH4EiRSyM-7mR8w4_Imfqgznf-L1DVH01dUEoSHag","pdfSize":"4692396"}
