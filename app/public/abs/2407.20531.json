Firstly, we reduce the MHD system to a\ndegenerate wave-elliptic system inherent with a specific null form. After\nconstructing a new solution space, we can prove some good product estimates.\nCombined with the inside null structure, a bilinear estimate of the\nKlainerman-Machedon's type for nonlinear terms can be obtained. These lead us\nto prove the local well-posedness of ideal incompressible MHD equations in\nLagrangian coordinates if the initial velocity $\\bv_0 \\in H^{s}(\\mathbb{R}^n),\ns> \\frac{n+1}{2}$ $(n=2,3)$. So our result lowers $\\frac12$-order regularity\ncomparing with the classical exponent $s>1+\\frac{n}{2}$. Moreover, to the\nauthor's knowledge, this is the first result concerning low-regularity\nsolutions of the ideal MHD equations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"F-yhZZy-MIHi2EDYjYBs6yAU8BRtuUV57PHVNg35xSo","pdfSize":"365730"}
