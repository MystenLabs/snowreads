We show that the interior regularity theory\ndeveloped by Caffarelli for the classical two-phase problem in his pioneer\nworks \\cite{C1,C2}, can be extended up to the boundary for the Neumann boundary\ncondition under very mild regularity assumptions on the convex domain $K$. To\nstart, we establish a general existence theorem for the Dirichlet two-phase\nproblem driven by two different fully nonlinear operators, which is a result of\nindependent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
