This\nisotope was produced in the 3n evaporation channel of the fusion reaction of\n$^{48}$Ca+$^{197}$Au. A half-life of 16.9(8)~s was deduced from 662 $\\alpha$\ndecays of $^{242}$Es, resulting in an $\\alpha$-decay branching of 41(3)\\%.\nTwenty-six fission events with a half-life of 18.2$^{+4.5}_{-3.0}$~s were\nassigned to originate from the electron-capture delayed fission of $^{242}$Es.\nThe probability for the electron-capture delayed fission was measured to be\n0.015(4), which improves and resolves ambiguities in available experimental\ndata. We discuss all known cases for electron-capture delayed fission in Es,\nBk, and Am isotopes and compare experimental data with predictions from a\nrecent semi-empirical model. A cross section of 27(3)~nb was measured for the\nproduction of $^{242}$Es.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NJBRgjMr6o1YbMk7vZAESQGYK6P2RS9lYMcUOpQm87U","pdfSize":"745904"}
