The experiments on the synthesis of superheavy nuclei (SHN), which\nare carried out in laboratories around the world, are examples of such\nexperiments encountering the target atoms sputtering in specific conditions.\nRotating wheels with a relatively large target annulus area are used in these\nexperiments to reduce the temperature and radiation loads on the target. Large\nareas of rotating targets allow one to reduce the sputtering yields of target\natoms significantly. The question arises about the reliability of these yields\nin experiments on the synthesis of SHN with Z > 118. These nuclei can be\nproduced with extremely low cross sections, requiring HI beam doses exceeding\n1020 particles passed through the target to observe several decay events of the\nthus synthesized SHN. Estimates based on approximations and simulations\nconsidered in this work are presented and compared with some data on actinide\ntarget sputtering obtained in experiments performed on the synthesis of SHN.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
