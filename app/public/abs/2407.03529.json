These inequalities provide specific growth and stability\nconditions for prescribed real-analytic functions, and have found applications\nto gradient flows, gradient systems, and as explicated in this paper, vector\nbundles over compact Riemannian manifolds. In this work, we outline the theory\nof functionals and variational problems over vector bundles, explore\napplications to arbitrary real-analytic functionals, and describe the energy\nfunctional on $S^{n-1}$ as a functional over a vector bundle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
