We show that for every\nbase in an explicit interval this iteration converges for any sequence of signs\nand all the real numbers are possible limits. We give some more results for a\nbase outside this interval.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
