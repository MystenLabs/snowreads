They are useful to beginners learning chords or for\nsharing the hand positions required to play a song.However, the diagrams\npresented on guitar learning toolsare usually selected from an existing\ndatabaseand rarely represent the actual positions used by performers.In this\npaper, we propose a tool which suggests a chord diagram for achord label,taking\ninto account the diagram of the previous chord.Based on statistical analysis of\nthe DadaGP and mySongBook datasets, we show that some chord diagrams are\nover-represented in western popular musicand that some chords can be played in\nmore than 20 different ways.We argue that taking context into account can\nimprove the variety and the quality of chord diagram suggestion, and compare\nthis approach with a model taking only the current chord label into account.We\nshow that adding previous context improves the F1-score on this task by up to\n27% and reduces the propensity of the model to suggest standard open chords.We\nalso define the notion of texture in the context of chord diagrams andshow\nthrough a variety of metrics that our model improves textureconsistencywith the\nprevious diagram.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
