The quality of a dynamic algorithm is measured in\nterms of its approximation ratio, \"recourse\" (the number of changes in $S$ per\nupdate) and \"update time\" (the time it takes to handle an update). The ultimate\ngoal in this line of research is to obtain a dynamic $O(1)$ approximation\nalgorithm with $\\tilde{O}(1)$ recourse and $\\tilde{O}(k)$ update time.\n  Dynamic $k$-median is a canonical example of a class of problems known as\ndynamic $k$-clustering, that has received significant attention in recent\nyears. To the best of our knowledge, however, previous papers either attempt to\nminimize the algorithm's recourse while ignoring its update time, or minimize\nthe algorithm's update time while ignoring its recourse. For dynamic\n$k$-median, we come arbitrarily close to resolving the main open question on\nthis topic, with the following results.\n  (I) We develop a new framework of randomized local search that is suitable\nfor adaptation in a dynamic setting. For every $\\epsilon > 0$, this gives us a\ndynamic $k$-median algorithm with $O(1/\\epsilon)$ approximation ratio,\n$\\tilde{O}(k^{\\epsilon})$ recourse and $\\tilde{O}(k^{1+\\epsilon})$ update time.\nThis framework also generalizes to dynamic $k$-clustering with $\\ell^p$-norm\nobjectives, giving similar bounds for the dynamic $k$-means and a new trade-off\nfor dynamic $k$-center.\n  (II) If it suffices to maintain only an estimate of the value of the optimal\n$k$-median objective, then we obtain a $O(1)$ approximation algorithm with\n$\\tilde{O}(k)$ update time. We achieve this result via adapting the Lagrangian\nRelaxation framework to the dynamic setting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
