[Local and global trend Bayesian exponential smoothing models.\nInternational Journal of Forecasting, 2024.], a generalised exponential\nsmoothing model was proposed that is able to capture strong trends and\nvolatility in time series. This method achieved state-of-the-art performance in\nmany forecasting tasks, but its fitting procedure, which is based on the NUTS\nsampler, is very computationally expensive. In this work, we propose several\nmodifications to the original model, as well as a bespoke Gibbs sampler for\nposterior exploration; these changes improve sampling time by an order of\nmagnitude, thus rendering the model much more practically relevant. The new\nmodel, and sampler, are evaluated on the M3 dataset and are shown to be\ncompetitive, or superior, in terms of accuracy to the original method, while\nbeing substantially faster to run.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
