Under the natural assumption that the magnetic body\n$\\mathcal{O}\\subset\\mathbb{R}^d$ ($d=1,2,3$) is bounded with smooth boundary,\nwe shall prove that the initial-boundary value problem of SLLBar equation\npossesses a unique global probabilistically strong and analytically weak\nsolution with initial data in the energy space $\\mathbb{H}^1(\\mathcal{O})$.\nThen by employing the weak convergence method, we proceed to establish a\nFreidlin-Wentzell type large deviation principle for pathwise solutions to the\nSLLBar equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
