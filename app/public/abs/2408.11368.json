Given an initially\nempty graph $G$, our algorithm processes $m$ insertions and $n$ deletions in\ntotal time $m^{1 + o(1)}$ and maintains an initially empty spanner $H$ with\ntotal recourse $n^{1 + o(1)}$. When the number of insertions is much larger\nthan the number of deletions, this notably yields recourse sub-linear in the\ntotal number of updates.\n  Our algorithm only has a single $O(\\log n)$ factor overhead in runtime and\napproximation compared to the underlying APSP data structure. Therefore, future\nimprovements for APSP will directly yield an improved dynamic spanner.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
