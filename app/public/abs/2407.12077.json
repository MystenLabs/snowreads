We train up to 1.5B parameter class models of the\nFinch, Llama, and GoldFinch architectures, and find dramatically improved\nmodeling performance relative to both Finch and Llama. Our cache size savings\nincrease linearly with model layer count, ranging from 756-2550 times smaller\nthan the traditional transformer cache for common sizes, enabling inference of\nextremely large context lengths even on limited hardware. Although\nautoregressive generation has O(n) time complexity per token because of\nattention, pre-fill computation of the entire initial cache state for a\nsubmitted context costs only O(1) time per token due to the use of a recurrent\nneural network (RNN) to generate this cache.
