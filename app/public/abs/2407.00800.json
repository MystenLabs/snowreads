An $L^1$-$L^p$ type embedding estimate derived from the\nfundamental solution is utilized to incorporate lower-order divergence terms.\nThis work naturally extends the boundedness theory for uniformly parabolic\nequations, with matching exponents for the coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
