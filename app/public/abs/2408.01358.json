Saito (Publ. RIMS 21 (1), 1985, 75-179) has introduced a class of root\nsystems called elliptic root systems which lies in the real vector space $F$\nwith a metric $I$ whose signature is of type $(l,2,0)$. He also classified the\npair $(R,G)$ of an elliptic root system $R$ with one dimensional subspace $G$\nof the radical of $I$, under the assumption that the quotient root system $R/G$\nis reduced. Here, we classify the pairs $(R,G)$ where $R/G$ is non-reduced.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XswocDi-xUmkWQ8IZjFxCUJ83JgCQvCMYEKIf_fqJ_w","pdfSize":"1454017","txDigest":"8o9bNrvW9qZESxAxh2ipcH3v75qrP6YwQVGULpZrmTd4","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
