Another crucial structure in such equations is shocks, which\nare the space-time locations where the velocity field is discontinuous. In this\nwork, we provide a detailed analysis of the structure and relationships between\nshocks, instability, and competition interfaces in the Brownian last-passage\npercolation model, which serves as a prototype of a semi-discrete inviscid\nstochastic HJ equation in one space dimension. Among our findings, we show that\nthe shock trees of the two unstable eternal solutions differ within the\ninstability region and align outside of it. Furthermore, we demonstrate that\none can reconstruct a skeleton of the instability region from these two shock\ntrees.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
