As a result, the\npopulation of initially clustered SMPBHs with $M_{\\rm PBH}\\sim 10^9M_\\odot$ and\nthe fraction of energy density $f_{\\rm PBH}\\sim 10^{-3}$ (consistent with\ncurrent constraints on SMPBHs) has the potential to naturally explain\nhigh-redshift massive galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
