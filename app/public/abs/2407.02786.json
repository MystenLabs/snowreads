Conversely, a recent study has demonstrated that accurate LIO can\nalso be achieved using a loosely-coupled method. Inspired by this advancements,\nwe present a LIO method that leverages the recursive Bayes filter, solved via\nthe Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) - herein referred to as KLIO. Within KLIO,\nprior and likelihood distributions are computed using IMU preintegration and\nscan matching between LiDAR and local map point clouds, and the pose, velocity,\nand IMU biases are updated through the EKF process. Through experiments with\nthe Newer College dataset, we demonstrate that KLIO achieves precise trajectory\ntracking and mapping. Its accuracy is comparable to that of the\nstate-of-the-art methods in both tightly- and loosely-coupled methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
