Nonetheless, existing methods\noften produce outliers that are considerably distant from the ID, showing\nlimited efficacy for capturing subtle distinctions between ID and OOD. To\naddress these issues, we propose a novel framework, Semantic Outlier generation\nvia Nuisance Awareness (SONA), which notably produces challenging outliers by\ndirectly leveraging pixel-space ID samples through diffusion models. Our\napproach incorporates SONA guidance, providing separate control over semantic\nand nuisance regions of ID samples. Thereby, the generated outliers achieve two\ncrucial properties: (i) they present explicit semantic-discrepant information,\nwhile (ii) maintaining various levels of nuisance resemblance with ID.\nFurthermore, the improved OOD detector training with SONA outliers facilitates\nlearning with a focus on semantic distinctions. Extensive experiments\ndemonstrate the effectiveness of our framework, achieving an impressive AUROC\nof 88% on near-OOD datasets, which surpasses the performance of baseline\nmethods by a significant margin of approximately 6%.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
