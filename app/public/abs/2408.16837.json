This study addresses the need for a comprehensive analysis of research\ntrends in this field, especially given the rapid advancements and growing use\nof CA technologies like ChatGPT. Through bibliometric analysis, we aim to\nidentify key keywords, disciplines, research clusters, and international\ncollaborations related to CA and trust. We analyzed 955 studies published\nbetween 2009 and 2024, all sourced from the Scopus database. Additionally, we\nconducted a text clustering analysis to identify the main themes in the\npublications and understand their distribution. Our findings highlight the\nincreasing interest in CA, particularly with the introduction of ChatGPT. The\nUSA leads in research output, followed by Germany, China, and the UK.\nFurthermore, there is a notable rise in interdisciplinary research, especially\nin the fields of human-computer interaction and artificial intelligence.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
