While boundary controls alone prove inadequate for\nreplicating the complex patterns seen in biological systems, particularly under\nnatural point-wise constraints of the system state, their combination with the\nregulation of the diffusion coefficient enables the successful generation of\nsuch patterns.\n  Our study demonstrates that the set of steady-states is path-connected,\nfacilitating the use of the staircase method. This approach allows any\nadmissible initial configuration to evolve into any stationary pattern over a\nsufficiently long time while maintaining the system's natural bilateral\nconstraints. We provide also examples of complex patterns that steady-state\nconfigurations can adopt.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"uwOrHQpDtpp1XQNmFqtsJr11mbzVx0ZixuluMKjbe6M","pdfSize":"1899269"}
