This correction is of order\n$a^3\\rho^{8/3}$, with $a$ the $p$-wave scattering length of the interaction and\n$\\rho$ the particle density, depends on the temperature and matches the\ncorresponding lower bound of [arXiv:2307.01113].\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
