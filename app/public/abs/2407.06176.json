However, it is often\nchallenging to perform image segmentation due to data imbalance between intra-\nand inter-class, resulting in over- or under-segmentation. Consequently, we\nproposed a new methodology to address the above issue, with a compact yet\neffective contour-weighted loss function. Our new loss function incorporates a\ncontour-weighted cross-entropy loss and separable dice loss. The former loss\nextracts the contour of target regions via morphological erosion and generates\na weight map for the cross-entropy criterion, whereas the latter divides the\ntarget regions into contour and non-contour components through the extracted\ncontour map, calculates dice loss separately, and combines them to update the\nnetwork. We carried out abdominal organ segmentation and brain tumor\nsegmentation on two public datasets to assess our approach. Experimental\nresults demonstrated that our approach offered superior segmentation, as\ncompared to several state-of-the-art methods, while in parallel improving the\nrobustness of those popular state-of-the-art deep models through our new loss\nfunction.
