We motivate\nour work with prior art in software optimizations for quantum programs like\nnoise-adaptive mapping and multi-programming, and we introduce the concept of\nPCS while emphasizing design considerations for its practical use. We show that\nby carefully embedding Pauli checks within a target application (i.e. a quantum\ncircuit), we can learn quantum system noise profiles. Further, PCS combined\nwith multi-programming unlocks non-trivial fidelity improvements in quantum\nprogram outcomes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
