In this study, we quantitatively investigate the impact of fluid\nvorticity on the evolution of magnetic fields in the 20-50\\% centrality class\nin Au+Au collisions, with collision energies of $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=(7.7, 14.5,\n19.6, 27, 39, 62.4, 200)$ GeV. Our results indicate that fluid vorticity leads\nto a delay in the evolution of the magnetic field, in which this effect becomes\nmore pronounced as the collision energy decreases. Additionally, we have\ncalculated the mean magnetic field values on the freeze-out hypersurface for\nvarious collision energies. Our simulation results align with the values\ninferred from experimental data of $\\bar{\\Lambda}-\\Lambda$, within the error\nmargins.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
