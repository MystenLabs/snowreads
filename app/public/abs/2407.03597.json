The\nFVG method assumes an invariable AGN color, but this assumption has been\nquestioned by the intrinsic color variation of quasars and local Seyfert\ngalaxies. Here, using an up-to-date thermal fluctuation model to simulate\nmulti-wavelength AGN variability, we theoretically demonstrate that the FVG\nmethod generally overestimates the host galaxy flux; that is, it is more\nsignificant for brighter AGN/quasars. Furthermore, we observationally confirm\nthat the FVG method indeed overestimates the host galaxy flux by comparing it\nto that estimated through other independent methods. We thus caution that\napplying the FVG method should be performed carefully in the era of time-domain\nastronomy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
