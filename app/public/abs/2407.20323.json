We find that demanding Lax integrability imposes a crucial\nrestriction, namely that the coset $F\\backslash G$ must be symmetric.\nSurprisingly, we also find that (when $F$ is non-abelian) integrability\nrequires that the term in the action involving only the spectator fields should\nhave a specific $\\lambda$-dependence, which is a curious modification of the\nprocedure expected from the known $F=G$ case. The resulting Lax connection has\na novel analytical structure, with four single poles as opposed to the two\npoles of the cases of the PCM and of the standard $\\lambda$-deformation. We\nalso explicitly work out the example of $G=SU(2)$ and $F=U(1)$, discussing its\nrenormalisation group flow to two loops.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
