The research combines numerical modeling of the\nAFSD process with genetic algorithm-optimized machine learning models to\npredict von Mises stress and logarithmic strain. Finite element analysis was\nemployed to simulate the AFSD process for five aluminum alloys: AA2024, AA5083,\nAA5086, AA7075, and AA6061, capturing complex thermal and mechanical\ninteractions. A dataset of 200 samples was generated from these simulations.\nSubsequently, Decision Tree (DT) and Random Forest (RF) regression models,\noptimized using genetic algorithms, were developed to predict key mechanical\nproperties. The GA-RF model demonstrated superior performance in predicting\nboth von Mises stress (R square = 0.9676) and logarithmic strain (R square =\n0.7201). This innovative approach provides a powerful tool for understanding\nand optimizing the AFSD process across multiple aluminum alloys, offering\ninsights into material behavior under various process parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"MSCXlvNDf7DluEdHqbHOebHhoc6fSTAWQan9oCiyQtk","pdfSize":"3754991"}
