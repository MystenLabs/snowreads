In this paper, we explore structured \\textit{BEs} for a class of\nthree-by-three block saddle point problems (\\textit{TBSPPs}), aiming to assess\nthe strong backward stability of iterative algorithms devised to find their\nsolution. Our investigations preserve the inherent matrix structure and\nsparsity pattern in the corresponding perturbation matrices and derive explicit\nformulae for the structure \\textit{BEs}. Moreover, we provide formulae for the\nstructure-preserving minimal perturbation matrices for which the structured\n\\textit{BE} is attained. Furthermore, using the obtained structured\n\\textit{BEs}, we propose three new termination criteria for the iterative\nalgorithms to solve the \\textit{TBSPP.} Numerical experiments are performed to\ntest the strong backward stability of various iterative algorithms, as well as\nthe reliability and effectiveness of the proposed termination criteria.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
