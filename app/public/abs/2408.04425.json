The accumulated DM can affect\nthe properties of NSs. In this work we use a general relativistic two-fluid\nformalism to solve the structure of DM-admixed NSs (DANSs) and the surrounding\nspacetime. Specifically, we pay attention to the situation where those DANSs\npossess DM halos. Due to the gravitational effect of the DM halo, the pulse\nprofile of an X-ray pulsar is changed. Our study finds a universal relation\nbetween the peak flux deviation of the pulse profile and $M_{\\rm halo}/R_{\\rm\nBM}$, which is the ratio of the DM halo mass, $M_{\\rm halo}$, to the baryonic\nmatter (BM) core radius, $R_{\\rm BM}$. Our results show that, when $M_{\\rm\nhalo}/R_{\\rm BM}=0.292$ and the DM particle mass $m_f = 0.3\\,$GeV, the maximum\ndeviation of the profile can be larger than 100$\\%$, which has implication in\nX-ray pulsar observation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aE6YYP3E7jc4l-8x-o1NUKsegAK2TUS8LEoyq3arqbE","pdfSize":"1294851"}
