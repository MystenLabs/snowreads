In\nthis work, we introduce a method for detecting multipartite entanglement\nstructures in arbitrary continuous variable states, which also reveals genuine\nmultipartite entanglement. By leveraging the quantum Fisher information, we\npropose a criterion for characterizing entanglement and offer a systematic\napproach to identify feasible operators that capture quantum correlations in\nmultimode non-Gaussian states. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method\non over 10000 randomly generated multimode-entangled quantum states, achieving\na high success rate in entanglement detection. Additionally, our method\nexhibits enhanced robustness against losses by expanding the set of accessible\noperators. This work provides a general framework for characterizing\nentanglement structures in diverse continuous variable systems, enabling a\nnumber of experimentally relevant applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
