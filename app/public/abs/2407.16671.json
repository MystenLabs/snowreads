As a corollary, we prove that for any real\nanalytic 1-norm or $\\infty$-norm nonexpansive map on $\\mathbb{R}^n$, there is a\npositive integer $q$ such that the period of any periodic orbit divides $q$ and\n$q$ is the order, or twice the order, of a permutation on $n$ letters. This\nconfirms Nussbaum's $2^n$ Conjecture for $\\infty$-norm nonexpansive maps in the\nspecial case where the maps are also real analytic.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eLZqo796MXVV1hoEarzJJD18-FwG5Lm5CQq_N5L-Z6M","pdfSize":"153654"}
