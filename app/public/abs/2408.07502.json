We show that when\nsuch ribbons are activated appropriately, the deformations produced can pull\nback and perform work against the externally applied load. We perform two\nnumerical experiments to demonstrate this effect: (1) the \\emph{pulling}\nexperiment, where the ribbon is pulled longitudinally by a point force, and (2)\nthe \\emph{bending} experiment, where the ribbon is bent out of plane by a\nterminally applied point force. We quantify the capacity of the ribbon to work\nagainst external loads, and compute its dependence on both the ribbon thickness\nand the imprinted nematic texture (that is, the distribution of the nematic\ndirectors across the ribbon's length). Finally, we compute the efficiency of\nthe activation process. Building on the outcomes of our numerical explorations,\nwe formulate two educated conjectures on how the activation efficiency can in\ngeneral be improved by acting on both the applied load and the imprinted\nnematic texture.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
