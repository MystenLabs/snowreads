To achieve our objective, we will introduce a new contraction condition\nto examine the fixed point for multi-valued mapping, then we will be\ninvestigating the obtained result to ensure the existence and uniqueness of\nthis property for single-valued mapping. To show the use of our main result, we\nwill give the relative result in the ordinary metric space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
