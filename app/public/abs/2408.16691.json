Here we\ninclude macroscopic dynamics known as $\\texttt{GENERIC}$ for which the\ndynamical fluctuations show a canonical structure. We find a continuous\nsymmetry of the corresponding path-space action when restricting to quasistatic\ntrajectories, with the thermodynamic entropy as Noether charge.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
