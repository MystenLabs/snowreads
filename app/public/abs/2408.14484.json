To\naddress these challenges, we propose a novel approach using an agentic\nRetrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework for time series analysis. The\nframework leverages a hierarchical, multi-agent architecture where the master\nagent orchestrates specialized sub-agents and delegates the end-user request to\nthe relevant sub-agent. The sub-agents utilize smaller, pre-trained language\nmodels (SLMs) customized for specific time series tasks through fine-tuning\nusing instruction tuning and direct preference optimization, and retrieve\nrelevant prompts from a shared repository of prompt pools containing distilled\nknowledge about historical patterns and trends to improve predictions on new\ndata. Our proposed modular, multi-agent RAG approach offers flexibility and\nachieves state-of-the-art performance across major time series tasks by\ntackling complex challenges more effectively than task-specific customized\nmethods across benchmark datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
