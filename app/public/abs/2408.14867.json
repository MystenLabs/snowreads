It will act as a pathfinder of the Probe Of\nExtreme Multi-Messenger Astrophysics (POEMMA) detector. PBR will consist of an\ninnovative hybrid focal surface featuring a Fluorescence Camera (FC, based on\nMulti-Anode Photomultiplier Tubes [MAPMTs], 1.05 $\\mu$s time resolution) and a\nCherenkov Camera (based on SiPMs, 10 ns time resolution), both mounted on the\nsame tiltable frame that can point from nadir up to 13$^\\circ$ above the\nhorizon. The FC's main scientific goal is to observe, for the first time, the\nfluorescence emission of Extensive Air Showers produced by Ultra-High Energy\nCosmic Rays from sub-orbital altitudes. This measurement will validate the\ndetection strategy for future space-based missions, such as POEMMA. As a\nsecondary goal, the FC will perform a search for macroscopic dark matter\nthrough slowly evolving showers that will leave a signal similar to (but\ndistinct from) a meteor. PBR targets a launch in 2027 as a payload of an\nultra-long duration balloon flight with a duration of up to 100 days.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
