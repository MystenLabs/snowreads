The score is the entropy\nof an image as approximated by the bits-per-pixel of its compressed version.\nThus the score is intrinsic to an image and does not require supervision or\ntraining. It is very simple to compute and readily available as all images are\nstored in a compressed format. The motivation behind our choice of score is\nthat most other scores proposed in literature are expensive to compute. More\nimportantly, we want a score that captures the perceptual complexity of an\nimage. Entropy is one such measure, images with clutter tend to have a higher\nentropy. However sampling only low entropy iconic images, for example, leads to\nbiased learning and an overall decrease in test performance with current deep\nlearning models. To mitigate the bias we use a graph based method that\nincreases the spatial diversity of the selected samples. We show that this\nsimple score yields good results, particularly for semantic segmentation tasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
