We\nare particularly interested in those facets which are somehow independent of\nthe dimension $n$. Using Hadamard matrices, we prove that the number of\ndifferent dimensions of such facets is a super-polynomial function of the scale\n$r$, assuming that $n$ is sufficiently large. We show also that the $(2r-1)$-th\ndimensional homology of the complex $\\mathcal{VR}(Q_n; r)$ is non-trivial when\n$n$ is large enough, provided that the Hadamard matrix of order $2r$ exists.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
