It\nis expected to measure with an unprecedent precision the atmospheric\noscillation parameters, including the CP-violating phase $\\delta_{CP}$.\nMoreover, several studies have suggested that its unique features should allow\nDUNE to probe several new physics scenarios. In this work, we explore the\nperformances of the DUNE far detector in constraining new physics if a\nhigh-energy neutrino flux is employed (HE-DUNE). We take into account three\ndifferent scenarios: Lorentz Invariance Violation (LIV), Long Range Forces\n(LRF) and Large Extra Dimensions (LED). Our results show that HE-DUNE should be\nable to set bounds competitive to the current ones and, in particular, it can\noutperform the standard DUNE capabilities in constraining CPT-even LIV\nparameters and the compactification radius $R_{ED}$ of the LED model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
