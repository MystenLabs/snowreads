Our method, inspired by $A^*$, initiates a best-first-like procedure\nfrom a designated subset of vertices and iteratively expands it until further\ngrowth is neither possible nor beneficial. Traditionally, obtaining solutions\nwith bounds for an optimization problem involves solving a relaxation,\nmodifying the relaxed solution to a feasible one, and then comparing the two\nsolutions to establish bounds. However, for SPP-GCS, we demonstrate that\nreversing this process can be more advantageous, especially with Euclidean\ntravel costs. In other words, we initially employ $A^*$ to find a feasible\nsolution for SPP-GCS, then solve a convex relaxation restricted to the vertices\nexplored by $A^*$ to obtain a relaxed solution, and finally, compare the\nsolutions to derive bounds. We present numerical results to highlight the\nadvantages of our algorithm over the existing approach in terms of the sizes of\nthe convex programs solved and computation time.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
