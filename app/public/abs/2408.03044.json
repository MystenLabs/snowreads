Here, we have managed to tune and boost ferroelectric\ngeometric distortion of h-LuMnO3 thin films by doping Ca. Compressively\nstrained h-Lu1-xCaxMnO3(x=0.1,0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5)epitaxial thin films were\nstabilized over sapphire substrates by a h-ScFeO3 buffer layer. When the doping\nconcentration x>=0.2, the common substrate-induced interface clamping effect\nthat suppresses improper ferroelectricity of h-ReMnO3 can be eliminated. This\nwork establishes a potential quasi-2D ferroelectric system and suggests a\ngeneral strain engineering method to enhance improper ferroelectricity of\nhexagonal manganites.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
