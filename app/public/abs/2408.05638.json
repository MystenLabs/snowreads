The cavity is integrated with an optical\nparametric amplifier (OPA) and driven by a squeezed vacuum field. The\nintroduction of the OPA and the squeezed vacuum field induce squeezing in the\ncavity mode, which is transferred to the magnon modes through magnetic dipole\ninteractions. Our findings demonstrate that enhancing the OPA gain and the\nsqueezing parameter significantly enhances the quantum entanglement and the\nEinstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering. Furthermore, the photon-magnon coupling\nstrength can be adjusted to control the directionality of EPR steering,\noffering a mechanism for achieving one-way EPR steering under specific\nconditions. This control is fine-tuned by varying system parameters, thereby\nproviding a robust platform for steering in the presence of thermal noise. Our\nfindings advance the understanding of macroscopic quantum correlations and hold\npromising implications for quantum information processing, particularly in\ngenerating, manipulating, and enhancing quantum steering phenomena. This\npractical aspect of our research will inspire hope for future applications in\nthe field of quantum information.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
