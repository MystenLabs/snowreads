Given a sequence of $n$ observations,\nwe are interested in characterizing the performance of Likelihood Ratio Tests\nwhere two hypotheses are plausible for the observed quantities: either\nisotropic Cauchy or isotropic Gaussian. Under various setups, we show that the\nprobability of error of such detectors is not always exponentially decaying\nwith $n$ with the leading term in the exponent shown to be logarithmic instead\nand we determine the constants in that leading term. Perhaps surprisingly, the\noptimal Bayesian probabilities of error are found to exhibit different\nasymptotic behaviors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"u9LaJ7wqsEsMeikkfdjMiU6B8BMGdsWdp5mG-IrNt8s","pdfSize":"714437"}
