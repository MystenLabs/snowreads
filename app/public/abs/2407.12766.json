The drift matrix is assumed to be Temple class. First, we\nprove the global existence of smooth solutions for initial data with small\ntotal variation. We show that the solution to the parabolic equation converges\nto a semi-group solution of the hyperbolic system as viscosity goes to zero.\nFurthermore, we prove that the zero diffusion limit coincides with the one\nobtained in [Bianchini and Bressan, Indiana Univ. Math. J. 2000].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"B9tKEuUA12j-GpH1L_oegu8H4Wx_oOPg8rB_HwKgTew","pdfSize":"330205"}
