Existing\ndecomposition methods often focus on the uncorrelatedness between the common\nlatent factors and distinctive latent factors, but inadequately address the\nequally necessary uncorrelatedness between distinctive latent factors from\ndifferent data views. We propose a novel decomposition method, called\nDecomposition of Common and Distinctive Latent Factors (D-CDLF), to effectively\nachieve both types of uncorrelatedness for two-view data. We also discuss the\nestimation of the D-CDLF under high-dimensional settings.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
