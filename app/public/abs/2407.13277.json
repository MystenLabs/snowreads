However,\nexisting generative methods fail to consistently represent the hierarchical\nstructure of WSIs due to a focus on high-fidelity patches. To tackle this, we\npropose Ultra-Resolution Cascaded Diffusion Models (URCDMs) which are capable\nof synthesising entire histopathology images at high resolutions whilst\nauthentically capturing the details of both the underlying anatomy and\npathology at all magnification levels. We evaluate our method on three separate\ndatasets, consisting of brain, breast and kidney tissue, and surpass existing\nstate-of-the-art multi-resolution models. Furthermore, an expert evaluation\nstudy was conducted, demonstrating that URCDMs consistently generate outputs\nacross various resolutions that trained evaluators cannot distinguish from real\nimages. All code and additional examples can be found on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"BJ4eDsg42D22oKn_1mqxu_-kgwCkhBhW3nuHwOm7nAk","pdfSize":"42996419"}
