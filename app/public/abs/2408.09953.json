For the problems related to this control,\nthe best known lower bound is PP-hardness, where PP is \"probabilistic\npolynomial time,\" and the best known upper bound is the class NP^PP, i.e., the\nclass NP with a PP oracle. We optimally raise this lower bound by showing\nNP^PP-hardness of all these problems for the Penrose-Banzhaf and the\nShapley-Shubik indices, thus establishing completeness for them in that class.\nOur proof technique may turn out to be useful for solving other open problems\nrelated to weighted voting games with such a complexity gap as well.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I1E40Jd4ciuzxhrddq_FT8JIahIAOX-ZX0kyY8_Trpc","pdfSize":"398353"}
