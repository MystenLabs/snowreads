They are known to yield more robust predictions by\ncreating a set of diverse base models. In this paper, we introduce an approach\nto transfer the idea of snapshot ensembles to link prediction models in\nknowledge graphs. Moreover, since link prediction in knowledge graphs is a\nsetup without explicit negative examples, we propose a novel training loop that\niteratively creates negative examples using previous snapshot models. An\nevaluation with four base models across four datasets shows that this approach\nconstantly outperforms the single model approach, while keeping the training\ntime constant.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8IfSShdZZ0pWejRa2_4j9Js6JWKDjkX1FlztvN0OMfw","pdfSize":"2536221"}
