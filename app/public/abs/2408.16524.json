In a recent work, this construction has been\nextended to higher-derivative terms, starting from the four-derivative\nextension of Yang-Mills theory with an expectation to obtain a conformally\ninvariant DFT action up to the third order. Here, I attempt to extend this\nhigher-derivative DFT action for all orders in a manifestly\nbackground-independent way starting from the second order terms. The third\norder terms I obtained do not match the third order terms obtained directly\nfrom the double copy map. A clear understanding of this mismatch can give\nvaluable information about the double copy procedure for DFT, its relation to\nbackground independence, and the conformal symmetry in double configuration\nspace.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
