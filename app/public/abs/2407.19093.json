This approach is particularly intriguing when\nconsidering media with exotic properties, such as strongly-correlated phases\nand topological states of matter. In this work, we study the dressing of a\nmobile impurity interacting with a chiral mode, as provided by the edge of\ntopological quantum matter. The resulting ''chiral polaron'' is characterized\nby an asymmetric spectral function, which reflects the chirality and group\nvelocity of the topological edge mode and the drag experienced by the mobile\nimpurity. We first build our theoretical understanding from an effective\none-dimensional chiral model, which captures the hallmark signatures of the\nchiral polaron. We then demonstrate how this simple picture extends to\nrealistic models of integer and fractional Chern insulator states, by adapting\ntensor-network methods to polaron spectroscopy. Injecting mobile impurities on\nthe edge of topological quantum matter is shown to be a powerful tool to probe\nexotic edge properties, particularly suitable for cold-atom experiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
