In this work, we explicitly examine\ninter-mode dependence of phonon energies of a prototypical crystal, silicon,\nthrough energy covariance calculations and demonstrate the concerted nature of\nphonon energies even at 300 K, questioning independent harmonic oscillator\nassumptions commonly used for phonon energy descriptions of thermodynamics and\ntransport.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CbNtZ6Jf2atjLVm0WBLF-CsPExdlY8uRMWdg7m-3tBs","pdfSize":"18807539"}
