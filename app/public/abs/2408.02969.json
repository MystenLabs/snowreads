(2023, A&A, 674, A170, arXiv:2304.08394) and noted in that work as new\ndiscoveries are in fact known systems. This is especially true for the dense\nbulge fields with large blending of nearby sources. Among the published 245\nstars determined to be doubly eclipsing (i.e. containing two eclipsing\nsignals), I identified 53 blends. In other words, about a quarter of the\nsystems noted by \\'Ad\\'am et al. (2023, A&A, 674, A170) are not actually doubly\neclipsing; rather, these are contaminations of known nearby sources that have\nalready been detected by OGLE. Such a high proportion of reported false\npositives should not be readily ignored and ought to be addressed in future\nstudies.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
