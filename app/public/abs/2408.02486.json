The various aspects of the collision dynamics are investigate in terms\nof the individual decoupling processes. Thereby each observed particle\ndecouples during its own temporal decoupling window. This includes a ``very\nlate'' decoupling of the faintly bound Hypertritons observed in recent ALICE\nexperiments. The success of the strategy is based upon 200 years old wisdom and\nleads to a revised interpretation of the entire decoupling process.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
