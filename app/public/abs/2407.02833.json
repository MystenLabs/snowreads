Leveraging large language models (LLMs) offers new\nopportunities for comprehensive recommendation logic generation. However, in\nexisting related studies, fine-tuning LLM models for recommendation tasks\nincurs high computational costs and alignment issues with existing systems,\nlimiting the application potential of proven proprietary/closed-source LLM\nmodels, such as GPT-4. In this work, our proposed effective strategy LANE\naligns LLMs with online recommendation systems without additional LLMs tuning,\nreducing costs and improving explainability. This innovative approach addresses\nkey challenges in integrating language models with recommendation systems while\nfully utilizing the capabilities of powerful proprietary models. Specifically,\nour strategy operates through several key components: semantic embedding, user\nmulti-preference extraction using zero-shot prompting, semantic alignment, and\nexplainable recommendation generation using Chain of Thought (CoT) prompting.\nBy embedding item titles instead of IDs and utilizing multi-head attention\nmechanisms, our approach aligns the semantic features of user preferences with\nthose of candidate items, ensuring coherent and user-aligned recommendations.\nSufficient experimental results including performance comparison, questionnaire\nvoting, and visualization cases prove that our method can not only ensure\nrecommendation performance, but also provide easy-to-understand and reasonable\nrecommendation logic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
