One increasingly popular\nformat is tutorial videos, particularly those based on Jupyter notebooks, which\noffer an intuitive interpretation of code and vivid explanations of analytical\nprocedures. However, creating such videos requires a diverse skill set and\nsignificant manual effort, posing a barrier for many analysts. To bridge this\ngap, we introduce an innovative tool called NotePlayer, which connects notebook\ncells to video segments and incorporates a computational engine with language\nmodels to streamline video creation and editing. Our aim is to make the process\nmore accessible and efficient for analysts. To inform the design of NotePlayer,\nwe conducted a formative study and performed content analysis on a corpus of 38\nJupyter tutorial videos. This helped us identify key patterns and challenges\nencountered in existing tutorial videos, guiding the development of NotePlayer.\nThrough a combination of a usage scenario and a user study, we validated the\neffectiveness of NotePlayer. The results show that the tool streamlines the\nvideo creation and facilitates the communication process for data analysts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"YlloRZC1eyQiFC_f4NMR48xXABt1WGZQU1w3R8SVTc4","pdfSize":"4790554","txDigest":"9LvgQhPoPX5bFinY4mzRoYpKojcLWs96uBsjfgibXaRq","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
