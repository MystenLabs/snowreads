Herein, we demonstrate a facile\nsolid-phase method for in-situ doping of Ir at the Os sites in the Os3Sn7, an\nalloy with topological states, which significantly improves the photocatalytic\nperformance for the reduction of CO2 to CO and CH4. Experimental evidence\ncombined with theoretical calculations reveal that the nontrivial topological\nsurface states greatly accelerate charge-separation/electron-enrichment and\nadsorption/activation of CO2 molecules, rendering highly efficient reaction\nchannels to stimulate the formation of *COOH and *CO, as well CHO*. This work\nshows the promise of achieving high photocatalytic performances with\nsynthesizing topological catalysts and provides hints on the design of novel\ntopological catalysts with superior photoactivity towards the CO2 reduction\nreaction.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
