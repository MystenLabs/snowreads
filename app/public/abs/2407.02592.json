In this paper, we analyze\nthe performance of several low-complexity receivers that use optical parametric\namplifiers. The simulations demonstrate that receivers employing an\nentanglement-assisted scheme with phase-shift-keying modulation can outperform\nclassical capacities. We present a 2x2 optical hybrid receiver for\nentanglement-assisted communication and show that it has a roughly 10% lower\nerror probability compared to previously proposed optical parametric\namplifier-based receivers for more than 10 modes. However, the capacity of the\noptical parametric amplifier-based receiver exceeds the Holevo capacity and the\ncapacities of the optical phase conjugate receiver and 2x2 optical hybrid\nreceiver in the case of a single mode. The numerical findings indicate that\nsurpassing the Holevo and Homodyne capacities does not require a large number\nof signal-idler modes. Furthermore, we find that using unequal priors for BPSK\nprovides roughly three times the information rate advantage over equal priors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W069O7UJRsdyQTGHfI5S5HYdUw3DFlwYhawOOr-r204","pdfSize":"2184224"}
