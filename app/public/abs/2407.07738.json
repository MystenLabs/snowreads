We provide solutions to all four basic\nproblems associated with these envelopes, namely the existence problem,\nrepresentation problem, problem on the number of envelopes, and problem on the\nrelationships of definitions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
