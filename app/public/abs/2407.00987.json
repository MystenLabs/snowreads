Traditional approaches statically assign priorities to\nflows based on their associated applications, resulting in significant queuing\ndelays. In this paper, we observe that assigning different priorities to a flow\nleads to varying delays due to different shaping mechanisms applied to\ndifferent flow types. Leveraging this insight, we introduce a new scheduling\nmethod in mixed-criticality TSN that incorporates a priority adjustment scheme\namong diverse flow types to mitigate queuing delays and enhance schedulability.\nSpecifically, we propose dependency-aware priority adjustment algorithms\ntailored to different link-overlapping conditions. Experiments in various\nsettings validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, which enhances the\nschedulability by 20.57% compared with the SOTA method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
