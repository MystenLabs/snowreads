We update old calculations, perform new\ncalculations and analysis in a rigorous way, and take account of the net\nlight-flavor $SU(3)$ breaking effects in a consistent way. And we make more\nreasonable identifications for the $X(3960)$, $X(4140)$, $X(4274)$, $X(4500)$,\n$X(4685)$ and $X(4700)$ and supersede some old identifications. Furthermore, we\nconsider our previous theoretical predictions, and make reasonable/suitable\nidentifications of the new LHCb states $h_c(4000)$ and $\\chi_{c1}(4010)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
