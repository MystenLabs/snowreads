This\nmethod consists in combining approximation schemes calculated on different\nrandom grids to increase the order of convergence. We apply this method with\neither the Ninomiya-Victoir scheme (2008) or a second-order scheme that samples\nexactly the volatility component, and we show rigorously that we can achieve\nthen any order of convergence. We give numerical illustrations on financial\nexamples that validate the theoretical order of convergence, and present also\npromising numerical results for the multifactor/rough Heston model.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
