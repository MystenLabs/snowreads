This model first divides web data into several sub-data,\nwith each sub-data corresponding to a thread task. In each thread task, web\ncrawling tasks are concurrently executed, and the crawled data are stored in a\nbuffer queue, awaiting further parsing. The parsing process is also divided\ninto several threads. By establishing the model and continuously conducting\ncrawler tests, it is found that this model is significantly optimized compared\nto single-threaded approaches.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
