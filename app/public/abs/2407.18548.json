Current measures for visual discomfort rely\non users' self-reports those susceptible to subjective differences and lack of\nreal-time insights. In this work, we investigate if Electroencephalography\n(EEG) can objectively measure visual discomfort by sensing Event-Related\nPotentials (ERPs). In a user study (N=20), we compare four different levels of\nGaussian blur in a user study while measuring ERPs at occipito-parietal EEG\nelectrodes. The findings reveal that specific ERP components (i.e., P1, N2, and\nP3) discriminated discomfort-related visual stimuli and indexed increased load\non visual processing and fatigue. We conclude that time-locked brain activity\ncan be used to evaluate visual discomfort and propose EEG-based automatic\ndiscomfort detection and prevention tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
