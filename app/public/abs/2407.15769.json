Subsequently, for a 2-dimensional\nevolution algebra $A$ over a field $K$, we detail the relation between the\nalgebra associated with the (tight) universal associative and commutative\nrepresentation of $A$, referred to as the (tight) $p$-algebra, and the\ncorresponding Hopf algebra, $\\mathcal{H}$, representing the affine group scheme\n$\\text{Aut}(A)$.\n  Our analysis involves the computation of the (tight) $p-$algebra associated\nwith any 2-dimensional evolution algebra, whenever it exists. We find that\n$\\text{Aut}(A)=1$ if and only if there is no faithful associative and\ncommutative representation for $A$. Moreover, there is a faithful associative\nand commutative representation for $A$ if and only if $\\mathcal{H}\\not\\cong K$\nand $\\text{char} (K)\\neq 2$, or $\\mathcal{H}\\not\\cong K(\\epsilon)$ (the dual\nnumbers algebra) and $\\mathcal{H}\\not\\cong K$ in case of $\\text{char} (K)= 2$.\nFurthermore, if $A$ is perfect and has a faithful tight $p$-algebra, then this\n$p$-algebra is isomorphic to $\\mathcal{H}$ (as algebras). Finally, we derive\nimplications for arbitrary finite-dimensional evolution algebras.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
