The ratio of the number of radiative\ndecay photons and the number of $^{229m}$Th embedded are determined for single\ncrystalline CaF$_2$, MgF$_2$, LiSrAlF$_6$, AlN, and amorphous SiO$_2$. For the\nlatter two materials, no radiative decay signal was observed and an upper limit\nof the ratio is reported. The radiative decay wavelength was determined in\nLiSrAlF$_6$ and CaF$_2$, reducing its uncertainty by a factor of 2.5 relative\nto our previous measurement. This value is in agreement with the recently\nreported improved values from laser excitation.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"NQ0dXNqdbiYTu3GT14xkTa5j_I1jBJXIvYbk3Yl_CIA","pdfSize":"7159671"}
