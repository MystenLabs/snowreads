In this paper, a recursive sparse LU decomposition for\nmatrices arising from the discretization of linear PDEs is proposed based on\nthe nested dissection and low rank approximations. The matrix is reorganized\nbased on the nested structure of the associated graph. After eliminating the\ninterior vertices at the finest level, dense blocks on the separators are\nhierarchically sparsified using low rank approximations. To efficiently\nskeletonize these dense blocks, we split the separators into segments and\nintroduce a hybrid algorithm to extract the low rank structures based on a\nrandomized algorithm and the fast multipole method. The resulting decomposition\nyields a fast direct solver for sparse matrices, applicable to both symmetric\nand non-symmetric cases. Under a mild assumption on the compression rate of\ndense blocks, we prove an $\\O(N)$ complexity for the fast direct solver.\nSeveral numerical experiments are provided to verify the effectiveness of the\nproposed method.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
