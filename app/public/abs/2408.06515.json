In this paper, we\nsimulate the evolution of PBH binaries in DM halos and calculate their merger\nrate up to redshift of 10. We assume that DM halos are made entirely by a\ncombination of single PBHs and PBH binaries. We present the resulting merger\nrates from the two main channels that lead to merging PBH binaries: two-body\ncaptures and binary-single interactions. We account for alternative assumptions\non the dark matter halo mass-concentration relationship versus redshift. We\nalso study what impact the PBH mass distribution, centered in the stellar-mass\nrange, has on the PBH merger rate that the ground-based gravitational-wave\nobservatories can probe. We find that under reasonable assumptions on the\nabundance of PBH binaries relative to single PBHs, the binary-single\ninteraction rates can be dominant over the two-body capture channel. Our work\nstudies in detail the dynamics of PBHs inside DM halos, advancing our\nunderstanding on how the current gravitational-wave events constrain the\nproperties of PBHs. Moreover, we make predictions in a redshift range to be\nprobed by future observatories.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
