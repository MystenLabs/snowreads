It is shown that, despite additional algebraic or\nanalytic techniques are introduced due to new singular structures, there exists\na consistency of the inverse scattering theories for different backgrounds such\nas the vacuum, $1$-line solitons, and multi line solitons.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"SGqXJYWgrbsRmVLYgYOLXz_LyblQSEihsn90bMddacI","pdfSize":"698396"}
