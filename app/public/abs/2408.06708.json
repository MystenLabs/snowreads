Uncertainty relations between\ncoordinates and coarse-grained velocity can produce a phenomenon similar to\nquantum entanglement, where temperature plays the role of Planck's constant.\nThe theoretical analysis matches the experimental results, confirming that the\ninterconnected particles exhibit Brownian quantum-inspired classical\ncorrelation entanglement. This effect arises from a coarse grained description\nof Brownian motion and vanishes at a finer resolution. {The coarsening scales\nrange is measured too.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
