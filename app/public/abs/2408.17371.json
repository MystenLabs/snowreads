It\ncomputes the star radiance from the photometric data in Gaia and Hipparcos\ncatalogues, adding the contributions of the diffuse galactic and extragalactic\nlight, zodiacal light and airglow, and taking into account the effects of\natmospheric attenuation and scattering. The model allows computing the natural\nsky brightness in any given photometric band for a ground-based observer, if\nappropriate transformations from the Gaia bands are available. In this work we\npresent the most recent improvements of the model, including the use of Gaia\nEDR3 data, the inclusion of a wide set of photometric bands and the derivation\nof additional sky brightness indicators, as the horizontal irradiance and the\naverage hemispheric radiance\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
