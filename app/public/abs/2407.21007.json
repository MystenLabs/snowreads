Technical debt (TD) has long been one of the key factors\ninfluencing the maintainability of software products. It represents technical\ncompromises that sacrifice long-term software quality for potential short-term\nbenefits. Objective. This work is to collectively investigate the\npractitioners' opinions on the various perspectives of TD from a large\ncollection of articles. We find the topics and latent details of each, where\nthe sentiments of the detected opinions are also considered. Method. For such a\npurpose, we conducted a grey literature review on the articles systematically\ncollected from three mainstream technology forums. Furthermore, we adopted\nnatural language processing techniques like topic modeling and sentiment\nanalysis to achieve a systematic and comprehensive understanding. However, we\nadopted ChatGPT to support the topic interpretation. Results. In this study,\n2,213 forum posts and articles were collected, with eight main topics and 43\nsub-topics identified. For each topic, we obtained the practitioners'\ncollective positive and negative opinions. Conclusion. We identified 8 major\ntopics in TD related to software development. Identified challenges by\npractitioners include unclear roles and a lack of engagement. On the other\nhand, active management supports collaboration and mitigates the impact of TD\non the source code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
