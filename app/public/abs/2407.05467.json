key role in the speed and cost-competitiveness of\ndeveloping and deploying advanced AI models. The current demand for powerful AI\ninfrastructure for model training is driven by the emergence of generative AI\nand foundational models, where on occasion thousands of GPUs must cooperate on\na single training job for the model to be trained in a reasonable time.\nDelivering efficient and high-performing AI training requires an end-to-end\nsolution that combines hardware, software and holistic telemetry to cater for\nmultiple types of AI workloads. In this report, we describe IBM's hybrid cloud\ninfrastructure that powers our generative AI model development. This\ninfrastructure includes (1) Vela: an AI-optimized supercomputing capability\ndirectly integrated into the IBM Cloud, delivering scalable, dynamic,\nmulti-tenant and geographically distributed infrastructure for large-scale\nmodel training and other AI workflow steps and (2) Blue Vela: a large-scale,\npurpose-built, on-premises hosting environment that is optimized to support our\nlargest and most ambitious AI model training tasks. Vela provides IBM with the\ndual benefit of high performance for internal use along with the flexibility to\nadapt to an evolving commercial landscape. Blue Vela provides us with the\nbenefits of rapid development of our largest and most ambitious models, as well\nas future-proofing against the evolving model landscape in the industry. Taken\ntogether, they provide IBM with the ability to rapidly innovate in the\ndevelopment of both AI models and commercial offerings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
