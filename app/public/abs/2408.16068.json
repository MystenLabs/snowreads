This study\naimed to identify key biomarkers associated with stage III NSCLC in non-smoking\nfemales using gene expression profiling from the GDS3837 dataset. Utilizing\nXGBoost, a machine learning algorithm, the analysis achieved a strong\npredictive performance with an AUC score of 0.835. The top biomarkers\nidentified - CCAAT enhancer binding protein alpha (C/EBP-alpha), lactate\ndehydrogenase A4 (LDHA), UNC-45 myosin chaperone B (UNC-45B), checkpoint kinase\n1 (CHK1), and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 subunit alpha (HIF-1-alpha) - have\nbeen validated in the literature as being significantly linked to lung cancer.\nThese findings highlight the potential of these biomarkers for early diagnosis\nand personalized therapy, emphasizing the value of integrating machine learning\nwith molecular profiling in cancer research.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Genomics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
