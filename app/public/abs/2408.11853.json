We describe a Python interface to Marian NMT, a\nC++-based training and inference toolkit for sequence-to-sequence models,\nfocusing on machine translation. This interface enables models trained with\nMarian to be connected to the rich, wide range of tools available in Python. A\nhighlight of the interface is the ability to compute state-of-the-art COMET\nmetrics from Python but using Marian's inference engine, with a speedup factor\nof up to 7.8$\\times$ the existing implementations. We also briefly spotlight a\nnumber of other integrations, including Jupyter notebooks, connection with\nprebuilt models, and a web app interface provided with the package. PyMarian is\navailable in PyPI via $\\texttt{pip install pymarian}$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"77t6oAUukGOKsZXyhJc-3ummS_1rlBtIM07lrw9Tu7M","pdfSize":"302094"}
