Recently, Barmak\nstrengthened this to a simple-homotopy-equivalence. We reprove Barmak's result\nusing a combinatorial argument that constructs an explicit acyclic matching in\nthe sense of discrete Morse theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Z-VbnYoU4PZSpoTTyXRIh8dO6PUfJcMZnN0bE5BdiDw","pdfSize":"224337"}
