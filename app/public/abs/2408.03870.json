Under general\nconditions on the potential interaction term, we provide uniform bounds,\ndemonstrate the existence of symmetric solitons, and identify conditions under\nwhich monotonicity is lost. Additionally, we present new properties of black\nsolitons. Moreover, we establish the nonlocal-to-local convergence, i.e. the\nconvergence of the soliton of the nonlocal model toward the explicit dark\nsolitons of the local Gross-Pitaevskii equation.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"grbjJSg54iVGWnQ5-NO5DdGxn7F3OTcsK_iXvdgVbos","pdfSize":"902323"}
