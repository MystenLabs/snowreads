In addition to the\nexpected cost of providing the insurance, the firm must consider the other\noffers likely to be made to the customer, and how sensitive the customer is to\ndifferences in price. Moreover, firms often target a specific portfolio of\ncustomers that could depend on, e.g., age, location, and occupation. Given such\na target portfolio, firms may choose to modulate an individual customer's offer\nbased on whether the firm desires the customer within their portfolio. We term\nthe problem of modulating offers to achieve a desired target portfolio the\nportfolio pursuit problem. Having formulated the portfolio pursuit problem as a\nsequential decision making problem, we devise a novel reinforcement learning\nalgorithm for its solution. We test our method on a complex synthetic market\nenvironment, and demonstrate that it outperforms a baseline method which mimics\ncurrent industry approaches to portfolio pursuit.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"OEu5B1L9G3TkHKtqQLbS-gQHKWMgyM_jf-q-FoZGbQw","pdfSize":"616416","txDigest":"7zA1w2pGXXDGnoFpcuDPBG7nsViQtHeMqAadraczsjTf","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
