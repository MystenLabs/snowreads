In 2005, de\nGennes proposed that the way to explain the glass transition in simple terms\nwas to construct the cluster model of molecules in contact with all existing\nglass models and to refine the picture of the mean-field hard-sphere molecules\n(HSMs) in contact with each other. In the process of refining this picture, we\ndiscovered the two-electron quantum theory derived from the second solution of\nde Gennes n = 0, where the clustered contact of the two HSMs along the z-axis\nis the sequential emergence of the 16 z-direction interface excited quantum\nstates of their coupled electron pair, the two HSMs suddenly overlap by 0.27%\nto form a magic-interface two-dimensional vector. The two coupled electron\norbitals synchronously escaped the two HSMs 16 times, tangent to the magic\ninterface 16 times, and 16 parallel repulsive electron pairs with an interval\nof 5.9987{\\deg}, which is a clustered boson interaction between the two HSMs.\nThis is the common origin of boson peaks in the glass state and electron\npairing in the high-temperature superconductivity. Therefore, the collective\nbehavior of electrons in the two-electron theory can unify the glass transition\nand the high-temperature superconducting transition. This paper is not only a\ncomplete theoretical statement on glass transition, but also a new\ninterpretation of the theory of high-temperature superconductivity, which\nprovides a new theoretical perspective in the search for room-temperature\nsuperconducting materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
