One object is\nspectroscopically confirmed at $z_{\\rm spec}=5.051$, while the other has a\nrobust $z_{\\rm phot}=6.7\\pm0.3$. Thanks to their extremely red colors\n($F277W-F444W\\sim1.7$ mag), these galaxies satisfy the nominal color-selection\nfor the widely-studied ``little red dot\" (LRD) population with the exception of\ntheir spatially-resolved morphologies. The morphology of our targets allows us\nto conclude that their red continuum is dominated by highly obscured stellar\nemission and not by reddened nuclear activity. Using a variety of SED-fitting\ntools and star formation histories, we estimate the stellar masses to be\n$\\log(M_\\star)=11.32^{+0.07}_{-0.15}$ $M_\\odot$ and\n$\\log(M_\\star)=11.2^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$ $M_\\odot$, respectively, with a red\ncontinuum emission dominated by a recent episode of star formation. We then\ncompare their number density to the halo mass function to infer stellar baryon\nfractions of $\\epsilon_\\star\\sim0.25$ and $\\epsilon_\\star\\sim0.5$. Both are\nsignificantly higher than what is commonly observed in lower-z galaxies or more\ndust-obscured galaxies at similar redshifts. With very bright ultra-high-z\nLyman-Break Galaxies and some non-AGN dominated LRDs, such ``extended\" LRDs\nrepresent another population that may require very efficient star formation at\nearly times.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
