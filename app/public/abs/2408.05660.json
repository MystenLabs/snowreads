In this paper we perform a statistical comparison between two\nimportant classes of method for performing these tests. In the first method we\nmeasure the 2-point power spectra between the velocity and density tracers, and\njointly fit these statistics using theoretical models. In the second method we\nuse the density tracers to reconstruct a model velocity field through space,\nwhich we compare with the measured galaxy velocities on a point-by-point basis.\nBy generating an ensemble of numerical simulations in a simplified test\nscenario, we show that the error in the growth rate inferred by the\n\"reconstruction and scaling\" method may be under-estimated, unless the full\ncovariances of the underlying and reconstructed velocity fields are included in\nthe analysis. In this case the inferred growth rate errors agree with both the\npower spectrum method and a Fisher matrix forecast. We provide a roadmap for\nevaluating these covariances, considering reconstruction performed using both a\nFourier basis within a cuboid, and a Spherical Fourier-Bessel basis within a\ncurved-sky observational volume.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"jlV1X3CtMFarPYJGlV4VD7_gew6qD0oiIy4_uBooY4g","pdfSize":"934381"}
