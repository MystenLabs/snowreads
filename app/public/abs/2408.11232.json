It is known that a sum-free subset of ${\\mathbb F}_p^n$ can have at\nmost the size $\\frac13(p+1)p^{n-1}$ and that, up to automorphisms of ${\\mathbb\nF}_p^n$, the only extremal example is the `cuboid' $\\bigl[\\frac{p+1}3,\n\\frac{2p-1}3\\bigr]\\times {\\mathbb F}_p^{n-1}$.\n  For $p\\ge 11$ we show that if a sum-free subset of ${\\mathbb F}_p^n$ is not\ncontained in such an extremal one, then its size is at most\n$\\frac13(p-2)p^{n-1}$. This bound is optimal and we classify the extremal\nconfigurations. The remaining cases $p=2, 5$ are known to behave differently.\nFor $p=3$ the analogous question was solved by Vsevolod Lev, and for $p\\equiv\n1\\pmod{3}$ it is less interesting.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Exz6e_Tqo-KdmaZRiVH9UNZypwuup4d30HhOdLqx8gg","pdfSize":"599412"}
