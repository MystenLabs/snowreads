We establish the existence and\nuniqueness of solutions in the linear and nonlinear case, emphasizing the\nimportance of small excitations for existence and uniqueness in the nonlinear\ncase. Adopting a multiharmonic formulation, we address the nonlinear\npropagation's harmonic frequencies. An iteration scheme is devised and its\nconvergence under smallness conditions on the excitation is shown. We explore\nnumerical solution to the resulting system of Helmholtz equations, with a\nconforming finite element method for its discretization. Using an\nimplementation of the devised methodology, we showcase how acoustic waves\npropagate within nonlinear media. This study is supposed to enhance our\nunderstanding of ultrasound propagation dynamics, crucial for obtaining\nhigh-quality images from limited boundary measurements.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
