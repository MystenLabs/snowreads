Such kinds of wave equations include 2D relativistic membrane\nequations, 2D membrane equations, and some 2D quasilinear equations which come\nfrom the nonlinear Maxwell equations in electromagnetic theory or from the\ncorresponding Lagrangian functionals as perturbations of the Lagrangian\ndensities of linear wave operators. The main ingredients of the analysis here\ninclude looking for a new good unknown, finding some key identities based on\nthe higher order null conditions and the resulting null frames, as well as\novercoming the difficulties due to the slow decay of solutions to the 2-D wave\nequation, so that the solutions can be estimated precisely.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6LD2PMfQC4YkToxxx-ebXT_ApI5wUD-NDh1Dt11NC9o","pdfSize":"861232"}
