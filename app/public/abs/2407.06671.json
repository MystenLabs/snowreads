Here\nwe focus on the theoretical emergence of a second emission threshold, in\naddition to the one associated with condensation at zero-momentum, due to the\nnonlinear polariton scattering from the condensate into finite momentum\neigenmodes. The physics of this spatially modulated condensate is related to a\nspontaneous breaking of both phase and translational symmetries simultaneously,\nbearing strong similarities with the highly sought supersolid phase in Helium\nand ultracold atomic gases but with a novel mechanism typical of the\ndriven-dissipative scenario. We then propose clear-cut and unequivocal\nexperimental signatures that would allow to identify supersolidity phenomena in\npolariton condensates\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
