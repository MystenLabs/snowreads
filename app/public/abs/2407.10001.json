We define the\nconcepts of classical and quantum effect algebras and show that an effect\nalgebra $E$ is classical if and only if there exists an observable that\nmeasures every effect of $E$. We next consider matrix representations of effect\nalgebras and prove an effect algebra is classical if and only if its matrix\nrepresentation has precisely one row. We then discuss sum table for effect\nalgebras. Although these are not as concise as matrix representations, they\ngive more immediate information about effect sums which are the basic\noperations of an effect algebra. We subsequently study states on effect\nalgebras and prove that classical effect algebras are quantum effect algebras.\nFinally, we consider composites of effect algebras. This allows us to study\ninteracting systems described by effect algebras. We show that two effect\nalgebras are classical if and only if their composite is classical. We point\nout that scale effect algebras are not the only classical effect algebras and\nstress the importance of atoms in this work.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
