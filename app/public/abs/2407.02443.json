The transition is\ndetected via field-ionization of atoms excited from the 2S to the 20P Rydberg\nstate. Precise Monte-Carlo line-shape simulations allow for the accounting of\neffects such as Doppler and AC Stark shifts, while an optical heterodyne\nmeasurement of the excitation laser pulse is used to correct for laser\nfrequency chirp. A value of $1\\,233\\,607\\,210.5\\pm 49.6\\, \\mathrm{MHz}$ was\nobtained. This scheme allows for the measurement of the velocity distribution\nof positronium atoms to correct for the second-order Doppler effect. This is\nthe major source of systematic uncertainty expected for future measurements of\nthis transition with a CW laser, thus, our technique paves the way toward a new\ngeneration of a high precision determination of this interval in positronium.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
