We show that the category of\nspecialization semilattices is isomorphic to the category of semilattices with\na congruence, hence equivalent to the category of semilattice epimorphisms.\n  Guided by the above example, we hint to an ``internal'' characterization of\nsurjective homomorphisms between general relational systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
