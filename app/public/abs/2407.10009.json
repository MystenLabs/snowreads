Offsetting of\nthe active particle from the center of the drop breaks symmetry and leads to\nexcitation of large number of shape modes as well as particle and drop\ndisplacement. Flows due to common singularity representations of active\nparticles, such as Stokeslets, rotlets, and stresslets, are computed and\ncompared to results for non-deformable droplets enclosing active particles. The\neffect of interfacial properties is also investigated. Surfactants adsorbed at\nthe droplet interface immobilize the interface and arrest the droplet motion.\nOur results highlight strategies to steer the flows of active particles and\ncreate autonomously navigating containers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"tn3GbDLzdDoztOwYfR6GTB-6fspCf3UlBSI8SS_MrS0","pdfSize":"26385664"}
