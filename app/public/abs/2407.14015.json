Traditionally,\nstudent engagement is measured through self-reports, which are both\nlabour-intensive and not real-time. An emerging alternative is monitoring\nphysiological signals such as Electrodermal Activity (EDA) and Inter-Beat\nInterval (IBI), which reflect students' emotional and cognitive states. In this\nresearch, we analyzed these signals from 23 students wearing Empatica E4\ndevices in real-world scenarios. Diverging from previous studies focused on lab\nsettings or specific subjects, we examined physiological synchrony at the\nintra-student level across various courses. We also assessed how different\ncourses influence physiological responses and identified consistent temporal\npatterns. Our findings show unique physiological response patterns among\nstudents, enhancing our understanding of student engagement dynamics. This\nopens up possibilities for tailoring educational strategies based on\nunobtrusive sensing data to optimize learning outcomes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
