In this paper, we\npropose a deep learning framework called L-CAPA to learn current distribution\npolicies. In the framework, we find finite-dimensional representations of\nchannel functions and current distributions, allowing them to be inputted into\nand outputted from a deep neural network (DNN) for learning the policy. To\naddress the issue that the integrals in the loss function without closed-form\nexpressions hinder training the DNN in an unsupervised manner, we propose to\ndesign another two DNNs for learning the integrals. The DNNs are designed as\ngraph neural networks to incorporate with the permutation properties of the\nmappings to be learned, thereby improving learning performance. Simulation\nresults show that L-CAPA can achieve the performance upper-bound of optimizing\nprecoding in the SDPA system as the number of antennas approaches infinity, and\nit is with low inference complexity.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
