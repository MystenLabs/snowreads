The\nsystem features a mechanical single-leg setup capable of stepping on various\neasily interchangeable surfaces. Additionally, it incorporates a GRU-based\nSurface Recognition System, inspired by the system detailed in the Dog-Surf\npaper. This setup facilitates the expansion of dataset collection for model\ntraining, enabling data acquisition from hard-to-reach surfaces in laboratory\nconditions. Furthermore, it opens avenues for transferring surface properties\nfrom reality to simulation, thereby allowing the training of optimal gaits for\nlegged robots in simulation environments using a pre-prepared library of\ndigital twins of surfaces. Moreover, enhancements have been made to the\nGRU-based Surface Recognition System, allowing for the integration of data from\nboth the quadruped robot and the single-leg setup. The dataset and code have\nbeen made publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
