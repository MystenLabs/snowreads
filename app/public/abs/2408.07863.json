Our results are achieved by establishing\na splitting lemma, allowing for interlacing triangular arrays of high rank to\nbe decomposed into arrays of lower rank, and by constructing a bijection\nbetween interlacing triangular arrays of rank 3 with certain proper vertex\ncolorings of the triangular grid graph that factors through generalizations of\nKnutson-Tao puzzles. Along the way, we prove one enumerative conjecture of\nAggarwal-Borodin-Wheeler and disprove another.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
