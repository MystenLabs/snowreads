These distribution changes\nresult in performance deterioration; deterioration that continual learning aims\nto alleviate. However, only adaptation with data rehearsal strategies yields\npractically desirable performance for medical image segmentation. Such\nrehearsal violates patient privacy and, as most continual learning approaches,\noverlooks unexpected changes from out-of-distribution instances. To transcend\nboth of these challenges, we introduce a distribution-aware replay strategy\nthat mitigates forgetting through auto-encoding of features, while\nsimultaneously leveraging the learned distribution of features to detect model\nfailure. We provide empirical corroboration on hippocampus and prostate MRI\nsegmentation.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"RcDnhPHuedW04ZFVub3UDdKA4RDZeBIl7slpz_fmv-A","pdfSize":"6524512"}
