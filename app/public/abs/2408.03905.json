Deriving a lower bound for the relative temperature\nbetween the cold and hot reservoirs at which the engine operates, we provide\nexamples of refrigeration cycles in the presence of a uniform gravitational\nfield as well as in the case of a gravitational field produced by a\nnon-rotating spherically symmetric charged body, and the one obtained from the\nvacuum solution of Einstein's field equations in an expanding universe, as a\nfunction of the parameters which describe each spacetime.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
