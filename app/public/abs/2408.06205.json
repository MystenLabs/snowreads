Three\nfeatures affect the fire propagation: (i) a constant basic rate of spread term\naccounting for radiative and convective heat transfer, (ii) the unidirectional,\nconstant ambient wind, and (iii) a fire-induced pyrogenic wind. Two numerical\nmethods are proposed to solve for the harmonic pyrogenic potential. The first\nutilizes the conformal invariance of the Laplace equation, reducing the\nwildfire system to a single Polubarinova-Galin type equation. The second method\nuses a AAA-least squares method to find a rational approximation of the\npotential. Various wildfire scenarios are presented and the effects of the\npyrogenic wind and the radiative/convective basic rate of spread terms\ninvestigated. Firebreaks such as roads and lakes are also included and\nsolutions are found to match well with existing numerical and experimental\nresults. The methods proposed in this work are suitably fast and accurate to be\nconsidered for operational use.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
