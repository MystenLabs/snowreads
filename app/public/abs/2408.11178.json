In particular, we prove that the\nfluctuations are small over exponentially long time scales and obtain\nBerry-Esseen estimates for the fluctuation statistics at any fixed time. Our\nresults provide a mathematical explanation for several numerical observations,\nincluding the scaling relation between system size and frequency of large\nfluctuations, as well as system size induced desynchronization. To our best\nknowledge, these are the first characterizations of mean-field fluctuations on\nnetworks with a degree distribution that follows a power-law, a common feature\nfor many realistic systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
