After giving\na physical insight into the techniques, we show how to use them to deduce the\nabsence of eigenvalues and other spectral properties of electromagnetic quantum\nHamiltonians. We focus on our recent developments in non-self-adjoint settings,\nnamely on Schroedinger operators with matrix-valued potentials, relativistic\noperators of Pauli and Dirac types, and complex Robin boundary conditions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
