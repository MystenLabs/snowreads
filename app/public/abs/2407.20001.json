We show that the\nreflection zeros possess non-zero topological charges, which makes them\ntopologically protected. With a small perturbation of the parameters of the\nstructure (e.g., a change in one of the layer thicknesses), the reflection zero\ndoes not disappear, but shifts in the parameter space, i.e., appears at\ndifferent wavelength and angle of incidence. We demonstrate that with a further\nparameter change, two zeros with opposite topological charges (+1 and -1)\napproach each other, merge, and then disappear. We believe that the obtained\nresults give useful insight regarding the operation of layered\nmetal-dielectric-metal structures possessing reflection zeros.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
