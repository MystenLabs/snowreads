We report the successful etching of both heteroepitaxial\n(-201)-oriented and homoepitaxial (010)-oriented \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 films over a\nwide range of substrate temperature, TBCl molar flows, and reactor pressures.\nWe identify that the likely etchant is HCl (g) formed by the pyrolysis of TBCl\nin the hydrodynamic boundary layer above the substrate. The temperature\ndependence of the etch rate reveals two distinct regimes characterized by\nmarkedly different apparent activation energies. The extracted apparent\nactivation energies suggest that at temperatures below ~800 {\\deg}C the etch\nrate is likely limited by desorption of etch products, while at higher\nsubstrate temperatures chemisorption of HCl limits the etch rate. The relative\netch rates of heteroepitaxial (-201) and homoepitaxial (010) \\b{eta}-Ga2O3 were\nobserved to scale by the ratio of the surface energies indicating an\nanisotropic etch. For (010) homoepitaxial films, relatively smooth post-etch\nsurface morphology was achieved by tuning the etching parameters.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qHuEtfO6Msx4D9Nko2W01aOrRidXzLBk0VSuSq6hLUA","pdfSize":"1124850","txDigest":"9qiBUnSFwFgoEHTBBLiF46UY1evqDvchGbDeUQn5WWEw","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
