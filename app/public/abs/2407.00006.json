To address this challenge, we introduce an\nadaptive method that utilizes two microscale models based on an offline\ndatabase for multiscale modeling of curved interfaces (e.g., adhesive layers).\nThis database employs nonlinear classifiers, developed using Support Vector\nMachines from microscale sampling data, as a preprocessing step for multiscale\nsimulations. Next, we develop a new parallel network library that enables\nseamless model selection with customized communication layers, ensuring\nscalability in parallel computing environments. The correctness and\neffectiveness of the hierarchically parallel solver are verified on a crack\npropagation problem within the curved adhesive layer. Finally, we predict the\nultimate bending moment and adhesive layer failure of a wind turbine blade and\nvalidate the solver on a difficult large-scale engineering problem.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
