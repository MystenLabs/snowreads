Both the ROV and the objects to be mapped are placed in a pool that is\nimaged via an overhead camera. In our prototype mapping application, the ROV's\npose is found using extended Kalman filtering on measurements from the overhead\ncamera, inertial, and pressure sensors; while objects are detected with a deep\nneural network in the ROV camera stream. Validation experiments are performed\nfor pose estimation, detection, and mapping. The litter detection dataset and\ncode are made publicly available.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
