A\ntheorem due to Silverman implies that the rank $r_t$ of the specialization\n$E_t/\\mathbb{Q}$ is at least $r$ for all but finitely many $t \\in \\mathbb{Q}$.\nMoreover, it is conjectured that $r_t \\leq r+2$, except for a set of density\n$0$. In this article, when $E/\\mathbb{Q}(T)$ has a torsion point of order $2$,\nunder an assumption on the discriminant of a Weierstrass equation for\n$E/\\mathbb{Q}(T)$, we produce an upper bound for $r_t$ that is valid for\ninfinitely many $t$. We also present two examples of non-isotrivial elliptic\ncurves $E/\\mathbb{Q}(T)$ such that $r_t \\leq r+1$ for infinitely many $t$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
