A central consideration in practical applications for such\ndevices is the nature of the light-matter interface which determines the\nstorage state density and efficiency. Here, we employ an organic radical,\n$\\alpha$,$\\gamma$-bisdiphenylene-$\\beta$-phenylallyl (BDPA) doped into an\no-terphenyl host to explore the potential for using tuneable and\nhigh-performance molecular media in microwave-based quantum applications. We\ndemonstrate that this radical system exhibits millisecond-long spin-lattice\nrelaxation and microsecond-long phase memory times at room temperature, while\nalso having the capability to generate an oscillating spin-polarized state\nusing a co-dissolved photo-activated tetraphenylporphyrin moiety, all enabled\nby using a viscous liquid host. This latest system builds upon collective\nwisdom from previous molecules-for-quantum literature by combining careful host\nmatrix selection, with dynamical decoupling, and photoexcited triplet-radical\nspin polarisation to realise a versatile and robust quantum spin medium.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
