In particular, we introduce\n$\\mathcal{B}(\\mathcal{H})$-valued versions of the Jaffard algebra, of certain\nweighted Schur-type algebras, of Banach algebras which are defined by more\ngeneral off-diagonal decay conditions than polynomial decay, of weighted\nversions of the Baskakov-Gohberg-Sj\\\"ostrand algebra, and of anisotropic\nvariations of all of these matrix algebras, and show that they are\ninverse-closed in $\\mathcal{B}(\\ell^2(X;\\mathcal{H}))$. In addition, we obtain\nthat each of these Banach algebras is symmetric.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
