However, the correlation of\neach channels of speech features is failed to explore. Theoretically, each\nchannel map of speech features obtained by different convolution kernels\ncontains information with different scales demonstrating strong correlations.\nTo fill this gap, we propose a novel dual-branch architecture named\nchannel-aware dual-branch conformer (CADB-Conformer), which effectively\nexplores the long range time and frequency correlations among different\nchannels, respectively, to extract channel relation aware time-frequency\ninformation. Ablation studies conducted on DNS-Challenge 2020 dataset\ndemonstrate the importance of channel feature leveraging while showing the\nsignificance of channel relation aware T-F information for speech enhancement.\nExtensive experiments also show that the proposed model achieves superior\nperformance than recent methods with an attractive computational costs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
