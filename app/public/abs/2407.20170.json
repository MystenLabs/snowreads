Probability density\nfunctions are propagated directly using the Koopman approximation of the\nsolution flow of the system, where the dynamics have been projected on a\nwell-defined set of basis functions. The prediction technique is derived\nfollowing both the analytical (Galerkin) and numerical (EDMD) derivation of the\nKO, and a least square reduction algorithm assures the recursivity of the\nproposed methodology.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
