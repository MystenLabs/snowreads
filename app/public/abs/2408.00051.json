This paper presents a machine learning (ML)\nbased analysis of the information from the 2023 DRs. We use a natural language\nprocessing (NLP) approach to extract important information from the description\nof a disengagement, and use the k-Means clustering algorithm to group report\nentries together. The cluster frequency is then analyzed, and each cluster is\nmanually categorized based on the factors leading to disengagement. We discuss\nfindings from previous years' DRs, and provide our own analysis to identify\nareas of improvement for AVs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cgo82d-k4eIjaZWKMs-V5Y6z_gwZv_xK34yYkyyHG60","pdfSize":"524822","txDigest":"CYdk9d5BybFGqQBXUnVUnWrdqAM9MA8j2wUfpHmk6khD","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
