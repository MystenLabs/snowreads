Surprisingly, the derivation leads to a set\n  of geometric constraints that the lattice field theory must\n  satisfy. Monte Carlo simulations are in agreement with the exact\n  Ising CFT on $\\mathbb S^2$. We discuss the inherent benefits of using\n  non-uniform simplicial lattices and how these methods may be\n  generalized for use with other quantum theories on curved manifolds.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
