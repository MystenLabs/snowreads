A promising approach for multispectral snapshot\nimaging are camera arrays. Image processing is necessary to warp all different\nviews to the same view to retrieve a consistent multispectral datacube. This\nprocess is also called multispectral image registration. After a cross spectral\ndisparity estimation, an occlusion detection is required to find the pixels\nthat were not recorded by the peripheral cameras. In this paper, a novel fast\nedge-aware occlusion detection is presented, which is shown to reduce the\nruntime by at least a factor of 12. Moreover, an evaluation on ground truth\ndata reveals better performance in terms of precision and recall. Finally, the\nquality of a final multispectral datacube can be improved by more than 1.5 dB\nin terms of PSNR as well as in terms of SSIM in an existing multispectral\nregistration pipeline.
