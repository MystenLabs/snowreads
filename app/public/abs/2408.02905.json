By employing the\nWigner quasi-probability distribution and the star product, we show that the\nteleported energy is proportional to the amount of entanglement present in the\ninitial ground state. Further, we introduce the Husimi $Q$-function on a Bloch\ncoherent state in order to determine the Wehrl entropy of the system. Finally,\nthe Wherl entropy enable us to compute the consumption of coherence and\nentanglement throughout the protocol.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
