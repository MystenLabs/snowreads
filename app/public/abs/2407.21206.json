To address this problem, Masa\\v{r}\\'ik\nand Hlin\\v{e}n\\'y [GD 2023] recently asked for each edge of $G$ to be drawn\nwithout crossings while allowing multiple different drawings of $G$. More\nformally, a collection $\\mathcal{D}$ of drawings of $G$ is uncrossed if, for\neach edge $e$ of $G$, there is a drawing in $\\mathcal{D}$ such that $e$ is\nuncrossed. The uncrossed number $\\mathrm{unc}(G)$ of $G$ is then the minimum\nnumber of drawings in some uncrossed collection of $G$.\n  No exact values of the uncrossed numbers have been determined yet, not even\nfor simple graph classes. In this paper, we provide the exact values for\nuncrossed numbers of complete and complete bipartite graphs, partly confirming\nand partly refuting a conjecture posed by Hlin\\v{e}n\\'y and Masa\\v{r}\\'ik. We\nalso present a strong general lower bound on $\\mathrm{unc}(G)$ in terms of the\nnumber of vertices and edges of $G$. Moreover, we prove NP-hardness of the\nrelated problem of determining the edge crossing number of a graph $G$, which\nis the smallest number of edges of $G$ taken over all drawings of $G$ that\nparticipate in a crossing. This problem was posed as open by Schaefer in his\nbook [Crossing Numbers of Graphs 2018].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
