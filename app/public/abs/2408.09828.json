The calculations\nwere performed exactly in the coupling constant. We found the first three\nleading terms of the charge density asymptotics at small distances. Using this\nresult, we demonstrate that the impurity with charge number $Z=1$ remains\nsubcritical at any value of the coupling constant, whereas impurities with\nhigher charge number could become supercritical at certain coupling constant\nvalues. Such a behavior is similar to that in graphene.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-xTLQ7upDgXklb1klrRcbYobnOhFE98uThqYQJ1cGTg","pdfSize":"398116"}
