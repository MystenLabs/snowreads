Among the myriad of CVNN architectures, the phase-transmittance\nradial basis function neural network (PT-RBF) stands out, especially when\noperating in noisy environments such as 5G MIMO systems. Despite its\ncapabilities, achieving convergence in multi-layered, multi-input, and\nmulti-output PT-RBFs remains a daunting challenge. Addressing this gap, this\npaper presents a novel Deep PT-RBF parameter initialization technique. Through\nrigorous simulations conforming to 3GPP TS 38 standards, our method not only\noutperforms conventional initialization strategies like random, $K$-means, and\nconstellation-based methods but is also the only approach to achieve successful\nconvergence in deep PT-RBF architectures. These findings pave the way to more\nrobust and efficient neural network deployments in complex digital\ncommunication systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
