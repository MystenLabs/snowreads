This is partly because 2-body interactions can\nproduce an arbitrary time evolution, a fundamental fact often called the\nuniversality of 2-local gates in the context of quantum computing. However,\nwhen an unknown Hamiltonian respects a U(1) symmetry such as charge or particle\nnumber conservation, N-body interactions exhibit a distinct symmetry-protected\nsignature known as the N-body phase, which fewer-body interactions cannot\nmimic. We develop and demonstrate an efficient technique for the detection of\n3-body interactions despite the presence of unknown 2-body interactions. This\ntechnique, which takes advantage of GHZ states for phase estimation, requires\nprobing the unitary evolution and measuring its determinant in a small subspace\nthat scales linearly with the system size, making it an efficient approach.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
