We first consider the configuration of a dimer array coupled to\na waveguide. The results show that if the intra- and inter-cell phase delays\nare properly designed, the center and the width of the band gaps, as well as\nthe dispersion relation of the passbands can be modified by adjusting the\nintra-cell coupling strength. These manipulations provide ways to control the\npropagating modes in the waveguide, leading to some interesting effects such as\nslowing or even stopping a single-photon pulse. Finally, we take the case of\nthe tetramer chain as an example to show that, in the case of a larger number\nof atoms in each unit cell, tunable multi-gap structures and more sophisticated\nband-gap engineering can be realized. Our proposal provides efficient ways for\nphotonic band-gap engineering in micro- and nano-quantum systems, which may\nfacilitate the manipulation of photon transport in future quantum networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"9fr1novK-xey8O5z0GnXHkOb5hPHr325FwjIl-00Rr0","pdfSize":"18377931"}
