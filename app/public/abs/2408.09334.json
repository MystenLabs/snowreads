These\ncodes can provide error correction capability higher than the codes derived\nfrom the traditional stabilizer formalism. In this paper, we first give a\ns-Galois hulls decomposition of linear codes over finite fields. By means of\nthis decomposition, we provide a method to construct EAQEC codes. Using this\nmethod, we construct new EAQEC codes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Rings and Algebras","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
