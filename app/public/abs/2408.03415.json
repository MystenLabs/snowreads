These models have significantly\ncontributed to designing and evaluating effective control strategies during\npandemics. However, the increasing complexity and the number of parameters\nneeded to describe rapidly evolving transmission scenarios present significant\nchallenges for parameter estimation due to intractable likelihoods. To overcome\nthis issue, likelihood-free methods have proven effective for accurately and\nefficiently fitting these models to data. In this study, we focus on\napproximate Bayesian computation (ABC) and synthetic likelihood methods for\nparameter inference. We develop a method that employs ABC to select the most\ninformative subset of summary statistics, which are then used to construct a\nsynthetic likelihood for posterior sampling. Posterior sampling is performed\nusing Hamiltonian Monte Carlo as implemented in the Stan software. The proposed\nalgorithm is demonstrated through simulation studies, showing promising results\nfor inference in a simulated epidemic scenario.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mi3chOXOQB3CexsZKFBvocyXQTOptaOtrz8-BNlFfeY","pdfSize":"687131"}
