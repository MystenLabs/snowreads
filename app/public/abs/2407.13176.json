The agents are equipped with sensors that provide\ndirectional measurements and relative attitude measurements. We present a\nbottom-up approach where each agent runs an extended Kalman filter (EKF)\nlocally using directional measurements and augments this with relative attitude\nmeasurements provided by neighbouring agents. The covariance estimates of the\nrelative attitude measurements are geometrically corrected to compensate for\nrelative attitude between the agent that makes the measurement and the agent\nthat uses the measurement before being fused with the local estimate using the\nconvex combination ellipsoid (CCE) method to avoid data incest. Simulations are\nundertaken to numerically evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
