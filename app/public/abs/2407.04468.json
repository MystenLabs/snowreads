To explore the reasons involved, we studied\nthe temperature dependence of Hall coefficient in $Cr_{1-x}V_x$, $V_{2-y}O_3$\nand some high-$T_c$ superconducting cuprates. We argue that it can be\nrationalized using the following unifying principle:\\textit{ When a system is\nnear a magnetic instability and temperature is reduced towards the instability,\nthere is a progressive \"loss\" of carriers (progressive \"tying down\" of\nelectrons) as they participate in long-lived and long-ranged magnetic\ncorrelations.} In other words, magnetic correlations grow in space and are\nlonger-lived as temperature is reduced towards the magnetic instability. This\nis the mechanism behind reduced carrier density with reducing temperature and\nleads to an enhancement of the Hall coefficient. This unifying principle is\nimplemented and quantitative analysis is done using the Gor'kov Teitel'baum\nThermal Activation (GTTA) model. We also show that the Hall angle data can be\nunderstood using one relaxation time (in contrast to the \"two-relaxation\" times\nidea of Anderson) by taking into consideration of temperature dependence of\ncarrier density. This unifying principle is shown to be working in above\nstudied systems, but authors believe that it is of much more general validity.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
