We explore the problem\nof computing a state of minimum potential in this setting. Using the maximum\nnumber of resources that a player can use at a time, and the possible symmetry\nin the players' strategy spaces, we settle the complexity of the problem for\ninstances having monotone (i.e., either non-decreasing or non-increasing)\nlatency functions on their resources. The picture, delineating polynomial and\nNP-hard cases, is complemented with tight approximation algorithms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
