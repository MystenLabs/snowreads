The current top-performing prototypical learning methods\nemploy prototypes originating from support samples to direct the classification\nof query points. However, the inherent fragility of point-level matching and\nthe prevalent intra-class diversity pose great challenges to this\ncross-instance matching paradigm, leading to erroneous background activations\nor incomplete target excavation. In this work, we propose a simple yet\neffective framework in the spirit of Decoupled Localization and Expansion\n(DLE). The proposed DLE, including a structural localization module (SLM) and a\nself-expansion module (SEM), enjoys several merits. First, structural\ninformation is injected into the matching process through the agent-level\ncorrelation in SLM, and the confident target region can thus be precisely\nlocated. Second, more reliable intra-object similarity is harnessed in SEM to\nderive the complete target, and the conservative expansion strategy is\nintroduced to reasonably constrain the expansion. Extensive experiments on two\nchallenging benchmarks under different settings demonstrate that DLE\noutperforms previous state-of-the-art approaches by large margins.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
