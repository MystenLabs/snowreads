FMs, large neural networks trained on massive datasets, excel in\ndiverse tasks with remarkable adaptability and generality. However, geoscience\nfaces challenges like lacking curated training datasets and high computational\ncosts for developing specialized FMs. This study considers adapting FMs from\ncomputer vision to geoscience, analyzing their scale, adaptability, and\ngenerality for geoscientific data analysis. We introduce a workflow that\nleverages existing computer vision FMs, fine-tuning them for geoscientific\ntasks, reducing development costs while enhancing accuracy. Through\nexperiments, we demonstrate this workflow's effectiveness in broad applications\nto process and interpret geoscientific data of lunar images, seismic data, DAS\narrays and so on. Our findings introduce advanced ML techniques to geoscience,\nproving the feasibility and advantages of cross-domain FMs adaptation, driving\nfurther advancements in geoscientific data analysis and offering valuable\ninsights for FMs applications in other scientific domains.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
