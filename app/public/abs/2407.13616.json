We explore various path slicing methods, including k-means\nand anti-k-means clustering, to divide the TSP into manageable subproblems.\nThese are then solved using quantum or classical solvers. Our analysis,\nperformed on multiple TSP instances from the TSPlib, demonstrates the ability\nof our strategies to achieve near-optimal solutions efficiently, highlighting\nsignificant improvements in solving efficiency and resource utilization. This\napproach paves the way for future applications in larger combinatorial\noptimization scenarios, advancing the field of quantum optimization.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
