Recently, the advent of valleytronics has conceptualized\na valley spin valve (VSV) - a device that utilizes the valley degree of freedom\nand spin-valley locking to achieve a similar valve effect without relying on\nmagnetism. In this study, we propose a non-volatile VSV (n-VSV) based on a\ntwo-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric semiconductor where the resistance of the\nn-VSV is controlled by the ferroelectric domain wall between the two uniformly\npolarized domains. Focusing on the 1T'' phase of MoS2, which is known to be\nferroelectric down to a monolayer and using density functional theory (DFT)\ncombined with the quantum-transport calculations, we demonstrate that switching\nbetween the uniformly polarized state and the state with oppositely polarized\ndomains separated by a domain wall results in resistance change of as high as\n10^7. This giant VSV effect occurs due to transmission being strongly dependent\non matching (mismatching) the valley-dependent spin polarizations in the two\ndomains with the same (opposite) ferroelectric polarization orientations, when\nthe chemical potential of 1T''-MoS2 lies within the spin-split valleys. Our\nwork paves a new route for realizing high-performance nonvolatile\nvalleytronics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
