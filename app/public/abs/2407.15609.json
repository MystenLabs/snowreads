Our purpose here is to study the role of interactions in this model\nsystem when it is far from equilibrium. We therefore take both the sample and\nthe nanoprobe to be described by a Hubbard model with on-site repulsive\ninteractions and nearest-neighbor hopping. We compute the behavior of the local\nparticle density and the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of time\nusing time-dependent matrix product states at quarter and at half filling,\nfillings at which the chain realizes a Luttinger liquid or a Mott insulator,\nrespectively. This allows us to study in detail the oscillation of the\nparticles between the sample and the nanoprobe. While, for noninteracting\nsystems, the LDOS is time-independent, in the presence of interactions, the\nbackflow of electrons to the sample will lead to nontrivial dynamics in the\nLDOS. In particular, studying the time-dependent LDOS allows us to study how\nthe Mott gap closes locally and how this melting of the Mott insulator\npropagates through the system in time after such a local perturbation -- a\nbehavior that we envisage can be investigated in future experiments on\nultrashort time scales or on optical lattices using microscopy setups.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
