This was previously\nknown for $\\beta\\ge \\log_2(3/2)\\approx 0.585$. Improved bounds are also\nobtained at the critical exponent $\\beta=0.5$, including a bound that is\nasymptotically sharp for small subsets. A key ingredient is a new Bellman-type\nfunction involving the Gaussian isoperimetric profile which appears to be a\ngood approximation of the true envelope function. Verification uses\ncomputer-assisted proofs and interval arithmetic. Applications include progress\ntowards a conjecture of Kahn and Park as well as sharp Poincar\\'e inequalities\nfor Boolean-valued functions near $L^1$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
