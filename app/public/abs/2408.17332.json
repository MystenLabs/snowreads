However, not all videos become outdated; certain classic\nvideos can still attract user's attention. Such bias along temporal dimension\ncan be further aggravated by the matching model between users and videos,\nbecause the model learns from preexisting interactions. From real data, we\nobserve that different videos have varying sensitivities to recency in\nattracting users' attention. Our analysis, based on a causal graph modeling\nshort-video recommendation, suggests that the release interval serves as a\nconfounder, establishing a backdoor path between users and videos. To address\nthis confounding effect, we propose a model-agnostic causal architecture called\nLearning to Deconfound the Release Interval Bias (LDRI). LDRI enables jointly\nlearning of the matching model and the video recency sensitivity perceptron. In\nthe inference stage, we apply a backdoor adjustment, effectively blocking the\nbackdoor path by intervening on each video. Extensive experiments on two\nbenchmarks demonstrate that LDRI consistently outperforms backbone models and\nexhibits superior performance against state-of-the-art models. Additional\ncomprehensive analyses confirm the deconfounding capability of LDRI.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
