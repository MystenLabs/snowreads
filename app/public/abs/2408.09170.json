We also\naddress the peridynamic fractional anisotropic $p-$Laplacian. A secondary\nobjective is to explore anisotropic fractional Sobolev spaces with variable\nexponents, where we also derive new BBM-type results. Additionally, we address\nthe eigenvalue problem in the isotropic case.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
