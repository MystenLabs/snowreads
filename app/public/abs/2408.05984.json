It is known that\nu-cycles for permutations exist, and they have been considered in the\nliterature in several papers from different points of view.\n  In this paper, we show how to construct a family of u-cycles for\nmulti-dimensional permutations, which is based on applying an appropriate\ngreedy algorithm. Our construction is a generalisation of the greedy way by Gao\net al. to construct u-cycles for permutations. We also note the existence of\nu-cycles for $d$-dimensional matrices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8Q5BFzGuBFe5XNlPU33fhPSMyq_m9JZGvomAD18Vdlw","pdfSize":"182561"}
