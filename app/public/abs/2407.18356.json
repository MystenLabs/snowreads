In a 2024 paper with C. Doran and\nM. Kerr, the author previously deduced two consequences of this conjecture; one\nrelating zeroes of higher normal function to the spectra of operators of genus\none curves, the other connecting integral regulators of $K_2$-classes on mirror\ncurves to dilogarithm values at algebraic arguments. We now show that the\nlatter continues to hold in the presence of a mass parameter, thus expanding\nthe range of the conjecture.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/K-Theory and Homology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"xmOY8k2sUE4cow7h6GKoEdiBHyO6eZNh5V-cmf_Itmc","pdfSize":"232675"}
