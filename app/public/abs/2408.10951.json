In time series forecasting\n(TSF), where accurate predictions are crucial in fields like finance,\nhealthcare, and manufacturing, traditional augmentation methods for\nclassification tasks are insufficient to maintain temporal coherence. This\nresearch introduces two augmentation approaches using the discrete wavelet\ntransform (DWT) to adjust frequency elements while preserving temporal\ndependencies in time series data. Our methods, Wavelet Masking (WaveMask) and\nWavelet Mixing (WaveMix), are evaluated against established baselines across\nvarious forecasting horizons. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first\nstudy to conduct extensive experiments on multivariate time series using\nDiscrete Wavelet Transform as an augmentation technique. Experimental results\ndemonstrate that our techniques achieve competitive results with previous\nmethods. We also explore cold-start forecasting using downsampled training\ndatasets, comparing outcomes to baseline methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"1vXMF5hXSWqZTumHgG-_cDY0tY8XkZuLA9x5RKqPN2M","pdfSize":"2793651"}
