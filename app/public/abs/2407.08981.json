Second, on this\nbasis, the joint flexible bandwidth allocation is adopted to adapt the offer to\ndemand at the same time. This strategy allows both beam capacity and load to be\nadjusted to cope with the traffic demand. The new information generated during\nthe load transfer process of flexible beam-user mapping can guide the direction\nof beam optimization. Then, the proposed strategies are tested against joint\npower-bandwidth allocation and joint optimization of bandwidth and beam-user\nmapping under different traffic profiles. Numerical results are obtained for\nvarious non-uniform traffic distributions to evaluate the performance of the\nsolutions. Results show that flexible joint load and capacity scheduling are\nsuperior to other strategies in terms of demand satisfaction with acceptable\ncomplexity.
