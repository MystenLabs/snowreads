When these\nmodels are deployed in the real world, the need for alignment is magnified due\nto the potential cost to life and infrastructure due to unexpected faliures.\nTemporal Logic specifications have long provided a way to constrain system\nbehaviors and are a natural fit for these use cases. In this work, we propose a\nnovel approach to factor in signal temporal logic specifications while using\nautoregressive transformer models for trajectory planning. We also provide a\ntrajectory dataset for pretraining and evaluating foundation models. Our\nproposed technique acheives 74.3 % higher specification satisfaction over the\nbaselines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"abHtUmnGb7ja39xb0GXjz9zdB6N2zqhn8PoZ94J9LDg","pdfSize":"337795"}
