To constrain the model parameters, we use the\nMCMC technique, allowing for effective exploration of the model's parameters.\nWe apply this approach to analyze 31 points of observational Hubble Data (OHD),\n1048 points from the Pantheon data, and additional CMB data. We consider three\nscenarios: when $n$ is a free parameter (Case I), when $n=0$ (Case II), and\nwhen $n=1$ (Case III). In our analysis across all three cases, we observe that\nour model portrays the universe's evolution from a matter-dominated decelerated\nepoch to an accelerated epoch, as indicated by the corresponding deceleration\nparameter. In addition, we investigate the physical behavior of total energy\ndensity, total EoS parameter, and jerk parameter. Our findings consistently\nindicate that all cosmological parameters predict an accelerated expansion\nphase of the universe for all three cases ($q_0<0$, $\\omega_0<-\\frac{1}{3}$,\n$j_0>0$). Furthermore, our analysis reveals that the $Om(z)$ diagnostics for\nCases I and III align with the quintessence region, while Case II corresponds\nto the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
