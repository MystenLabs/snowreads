Employing a\ncomprehensive literature review, course websites analysis, and a detailed case\nstudy, the research identifies best practices for incorporating HCI datasets\ninto project-based ML education. Key f indings demonstrate increased student\nengagement, motivation, and skill development through hands-on projects, while\ninstructors benefit from effective tools for teaching complex concepts. The\nstudy also addresses challenges such as data complexity and resource\nallocation, offering recommendations for future improvements. These insights\nprovide a valuable framework for educators aiming to bridge the gap between\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
