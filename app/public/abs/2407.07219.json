These objects exhibit how the geometric structure of the Sliced\nWasserstein space differs from the Wasserstein space, and provides a simple\nexample of how solving the barycenter and gradient flow problems change when\nmoving between these metrics. Some of these geodesics will only be H\\\"older\ncontinuous with respect to the Wasserstein metric and thus will provide a\ndirect proof that Sliced-Wasserstein and regular Wasserstein metrics are not\nequivalent. Previous proofs of this were done for various cases in [2] and [5].\nThis paper, not only provides a direct proof, but also fills in gaps showing\nthese metrics not equivalent in dimensions greater than 2.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M2dHmEPhdyjtDzqX-KZxxaNnibUhI35vlGFwzhGdBLk","pdfSize":"341778"}
