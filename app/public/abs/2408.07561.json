We consider two different scenarios:\nfirst, the classical stability of gauged Q-balls with respect to generic\nthree-dimensional perturbations, and second, the behaviour of gauged Q-balls\nduring head-on and off-axis collisions at relativistic velocities. With regards\nto stability, we find that there exist gauged Q-ball configurations which are\nclassically stable in both logarithmic and polynomial scalar field models. With\nregards to relativistic collisions, we find that the dynamics can depend on\nmany different parameters such as the collision velocity, relative phase,\nrelative charge, and impact parameter of the colliding Q-balls.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
