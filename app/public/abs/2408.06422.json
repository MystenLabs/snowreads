There is a popular myth in the field that the length\nscale of collective neutrino oscillation is related to the strength of\nself-interaction potential; this is a result of confusion between the length\nscale and time scale. As a consequence of this myth, it is believed that the\nconvergence of numerical simulation of quantum kinetic equations requires a\nspatial resolution (radial bin size) that is equal to the inverse of the\nself-interaction potential. I try to debunk this myth in this paper.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"qzN61sivRmOBvqG6GVEfM8oWUOcaN8muGzIXWicPs3U","pdfSize":"682144"}
