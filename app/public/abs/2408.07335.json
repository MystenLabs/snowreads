Expanding\nthe sample of CL AGN is helpful to reveal the mechanism. This study aims to\nidentify more CL AGNs by cross-matching spectroscopic data from the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber\nSpectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST). Our approach to identify CL AGN candidates is\nbased on the automatic spectral fitting, followed by detailed visual\ninspections. Through this method, we present a sample of 88 CL AGNs, in which\n77 sources being newly discovered. Within this sample, 59 CL AGNs primarily\nshow the variability of the H$\\beta$ line, 22 exhibit changes in both the\nH$\\beta$ and H$\\alpha$ lines, and 7 mainly display variations in the H$\\alpha$\nline. Our findings reveal that the sequence of appearance and disappearance of\nthe BELs aligns with the known CL sequence. We estimate the black hole mass and\nEddington ratio for these CL AGNs, which range from $2.5\\times 10^6$ to\n$8.0\\times 10^8 M_\\odot$ and from 0.001 to 0.13, respectively. The Eddington\nratio is lower than that of most typical AGNs, and is consistent with the\nresults of previous studies on CL AGN. Our results support the hypothesis that\nthe CL behavior is driven by the state transitions of the accretion disk.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
