{"id":"2408.01440","title":"To Be, Or Not To Be?: Regulating Impossible AI in the United States","authors":"Maanas Kumar Sharma","authorsParsed":[["Sharma","Maanas Kumar",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Sat, 20 Jul 2024 08:37:13 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-06","timestamp":1721464633000,"abstract":"  Many AI systems are deployed even when they do not work. Some AI will simply\nnever be able to perform the task it claims to perform. We call such systems\nImpossible AI. This paper seeks to provide an integrated introduction to\nImpossible AI in the United States and guide advocates, both technical and\npolicy, to push forward regulation of Impossible AI in the U.S. The paper\ntracks three examples of Impossible AI through their development, deployment,\ncriticism, and government regulation (or lack thereof). We combine this with an\nanalysis of the fundamental barriers in the way of current calls for Impossible\nAI regulation and then offer areas and directions in which to focus advocacy.\nIn particular, we advance a functionality-first approach that centers the\nfundamental impossibility of these systems and caution against criti-hype. This\nwork is part of a broader shift in the community to focus on validity\nchallenges to AI, the decision not to deploy technical systems, and connecting\ntechnical work with advocacy.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"g6TKxjHraF2WPhVNTc1MRQW74aKJ4HkY19qJEn38lIw","pdfSize":"303103"}
