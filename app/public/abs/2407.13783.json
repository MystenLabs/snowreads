The\nenvironment motion is modelled by the stochastic Navier--Stokes equation, which\nincludes both a fluid in thermal equilibrium and a turbulent fluid. The surface\nis described by the generalized Pavlik's stochastic equation. As a result of\nfulfilling the renormalizability requirement, the model necessarily involves an\ninfinite number of coupling constants. The one-loop counterterm is derived in\nan explicit closed form. The corresponding renormalization group equations\ndemonstrate the existence of three two-dimensional surfaces of fixed points in\nthe infinite-dimensional parameter space. If the surfaces contain IR attractive\nregions, the problem allows for the large-scale, long-time scaling behaviour.\nFor the first surface (advection is irrelevant) the critical dimensions of the\nheight field $\\Delta_{h}$, the response field $\\Delta_{h'}$ and the frequency\n$\\Delta_{\\omega}$ are non-universal through the dependence on the effective\ncouplings. For the other two surfaces (advection is relevant) the dimensions\nare universal and they are found exactly.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L4e6YpoxWIZgvspDsZwm4KZHtVYL5a0NtNwIkXQBIQw","pdfSize":"243909","objectId":"0x2c98e07c953bd31e0a7cae2a970398b5797fbd5b35749f137e56529d29291d8a","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
