SZ involves the chronic\nrelease of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) and their utilization\nfor the synthesis of stress-induced plasticity agents such as endocannabinoids\n(ECBs). The causal event in SZ is prolonged stress during a sensitive period,\nwhich can induce prolonged and heritable changes. The physiological effect of\nthe released PUFAs and their products is to disconnect neurons from their\ninputs and promote intrinsic excitability. I show that these effects can\nexplain the positive, negative, cognitive, and mood symptoms of SZ, as well as\nthe mechanisms of many known triggers of psychosis. The theory is supported by\noverwhelming evidence addressing lipids, immunity, ECBs, neuromodulators,\nhormones, neurotransmitters, and cortical parameters in SZ. It explains why\nantipsychotic drugs are effective against positive symptoms, and why they do\nnot affect the other symptoms. Finally, I present promising treatment\ndirections implied by the theory, including some that are immediately\navailable.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"moVaRLkTNoKvBHAyWd1scL3Tgbjaq_VJqeu6e7jBB5M","pdfSize":"508626"}
