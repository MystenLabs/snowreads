However, quantifying their information\ntransmission capacity remains challenging. Here, we engineer an isolated cAMP\nsignaling channel in Pseudomonas aeruginosa using targeted gene knockouts,\noptogenetics, and a fluorescent cAMP probe. This design allows precise optical\ncontrol and real-time monitoring of cAMP dynamics. By integrating experimental\ndata with information theory, we reveal an optimal frequency for light-mediated\ncAMP signaling that maximizes information transmission, reaching about 40\nbits/h. This rate correlates strongly with cAMP degradation kinetics and\nemploys a two-state encoding scheme. Our findings suggest a mechanism for\nfine-tuned regulation of multiple genes through temporal encoding of second\nmessenger signals, providing new insights into bacterial adaptation strategies.\nThis approach offers a framework for quantifying information processing in\ncellular signaling systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Biological Physics","Quantitative Biology/Molecular Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ueREa0T96VNl3T7gZwKEFfcSSCRgTjyjnDviC4KZELA","pdfSize":"8322059"}
