We present an approach to find\nthe branching rules for the pair $\\mathfrak{g}\\supset\\mathfrak{h}$. According\nto an idea of Zhelobenko the information on restriction to $\\mathfrak{h}$ of\nall irreducible representations of $\\mathfrak{g}$ is contained in one\nassociative algebra, which we call the \\emph{branching algebra}. We use an\n\\emph{essential semigroup} $\\Sigma$, which parametrizes some bases in every\nfinite-dimensional irreducible representations of $\\mathfrak{g}$, and describe\nthe branching rules for $\\mathfrak{g}\\supset\\mathfrak{h}$ in terms of a certain\nsubsemigroup $\\Sigma'$ of $\\Sigma$. If $\\Sigma'$ is finitely generated, then\nthe semigroup algebra corresponding to $\\Sigma'$ is a toric degeneration of the\nbranching algebra. We propose the algorithm to find a description of $\\Sigma'$\nin this case. We give examples by deriving the branching rules for $A_n\\supset\nA_{n-1}$, $B_n\\supset D_n$, $G_2\\supset A_2$, $B_3\\supset G_2$, and $F_4\\supset\nB_4$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
