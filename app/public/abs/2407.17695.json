However, the extent of this knowledge can vary\nacross different domains. Existing methods often assume that LLMs already\npossess such comprehensive and in-depth knowledge of their environment,\noverlooking potential gaps in their understanding of actual world dynamics. To\naddress this gap, we introduce Discover, Verify, and Evolve (DiVE), a framework\nthat discovers world dynamics from a small number of demonstrations, verifies\nthe correctness of these dynamics, and evolves new, advanced dynamics tailored\nto the current situation. Through extensive evaluations, we analyze the impact\nof each component on performance and compare the automatically generated\ndynamics from DiVE with human-annotated world dynamics. Our results demonstrate\nthat LLMs guided by DiVE can make better decisions, achieving rewards\ncomparable to human players in the Crafter environment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
