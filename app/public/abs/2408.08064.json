In statistics this problem arises for\ninstance in the asymptotic null distribution of goodness-of-fit test statistics\nof weighted $L^2$-type. For this problem we present the Rayleigh-Ritz method to\napproximate the eigenvalues. The usefulness of these approximations is shown by\nhigh lightening implications such as critical value approximation and\ntheoretical comparison of test statistics by means of Bahadur efficiencies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
