It\nbegins with foundational definitions and properties, including the construction\nof Brownian motion and its Markovian characteristics. The document delves into\nadvanced topics such as the Karhunen-Loeve expansion, reflection principles,\nand Levy's modulus of continuity. Through rigorous proofs and theorems, the\nmanuscript examines the non-differentiability of Brownian paths, the behavior\nof zero sets, and the significance of local time. The notes also cover\nimportant results like Donsker's theorem and Blumenthal's 0-1 law, emphasizing\ntheir implications in the study of stochastic processes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XpSb45h3MjDwMMgFbgHIj14avsOx6UscRGjYVaQlpsk","pdfSize":"178387"}
