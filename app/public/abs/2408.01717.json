We have found a\nsignificant suppression of the Thouless energy with increasing interfacial\nresistance, in agreement with experimental results. The analysis of the\ntemperature dependence of the critical current in Josephson junctions in\ncomparison with the expressions for the Thouless energy may allow the\ndetermination of the interface parameters of S and N-layers.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
