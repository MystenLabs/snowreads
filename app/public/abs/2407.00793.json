In this so-called Gerrish-Lenski regime, typically a finite number\nof contending mutations is present together with one resident type. These\nmutations compete for fixation, a phenomenon addressed as clonal interference.\nWe study a system of Poissonian interacting trajectories (PIT) which arise as a\nlarge population scaling limit of the logarithmic sizes of the contending\nclonal subpopulations. We prove that this system exhibits an a.s.\\ positive\nasymptotic rate of fitness increase (speed of adaptation), which turns out to\nbe finite if and only if fitness increments have a finite expectation. We\nrelate this speed to heuristic predictions from the literature. Furthermore, we\nderive a functional central limit theorem for the fitness of the resident\npopulation in the PIT. A main result of this work is that the Poissonian\ninteracting trajectories arise as a large-population limit of a continuous time\nMoran model with strong selection.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
