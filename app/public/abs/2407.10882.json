Astrochemistry is experiencing a golden\nage, marked by significant advancements in the observation and understanding of\nthe chemical processes occurring in the inner regions of protostellar systems.\nHowever, many questions remain open, such as the origin of the chemical\ndiversity observed in the early evolutionary stages, which may influence the\nchemical composition of the forming planets. Additionally, astrochemistry\nprovides us with powerful tools to investigate the accretion/ejection processes\noccurring in the inner regions of young embedded objects, such as jets, winds,\naccretion streamers, and shocks. In this chapter, we review the observational\nefforts carried out in recent years to chemically characterize the inner\nregions of Solar-System analogs. We summarize our current understanding of\nmolecular complexity in planet-forming disks and shed light on the existing\nlimitations and unanswered questions. Finally, we highlight the important role\nof future radio facilities, like SKAO and ngVLA, in exploring the chemical\ncomplexity of the regions where planetary systems are emerging.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
