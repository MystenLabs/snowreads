In this work, we provide\nexamples of substitution rules that generate tilings with ILC. The proof relies\non Danzer's algorithm, which assumes that the substitution factor is non-Pisot.\nIn addition to ILC, the tiling space of each substitution rule contains a\ntiling that exhibits global n-fold rotational symmetry, n=13,17,21.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
