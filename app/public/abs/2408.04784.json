We begin by analyzing the layer-localization to\ndelocalization transition through the inverse participation ratio (IPR).\nUtilizing perturbation analysis, we derive a new analytical approximation for\nthe transition point and an expression for the IPR in the non-dominant layer\nwithin the localized regime. Additionally, we examine the transition from a\nnon-dominant to a dominant regime, providing an analytical expression for the\ntransition point. These transitions are further explored and validated through\ndynamical simulations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
