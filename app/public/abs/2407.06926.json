In this\npaper, we present an expression for a non-axisymmetric Aretakis gravitational\ncharge and its potentially observable imprint at a finite distance from the\nhorizon (Ori-coefficient) in extremal Kerr black hole backgrounds. We offer\nstrong and robust numerical evidence for the existence of this hair and its\nproperties. Specifically, we consider the time evolution of horizon\npenetrating, quadrupolar and (subdominant) octupolar gravitational\nperturbations with compact support on extremal Kerr (EK) spacetime. We do this\nby numerically solving the Teukolsky equation and determining the Aretakis\ncharge values on the horizon and at a finite distance from the black hole.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
