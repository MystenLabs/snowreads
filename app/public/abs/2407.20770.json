Traditional non-Bayesian social learning models only\nconsider single signals, limiting their applications in scenarios where\nmultiple viewpoints of information are available. In this work, we exploit, in\nthe information aggregation step, the independently learned results from\nobservations taken from multiple viewpoints and propose a novel non-Bayesian\nsocial learning model for scenarios with multiview observations. We prove the\nconvergence of the model under traditional assumptions and provide convergence\nconditions for the algorithm in the presence of misleading signals. Through\ntheoretical analyses and numerical experiments, we validate the strong\nreliability and robustness of the proposed algorithm, showcasing its potential\nfor real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
