However, specifying their parameters (such\nas models, tools, and orchestration mechanisms etc,.) and debugging them\nremains challenging for most developers. To address this challenge, we present\nAUTOGEN STUDIO, a no-code developer tool for rapidly prototyping, debugging,\nand evaluating multi-agent workflows built upon the AUTOGEN framework. AUTOGEN\nSTUDIO offers a web interface and a Python API for representing LLM-enabled\nagents using a declarative (JSON-based) specification. It provides an intuitive\ndrag-and-drop UI for agent workflow specification, interactive evaluation and\ndebugging of workflows, and a gallery of reusable agent components. We\nhighlight four design principles for no-code multi-agent developer tools and\ncontribute an open-source implementation at\nhttps://github.com/microsoft/autogen/tree/main/samples/apps/autogen-studio\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
