We establish that\nthis phenomenon occurs in a particular situation, which lets us give a lower\nbound for the volume of any Lagrangian torus in $\\mathbb{CP}^2$ which is\nHamiltonian isotopic to the Chekanov torus. The rest of the paper is a\ndiscussion of why we should expect these phenomena to be very common, motivated\nby Oh's conjecture on the volume-minimising property of the Clifford torus and\nthe concurrent normals conjecture in convex geometry. We pose many open\nquestions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
