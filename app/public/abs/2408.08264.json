To\naddress the resulting ill-posed inverse problem, optimization-based or Bayesian\ninference approaches typically use regularization, thereby limiting the\npossibility of discovering multiple solutions. In this study, we use inVAErt\nnetworks, a neural network-based, data-driven framework for enhanced digital\ntwin analysis of stiff dynamical systems. We demonstrate the flexibility and\neffectiveness of inVAErt networks in the context of physiological inversion of\na six-compartment lumped parameter hemodynamic model from synthetic data to\nreal data with missing components.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
