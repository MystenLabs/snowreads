We discuss some constraints on the\nbase for these moduli stacks to be algebraic and observe that a large class of\ninteresting schemes satisfy these constraints. Using this construction, we\nprovide an alternate construction of moduli stacks of Higgs bundles along with\na proof of algebraicity following readily from the algebraicity of moduli\nstacks of quiver bundles. One feature of our approach is that, for each of the\nmoduli stacks we discuss, there are algebraic moduli stacks parametrizing\nmorphisms of the objects being classified. We discuss some potential\napplications of this in categorifying non-abelian Hodge theory in a sense we\nwill make precise. We also discuss potential applications of our methods and\nperspectives to the subjects of quiver modifications, abstract moduli theory,\nand homotopy theory.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
