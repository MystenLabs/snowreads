We define stringy event horizons in terms of the half-sided inclusion\nproperty, which is related to a stronger notion of boundary ergodic or quantum\nchaotic behavior. Using our definition, we argue that above the Hawking--Page\ntemperature, there is an emergent sharp horizon structure in the large $N$\nlimit of $\\mathcal{N}=4$ Super-Yang--Mills at finite nonzero 't Hooft coupling.\nIn contrast, some previously considered toy models of black hole information\nloss do not have a stringy horizon. Our methods can also be used to probe\nviolations of the equivalence principle for the bulk gravitational system, and\nto explore aspects of stringy nonlocality.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
