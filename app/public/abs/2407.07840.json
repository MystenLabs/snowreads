They tend to hallucinate and may\ngenerate biased responses. In such circumstances, having a way to assess the\nreliability of a given response generated by a VLM is quite useful. Existing\nmethods, such as estimating uncertainty using answer likelihoods or\nprompt-based confidence generation, often suffer from overconfidence. Other\nmethods use self-consistency comparison but are affected by confirmation\nbiases. To alleviate these, we propose \\textbf{De}compose and \\textbf{C}ompare\n\\textbf{C}onsistency (\\texttt{DeCC}) for reliability measurement. By comparing\nthe consistency between the direct answer generated using the VLM's internal\nreasoning process, and the indirect answers obtained by decomposing the\nquestion into sub-questions and reasoning over the sub-answers produced by the\nVLM, \\texttt{DeCC} measures the reliability of VLM's direct answer. Experiments\nacross six vision-language tasks with three VLMs show \\texttt{DeCC}'s\nreliability estimation achieves better correlation with task accuracy compared\nto the existing methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"du6x-3BhQ-lu4c008u3YTKYV0z_1S6ktN09-4MuT1zk","pdfSize":"1088805"}
