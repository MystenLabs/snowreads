We show that finely\nstratified rerandomization does partially linear regression adjustment \"by\ndesign,\" providing nonparametric control over the stratified covariates and\nlinear control over the rerandomized covariates. We introduce several new\nrerandomization schemes, allowing for imbalance metrics based on nonlinear\nestimators. We also propose a novel minimax scheme that uses pilot data or\nprior information to minimize the computational cost of rerandomization,\nsubject to a strict bound on statistical efficiency. While the asymptotic\ndistribution of generalized method of moments (GMM) estimators under stratified\nrerandomization is generically non-normal, we show how to restore asymptotic\nnormality using ex-post linear adjustment tailored to the stratification. This\nenables simple asymptotically exact inference on superpopulation parameters, as\nwell as efficient conservative inference on finite population parameters.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics","Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
