This paper introduces the Automatic\nIdentification System Database (AISdb), a novel tool designed to address the\nchallenges of processing and analyzing AIS data. AISdb is a comprehensive,\nopen-source platform that enables the integration of AIS data with\nenvironmental datasets, thus enriching analyses of vessel movements and their\nenvironmental impacts. By facilitating AIS data collection, cleaning, and\nspatio-temporal querying, AISdb significantly advances AIS data research.\nUtilizing AIS data from various sources, AISdb demonstrates improved handling\nand analysis of vessel information, contributing to enhancing maritime safety,\nsecurity, and environmental sustainability efforts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
