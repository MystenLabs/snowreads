In their\nsmooth version, they can be identified with the group of diffeomorphisms on the\ncelestial sphere. Their canonical realization requires treating the celestial\nmetric as a variable in the gravitational phase space, along with the news and\nshear tensors. In this paper, we derive the resulting Poisson brackets (PB).\nThe standard PB algebra of the news and shear tensors is augmented by\ndistributional terms at the boundaries of null infinity, including novel PB\nrelations between the celestial metric and the radiative variables.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
