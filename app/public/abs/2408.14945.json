The\neffective potentials, greybody factors and quasinormal modes of the black hole\nare investigated by using the Klein-Gordon equation and Dirac equation. To\ncompute the Gerybody factors for scalar and Dirac field, we use the general\nmethod of semi-analytical bounds. The impact of Lorentz invariance violation\nparameter $L$ and cosmological constant $\\Lambda$ to the effective potential,\ngreybody factors and quasinormal modes are analyzed for different modes.\nIncreasing the parameters $\\Lambda$ and $L$ lower the effective potentials and\nconsequently increase the rigorous bound on the greybody factors. We also\ninvestigate the quasinormal mode using the third order WKB approximation\nmethod. Our findings show that the oscillation frequency and the damping rate\ndecrease with increasing $L$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
