Understanding the effect of external perturbation\non the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids has emerged as a relevant\nresearch issue in soft matter and biological physics. Optical perturbation in\nthe form of photonic forces and torques has added impetus to this exploration.\nIn recent years, optothermal effects arising due to optical excitation of\nmesoscale matter have expanded the toolbox of light-colloidal matter\ninteractions. In this perspective, we present an experimental viewpoint on some\nof the developments related to the assembly and dynamics of Brownian colloids\ndriven by the optothermal field. Furthermore, we discuss some interesting\nprospects on driven colloidal matter that can have implications on soft matter\nphysics and soft photonics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tuOAeTvT7Q73KwsbJ4mfAO-kUuwxOdcSg3R0KB5AXYU","pdfSize":"638966"}
