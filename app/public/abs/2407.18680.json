Combined with a\nsuitable closure, it has been shown to reproduce e.g. the static structure\nfactor, pressure, and compressibility of liquids to a great degree of accuracy.\nHowever, out of the multitude of closures that exist for the Ornstein-Zernike\nequation, it is hard to predict a priori which closure will give the most\naccurate predictions for the system at hand. To alleviate this problem, we\ncompare the predictive power of many closures on a curated set of\nrepresentative benchmark systems, including those with hard-sphere, inverse\npower-law, Gaussian core, and Lennard-Jones particles, in three and two\ndimensions. For example, we find that the well-known and highly used\nPercus-Yevick closure gives significantly worse predictions than lesser-known\nclosures of equal complexity in all cases studied. We anticipate that the\ntrends observed in our results will aid in making more informed decisions\nregarding closure choices. To facilitate the adoption of more modern closure\ntheories, we also have packaged, documented, and distributed the code necessary\nto numerically solve the equations for a given closure and pair interaction\npotential.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
