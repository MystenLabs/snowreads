Recently Wang et al. (2023, ApJ, 943,\n80) studied magnetic flux and electric current measured at the footpoints of 28\neruptive MFRs from 2010 to 2015. Because of the small sample size, no rigorous\nstatistics has been done. Here, we include 9 more events from 2016 to 2023 and\nperform a series of nonparametric statistical tests at a significance level of\n5\\%. The tests confirm that there exist no significant differences in magnetic\nproperties between conjugated footpoints of the same MFR, which justifies the\nmethod of identifying the MFR footpoints through coronal dimming. The tests\ndemonstrate that there exist no significant differences between MFRs with\npre-eruption dimming and those with only post-eruption dimming. However, there\nis a medium level of association between MFRs carrying substantial net current\nand those produce pre-eruption dimming, which can be understood by the\nLorentz-self force of the current channel. The tests also suggest that in\nestimating the magnetic twist of MFRs, it is necessary to take into account the\nspatially inhomogeneous distribution of electric current density and magnetic\nfield.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
