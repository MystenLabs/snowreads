A graph $G$ is $k$-11-representable if it can be\nrepresented by a word $w$ such that for any edge (resp., non-edge) $xy$ in $G$\nthe subsequence of $w$ formed by $x$ and $y$ contains at most $k$ (resp., at\nleast $k+1$) pairs of consecutive equal letters. A remarkable result of Cheon\nat al.\\ is that {\\em any} graph is 2-11-representable, while it is unknown\nwhether every graph is 1-11-representable. Cheon et al.\\ showed that the class\nof 1-11-representable graphs is strictly larger than that of word-representable\ngraphs, and they introduced a useful toolbox to study 1-11-representable\ngraphs.\n  In this paper, we introduce new tools for studying 1-11-representation of\ngraphs. We apply them for establishing 1-11-representation of Chv\\'{a}tal\ngraph, Mycielski graph, split graphs, and graphs whose vertices can be\npartitioned into a comparability graph and an independent set.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"UPnZl9ITTBNZbKdjuCTdggvmyijG__nCfIJVdXO9RXo","pdfSize":"183572"}
