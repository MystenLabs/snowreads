Assurance tasks encompass\nadherence to standards, certification processes, and the execution of\nverification and validation (V&V) methods, such as model checking. In this\nstudy, we propose a holistic, multi-level modelling approach for formally\nverifying and validating autonomous robotic swarms, which are defined at the\nmacroscopic formal modelling, low-fidelity simulation, high-fidelity\nsimulation, and real-robot levels. Our formal macroscopic models, used for\nverification, are characterized by data derived from actual simulations,\nensuring both accuracy and traceability across different system models.\nFurthermore, our work combines formal verification with experimental validation\ninvolving real robots. In this way, our corroborative approach for V&V seeks to\nenhance confidence in the evidence, in contrast to employing these methods\nseparately. We explore our approach through a case study focused on a swarm of\nrobots operating within a public cloakroom.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
