Current data releases include both J and K bands, with\nH-band data forthcoming. Here we present a novel pipeline to recover asteroids\nfrom this survey data. We recover 26,138 reliable observations, corresponding\nto 23,399 unique asteroids, from these public data. We measure J-K colors for\n601 asteroids. Our survey extends about two magnitudes deeper than 2MASS. We\nfind that our small inner main belt objects are less red than larger inner belt\nobjects, perhaps because smaller asteroids are collisionally younger, with\nsurfaces that have been less affected by space weathering. In the middle and\nouter main belt, we find our small asteroids to be redder than larger objects\nin their same orbits, possibly due to observational bias or a disproportionate\npopulation of very red objects among these smaller asteroids. Future work on\nthis project includes extracting moving object measurements from H and Y band\ndata when it becomes available.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"KHyc4Fs3TQN7lkQIBe6QpwZcG7feEvTiEU1zkHWYeo8","pdfSize":"722605","objectId":"0x6631155ed043c7278e85566b92b5d67af9e20c9528062be68e5da18f0779aefa","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
