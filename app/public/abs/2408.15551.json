We provide a relation between K\\\"ahler immersions problem of these\nmetrics and the sign of their mass. Our result shows that these metrics with\npositive mass do not admit a K\\\"ahler immersion into complex Euclidean space.\nMoreover, we also obtain that these metrics with any sign of mass cannot be\nK\\\"ahler immersed into complex hyperbolic space.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
