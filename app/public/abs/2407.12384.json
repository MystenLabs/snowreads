We recover in this way known\nresults which were formerly proved using representation theory.Similar\ntechniques show that for general symmetric matrices, most approximate\neigenvectors spectrally localized in a given window containing sufficiently\nmany eigenvalues are delocalized in $L^q$ norms. Building upon this\nobservation, we prove a delocalization result for approximate eigenvectors of\nlarge graphs containing few short loops, under an assumption on the resolvent\nwhich is verified in some standard cases, for instance random lifts of a fixed\nbase graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Spectral Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
