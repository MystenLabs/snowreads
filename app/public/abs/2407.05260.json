We show that there is an\nimprovement in coding performance due to cost variability, both with and\nwithout feedback. We demonstrate this improvement over the traditional\nalmost-sure cost constraint (also called the peak-power constraint) that\nprohibits any cost variation above a fixed threshold. Our result simultaneously\nshows that feedback does not improve the second-order coding rate of\nsimple-dispersion DMCs under the peak-power constraint. This finding parallels\nsimilar results for unconstrained simple-dispersion DMCs, additive white\nGaussian noise (AWGN) channels and parallel Gaussian channels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VadVtrzKyy8MsqQvhu0S6CV9Bmk11T2hqoi8v_RmHmQ","pdfSize":"180207"}
