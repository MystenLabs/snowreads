Using the sample average\napproximation, we obtain optimal control problems with ensembles of\ndeterministic dynamical systems. Leveraging techniques for metric entropy\nbounds, we derive non-asymptotic Monte Carlo-type convergence rates for the\nensemble-based solutions. Our theoretical framework is validated through\nnumerical simulations on a harmonic oscillator problem and a vaccination\nscheduling problem for epidemic control under model parameter uncertainty.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
