Despite these developments, the process of customizing\nTTS voices remains a complex task, mostly requiring the expertise of\nspecialists within the field. One reason for this is the utilization of deep\nlearning models, which are characterized by their expansive, non-interpretable\nparameter spaces, restricting the feasibility of manual customization. In this\npaper, we present a novel human-in-the-loop paradigm based on an evolutionary\nalgorithm for directly interacting with the parameter space of a neural TTS\nmodel. We integrated our approach into a user-friendly graphical user interface\nthat allows users to efficiently create original voices. Those voices can then\nbe used with the backbone TTS model, for which we provide a Python API.\nFurther, we present the results of a user study exploring the capabilities of\nVoiceX. We show that VoiceX is an appropriate tool for creating individual,\ncustom voices.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Sound","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Audio and Speech Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XMkuLvZLJvCSbfV8UAMlPcjwtf1pkby1R_0YJX6SBLw","pdfSize":"303066"}
