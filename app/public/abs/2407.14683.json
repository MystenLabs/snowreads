Because lockdowns require\ntremendous resources to enforce, they are often limited in duration or scope.\nThe introduction of automated driving systems may allow governments to quickly\nand cheaply effect large-area lockdowns by jamming wireless communications,\nspoofing road closures on digital maps, exploiting a vehicle's programming to\nobey all traffic control devices, or coordinating with vehicle developers.\nFuture vehicles may lack conventional controls, rendering them undrivable by\nthe public. As travel restrictions become easier to implement, governments may\nenforce them more frequently, over longer durations and wider areas. This\narticle explores the practical, legal, and ethical implications of lockdowns\nwhen most driving is highly automated, and provides guidance for the\ndevelopment of lockdown policies.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hR52DSovgzmE7O7QWllYQWHKfx2kgGwkkGzfwf7tEDc","pdfSize":"231214"}
