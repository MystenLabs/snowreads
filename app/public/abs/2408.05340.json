We show how oriented paths in the contact cut graph correspond to\nLefschetz fibrations and multisection with divides diagrams. We also give a\ncorrespondence for achiral Lefschetz fibrations. We use these correspondences\nto define a new invariant of Weinstein domains, the Weinstein\n$\\mathcal{L}$-invariant, that is a symplectic analogue of the Kirby-Thompson's\n$\\mathcal{L}$-invariant of smooth $4$-manifolds. We discuss the relation of\nLefschetz stabilization with the Weinstein $\\mathcal{L}$-invariant. We present\ntopological and geometric constraints of Weinstein domains with\n$\\mathcal{L}=0$. We also give two families of examples of multisections with\ndivides that have arbitrarily large $\\mathcal{L}$-invariant.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dhLwQxJp-E3iDFD_yfNCtZyMKb4i0io_Kxsks4metnY","pdfSize":"599029"}
