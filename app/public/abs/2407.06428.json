When the\ndynamics is governed by a time-independent Hamiltonian, Krylov complexity has\nemerged as a powerful tool. For unitary evolutions like kicked systems or\nTrotterized dynamics, a similar formulation based on the Arnoldi approach has\nbeen proposed (P. Suchsland, R. Moessner, and P. W. Claeys, (2023),\narXiv:2308.03851). In this work, we show that this formulation is robust for\nobserving the transition from integrability to chaos in both autonomous and\nkicked systems. Examples from random matrix theory and spin chains are shown in\nthis paper.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
