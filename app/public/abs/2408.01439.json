We propose a framework of\nquantum signal processing and quantum singular value transformation on $U(N)$,\nwhich realizes multiple polynomials simultaneously from a block-encoded input,\nas a generalization of those on $U(2)$ in the original frameworks. We also\nperform a comprehensive analysis on achievable polynomials and give a recursive\nalgorithm to construct the quantum circuit that gives the desired polynomial\ntransformation. As an example application, the new framework is used to\nconstruct the quantum amplitude estimation algorithm with asymptotically\noptimal query complexity. Based on this framework, we also propose a framework\nto realize multi-variate polynomial functions for commutative variables.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
