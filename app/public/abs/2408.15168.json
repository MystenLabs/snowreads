However, because our view of the\nSun is limited in the ecliptic plane, the polar regions remain largely\nuncharted. Using the high spatial resolution and polarimetric precision vector\nmagnetograms observed by Hinode from 2012 to 2021, we investigate the long-term\nvariation of the magnetic fields in polar caps at different latitudes. The\nHinode magnetic measurements show that the polarity reversal processes in the\nnorth and south polar caps are non-simultaneous. The variation of the averaged\nradial magnetic flux density reveals that, in each polar cap, the polarity\nreversal is completed successively from the 70 degree latitude to the pole,\nreflecting a poleward magnetic flux migration therein. These results clarify\nthe polar magnetic polarity reversal process at different latitudes.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Physics/Space Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
