GIM demonstrates versatility\nacross different types of grids including structured and unstructured\npolyhedral meshes without the need for any treatment at the boundaries. An\noptimization method is developed for making GIM grid-independent from\nresolution and type. The method is validated against experimental data of a\nfluidized bed. The validation results demonstrate realistic results which\nresemble experimental data. Furthermore, unstructured polyhedral grids\noutperformed structured grids of equivalent resolution providing results more\naligned with experimental data. The gradient of the void fraction is solved in\nthe CFD solver and is used in the DEM solver for precise estimation of the void\nfraction at a particle location. In conclusion, GIM provides a solution for\nvoid fraction calculations in particulate media simulations with complex\ngeometries applicable to industrial needs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
