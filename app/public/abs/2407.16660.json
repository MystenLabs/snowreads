While many graphs (e.g., Twitter, Wikipedia, etc.) are\nusually involving over time, it is of great importance to study the dynamic\nsubgraph matching (DSM) problem, a fundamental yet challenging graph operator,\nwhich continuously monitors subgraph matching results over dynamic graphs with\na stream of edge updates. To efficiently tackle the DSM problem, we carefully\ndesign a novel vertex dominance embedding approach, which effectively encodes\nvertex labels that can be incrementally maintained upon graph updates. Inspire\nby low pruning power for high-degree vertices, we propose a new degree grouping\ntechnique over basic subgraph patterns in different degree groups (i.e., groups\nof star substructures), and devise degree-aware star substructure synopses\n(DAS^3) to effectively facilitate our designed vertex dominance and range\npruning strategies. We develop efficient algorithms to incrementally maintain\ndynamic graphs and answer DSM queries. Through extensive experiments, we\nconfirm the efficiency of our proposed approaches over both real and synthetic\ngraphs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
