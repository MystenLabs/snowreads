In this paper we investigate the impact of the tau\npolarization on the pions generated in its decay. In particular, we consider\ntau neutrino - tungsten interactions at the LHC energies and estimate the\nassociated pion momentum, energy and angular distributions. The contribution of\nthe $F_5$ is also investigated. Our results indicate that the pion properties\nare sensitive to the tau polarization state as well as to the magnitude of\n$F_5$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
