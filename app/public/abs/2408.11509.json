In this work, we propose novel many-to-many (M2M)\nNOMA-based schemes to exchange broadcast, multicast, and unicast messages\nbetween cluster heads (CHs) of vehicular platoons. Specifically, we design\nuplink-M2M-NOMA (UM-NOMA), downlink-M2M-NOMA (DM-NOMA) and joint\nuplink-downlink-M2M-NOMA (UDM-NOMA) schemes for peer-to-peer vehicular ad hoc\nnetworks (VANETs). We propose a unique clustering design for full-duplex\ncommunication that utilizes the high throughput millimeter-wave (mmWave)\nchannels. Furthermore, we investigate jointly optimal CH selection (CHS) and\npower allocation (PA) to maximize the network sum rate and devise a\ncomputationally efficient tailored-greedy algorithm that yields near-optimal\nperformance. We also propose a super-cluster formation protocol to further\nlimit the overhead of successive interference cancellation (SIC). The results\nreveal that in most of the considered scenarios, the proposed UDM-NOMA scheme\noutperforms orthogonal multiple access (OMA) in terms of sum rate by up to 50%\neven when the SIC receiver errors reach 10%.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
