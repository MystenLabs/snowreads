Using some\nalgebraic and geometric tools, and in terms of the notion of Hom-orthogonality,\nwe find necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of infinite\nfamilies of bricks of the same dimension. This sheds new lights on the bBT\nconjectures and we prove many of them for some new families of algebras. Our\nresults imply some interesting algebraic and geometric characterizations of\nbrick-finite algebras as conceptual generalizations of local algebras. We also\nverify the bBT conjectures for any algebra whose Auslander-Reiten quiver has a\ngeneralized standard component. On the one hand, our work relates and develops\nsome recent studies of the bBT conjectures which are conducted in several\ndirections. On the other hand, it extends some earlier results of\nChindris-Kinser-Weyman, where the algebras with preprojective components were\ntreated.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
