The dynamical process whereby synchronization is reached can be thought\nof as a growth process in which an interface formed by the local phase field\ngradually roughens and eventually saturates. Such a process is here shown to\ndisplay the generic scale invariance of the one-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang\nuniversality class, including a Tracy-Widom probability distribution for phase\nfluctuations around their mean. This is revealed by numerical explorations of a\nvariety of oscillator systems: rings of generic phase oscillators and rings of\nparadigmatic limit-cycle oscillators, like Stuart-Landau and van der Pol. It\nalso agrees with analytical expectations derived under conditions of strong\nmutual coupling. The nonequilibrium critical behavior that we find is robust\nand transcends the details of the oscillators considered. Hence, it may well be\naccessible to experimental ensembles of oscillators in the presence of e.g.\nthermal noise.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
