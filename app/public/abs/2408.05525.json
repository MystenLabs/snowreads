In this work, we reveal the quantum geometry and\nthe associated entanglement entropy (EE) of Floquet topological states in\none-dimensional periodically driven systems. The quantum metric tensors of\nFloquet states are found to show non-analytic signatures at topological phase\ntransition points. Away from the transition points, the bipartite geometric EE\nof Floquet states exhibits an area-law scaling vs the system size, which holds\nfor a Floquet band at any filling fractions. For a uniformly filled Floquet\nband, the EE further becomes purely quantum geometric. At phase transition\npoints, the geometric EE scales logarithmically with the system size and\ndisplays cusps in the nearby parameter ranges. These discoveries are\ndemonstrated by investigating typical Floquet models including periodically\ndriven spin chains, Floquet topological insulators and superconductors. Our\nfindings uncover the rich quantum geometries of Floquet states, unveiling the\ngeometric origin of EE for gapped Floquet topological phases, and introducing\ninformation-theoretic means of depicting topological transitions in Floquet\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
