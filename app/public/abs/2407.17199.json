We\ndemonstrate that the Schmidt vector fully characterizes separable and maximally\nentangled states. Furthermore, we prove that the Schmidt vector is monotonic\nand strongly monotonic under LOCC, giving necessary conditions for conversions\nbetween mixed states. Additionally, we extend the definition of the Schmidt\nrank from pure states to mixed states as the cardinality of the support of the\nSchmidt vector and show that it is equal to the Schmidt number introduced in\nprevious work [Phys. Rev. A 61, 040301 (R), 2000]. Finally, we introduce a\nfamily of entanglement monotones by considering concave and symmetric functions\napplied to the Schmidt vector.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
