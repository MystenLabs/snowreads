Motivated by this learning process, we propose a novel\nlearning paradigm, called reflecting learning, in handling long-tail\nrecognition. Our method integrates three processes for reviewing past\npredictions during training, summarizing and leveraging the feature relation\nacross classes, and correcting gradient conflict for loss functions. These\ndesigns are lightweight enough to plug and play with existing long-tail\nlearning methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in popular long-tail\nvisual benchmarks. The experimental results highlight the great potential of\nreflecting learning in dealing with long-tail recognition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"sy2uzAkooR2mE5gDCNUuR-vfBVlMCYrLsa-pi2TRHmE","pdfSize":"6157600"}
