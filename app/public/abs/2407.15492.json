Unlike in dimensions 2 and 3, we can no longer\nrely on the Jacobian model and its derivatives to compute isogenies. In\ndimension 4 (and higher), we can only use theta-models. Previous works by\nRomain Cosset, David Lubicz and Damien Robert have focused on the computation\nof $\\ell$-isogenies in theta-models of level $n$ coprime to $\\ell$ (which\nrequires to use $n^g$ coordinates in dimension $g$). For cryptographic\napplications, we need to compute chains of $2$-isogenies, requiring to use\n$\\geq 3^g$ coordinates in dimension $g$ with state of the art algorithms.\n  In this paper, we present algorithms to compute chains of $2$-isogenies\nbetween abelian varieties of dimension $g\\geq 1$ with theta-coordinates of\nlevel $n=2$, generalizing a previous work by Pierrick Dartois, Luciano Maino,\nGiacomo Pope and Damien Robert in dimension $g=2$. We propose an implementation\nof these algorithms in dimension $g=4$ to compute endomorphisms of elliptic\ncurve products derived from Kani's lemma with applications to SQIsignHD and\nSIDH cryptanalysis. We are now able to run a complete key recovery attack on\nSIDH when the endomorphism ring of the starting curve is unknown within a few\nseconds on a laptop for all NIST SIKE parameters.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Sg9H2pgKDO-K-aMEs7vc_5C5Mwn3NkYVrFeP3jFSk-0","pdfSize":"793013","objectId":"0xa2ad85c5bfeda6455bb0b584413b9b02a11eae17f5d8259eec1fe706ebe38905","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
