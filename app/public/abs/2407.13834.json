However, the bounds on the axial NSI are more relaxed, raising\nthe hope that studying the neutral current events at an experiment such as DUNE\ncan give a glimpse of new physics. We build a model that gives rise to axial\nNSI with large couplings leading to observable deviation from the standard\nprediction at DUNE. The model is based on a $U(1)$ gauge symmetry with a gauge\nboson of mass $\\sim 30$~GeV which can be discovered at the high luminosity LHC.\nCombining the LHC and DUNE discoveries, we can unravel the axial form of\ninteraction. The cancellation of anomalies of the gauge group suggests new\nheavy quarks as well as a dark matter candidate. The new quarks mixed with the\nfirst generation quarks can also be discovered at the LHC. Moreover, they\nprovide a seesaw mechanism that explains the smallness of the $u$ and $d$ quark\nmasses. The dark matter has an axial coupling to the quarks which makes its\ndiscovery via spin dependent direct dark matter search experiments possible.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
