One\npotential solution is to use molecular singlet exciton fission to generate two\nelectrons from each absorbed high-energy photon. We demonstrate that the\nlong-standing challenge of coupling molecular excited states to silicon solar\ncells can be overcome using sequential charge transfer. Combining zinc\nphthalocyanine, aluminum oxide, and a shallow junction crystalline silicon\nmicrowire solar cell, the peak charge generation efficiency per photon absorbed\nin tetracene is (138 +- 6)%, comfortably surpassing the quantum efficiency\nlimit for conventional silicon solar cells and establishing a new, scalable\napproach to low cost, high efficiency photovoltaics.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
