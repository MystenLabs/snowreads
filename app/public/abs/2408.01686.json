By developing an approach based\non a direct minimization of the energy functional on a new constrained\nmanifold, we establish the existence of two normalized solutions for the\ncorresponding stationary problem. One is a local minimizer with positive level\nand the other one is a global minimizer with negative level. Moreover, we find\nthat the global minimizer is farther away from the origin than the local\nminimizer. Finally, we explore the relations between the ground state solution\nand the least action solution, and some dynamical behavior and scattering\nresults are presented as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"I3d1yxP8Da36YBNZGCNi4BALDW4kr8QCYWIKugRF2Fk","pdfSize":"364808"}
