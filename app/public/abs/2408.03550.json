Generating high-efficiency single\nphotons with high purity and heralding efficiency is the prerequisite for\nphotonic quantum computers. At the same time, generating high-efficiency\nscalable squeezed light is the prerequisite for continuous variable quantum\ncomputing along with sensing applications. Here, we propose a symmetric\nring-Mach-Zehnder interferometer (RMZI), which includes a periodically poled\nlithium niobate (PPLN) waveguide as an efficient source of squeezed light and a\nsingle-photon source. We numerically show that our proposed design can generate\ntunable squeezed light with a squeezing level higher than -12dB with\nsub-milli-watt (mW) pump power. The proposed device can also generate single\nphotons with purity as high as 99(95)% with heralding efficiency 94(99)% using\nonly 20ps long pulses. Our proposed design is fully compatible with current\nfabrication technology.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"aogcxFspLGaj3ybsydRZox3dTAcK26kDUuDWiZ0pRnw","pdfSize":"5651313"}
