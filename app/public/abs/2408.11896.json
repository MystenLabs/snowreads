However, generally a promising approach is to\n(holographically) realize such systems on branes in string/M-theory; and\nspecifically an old argument by Hellerman & Susskind gives a sketch of\nfractional quantum Hall states arising via discrete light cone quantization of\nM5/M9-brane intersections.\n  Here we present a rigorous derivation of abelian anyon quantum states on\nM5$\\perp$MO9-branes (\"open M5-branes\") on the discrete light cone, after\nglobally completing the traditional local field content on the M5-worldvolume\nvia a flux-quantization law compatible with the ambient 11d supergravity,\nspecifically taken to be in the unstable co-Homotopy cohomology (\"Hypothesis\nH\").\n  The main step in the proof uses a theorem of Okuyama to identify co-Homotopy\nmoduli spaces with configuration spaces of strings with charged endpoints, and\nidentifies their loop spaces with cobordism of framed links that, under\ntopological light cone quantization, turn out to be identified with the\nregularized Wilson loops of abelian Chern-Simons theory.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Algebraic Topology","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
