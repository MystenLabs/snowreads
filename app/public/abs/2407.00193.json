The Partnership for\nIntegration of Computation into Undergraduate Physics (PICUP) uses Slack as a\nmechanism for continued communication beyond face-to-face meetings. Through our\nanalysis, we use networks to represent the Slack channels, identify lurkers,\nand use metrics to quantify pariticipation. Additionally, we use randomization\ntechniques to understand how similar our metric values are to networks of\nsimilar size and distribution. We highlight the need for using the appropriate\nrandomization model and assumption checking. We characterize participation\namongst users in the network and provide potential reasonings for their\nactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics Education"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
