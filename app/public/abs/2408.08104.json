The solution solves the minimum problem for the following functional,\n  \\begin{equation*}\n  \\mathscr{J}(u):=\\int_{\\Omega}\\left(\\frac{|\\nabla u|^2}{2}-u^+ (\\log\nu-1)\\right) \\, dx,\n  \\end{equation*}\n  where $u^+=\\max{\\{0,u\\}}$. In this paper, based on the regularity of the\nsolution, we establish the $C^{1,\\alpha}$ regularity of the free boundary\n$\\Omega \\cap \\partial\\{u>0\\}$ near the regular points for some $\\alpha\\in\n(0,1)$.\n  The logarithmic forcing term becomes singular near the free boundary\n$\\Omega\\cap\\partial\\{u>0\\}$ and lacks the scaling properties, which are very\ncrucial in studying the regularity of the free boundary. Despite these\nchallenges, we draw inspiration for our overall strategy from the\n\"epiperimetric inequality\" method introduced by Weiss in 1999 [Invent. Math.,\n138, 23-50, 1999]. Central to our approach is the introduction of a new type of\nenergy contraction. This allows us to achieve energy decay, which in turn\nensures the uniqueness of the blow-up limit, and subsequently leads to the\nregularity of the free boundary.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
