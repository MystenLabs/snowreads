In the investigated temperature range, 1.033$\\times\nT_{C}$ to 1.5$\\times T_{C}$, where $T_C$ is the Curie temperature, the spin\nfluctuations are well described by the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model\npredictions. Apart from the Heisenberg exchange, additional pseudo-dipolar\ninteractions manifest through a finite long-wavelength relaxation rate that\nvanishes at the transition temperature ($T_C = 305$\\,K). Based on the\ncharacteristic extend of spin fluctuations in wave-vector and energy space we\ndetermine that the nature of magnetism in MnFe$_4$Si$_3$ is localized above\nroom temperature. This contrasts with the most celebrated Mn and Fe based\nmagnetocaloric materials that are considered as itinerant magnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
