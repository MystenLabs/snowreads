This resolves the catastrophic failure of fixed-order\nperturbation theory where quarkonium cross sections at large transverse\nmomentum can turn negative due to large radiative corrections. We find that\nresummation is imperative for describing measured prompt production rates of\n$J/\\psi$ at large transverse momentum.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
