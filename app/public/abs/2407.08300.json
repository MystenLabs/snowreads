If either $k=n$ or the manifold is\nconformally flat and $k>n/2$, we prove that all Lipschitz viscosity solutions\nare smooth away from a closed set of measure zero. For the general $k>n/2$\ncase, under certain assumptions, we prove the existence of a Lipschitz\nviscosity solution that is smooth away from a closed set of measure zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
