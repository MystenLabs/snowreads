More recently, Deep Learning approaches\nhave been shown to provide improved performance in detection. However,\nobtaining sufficient labelled weather radar data for flying animals to build\nlearning-based models is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address the\nchallenge of data labelling, we propose a self-supervised learning method for\ndetecting animal movement. In our proposed method, we pre-train our model on a\nlarge dataset with noisy labels produced by a threshold approach. The key\nadvantage is that the pre-trained dataset size is limited only by the number of\nradar images available. We then fine-tune the model on a small human-labelled\ndataset. Our experiments on Australian weather radar data for waterbird\nsegmentation show that the proposed method outperforms the current state-of-the\nart approach by 43.53% in the dice co-efficient statistic.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
