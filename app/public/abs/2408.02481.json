Within this framework, we consider\na sample of individuals characterized by specific features, each feature\nencompassing a finite range of values, and classified based on a binary\nresponse variable. This measure turns out to be an influence measure explored\nin existing literature and related to cooperative game theory. We provide an\naxiomatic characterization of our proposed influence measure by tailoring\nproperties from the cooperative game theory to our specific context.\nFurthermore, we demonstrate that our influence measure becomes a general\ncharacterization of the well-known Banzhaf-Owen value for games with a priori\nunions, from the perspective of classification problems. The definitions and\nresults presented herein are illustrated through numerical examples and various\napplications, offering practical insights into our methodologies.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
