We find that even a small contribution of\nrocket kicks combined with instantaneous natal kicks can allow binaries to\nreach period--eccentricity combinations unattainable in standard binary\nevolution models. We propose these kick + rocket combinations as a new channel\nto form wide low-eccentricity neutron star binaries such as Gaia NS1, as well\nas inducing stellar mergers months to years after a supernova to cause peculiar\nhigh-energy transients.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e7ZkKMb4sveIixz3DxflJd2lw7oL13uPQpe5yc2hVqM","pdfSize":"3881220","objectId":"0x3359d0104fcf37cac551d7aca6bef4f26b50f5b4e3c60008424ad9c15ae617b3","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
