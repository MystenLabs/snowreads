In this paper, we tackle the\nproblem of detecting and attributing AI-generated text by proposing WhosAI, a\ntriplet-network contrastive learning framework designed to predict whether a\ngiven input text has been generated by humans or AI and to unveil the\nauthorship of the text. Unlike most existing approaches, our proposed framework\nis conceived to learn semantic similarity representations from multiple\ngenerators at once, thus equally handling both detection and attribution tasks.\nFurthermore, WhosAI is model-agnostic and scalable to the release of new AI\ntext-generation models by incorporating their generated instances into the\nembedding space learned by our framework. Experimental results on the\nTuringBench benchmark of 200K news articles show that our proposed framework\nachieves outstanding results in both the Turing Test and Authorship Attribution\ntasks, outperforming all the methods listed in the TuringBench benchmark\nleaderboards.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
