The approach assumes that for a periodic phenomenon, a\nhighly similar set of events is generated within a spatio-temporal window at a\ntime difference corresponding to its period. The sets of similar events are\ndetected by a correlation in the spatio-temporal event stream space. The\nproposed method, EEPPR, is evaluated on a dataset of 12 sequences of periodic\nphenomena, i.e. flashing light and vibration, and periodic motion, e.g.,\nrotation, ranging from 3.2 Hz to 2 kHz (equivalent to 192 - 120 000 RPM). EEPPR\nsignificantly outperforms published methods on this dataset, achieving a mean\nrelative error of 0.1%, setting new state-of-the-art. The dataset and codes are\npublicly available on GitHub.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"pYvdlm_REtDEO0CIgVHBnALxnt3QiTjOLvNpk0zJD0o","pdfSize":"43298762"}
