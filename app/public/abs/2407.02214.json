Lithium niobate, one of the most widely used\nnonlinear crystals, exhibits strong second-order nonlinear effects and\nelectro-optic properties. However, its moderate refractive index and etching\nsidewall angle limit its capability in confining light into nanoscales,\nrestricting its application in nanophotonics. Here, we exploit nanocavities\nformed by second-order circular Bragg gratings, which support resonant anapole\nmodes to achieve highly enhanced SHG in thin film lithium niobate. The CBG\nnanocavity exhibits a record-high normalized conversion efficiency of\n$1.21\\times10^{-2}\\mathrm{cm^2/GW}$ under the pump intensity of $1.9$\n$\\mathrm{MW/cm^2}$. An SHG enhancement of $42,000$ is realized compared to\nTFLN. Besides, we also show s- and p-polarization independent SHG in elliptical\nBragg nanocavities. This work could inspire studying nonlinear optics at the\nnanoscale on TFLN as well as other novel photonic platforms.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
