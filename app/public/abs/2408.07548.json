Let $k^*$ be\nthe supremum of the idempotent elements of $*$ in $[0,1)$. It is shown that if\n$k^*=1$ (resp. $k^*<1$), then an approach space is probabilistic metrizable\nwith respect to $*$ if and only if it is probabilistic metrizable with respect\nto the minimum (resp. product) t-norm.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
