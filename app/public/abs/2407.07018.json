This\nincreases both the cost and time-to-completion for studies. We show how large,\ndiverse observational text data can be mined with large language models (LLMs)\nto produce inexpensive causal effect estimates under appropriate causal\nassumptions. We introduce NATURAL, a novel family of causal effect estimators\nbuilt with LLMs that operate over datasets of unstructured text. Our estimators\nuse LLM conditional distributions (over variables of interest, given the text\ndata) to assist in the computation of classical estimators of causal effect. We\novercome a number of technical challenges to realize this idea, such as\nautomating data curation and using LLMs to impute missing information. We\nprepare six (two synthetic and four real) observational datasets, paired with\ncorresponding ground truth in the form of randomized trials, which we used to\nsystematically evaluate each step of our pipeline. NATURAL estimators\ndemonstrate remarkable performance, yielding causal effect estimates that fall\nwithin 3 percentage points of their ground truth counterparts, including on\nreal-world Phase 3/4 clinical trials. Our results suggest that unstructured\ntext data is a rich source of causal effect information, and NATURAL is a first\nstep towards an automated pipeline to tap this resource.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
