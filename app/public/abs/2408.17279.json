A conjecture of Kleiner, recently disproven by Anttila\nand the second author, proposes a combinatorial sufficient condition. The\ncounterexamples constructed are all topologically one dimensional, and the\nsufficiency of Kleiner's condition remains open for most other examples.\n  A separate question of Kleiner and Schioppa, apparently unrelated to the\nproblem above, asks about the existence of \"analytically $1$-dimensional\nplanes\": metric measure spaces quasisymmetric to the Euclidean plane but\nsupporting a $1$-dimensional analytic structure in the sense of Cheeger.\n  In this paper, we construct an example for which the conclusion of Kleiner's\nconjecture is not known to hold. We show that either this conclusion fails in\nour example or there exists an \"analytically $1$-dimensional plane\". Thus, our\nconstruction either yields a new counterexample to Kleiner's conjecture,\ndifferent in kind from those of Anttila and the second author, or a resolution\nto the problem of Kleiner--Schioppa.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
