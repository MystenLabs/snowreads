Data processing units (DPUs) are a promising\nsolution, but utilizing them for data processing needs characterizing the new\nhardware and recognizing their capabilities and constraints. We hence propose\nDPDPU, a platform for holistically exploiting DPUs to optimize data processing\ntasks that are critical to performance and cost. It seeks to fill the semantic\ngap between DPUs and data processing systems and handle DPU heterogeneity with\nthree engines dedicated to compute, networking, and storage. This paper\ndescribes our vision, DPDPU's key components, their associated utilization\nchallenges, as well as the current progress and future plans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"4XhKALnzCOUwXya-DFd-seWW_JnxuX4QyxwFShy98rQ","pdfSize":"983492"}
