The setup is based on a glass capillary, in which\nprecipitation of corrosion products in the interfacial aqueous phase can be\nmonitored over time with optical microscopy, and chemically and structurally\ncharacterized with microscopic synchrotron-based techniques (X-ray\nfluorescence, X-ray diffraction, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy). Moreover,\nquantification of precipitates through X-ray transmission measurements provides\nin-situ corrosion rates. We illustrate this setup for iron corrosion in a pH 8\nelectrolyte, revealing the critical role of O2 and iron diffusion in governing\nthe precipitation of ferrihydrite and its transformation to goethite. Corrosion\nand coupled reactive transport processes can thus be monitored and\nfundamentally investigated at the metal-electrolyte interface, with\nmicrometer-scale resolution. This capillary setup has potential applications\nfor in-situ corrosion studies of various metals and environments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
