Here, we present deepmriprep, a neural network-based\npipeline that performs all necessary preprocessing steps for VBM analysis of\nT1-weighted MR images using deep neural networks. Utilizing the Graphics\nProcessing Unit (GPU), deepmriprep is 37 times faster than CAT12, the leading\nVBM preprocessing toolbox. The proposed method matches CAT12 in accuracy for\ntissue segmentation and image registration across more than 100 datasets and\nshows strong correlations in VBM results. Tissue segmentation maps from\ndeepmriprep have over 95% agreement with ground truth maps, and its non-linear\nregistration, using supervised SYMNet, predicts smooth deformation fields\ncomparable to CAT12. The high processing speed of deepmriprep enables rapid\npreprocessing of extensive datasets and thereby fosters the application of VBM\nanalysis to large-scale neuroimaging studies and opens the door to real-time\napplications. Finally, deepmripreps straightforward, modular design enables\nresearchers to easily understand, reuse, and advance the underlying methods,\nfostering further advancements in neuroimaging research. deepmriprep can be\nconveniently installed as a Python package and is publicly accessible at\nhttps://github.com/wwu-mmll/deepmriprep.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Vbz87EUBeO6tCXAy1Jg9wcoi6QQSumwaZkUnQ9pVc8k","pdfSize":"6622583"}
