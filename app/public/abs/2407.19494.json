We find that although these states are all above\ntheir open flavor thresholds, their rearrangement decay widths are rather\nnarrow which can be understood by the mismatching of the wave functions between\nthe initial and final states. It implies that the tetraquarks of\n$cs\\bar{c}\\bar{s}$ and $cc\\bar{s}\\bar{s}$ may have a good chance to exist as\ngenuine tetraquark states. It also shows that the color-spin configurations of\nthe $cs\\bar{c}\\bar{s}$ and $cc\\bar{s}\\bar{s}$ systems are quite different. We\nfind that for a physical state of $cs\\bar{c}\\bar{s}$ its color configurations\ncan be dominated by either the $|11\\rangle_{c}$ or $|88\\rangle_{c}$ ones. It\nsuggests that some hidden charm-strange tetraquark states may strongly couple\nto two color-singlet hadrons if the kinematics and dynamics allow. In contrast,\nwe find that the color configurations $|11\\rangle_{c}$ and $|88\\rangle_{c}$ in\na double charm-strange $cc\\bar{s}\\bar{s}$ state are rather compatible. It may\nsuggest that an overall color-singlet tetraquark (i.e. a genuine color-singlet)\nshould always play a role in the $T_{cc\\bar{s}\\bar{s}}$ states. Discussions\ntaking into account some experimental candidates are presented, and suggestions\non further experimental searches are also made.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"eywHNTsh_ZNMLAMksY2kDSFf4JaD23CUJ_IzKx44shI","pdfSize":"365475"}
