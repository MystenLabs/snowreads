Based on the Chebyshev\nexpansion of the time evolution of the single-particle density matrix, the\nmethod gives access to nonperturbative excitation and relaxation phenomena in\nmodels of disordered materials with sizes on the experimental scale. After\nvalidating the method by applying it to saturable optical absorption in clean\ngraphene, we uncover that disorder can enhance absorption in graphene and that\nthe interplay between light, anisotropy, and disorder in nanoporous graphene\nmight be appealing for sensing applications. Beyond the optical properties of\ngraphene-like materials, the method can be applied to a wide range of\nlarge-area materials and systems with arbitrary descriptions of defects and\ndisorder.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"ekaykZkKFsOESKejn2NaSPbLdi32Yv8PmMVIvHd5EVE","pdfSize":"1358280"}
