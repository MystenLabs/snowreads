Occupancy Grid Maps (OGMs) are commonly employed for scene\nprediction due to their structured spatial representation, flexibility across\nsensor modalities and integration of uncertainty. Recent studies have\nsuccessfully combined OGMs with deep learning methods to predict the evolution\nof scene and learn complex behaviours. These methods, however, do not consider\nprediction of flow or velocity vectors in the scene. In this work, we propose a\nnovel multi-task framework that leverages dynamic OGMs and semantic information\nto predict both future vehicle semantic grids and the future flow of the scene.\nThis incorporation of semantic flow not only offers intermediate scene features\nbut also enables the generation of warped semantic grids. Evaluation on the\nreal-world NuScenes dataset demonstrates improved prediction capabilities and\nenhanced ability of the model to retain dynamic vehicles within the scene.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
