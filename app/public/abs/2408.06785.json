As humans become more and more integrated\ninto human-to-anything interactions, the understanding of the human as a whole\nbecomes critical. In this paper, we conduct a structured review of the human\ndigital twin to indicate where modern paradigms fail to model the human agent.\nParticularly, the mechanistic viewpoint limits the usability of human and\ngeneral digital twins. Instead, we propose a novel way of thinking about\nmodels, states, and their relations: Perspectives-Observer-Transparency. The\nmodelling paradigm indicates how transparency - or whiteness - relates to the\nabilities of an observer, which again allows to model the penetration depth of\na system model into the human psyche. The split in between the human's outer\nand inner states is described with a perspectives model, featuring the\nintroperspective and the exteroperspective. We explore this novel paradigm by\nemploying two recent scenarios from ongoing research and give examples to\nemphasize specific characteristics of the modelling paradigm.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
