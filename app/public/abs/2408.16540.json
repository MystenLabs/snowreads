However,\nexisting approaches still struggle to generate high-quality images with\nconsistent pose alignment, resulting in unsatisfactory outputs. In this paper,\nwe propose a framework delving into the graph relations of pose priors to\nprovide control information for human image generation. The main idea is to\nestablish a graph topological structure between the pose priors and latent\nrepresentation of diffusion models to capture the intrinsic associations\nbetween different pose parts. A Progressive Graph Integrator (PGI) is designed\nto learn the spatial relationships of the pose priors with the graph structure,\nadopting a hierarchical strategy within an Adapter to gradually propagate\ninformation across different pose parts. A pose perception loss is further\nintroduced based on a pretrained pose estimation network to minimize the pose\ndifferences. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments conducted on\nthe Human-Art and LAION-Human datasets demonstrate that our model achieves\nsuperior performance, with a 9.98% increase in pose average precision compared\nto the latest benchmark model.
