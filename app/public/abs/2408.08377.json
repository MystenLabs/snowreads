We demonstrate how the joint factorization consistently\nfactorize all perturbative collinear sensitivities of partonic scattering in\nboth QCD and QED into corresponding universal hadron and lepton distribution\nfunctions without the need of any parameters other than the standard\nfactorization scale. We discuss the necessary modification to DGLAP-type\nevolution of the parton and lepton distribution functions in this joint\nfactorization approach. We also discuss the potential impact of this joint\nfactorization approach on the extraction of partonic information from\nlepton-hadron DIS.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
