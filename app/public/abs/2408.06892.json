We give\nexplicit coordinate expressions of the resulting reduced differential\nequations, the so-called Lagrange-Poincare-Herglotz equations. Our framework\nrelied on the associated Herglotz vector field and its projected vector field,\nand the use of well-chosen quasi-velocities. Some examples are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZNry6LwrXc4TfYQw2JOYLMZqWdBjWsoZT0AzKfFbsNM","pdfSize":"309661"}
