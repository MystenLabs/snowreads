When the\nstate space of the system is infinite-dimensional, the Liouville superoperator\nis unbounded whenever the corresponding Hamiltonian is. In this paper, we\nprovide a rigorous, pedagogically-oriented, and self-contained introduction to\nthe quantum Liouville formalism in the presence of unbounded operators. We\npresent and discuss a characterization of the domain of the Liouville\nsuperoperator originally due to M. Courbage; starting from that, we develop\nsome simpler characterizations of the domain of the Liouvillian and its square.\nWe also provide, with explicit proofs, some domains of essential\nself-adjointness (cores) of the Liouvillian.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
