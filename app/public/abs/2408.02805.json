In\nparticular, we give multidimensional polynomial systems for which the\nconditioning of a subproblem can be worse than the conditioning of the original\nproblem by a factor that grows exponentially with the number of variables.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
