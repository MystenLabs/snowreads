In this Perspective, we describe\nthe importance of local magnetic structure in several classes of emerging\nmaterials and present the magnetic pair distribution function (mPDF) technique\nas a powerful tool for studying short-range magnetism from neutron\ntotal-scattering data. We then provide a selection of examples of mPDF analysis\napplied to magnetic materials of recent technological and fundamental interest,\nincluding the antiferromagnetic semiconductor MnTe, geometrically frustrated\nmagnets, and iron-oxide magnetic nanoparticles. The rapid development of mPDF\nanalysis since its formalization a decade ago puts this technique in a strong\nposition for making continued impact in the study of local magnetism in\nemerging materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
