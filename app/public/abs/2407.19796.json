We call a subsequence {$f$-segmental} if it is composed of $f$\nfactors. More precisely, any string of the form $u_1 \\dots u_f$ is an\n$f$-segmental subsequence of a string $v_0u_1v_1 \\dots u_fv_f$. Since factors\nare $1$-segmental subsequences, this relativizes the notions of factors and\nsubsequences. This paper studies some basic problems concerning $f$-segmental\nsubsequences: namely, the longest common $(f_1,f_2)$-segmental subsequence\nproblem and the $f$-segmental subsequence matching problem. The former asks the\nlongest string that is an $f_i$-segmental subsequence of two input strings\n$T_i$ with $i=1,2$. The latter asks whether an input string $P$ is an\n$f$-segmental subsequence of the other input string $T$. We present\npolynomial-time algorithms for those problems and show that the one for the\n$f$-segmental subsequence matching problem is optimal modulo sub-polynomial\nfactors under the strong exponential-time hypothesis.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
