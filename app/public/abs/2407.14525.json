All the available technology\nin the field of speech recognition doesn't come with an interface for\ncommunication for people with hearing, speech, or cognitive disabilities. The\nproposed model proposes the speech from the user, is transmitted to the speech\nrecognition layer where it is converted into text and then that text is then\ntransmitted to the morse code conversion layer where the morse code of the\ncorresponding speech is given as the output. The accuracy of the model is\ncompletely dependent on speech recognition, as the morse code conversion is a\nprocess. The model is tested with recorded audio files with different\nparameters. The proposed model's WER and accuracy are both determined to be\n10.18% and 89.82%, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Sound","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XTURO5yX_kA59a7jtWH_AiRFMtO65rTVbr-46ad55gQ","pdfSize":"985979"}
