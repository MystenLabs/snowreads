In particular, we incorporate the effects of\nGUP into the Parikh-Wilczek tunneling process for Hawking radiation. To this\neffect, we observe that results obtained due to GUP correction resemble that of\nthe Reissner-Nordstr\\\"{om} black hole, showing similarities to the nature of an\nelectric charge. We also find that, within this framework, the emission is not\npurely thermal, thus addressing the information loss problem through the\ncorrelation function.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Nu_SLhPjgvwY3nrEnuy-Q7U6fPZpeg9jLwnOOWhwo4g","pdfSize":"395654"}
