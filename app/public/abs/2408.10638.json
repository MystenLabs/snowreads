Employing\nself-consistent mean-field calculations, we find that superconductivity in this\ncompound is predominantly governed by interlayer pairing mechanisms. In the\nsuperconducting state, our analysis uncovers a notable absence of a spin\nresonance mode, a finding that deviates from conventional expectations.\nFurthermore, we reveal a spectrum of energy-dependent incommensurate spin\nexcitations. The observed incommensurate structures are elegantly explained by\nthe nesting effect of energy contours, providing a coherent and comprehensive\naccount of experimental observations. The implications of these spin\nexcitations in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ are profound, offering critical insights into\nthe superconducting mechanism at play. Our results not only contribute to the\nunderstanding of this novel superconductor but also pave the way for further\nresearch into the interplay between spin dynamics and unconventional\nsuperconductivity in layered materials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XNeNp7lPownTMv9HhNipYKPptXSzE7rjT8KUTYcQYMk","pdfSize":"1288056"}
