Effective and efficient response to natural disasters is\nessential for building resilience and a sustainable urban environment. Two\ntypes of information are usually the most necessary and difficult to gather in\ndisaster response. The first information is about disaster damage perception,\nwhich shows how badly people think that urban infrastructure has been damaged.\nThe second information is geolocation awareness, which means how people\nwhereabouts are made available. In this paper, we proposed a novel disaster\nmapping framework, namely CVDisaster, aiming at simultaneously addressing\ngeolocalization and damage perception estimation using cross-view Street-View\nImagery (SVI) and Very High-Resolution satellite imagery. CVDisaster consists\nof two cross-view models, where CVDisaster-Geoloc refers to a cross-view\ngeolocalization model based on a contrastive learning objective with a Siamese\nConvNeXt image encoder, and CVDisaster-Est is a cross-view classification model\nbased on a Couple Global Context Vision Transformer (CGCViT). Taking Hurricane\nIAN as a case study, we evaluate the CVDisaster framework by creating a novel\ncross-view dataset (CVIAN) and conducting extensive experiments. As a result,\nwe show that CVDisaster can achieve highly competitive performance (over 80%\nfor geolocalization and 75% for damage perception estimation) with even limited\nfine-tuning efforts, which largely motivates future cross-view models and\napplications within a broader GeoAI research community.
