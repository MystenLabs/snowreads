For this purpose, we carry out\nthe operator extraction of a square root in the Eriksen operator. The derived\ncorrection is important for the scattering of relativistic particles. Since the\ndescription of this scattering by a relativistic wave equation of the second\norder is more convenient, we determine a general connection between relativisic\nwave equations of the first and second orders. For Dirac particles, the\nrelativisic wave equation of the second order is obtained with the correction\nsimilar to that to the Foldy-Wouthuysen Hamiltonian.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
