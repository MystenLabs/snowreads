The model is motivated from applications in photoacoustic\ntomography when one seeks to recover both the wave speed and the initial\nultrasound pressure from a single ultrasound signal. In particular, our result\nshows that the ratio of the initial ultrasound pressure and the wave speed\nsquared uniquely determines both of them respectively.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
