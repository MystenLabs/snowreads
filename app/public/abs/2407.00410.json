To address challenges related to error\naccumulation in autoregressive models and the complexities associated with\nself-supervised model design for this task, we propose a two-stage network\nframework. This framework consists of a primitive network and a constraint\nnetwork, transforming the sketch analysis task into a set prediction problem to\nenhance the effective handling of primitives and constraints. By decoupling\ntarget types from parameters, the model gains increased flexibility and\noptimization while reducing complexity. Additionally, the constraint network\nincorporates a pointer module to explicitly indicate the relationship between\nconstraint parameters and primitive indices, enhancing interpretability and\nperformance. Qualitative and quantitative analyses on two publicly available\ndatasets demonstrate the superiority of this method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rBQ_WsWOdMJXpX7pW0ehzKSOtrAWp7XncKb5ytKKar8","pdfSize":"2313754"}
