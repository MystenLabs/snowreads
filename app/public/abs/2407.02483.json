To bridge this gap, this paper introduces the first agent\nexplicitly designed for the medical field, named \\textbf{M}ulti-modal\n\\textbf{Med}ical \\textbf{Agent} (MMedAgent). We curate an instruction-tuning\ndataset comprising six medical tools solving seven tasks, enabling the agent to\nchoose the most suitable tools for a given task. Comprehensive experiments\ndemonstrate that MMedAgent achieves superior performance across a variety of\nmedical tasks compared to state-of-the-art open-source methods and even the\nclosed-source model, GPT-4o. Furthermore, MMedAgent exhibits efficiency in\nupdating and integrating new medical tools.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
