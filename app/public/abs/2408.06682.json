While numerous techniques have been\ndeveloped that show promise in simulated datasets, their efficacy often\ndiminishes when applied to real-world data. A primary issue is the\nfrequency-dependent variations in the instrumental response. In this paper, we\npropose a novel approach utilizing the internal cross-correlation among\ndifferent frequencies to calibrate the beam's frequency fluctuations. Using a\nsimulated dataset that incorporates frequency-dependent random fluctuations\ninto the beam model, we illustrate that our method can achieve considerable\nimprovements over traditional techniques. Our results represent a step forward\nin enhancing the precision and reliability of foreground removal in intensity\nmapping surveys.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
