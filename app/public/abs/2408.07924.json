Our new and archival ATCA radio\nobservations were analysed along with $Chandra$ X-ray data. These observations\nshow a prominent `bullet' shaped feature beyond the southwestern boundary of\nthe SNR. Both X-ray morphology and radio polarisation analysis support a\nphysical connection of this feature to the SNR. The 'bullet' feature's apparent\nvelocity is estimated at $\\sim$1300 km s$^{-1}$, based on its distance\n($\\sim$10 pc) from the remnant's geometric centre and estimated age ($\\sim$7600\nyrs). we estimated the radio spectral index, $\\alpha= -0.55 \\pm 0.03$ which is\ntypical of middle-age SNRs. Polarisation maps created for N49 show low to\nmoderate levels of mean fractional polarisation estimated at 7$\\pm$1% and\n10$\\pm$1% for 5.5 and 9 GHz, respectively. These values are noticeably larger\nthan found in previous studies. Moreover, the mean value for the Faraday\nrotation of SNR N49 from combining CABB data is 212$\\pm$65 rad m$^{-2}$ and the\nmaximum value of RM is 591$\\pm$103 rad m$^{-2}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
