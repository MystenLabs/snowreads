The simulations resolve (4\nM$_\\odot$ gas phase mass resolution, $\\sim$ 0.1 pc spatial resolution) the\nmulti-phase interstellar medium with a non-equilibrium chemical heating/cooling\nnetwork at temperatures below $10^4$ K. Massive stars are sampled individually\nand interact with the ISM through the formation of HII regions and supernova\nexplosions. In the extended starburst phase, the ISM is dominated by cold\n($T_\\mathrm{gas} < 300$ K) filamentary clouds with self-similar internal\nstructures. The clouds have masses of $10^{2.6}$ - $10^{5.6}$ M$_\\odot$ with a\npower law mass function, $dN/dM \\propto M^\\alpha$ with $\\alpha = -1.78 (\\pm\n0.08)$. They also follow the Larson relations, in good agreement with\nobservations. We trace the lifecycle of the cold clouds and find that they\nfollow an exponential lifetime distribution and an e-folding time of $\\sim$ 3.5\nMyr. Clouds with peak masses below $10^4$ M$_\\odot$ follow a power law relation\nwith their average lifetime $\\tau_\\mathrm{life} \\propto M^{0.3}_\\mathrm{max}$\nwhich flattens out for higher cloud masses at $ < 10$ Myr. A similar relation\nexists between cloud size at peak mass and lifetime. This simulation of the\nevolution of a realistic galactic cold cloud population supports the rapid\nformation and disruption of star-forming clouds by stellar radiation and\nsupernovae on a timescale less than 10 Myr.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
