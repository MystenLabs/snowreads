We find large diode\nefficiencies in the wide-reaching finite-momentum pairing regimes of the phase\ndiagram. Remarkably, even perfect diode efficiency of 100% can be obtained in\nthe presence of an external magnetic field. We attribute the largest\nefficiencies to competition between multiple zero-momentum (BCS) and\nfinite-momentum superconducting states, which is connected to a topological\nnodal-to-nodeless transition in altermagnets with magnetic field, making our\nresults applicable to a wide range of altermagnets.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
