Emerging\narithmetic-based FHE schemes (ar-FHE), like BGV, demonstrate even better\nperformance in word-wise comparison operations over non-arithmetic FHE (na-FHE)\nschemes, such as TFHE, especially for basic tasks like comparing values,\nfinding maximums, and minimums. This shows the universality of ar-FHE in\neffectively handling both arithmetic and non-arithmetic operations without the\nexpensive conversion between arithmetic and non-arithmetic FHEs. We refer to\nuniversal arithmetic Fully Homomorphic Encryption as uFHE. The arithmetic\noperations in uFHE remain consistent with those in the original arithmetic FHE,\nwhich have seen significant acceleration. However, its non-arithmetic\ncomparison operations differ, are slow, and have not been as thoroughly studied\nor accelerated. In this paper, we introduce BoostCom, a scheme designed to\nspeed up word-wise comparison operations, enhancing the efficiency of uFHE\nsystems. BoostCom involves a multi-prong optimizations including infrastructure\nacceleration (Multi-level heterogeneous parallelization and GPU-related\nimprovements), and algorithm-aware optimizations (slot compaction, non-blocking\ncomparison semantic). Together, BoostCom achieves an end-to-end performance\nimprovement of more than an order of magnitude (11.1x faster) compared to the\nstate-of-the-art CPU-based uFHE systems, across various FHE parameters and\ntasks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
