In this paper, we investigate its application in an\namplify-and-forward (AF) relay system, where a multi-MA AF relay is deployed to\nassist in the wireless communications from a source to a destination. In\nparticular, we aim to maximize the achievable rate at the destination, by\njointly optimizing the AF weight matrix at the relay and its MAs' positions in\ntwo stages for receiving the signal from the source and transmitting its\namplified version to the destination, respectively. However, compared to the\nexisting one-stage antenna position optimization, the two-stage position\noptimization is more challenging due to its intricate coupling in the\nachievable rate at the destination. To tackle this challenge, we decompose the\nconsidered problem into several subproblems by invoking the alternating\noptimization (AO) and solve them by using the semidefinite programming and the\ngradient ascent. Numerical results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed\nsystem over the conventional relaying system with fixed-position antennas\n(FPAs) and also drive essential insights.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
