We find that an approach based on\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) using content drawn from astronomy journal\npapers can be used to infer high-priority research areas. While the LDA models\nare challenging to interpret, we find that they may be strongly associated with\nmeaningful keywords and scientific papers which allow for human interpretation\nof the topic models.\n  Significant correlation is found between the results of applying these models\nto the previous decade of astronomical research (\"1998-2010\" corpus) and the\ncontents of the science frontier panel report which contains high-priority\nresearch areas identified by the 2010 National Academies' Astronomy and\nAstrophysics Decadal Survey (\"DS2010\" corpus). Significant correlations also\nexist between model results of the 1998-2010 corpus and the submitted\nwhitepapers to the Decadal Survey (\"whitepapers\" corpus). Importantly, we\nderive predictive metrics based on these results which can provide leading\nindicators of which content modeled by the topic models will become highly\ncited in the future. Using these identified metrics and the associations\nbetween papers and topic models it is possible to identify important papers for\nplanners to consider.\n  A preliminary version of our work was presented by Thronson etal. 2021 and\nThomas etal. 2022.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"HU712JhKS4PysRp2CZo19uuszQqX0kwEJ6s1jRB8zHQ","pdfSize":"1482375"}
