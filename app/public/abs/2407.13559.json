This study introduces Qalam, a novel foundation model designed\nfor Arabic OCR and HWR, built on a SwinV2 encoder and RoBERTa decoder\narchitecture. Our model significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving a\nWord Error Rate (WER) of just 0.80% in HWR tasks and 1.18% in OCR tasks. We\ntrain Qalam on a diverse dataset, including over 4.5 million images from Arabic\nmanuscripts and a synthetic dataset comprising 60k image-text pairs. Notably,\nQalam demonstrates exceptional handling of Arabic diacritics, a critical\nfeature in Arabic scripts. Furthermore, it shows a remarkable ability to\nprocess high-resolution inputs, addressing a common limitation in current OCR\nsystems. These advancements underscore Qalam's potential as a leading solution\nfor Arabic script recognition, offering a significant leap in accuracy and\nefficiency.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
