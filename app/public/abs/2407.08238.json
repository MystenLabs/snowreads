This constraint often leads to fleet under-utilization and\nincurs high parking costs for idle vehicles. To address this inefficiency, we\npropose a N-user matching algorithm which is designed to facilitate one-way\ntrips within the round-trip rental framework. Our algorithm addresses the joint\nproblem of optimal pricing and user matching through a Two-Stage Integer Linear\nProgramming (ILP)-based formulation. In the first stage, optimal rental prices\nare determined by setting a risk factor that governs the likelihood of matching\na set of N-user. The second stage involves maximizing expected profit through a\nnovel ILP-based user-matching formulation. Testing our algorithm on real-world\nscenarios demonstrates an approximate 35\\% increase in demand fulfillment.\nAdditionally, we assess the model robustness under uncertainty by varying\nfactors such as the risk factor (probability of user ride acceptance at the\noffered price), cost factor (rental cost-to-fare ratio), and maximum chain\nlength.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
