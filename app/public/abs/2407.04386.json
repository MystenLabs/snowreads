The algorithm is\nfocused on providing real-time solutions for local exploration in a fully\nunknown and unstructured environment while directly incorporating exploratory\nbehavior, robot-safe path planning, and robot actuation into the central\nproblem. ERRT provides a complete sampling and tree-based solution for\nevaluating \"where to go next\" by considering a trade-off between maximizing\ninformation gain, and minimizing the distances travelled and the robot\nactuation along the path. The complete scheme is evaluated in extensive\nsimulations, comparisons, as well as real-world field experiments in\nconstrained and narrow subterranean and GPS-denied environments. The framework\nis fully ROS-integrated, straight-forward to use, and we open-source it at\nhttps://github.com/LTU-RAI/ExplorationRRT.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
