However, existing mechanisms neglect the network effects of client\nparticipation, leading to suboptimal incentives and social welfare. This paper\naddresses this gap by exploring network effects in FL incentive mechanism\ndesign. We establish a theoretical model to analyze FL model performance and\nquantify the impact of network effects on heterogeneous client participation.\nOur analysis reveals the non-monotonic nature of FL network effects. To\nleverage such effects, we propose a model trading and sharing (MTS) framework\nthat allows clients to obtain FL models through participation or purchase. To\ntackle heterogeneous clients' strategic behaviors, we further design a socially\nefficient model trading and sharing (SEMTS) mechanism. Our mechanism achieves\nsocial welfare maximization solely through customer payments, without\nadditional incentive costs. Experimental results on an FL hardware prototype\ndemonstrate up to 148.86% improvement in social welfare compared to existing\nmechanisms.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
