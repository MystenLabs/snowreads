The characteristic of this\nmodel is that the coupling connections between the oscillators can be either\nattractive or repulsive. We list all critical points and investigate their\nstability. We furthermore present a framework studying convergence towards\nstable critical points under special coupled strengths. The main tool is the\nlinearization and the monotonicity arguments of oscillator diameter.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
