In\nparticular we show that the $\\alpha$--order Riemann--Liouville fractional\nderivative maps $W^{p,s}_0(\\Omega)$ to $W^{p,s-\\alpha}(\\Omega)$, for all\n$0<\\alpha<s<1$ and the $\\alpha$--order Marchaud fractional derivative with even\nextension maps the fractional Sobolev space $W^{p,s}((0,\\infty))$ to\n$W^{p,s-\\alpha}(\\real)$ for all $0<\\alpha<s<1$ and $ps\\geq1$ . The proof is\nbased on the Calder\\'{o}n--Lions interpolation theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
