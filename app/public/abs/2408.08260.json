To recover missing components\nfrom under-complete NMF, we introduce GSVD-NMF, which proposes new components\nbased on the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) between\npreliminary NMF results and the SVD of the original matrix. Simulation and\nexperimental results demonstrate that GSVD-NMF often recovers missing features\nfrom under-complete NMF and helps NMF achieve better local optima.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
