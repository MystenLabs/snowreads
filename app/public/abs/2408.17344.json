Re-ranking is an\nintegral component of many retrieval pipelines; however, there exist numerous\napproaches to it, relying on different implementation methods. rerankers\nunifies these methods into a single user-friendly interface, allowing\npractitioners and researchers alike to explore different methods while only\nchanging a single line of Python code. Moreover ,rerankers ensures that its\nimplementations are done with the fewest dependencies possible, and re-uses the\noriginal implementation whenever possible, guaranteeing that our simplified\ninterface results in no performance degradation compared to more complex ones.\nThe full source code and list of supported models are updated regularly and\navailable at https://github.com/answerdotai/rerankers.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"zDpTyxXj6eMtZcoyeNAzrCtgPsQFrni4GOg402RyY_I","pdfSize":"125688"}
