Unlike most\nexisting approaches, SF3D is explicitly trained for mesh generation,\nincorporating a fast UV unwrapping technique that enables swift texture\ngeneration rather than relying on vertex colors. The method also learns to\npredict material parameters and normal maps to enhance the visual quality of\nthe reconstructed 3D meshes. Furthermore, SF3D integrates a delighting step to\neffectively remove low-frequency illumination effects, ensuring that the\nreconstructed meshes can be easily used in novel illumination conditions.\nExperiments demonstrate the superior performance of SF3D over the existing\ntechniques.
