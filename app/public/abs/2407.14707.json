Although various\nschemes have been proposed to address the issue, it is still very hard to make\na reasonable tradeoff between device performance and practicability. In this\nwork, we demonstrate a pixelated spectral router based on sparse meta-atom\narray, which can efficiently separate the incident R (600-700 nm), G (500-600\nnm), and B (400-500 nm) band light to the corresponding pixels of a Bayer image\nsensor, providing over 56% signal enhancement above the traditional color\nfilter scheme. The CMOS-compatible spectral router has superior characteristics\nof polarization insensitivity and high incident angle tolerance (over\n30{\\deg}), enabled by simple compound Si3N4 nanostructures which are very\nsuitable for massive production. Imaging experiments are conducted to verify\nits potential for real applications. Our pixelated spectral router scheme is\nalso found to be robust and could be freely adapted to image sensors of various\npixel sizes, having great potential in building the new generation of\nhigh-performance image sensing components.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
