The physical model contains two Kerr-nonlinear\nresonators and a cavity. By properly designing the parameters, each\nKerr-nonlinear resonator is confined in the cat-state subspace and the\nentangled cat states can be generated efficiently. We introduce composite\ntwo-photon drives with multiple amplitudes and frequencies to improve the\nfidelity of the entangled cat states in the presence of parameter errors. The\nperformance of the protocol is estimated by taking into account the parametric\nerrors and decoherence. Numerical simulation results show that the protocol is\ninsensitive to timing error and detuning error, and has strong robustness to\ndecoherence. We hope the protocol may provide a method for preparing stable\nentangled cat states.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
