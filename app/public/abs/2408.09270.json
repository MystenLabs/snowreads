This work provides a synthesis of recent\ninsights into the behaviour of quantum vortices within atomic Bose-Einstein\ncondensates (BECs) subject to curved geometric constraints. We highlight the\nsignificant impact of the curvature on the condensate density and phase\ndistribution, particularly in quasi-one-dimensional waveguides for different\nangular momentum states. An engineered periodic transport of the quantized\nvorticity between density-coupled ring-shaped condensates is discussed. The\nsignificant role of curved geometry in shaping the dynamics of rotational\nJosephson vortices in long atomic Josephson junctions is illustrated for the\nsystem of vertically stacked toroidal condensates. Different methods for the\ncontrolled creation of rotational Josephson vortices in coupled ring systems\nare described in the context of the formation of long-lived vortex\nconfigurations in shell-shaped BECs with cylindrical geometry. Future\ndirections of explorations of vortices in curved geometries with implications\nfor quantum information processing and sensing technologies are discussed.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
