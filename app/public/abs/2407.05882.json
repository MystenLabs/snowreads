Our proof\nis an adaptation of a contradiction and compactness argument that so far had\nbeen only used to prove estimates in H\\\"older spaces. This new approach is\nsimpler than previous ones, and avoids the use of any interpolation theorem.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
