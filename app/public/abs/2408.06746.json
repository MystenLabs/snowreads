The\nlocating-chromatic number of a graph $G$ can be defined as the cardinality of a\nminimum resolving partition of the vertex set $V(G)$ such that all vertices\nhave different coordinates and every two adjacent vertices in $G$ is not\ncontained in the same partition class. In this case, the coordinate of a vertex\nin $G$ is expressed in terms of the distances of this vertex to all partition\nclasses. The corona product of a graph $G$ of order $n$ and a graph $H,$\ndenoted by $G \\odot H,$ is the graph obtained by taking one copy of $G$ and $n$\ncopies of $H$ and joining the $i^{th}$-vertex of $G$ to every vertex in the\n$i^{th}$-copy of $H$. In this paper, we determine the sharp general bound of\nthe locating-chromatic number of $G \\odot H$ for $G$ is a connected graph and\n$H$ is an arbitrary graph, or $G$ is a tree graph and $H$ is a complement of\ncomplete graph.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"W12_wZ2R_2SxbPzBrk-mooRAHX8X0BXTkdEN3ix1v9k","pdfSize":"248489"}
