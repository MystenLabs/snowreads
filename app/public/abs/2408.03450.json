The study integrates high-throughput finite element simulations\nand Gaussian Process Regression to develop a surrogate model that predicts\ncrash parameters with high accuracy while providing uncertainty estimates. The\nmodel was trained using data generated from thermoforming and crash simulations\nover a range of material and process parameters. Validation against new\nsimulation data demonstrated the model's predictive accuracy with mean absolute\npercentage errors within 8.08% for all output variables. Additionally, a Monte\nCarlo uncertainty propagation study revealed the impact of input variability on\noutputs. The results highlight the efficacy of the Gaussian Process Regression\nmodel in capturing complex relationships within the dataset, offering a robust\nand efficient tool for the design optimization of composite battery enclosures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"dZ-tMUykHBGK6CEhc4klTfEjmUucGO_rS9JpFARVU-4","pdfSize":"1858489"}
