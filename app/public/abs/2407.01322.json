We\nconsider all the leading order contributions including the contribution from\nthe interference of $W^-W^+$ diagrams with other possible diagrams. The tagging\nof two $W$ bosons with a pair of jets is done using the jet charge, while the\ndecay products of $W^\\prime$s are tagged as \\emph{up/down}-type using boosted\ndecision trees to construct polarizations and spin correlations. Marginalized\nlimits on five anomalous couplings are obtained by Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nanalysis using polarizations, spin correlations, and cross~section. We found\nthat the full-hadronic channel provides tighter limits on anomalous couplings\nthan compared to the usually sought-after clean semi-leptonic channel, owing to\nthe large contribution from interference.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
