To address this problem, we propose a fingerphoto deblurring\narchitecture referred to as Fingerphoto Deblurring using Wavelet Style Transfer\n(FDWST), which aims to utilize the information transmission of Style Transfer\ntechniques to deblur fingerphotos. Additionally, we incorporate the Discrete\nWavelet Transform (DWT) for its ability to split images into different\nfrequency bands. By combining these two techniques, we can perform Style\nTransfer over a wide array of wavelet frequency bands, thereby increasing the\nquality and variety of sharpness information transferred from sharp to blurry\nimages. Using this technique, our model was able to drastically increase the\nquality of the generated fingerphotos compared to their originals, and achieve\na peak matching accuracy of 0.9907 when tasked with matching a deblurred\nfingerphoto to its sharp counterpart, outperforming multiple other\nstate-of-the-art deblurring and style transfer techniques.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
