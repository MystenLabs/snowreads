The nonlocality is described\nby means of a symmetric singular kernel. We define a notion of weak solution\nadapted to possible degeneracies and prove, as our first main result, its\nglobal-in-time existence. The proof relies on an application of the formal\ngradient flow structure of the system (to overcome the lack of a-priori\nestimates), combined with an extension of the boundedness-by-entropy method, in\nturn involving a careful analysis of an auxiliary variational problem. This\nallows to obtain solutions to an approximate, time-discrete system. Letting the\ntime step size go to zero, we recover the desired nonlocal weak solution where,\ndue to their low regularity, the Cahn-Hilliard terms require a special\ntreatment.\n  Finally, we prove convergence of solutions for this class of nonlocal\nCahn-Hilliard equations to their local counterparts.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
