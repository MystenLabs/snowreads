Accounting for\nwide-separation corrections, which arise from the loss of symmetry in the\ncorrelation of widely separated points on the past light cone, is essential for\ntheir accurate modelling and detection. These corrections can be included\nperturbatively to the standard bispectrum and we compute them analytically for\na generalised line of sight. We include the radial contribution to the\nwide-separations corrections for the first time. We show that the first-order\ncorrections entering the odd multipoles with respect to the line of sight are\nlarge, up to $10 \\%$ of the bispectrum monopole, and need to be included when\nconsidering the leading-order relativistic effects that could be detectable\nwith surveys like DESI and Euclid. The second-order wide-separation and\nrelativistic contributions, including their mixing terms, have implications for\nanalysis of PNG and we show, for the local type, they can mimic $f_{\\rm NL}$ of\norder 10 in the squeezed limit. We present full analytic expressions for all\nthese contributions to the local bispectrum and its multipoles with a publicly\navailable code for their computation.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
