We discuss the basics of this\nimplementation and the scale hierarchies underpinning the simulation. With the\nhelp of a few benchmarks, we show the effect of variation of dark sector\nparameters on thrust and angularities within the dark sector, and study\ncorrelation functions, which can be helpful for understanding the angular\nstructure of these events. Finally we comment on the uncertainties introduced\ndue to lack of knowledge of hadronisation parameters within the dark sectors.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
