Other holmium compounds are of\ninterest, and we here report the synthesis and the magnetic properties of\nHoSi$_{1.67}$ and HoGe$_{1.67}$ which form the same AlB$_2$-type structure but\nwith vacancies. They are found to show the antiferromagnetic order with the\nNeel temperature 17.6(2)K for HoSi$_{1.67}$ and 9.9(2)K for HoGe$_{1.67}$, and\nthe magnetic entropy changes at the temperature are 0.05(1)J/cm$^3$K for\nHoSi$_{1.67}$ and 0.08(1)J/cm$^3$K for HoGe$_{1.67}$. Magnetic orders were\nsuppressed by replacing vacancies with nickel, resulting in an increase of\nmagnetic entropy changes. Distance between the in-plane Ho$^{3+}$ ions appears\nto be an important parameter leading to the transition between the\nantiferromagnetic (HoSi$_{1.67}$) and the ferromagnetic (HoB$_2$) order. The\nfinding may aid the exploration of other heavy rare-earth compounds for similar\napplications.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"s9pMmjsT2c7K2e4zm-0bHzQt4zkRo4pox7ZEpCIWfgw","pdfSize":"522365"}
