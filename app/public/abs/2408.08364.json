Generalized fluctuations, or cumulants, provide\ninformation beyond the mean and variance of an observable. In this letter, we\ndevelop a systematic method to determine the asymptotic behavior of cumulants\nof local observables as the region becomes large. Our analysis reveals that the\nexpansion is closely tied to the geometric characteristics of the region and\nits boundary, with coefficients given by convex moments of the connected\ncorrelation function: the latter is integrated against intrinsic volumes of\nconvex polytopes built from the coordinates, which can be interpreted as\naveraged shadows. A particular application of our method shows that, in two\ndimensions, the leading behavior of odd cumulants of conserved quantities is\ntopological, specifically depending on the Euler characteristic of the region.\nWe illustrate these results with the paradigmatic strongly-interacting system\nof two-dimensional quantum Hall state at filling fraction $1/2$, by performing\nMonte-Carlo calculations of the skewness (third cumulant) of particle number in\nthe Laughlin state.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
