So far, this result relies\non the assumption of a negative Higgs mass parameter, or equivalently, on\nelectroweak spontaneous symmetry breaking. We derive a new, corresponding bound\nfor the case of a positive mass parameter. When the new bound is significantly\nmore restrictive than or comparable to its established counterpart, it may\noffer an explanation for the sign of the Higgs mass parameter, and thus,\nspontaneous symmetry breaking itself. New physics at scales $\\mathcal{O}\n(1-10)$ TeV can lower these bounds as far as the TeV-scale. As an illustration,\nwe consider vacuum stability in the presence of additional TeV-scale fermions\nwith Yukawa couplings to the Higgs, as well as a dimension-six term\nparameterizing new physics in the UV. This scenario requires new physics that\ncouples strongly to the Higgs, and can potentially be probed at future\ncolliders. Finally, to allow for comparison with concrete mechanisms predicting\nmetastability, we provide the mass-dependent lifetime of the electroweak vacuum\nfor this model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"H5AnHh3HTvEEXPCXn9A_Ffiq1irwVcVK-vvmM35BUvE","pdfSize":"1262738"}
