In complement and contrast, traditional population-based\nmetaheuristics rely on reactive environmental interactions without anticipatory\nadaptation. This paper proposes the integration of Active Inference into these\nmetaheuristics to enhance performance through anticipatory environmental\nadaptation. We demonstrate this approach specifically with Ant Colony\nOptimization (ACO) on the Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP). Experimental\nresults indicate that Active Inference can yield some improved solutions with\nonly a marginal increase in computational cost, with interesting patterns of\nperformance that relate to number and topology of nodes in the graph. Further\nwork will characterize where and when different types of Active Inference\naugmentation of population metaheuristics may be efficacious.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Neural and Evolutionary Computing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
