These\napproaches completely overwhelm the conventional interferes, such as\nionization, activation and chemical bonds, and achieves the 1H quantification\nwithin superconducting La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 (or Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2). A large diversity of\n1H composition far beyond the previously expected critical dome was observed,\nwhile their TC were not changed significantly. Furthermore, the\nsuperconductivity was demonstrated to be achievable for La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 reduced\nby Al without any hydrogen associated process, while the superconducting\nproperties for the CaH2 reduced La0.8Sr0.2NiO2 is rather stable after long term\nexposure in air, despite the high volatility of 1H within oxides. All these\nresults indicate that the 1H incorporation composition is not critical to the\nsuperconductivity of the infinite-layer nickelates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
