The model\nconsists of a mechanical equation which is coupled to a diffusion equation with\na degenerate mobility. Having shown existence of weak solutions in a previous\nwork, the focus is first on showing boundedness of the concentration using\nMoser iteration. Afterwards, it is assumed that the external loading is small,\nand it is rigorously shown that solutions of the nonlinear, finite-strain\nsystem converge to solutions of the linear, small-strain system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
