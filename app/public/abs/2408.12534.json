Most existing\nbenchmarks and algorithms are tailored to specific cancer types, limiting their\nability to provide comprehensive cancer analysis. This work presents the first\ninternational competition on abdominal organ and pan-cancer segmentation by\nproviding a large-scale and diverse dataset, including 4650 CT scans with\nvarious cancer types from over 40 medical centers. The winning team established\na new state-of-the-art with a deep learning-based cascaded framework, achieving\naverage Dice Similarity Coefficient scores of 92.3% for organs and 64.9% for\nlesions on the hidden multi-national testing set. The dataset and code of top\nteams are publicly available, offering a benchmark platform to drive further\ninnovations https://codalab.lisn.upsaclay.fr/competitions/12239.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
