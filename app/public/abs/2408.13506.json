We\nthen enforce conservation by making sure that the fluxes around a node sum up\nto zero, which fixes the value of the free parameter. We demonstrate that for\nlinear acoustics one of the non-standard Riemann solvers leads to a vorticity\npreserving method on unstructured meshes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
