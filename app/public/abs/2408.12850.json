Traditional approaches often focus on\nsurface-level linguistic features or learner comprehension levels, neglecting\nthe intricate interplay of factors contributing to question complexity. This\npaper presents a novel framework for domain-specific question difficulty\nestimation, leveraging a suite of NLP techniques and knowledge graph analysis.\nWe introduce four key parameters: Topic Retrieval Cost, Topic Salience, Topic\nCoherence, and Topic Superficiality, each capturing a distinct facet of\nquestion complexity within a given subject domain. These parameters are\noperationalized through topic modelling, knowledge graph analysis, and\ninformation retrieval techniques. A model trained on these features\ndemonstrates the efficacy of our approach in predicting question difficulty. By\noperationalizing these parameters, our framework offers a novel approach to\nquestion complexity estimation, paving the way for more effective question\ngeneration, assessment design, and adaptive learning systems across diverse\nacademic disciplines.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GtRY4z60G6G5HTJa4QL3IyGnRlngVXjB3SgT-Wflwxg","pdfSize":"794515"}
