Potentials have a plateau at large values of the\ninflaton field where the axion forms a flat direction, a saddle point at\n$\\tau=i$, and a minimum at $\\tau=e^{2\\pi i\\over 3}$. Due to the underlying\nhyperbolic geometry, the theory exhibits an $\\alpha$-attractor behavior: its\ncosmological predictions are stable with respect to certain modifications of\nthe $SL(2,\\mathbb{Z})$ invariant potentials. We present a supersymmetric\nversion of this theory in the framework of $\\overline {D3}$ induced geometric\ninflation. The choice of $\\alpha$ is determined by underlying string\ncompactification. For example, in a CY compactification with $T^2$, one has\n$3\\alpha=1$, the lowest discrete Poincar\\'e disk target for LiteBIRD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Q0g8_vXZkM3RYqPC9DkeQQj_1z8fat-Fjp5eWrh5kbo","pdfSize":"7312311"}
