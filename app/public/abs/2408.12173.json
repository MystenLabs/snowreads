For this, we present a classification of the\nprimary areas in knowledge graph technology that harnesses different hardware\nunits for accelerating certain knowledge graph functionalities. We then\nextensively describe respective works, focusing on how KG related schemes\nharness modern hardware accelerators. Based on our review, we identify various\nresearch gaps and future exploratory directions that are anticipated to be of\nsignificant value both for academics and industry practitioners.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Performance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
