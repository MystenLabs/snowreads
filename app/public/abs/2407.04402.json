This paper proposes an\nadaptable, data-driven, maneuverability-dependent, $\\alpha$-quantile-based\nframework for decoding, constructing, splitting, and assessing trajectories\nfrom raw AIS records to improve transparency in AIS data mining. Results\nindicate the proposed filtering algorithm robustly extracts clean, long, and\nuninterrupted trajectories for further processing. An open-source Python\nimplementation of the framework is provided.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
