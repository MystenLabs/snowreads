This makes a variation\nfrom more famous two-way cascades where the excitation can go up and down\nfollowing its excitation or relaxation in the ladder. We provide closed-form\nsolutions for two-photon correlation functions between any transitions in such\ncircular cascades. We discuss how the rich correlations that result from what\nappears to be an extremely simple implementation, are essentially those which\nhave been entertained from complex architectures relying on\nstrongly-correlated, many-body physics or cavity QED effects.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LfmQJCvi3ACdjrTfV6bnFUgr6bWuTfW6rYv-mmscOSc","pdfSize":"1037265"}
