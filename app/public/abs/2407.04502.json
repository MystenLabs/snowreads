Here, we\nstudy the interactions between the longitudinal optical phonons and Lorentzian\nmedium-based dispersive photonic time crystals (PTCs). We demonstrate that a\nstationary charge embedded in the PTCs can excite these longitudinal modes\nthrough the conversion of the static polarization field induced by the charge.\nFurthermore, the PTCs can develop a momentum bandgap across the entire wave\nvector space to amplify the longitudinal modes. Remarkably, this infinite\nmomentum bandgap can be established with minimal temporal modulation of the\nrefractive index when creating the PTCs. Our approach expands the range of\nwaves that can be manipulated in PTCs and shows potential for observing\nmomentum bandgap phenomenon in realistic optical experiments, where the\nmodulation depth of the refractive index is severely constrained.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
