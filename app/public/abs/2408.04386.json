Today, it is increasingly common for\njournalism schools to incorporate data visualization into their curricula.\nHowever, the approach to teaching data visualization in journalism schools can\ndiverge significantly from that in computer science or design schools,\ninfluenced by the varied backgrounds of students and the distinct value systems\ninherent to these disciplines. This paper reviews my experience and reflections\non teaching data visualization in a journalism school. First, I discuss the\nprominent characteristics of journalism education that pose challenges for\ncourse design and teaching. Then, I share firsthand teaching experiences\nrelated to each characteristic and recommend approaches for effective teaching.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IfCKTcAOeLHDb5OIB0otaDTQvG_hcDdt2FP8_udPb5w","pdfSize":"5924967"}
