Experimental advancements have sparked interest in control\nproblems in stochastic thermodynamics, typically concerning a time-dependent\npotential applied to a nanoparticle to reach a target stationary state in a\ngiven time with minimal energy cost. We study this problem for a particle\nsubject to thermal fluctuations in a regime that takes into account the effects\nof inertia, and, building on the results of [1], provide a numerical method to\nfind optimal controls even for non-Gaussian initial and final conditions\ncorresponding to non-harmonic confinements. We show that the momentum mean\ntends to a constant value along the trajectory except at the boundary and the\nevolution of the variance is non-trivial. Our results also support that the\nlower bound on the optimal entropy production computed from the overdamped case\nis tight in the adiabatic limit.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
