However, their measurements are often\ninaccurate and sensitive to local disturbances, in contrast to standardized\nstations (SSs) that provide accurate readings but fall short in number. To\nsimultaneously address the issues of low data quality (MSs) and high label\nsparsity (SSs), a multi-task spatio-temporal network (MTSTN) is proposed, which\nemploys self-supervised learning to utilize massive unlabeled data, aided by\nseasonal and trend decomposition of MS data offering reliable information as\nfeatures. The MTSTN is applied to infer NO$_2$, O$_3$ and PM$_{2.5}$\nconcentrations in a 250 km$^2$ area in Chengdu, China, at a resolution of\n500m$\\times$500m$\\times$1hr. Data from 55 SSs and 323 MSs were used, along with\nmeteorological, traffic, geographic and timestamp data as features. The MTSTN\nexcels in accuracy compared to several benchmarks, and its performance is\ngreatly enhanced by utilizing low-quality MS data. A series of ablation and\npressure tests demonstrate the results' robustness and interpretability,\nshowcasing the MTSTN's practical value for accurate and affordable AQ\ninference.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
