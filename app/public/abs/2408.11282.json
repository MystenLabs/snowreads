For a vertex $x$ of $\\Gamma$ the corresponding subconstituent\nalgebra $T=T(x)$ is generated by the adjacency matrix $A$ of $\\Gamma$ and the\ndual adjacency matrix $A^*=A^*(x)$ of $\\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We\nintroduce a $T$-module $\\mathcal N = \\mathcal N(x)$ called the nucleus of\n$\\Gamma$ with respect to $x$. We describe $\\mathcal N$ from various points of\nview. We show that all the irreducible $T$-submodules of $\\mathcal N$ are thin.\nUnder the assumption that $\\Gamma$ is a nonbipartite dual polar graph, we give\nan explicit basis for $\\mathcal N$ and the action of $A, A^*$ on this basis.\nThe basis is in bijection with the set of elements for the projective geometry\n$L_D(q)$, where $GF(q)$ is the finite field used to define $\\Gamma$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
