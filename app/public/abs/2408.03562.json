The travel dataset was sourced from the the\nReddit API by requesting posts from travel-related subreddits to get\ntravel-related conversation prompts and personalized travel experiences, and\naugmented for each fine-tuning method. We used two pretrained LLMs utilized for\nfine-tuning research: LLaMa 2 7B, and Mistral 7B. QLoRA and RAFT are applied to\nthe two pretrained models. The inferences from these models are extensively\nevaluated against the aforementioned metrics. The best model according to human\nevaluation and some GPT-4 metrics was Mistral RAFT, so this underwent a\nReinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) training pipeline, and\nultimately was evaluated as the best model. Our main findings are that: 1)\nquantitative and Ragas metrics do not align with human evaluation, 2) Open AI\nGPT-4 evaluation most aligns with human evaluation, 3) it is essential to keep\nhumans in the loop for evaluation because, 4) traditional NLP metrics\ninsufficient, 5) Mistral generally outperformed LLaMa, 6) RAFT outperforms\nQLoRA, but still needs postprocessing, 7) RLHF improves model performance\nsignificantly. Next steps include improving data quality, increasing data\nquantity, exploring RAG methods, and focusing data collection on a specific\ncity, which would improve data quality by narrowing the focus, while creating a\nuseful product.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FR61btN22jhOsTCWcX219L0KYhlMMYQX8p-aPlY-O04","pdfSize":"3213442"}
