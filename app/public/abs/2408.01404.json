However,\ncurrent device and system implementations have limited performance. This work\ndemonstrates a novel diffractive device architecture, which is named digitized\nheterostack and consists of multiple layers of nonvolatile phase change\nmaterials (PCMs) with different thicknesses. This architecture can both\nleverage the advantages of PCM optical properties and mitigate challenges\nassociated with implementing multilevel operations in a single PCM layer.\nProof-of-concept experiments demonstrate the electrical tuning of one PCM layer\nin a spatial light modulation device, and thermal analysis guides the design of\nDONN devices and systems to avoid thermal crosstalk if individual heterostacks\nare assembled into an array. Further, heterostacks containing three PCM layers\nare designed to have a large phase modulation range and uniform coverage and\nthe ML performance of DONN systems with designed heterostacks is evaluated. The\ndeveloped device architecture provides new opportunities for desirable\nenergy-efficient, fast-reconfigured, and compact DONN systems in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0Rz3ugs_9n_TqH-L6WbRemlQjI7SradK3eZHNmfh2mA","pdfSize":"2055453","txDigest":"5GXuRbC6oR8r9QTpLn1PqdQcucdTaAQpBwosqt5spX8x","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
