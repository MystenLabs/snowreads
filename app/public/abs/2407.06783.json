The corresponding continuum equation is a Poisson equation with\nmeasure data in a Euclidean domain $\\Omega \\subset \\mathbb{R}^d$. The singular\nnature of these equations is challenging and requires an approach with several\ndistinct parts: (1) We prove quantitative error estimates when convolving the\nmeasure data of a Poisson equation with (approximately) radial function\nsupported on balls. (2) We use quantitative variational techniques to prove\ndiscrete to continuum convergence rates on random geometric graphs with\nbandwidth $\\varepsilon>0$ for bounded source terms. (3) We show how to\nregularize the graph Poisson equation via mollification with the graph heat\nkernel, and we study fine asymptotics of the heat kernel on random geometric\ngraphs. Combining these three pillars we obtain $L^1$ convergence rates that\nscale, up to logarithmic factors, like $O(\\varepsilon^{\\frac{1}{d+2}})$ for\ngeneral data distributions, and $O(\\varepsilon^{\\frac{2-\\sigma}{d+4}})$ for\nuniformly distributed data, where $\\sigma>0$. These rates are valid with high\nprobability if $\\varepsilon\\gg\\left({\\log n}/{n}\\right)^q$ where $n$ denotes\nthe number of vertices of the graph and $q \\approx \\frac{1}{3d}$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
