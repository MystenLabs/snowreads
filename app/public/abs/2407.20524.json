These decision policies not only control the\nquality-latency trade-off in SST but also mitigate the impact of unstable\npredictions on translation quality by delaying translation for more context or\ndiscarding these predictions through stable hypothesis detection. However,\nthese policies often overlook the potential benefits of utilizing unstable\npredictions. We introduce the contrastive feedback mechanism (CFM) for SST, a\nnovel method that leverages these unstable predictions as feedback to improve\ntranslation quality. CFM guides the system to eliminate undesired model\nbehaviors from these predictions through a contrastive objective. The\nexperiments on 3 state-of-the-art decision policies across 8 languages in the\nMuST-C v1.0 dataset show that CFM effectively improves the performance of SST.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
