The end-periodicity of $f$\nensures that $M_f$, its associated mapping torus, has a compactification as a\n$3$-manifold with boundary; further, if $f$ is atoroidal, then $M_f$ admits a\nhyperbolic metric. Such maps admit invariant \\emph{positive and negative\nHandel-Miller laminations}, $\\Lambda^+$, $\\Lambda^-$, whose leaves naturally\nproject to the arc and curve complex of a given compact subsurface $Y\\subset\nS$.\n  As an end-periodic analogy to work of Minsky in the finite-type setting, we\nshow that for every $\\epsilon>0$ there exists $K> 0$ (depending only on\n$\\epsilon$ and the \\emph{capacity} of $f$) for which $d_Y (\\Lambda^+,\n\\Lambda^-)\\geq K$ implies $\\inf_{\\sigma\\in\n\\text{AH}(M_f)}\\{\\ell_\\sigma(\\partial Y)\\} \\leq \\epsilon$. Here $\\ell_\\sigma\n(\\partial Y)$ denotes the total geodesic length of $\\partial Y$ in $(M_f,\n\\sigma)$, and the infimum is taken over all hyperbolic structures on $M_f$.\n  This work produces the following: given a closed surface $\\Sigma$, we provide\na family of closed, fibered hyperbolic manifolds in which $\\Sigma$ is totally\ngeodesically embedded, (almost) transverse to the pseudo-Anosov flow, with\narbitrarily small systole.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"TYhfvRK7LVfWvv--L_NgrghoWSckCL6oP-NU6tt0aCM","pdfSize":"2094467"}
