Various methods have been\ndeveloped to counteract phishing, each with varying levels of accuracy, but\nthey also encounter notable limitations. In this study, we introduce\nPhishAgent, a multimodal agent that combines a wide range of tools, integrating\nboth online and offline knowledge bases with Multimodal Large Language Models\n(MLLMs). This combination leads to broader brand coverage, which enhances brand\nrecognition and recall. Furthermore, we propose a multimodal information\nretrieval framework designed to extract the top k relevant items from offline\nknowledge bases, utilizing all available information from a webpage, including\nlogos, HTML, and URLs. Our empirical results, based on three real-world\ndatasets, demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly enhances\ndetection accuracy and reduces both false positives and false negatives, while\nmaintaining model efficiency. Additionally, PhishAgent shows strong resilience\nagainst various types of adversarial attacks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"gzDbGF-y_j-3jVEJFU81ThGrU8s0AwPqF-52_cbzkLM","pdfSize":"813445"}
