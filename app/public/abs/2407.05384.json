In the limit $N\\to\\infty$, we\nestablish the Riemann-Hilbert problem of the soliton gas. Using the Deift-Zhou\nnonlinear steepest-descent method, this soliton gas under the nonzero\nbackground will decay to a constant background as $x\\to+\\infty$, while its\nasymptotics as $x\\to-\\infty$ can be expressed with a Riemann-Theta function,\nattached to a Riemann surface with genus-two. We also analyze the large $t$\nasymptotics over the entire spatial domain, which is divided into three\ndistinct asymptotic regions depending on the ratio $\\xi=\\frac{x}{t}$. Using the\nsimilar method, we provide the leading-order asymptotic behaviors for these\nthree regions and exhibit the dynamics of large $t$ asymptotics.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
