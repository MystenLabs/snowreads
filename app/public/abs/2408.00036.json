We prove if some singular\nsources happen to be placed on the zero-level curve of the potential function,\na priori estimate can still be obtained. As a consequence of this estimate,\nexistence and multiplicity results can still be obtained based on the topology\nof the manifold.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"NghG3qviSYgcgoX8CRM4gP8-cFm3gHvMy_59ztqTp1M","pdfSize":"62909","txDigest":"Ez9j8er1cvFxgkdtstKofhSCU2CX29jDfgyjSjcUNdnT","endEpoch":"100","status":"CERTIFIED"}
