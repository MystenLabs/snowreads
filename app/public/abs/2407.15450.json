Our circuit stands out because it behaves very closely to the case of\ntwo transversely coupled spin-1/2 systems. In particular, the generally\nunwanted static ZZ-term due to the non-computational transitions is nearly\nabsent despite a strong qubit-qubit hybridization. Spectroscopy of the\nnon-computational transitions reveals a spurious LC-mode arising from the\ncombination of the coupling inductance and the capacitive links between the\nterminals of the two qubit circuits. Such a mode has a minor effect on our\nspecific device, but it must be carefully considered for optimizing future\ndesigns.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
