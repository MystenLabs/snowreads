However, the real-time application of\nphysics-informed neural networks (PINNs) is limited by their reliance on fixed\ninput lengths and surrogate models. This study introduces a novel\nphysics-informed Gated Recurrent Network (PiGRN) designed to predict\nmulti-joint torques using surface electromyography (sEMG) data. The PiGRN model\nemploys a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to convert time-series sEMG inputs into\nmulti-joint kinematics and external loads, which are then integrated into an\nequation of motion to ensure consistency with physical laws. Experimental\nvalidation with sEMG data from five participants performing elbow\nflexion-extension tasks showed that the PiGRN model accurately predicted joint\ntorques for 10 unfamiliar movements, with RMSE values between 4.02\\% and\n11.40\\% and correlation coefficients ranging from 0.87 to 0.98. These findings\nhighlight the PiGRN's potential for real-time exoskeleton and rehabilitation\napplications. Future research will explore more diverse datasets, improve\nmusculoskeletal models, and investigate unsupervised learning methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
