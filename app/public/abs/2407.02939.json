The construction is driven by the inf-sup theory, which we\nrecently developed. It builds upon the four-field formulation of the equations\nobtained by introducing the total pressure and the total fluid content. We\ndiscretize in space with Lagrange finite elements and in time with backward\nEuler. We establish inf-sup stability and quasi-optimality of the proposed\ndiscretization, with robust constants with respect to all material parameters.\nWe further construct an interpolant showing how the error decays for smooth\nsolutions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
