Certifying the\nfunctioning and efficiency of the individual components is a task that is well\nstudied and widely used. However, the power of quantum networks can only be\nrealized by integrating all the required quantum technologies and platforms\nacross a large number of users. In this work, we demonstrate how to certify the\ndistillable entanglement available in multipartite states produced by quantum\nnetworks, without relying on the physical realization of its constituent\ncomponents. We do so by using the paradigm of device independence.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
