When $\\sigma<0$, the\nBerezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition between the superfluid and the\nlocalized phase is driven by the long-range correlations and the Luttinger\nparameter $K$ takes the critical value $K_c(\\sigma)=3/2-\\sigma/2$. The\nlocalized phase is a Bose glass for $\\sigma>\\sigma_c=3-\\pi^2/3\\simeq\n-0.289868$, and a Mott glass -- characterized by a vanishing compressibility\nand a gapless conductivity -- when $\\sigma<\\sigma_c$. Our conclusions, based on\nthe nonperturbative functional renormalization group and perturbative\nrenormalization group, are confirmed by the study of the case $\\sigma=-1$,\ncorresponding to a perfectly correlated disorder in space, where the model is\nexactly solvable in the semiclassical limit $K\\to 0^+$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
