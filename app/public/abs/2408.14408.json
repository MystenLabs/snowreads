An especially\nchallenging case that has grown to prominence with advances in single-cell\nsequencing technologies is learning the behavior of individuals from population\nsnapshots. In the absence of individual-level time series, standard stochastic\ndifferential equation models are often nonidentifiable because intrinsic\ndiffusion cannot be distinguished from measurement noise. Despite the\ndifficulty, accurately recovering diffusion terms is required to answer even\nbasic questions about the system's behavior. We show how to combine\npopulation-level time series with velocity measurements to build a provably\nconsistent estimator of the diffusion matrix.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Quantitative Methods","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"0vAOqQ3RzVy_-Nrt4BPs-SBx2MTFjFjv2Ya1C_oqI4k","pdfSize":"1816803"}
