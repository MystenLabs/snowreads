While DL models for anomaly detection excel at\nextracting features and learning patterns from data, they are vulnerable to\ndata contamination -- the inadvertent inclusion of attack-related data in\ntraining sets presumed benign. This study evaluates the robustness of six\nunsupervised DL algorithms against data contamination using our proposed\nevaluation protocol. Results demonstrate significant performance degradation in\nstate-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms when exposed to contaminated\ndata, highlighting the critical need for self-protection mechanisms in DL-based\nNAD models. To mitigate this vulnerability, we propose an enhanced auto-encoder\nwith a constrained latent representation, allowing normal data to cluster more\ndensely around a learnable center in the latent space. Our evaluation reveals\nthat this approach exhibits improved resistance to data contamination compared\nto existing methods, offering a promising direction for more robust NAD\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
