We first propose $r$-minimal codes in\na general setting where the ambient space is a finite dimensional left module\nover a division ring and is supported on a lattice. We characterize minimal\nsubcodes and $r$-minimal codes, derive a general singleton bound, and give\nexistence results for $r$-minimal codes by using combinatorial arguments. We\nthen consider $r$-minimal rank metric codes over a field extension\n$\\mathbb{E}/\\mathbb{F}$ of degree $m$, where $\\mathbb{E}$ can be infinite. We\ncharacterize these codes in terms of cutting $r$-blocking sets, generalized\nrank weights of the codes and those of the dual codes, and classify codes whose\n$r$-dimensional subcodes have constant rank support weight. Next, with the help\nof the evasiveness property of cutting $r$-blocking sets and some upper bounds\nfor the dimensions of evasive subspaces, we derive several lower and upper\nbounds for the minimal length of $r$-minimal codes. Furthermore, when\n$\\mathbb{E}$ is finite, we establish a general upper bound which generalizes\nand improves the counterpart for minimal codes in the literature. As a\ncorollary, we show that if $m=3$, then for any $k\\geqslant2$, the minimal\nlength of $k$-dimensional minimal codes is equal to $2k$. To the best of our\nknowledge, when $m\\geqslant3$, there was no known explicit formula for the\nminimal length of $k$-dimensional minimal codes for arbitrary $k$ in the\nliterature.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
