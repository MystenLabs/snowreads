The catalogue was created using photometric data from the\nHerschel SPIRE and PACS instruments in the 70 $\\mu$m, 160 $\\mu$m, 250 $\\mu$m,\n350 $\\mu$m, and 500 $\\mu$m continuum bands. Extended structure in the region\nwas reconstructed from a Herschel column density map. Power spectra and PDFs of\nthis structure are presented. The PDF splits into log-normal and power-law\nforms, with the high-density power-law component associated primarily with the\ncentral part of TMC1. The total mass in the mapped region is 2000 M$_\\odot$, of\nwhich 34% is above an extinction of AV $\\sim$ 3 mag -- a level that appears as\na break in the PDF and as the minimum column density at which dense cores are\nfound. A total of 35 dense filaments were extracted from the column density\nmap. These have a characteristic FWHM width of 0.07 pc, but the TMC1 filament\nitself has a mean FWHM of $\\sim$ 0.13 pc. The thermally supercritical filaments\nin the region are aligned orthogonal to the prevailing magnetic field\ndirection. Derived properties for the supercritical TMC1 filament support the\nscenario of it being relatively young. A catalogue of 44 robust and candidate\nprestellar cores is created and is assessed to be complete down to 0.1\nM$_\\odot$. The combined prestellar CMF for the TMC1 and L1495 regions is well\nfit by a single log-normal distribution and is comparable to the standard IMF.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
