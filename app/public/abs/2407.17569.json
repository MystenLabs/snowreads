The\norganizer would like to find a tournament rule that simultaneously satisfies\nthe following desiderata. It must be Condorcet-consistent (henceforth, CC),\nmeaning it selects as the winner the unique team that beats all other teams (if\none exists). It must also be strongly non-manipulable for groups of size $k$ at\nprobability $\\alpha$ (henceforth, k-SNM-$\\alpha$), meaning that no subset of\n$\\leq k$ teams can fix the matches among themselves in order to increase the\nchances any of it's members being selected by more than $\\alpha$. Our\ncontributions are threefold. First, wee consider a natural generalization of\nthe Randomized Single Elimination Bracket rule from [Schneider et al. 2017] to\n$d$-ary trees and provide upper bounds to its manipulability. Then, we propose\na novel tournament rule that is CC and 3-SNM-1/2, a strict improvement upon the\nconcurrent work of [Dinev and Weinberg, 2022] who proposed a CC and 3-SNM-31/60\nrule. Finally, we initiate the study of reductions among tournament rules.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
