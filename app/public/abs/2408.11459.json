This leads to a number of new results in\nthis classical subject, including an unexpected relation between the\nmultiply-transitive families of models having $7$- and $6$-dimensional\nsymmetries, and a one-to-one correspondence between equivalence classes of\nnontransitive $(2,3,5)$-distributions with $6$-dimensional symmetries and\nnonhomogeneous nondegenerate Legendrian curves in $\\mathbb{P}^3$. An ingredient\nfor establishing the former is an explicit classification of homogeneous\nnondegenerate Legendrian curves in $\\mathbb{P}^3$, which we present.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
