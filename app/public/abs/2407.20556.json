These\nrobots leverage multimodal communication, incorporating speech, facial\nexpressions, and gestures to enhance user engagement and emotional support. The\nunderstanding of design paradigms of social robots is obstructed by the\ncomplexity of the system and the necessity to tune it to a specific task. This\narticle provides a structured review of social robot design paradigms,\ncategorizing them into cognitive architectures, role design models, linguistic\nmodels, communication flow, activity system models, and integrated design\nmodels. By breaking down the articles on social robot design and application\nbased on these paradigms, we highlight the strengths and areas for improvement\nin current approaches. We further propose our original integrated design model\nthat combines the most important aspects of the design of social robots. Our\napproach shows the importance of integrating operational, communicational, and\nemotional dimensions to create more adaptive and empathetic interactions\nbetween robots and humans.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"H0v8IjWxqe2-15lCNNMHpAPbnX9_Q7dTqJBqtYJP12Q","pdfSize":"262664"}
