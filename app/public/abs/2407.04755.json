Thus, it is legitimate to ask how can one treat the\nhigh order processes nonperturbatively, in such a way that the electron-atom\ninteraction and the quantized nature of radiation be simultaneously taken into\naccount? An analytic method is proposed to answer this question in the\nframework of nonrelativistic quantum electrodynamics. As an application, a\nquantum optical generalization of the strong-field Kramers-Heisenberg formula\nis derived for describing high-harmonic generation. Our formalism is suitable\nto analyse, among various quantal effects, the possible role of arbitrary\nphoton statistics of the incoming field. The present paper is dedicated to the\nmemory of Prof. Dr. Fritz Ehlotzky, who had significantly contributed to the\ntheory of strong-field phenomena over many decades.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"-MiNXlI-kc1Z2NjPUwtlzwSMDBu4ZMgSPR8Jv8GV250","pdfSize":"528839"}
