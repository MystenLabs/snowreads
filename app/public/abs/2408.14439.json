The scheme consists in coupling the inelastically\nscattered light of each particle into transmission lines and directing it\ntowards the other particle. The interference between this light and the\nbackground field introduces an effective coupling between the two particles\nwhile simultaneously reducing the effect of recoil heating. We analyze the\nsystem dynamics, showing that both transient and conditional entanglement\nbetween remote particles can be achieved under realistic experimental\nconditions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
