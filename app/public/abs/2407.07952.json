Such a Maxwell-scalar theory is equivalent to some\nnonlinear electrodynamics (NLED) at the level of equations of motion, but it\nhas the advantage of circumventing the no-go theorem of regular electric black\nholes under a given Lagrangian of NLED. We study the thermodynamics and show\nthat the mass of the regular black hole can be determined solely by the Maxwell\nfield, without having to know the metric profile function. Our formalism allows\nto study the applications of the electrically-charged regular black holes in\nareas that were previously available only to the non-regular ones.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
