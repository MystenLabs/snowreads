Existing\nmethods address this by creating such data from large language models (LLMs)\nand then distilling such knowledge into smaller models. However, these methods\nare limited by the quality of the LLMs output, and tend to generate repetitive\nor incorrect data. In this work, we present Retrieval Based Distillation\n(ReBase), a method that first retrieves data from rich online sources and then\ntransforms them into domain-specific data. This method greatly enhances data\ndiversity. Moreover, ReBase generates Chain-of-Thought reasoning and distills\nthe reasoning capacity of LLMs. We test our method on 4 benchmarks and results\nshow that our method significantly improves performance by up to 7.8% on SQuAD,\n1.37% on MNLI, and 1.94% on BigBench-Hard.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
