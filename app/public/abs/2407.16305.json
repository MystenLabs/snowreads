To implement high-dimensional measurements, it is a\ncommon practice to separately project the system onto each of the possible\neigenstates followed by post-processing. Here, we argue that such measurement\nbinarisation procedures are flawed and open a loophole in black-box correlation\nexperiments. We point out how binarised measurements can lead to meaningless\nresults unless artificial assumptions are introduced. We then propose a method\nto faithfully analyse correlations from binarised measurements. We apply this\napproach to well-known examples of quantum correlations in Bell,\nprepare-and-measure and steering experiments. For the former two, we find that\nbinarisation permits reduced-but-yet-significant quantum advantage, while for\nthe latter we find that binarisation can sometimes lead to undiminished quantum\ncorrelations. Our discussion emphasises the importance of both more careful\ndata analysis and for developing genuine multi-outcome quantum measurements.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
