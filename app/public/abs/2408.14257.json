The only known technique, due to\nConlon--Lee, to show that a bigraph $G$ is weakly norming is to present a\ncut-percolation sequence of $G$.\n  In this paper, we identify a key obstacle for cut-percolation, which we call\nfold-stability and we show that existence of a cut-percolating of a bigraph $G$\nis equivalent to non-existence of non-monochromatic fold-stable colorings of\nthe edges of $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
