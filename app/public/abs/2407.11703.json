The objective is to optimize a particular eigenvalue to a target\nvalue. We introduce the mixed variational formulation of the Maxwell eigenvalue\nproblem introduced by Kikuchi (1987) in function spaces of\n(H(\\operatorname{curl}; \\Omega)) and (H^1(\\Omega)). To handle this formulation,\nsuitable transformations of these spaces are utilized, e.g., of Piola-type for\nthe space of (H(\\operatorname{curl}; \\Omega)). This allows for a formulation of\nthe problem on a fixed reference domain together with a domain mapping. Local\nuniqueness of the solution is obtained by a normalization of the the\neigenfunctions. This allows us to derive adjoint formulas for the derivatives\nof the eigenvalues with respect to domain variations. For the solution of the\nresulting optimization problem, we develop a particular damped inverse BFGS\nmethod that allows for an easy line search procedure while retaining positive\ndefiniteness of the inverse Hessian approximation. The infinite dimensional\nproblem is discretized by mixed finite elements and a numerical example shows\nthe efficiency of the proposed approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
