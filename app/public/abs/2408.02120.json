First, for vortex bound states, the\nspatial anisotropy and positions of electron density peaks are associated with\ninterband couplings. Second, even with inversion symmetry, there allows a\nIsing-type spin-orbit coupling, leading to the enhanced in-plane upper critical\nfield.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QmXmNYMZW19xrnnh_ibXpXBO81Yi9mKaqk_HN7jNPDY","pdfSize":"3073675","txDigest":"57y2oWark11WVPjx422qFKuFj3NhxLJo83H7eL3YFpJL","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
