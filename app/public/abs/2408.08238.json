This paper introduces CatalogBank, a dataset developed to\nbridge the gap between textual descriptions and other data modalities related\nto engineering design catalogs. We utilized existing information extraction\nmethodologies to extract product information from PDF-based catalogs to use in\ndownstream tasks to generate a baseline metric. Our approach not only supports\nthe potential automation of design workflows but also overcomes the limitations\nof manual data entry and non-standard metadata structures that have\nhistorically impeded the seamless integration of textual and other data\nmodalities. Through the use of DocumentLabeler, an open-source annotation tool\nadapted for our dataset, we demonstrated the potential of CatalogBank in\nsupporting diverse document-based tasks such as layout analysis and knowledge\nextraction. Our findings suggest that CatalogBank can contribute to document\nengineering and NLP by providing a robust dataset for training models capable\nof understanding and processing complex document formats with relatively less\neffort using the semi-automated annotation tool DocumentLabeler.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
