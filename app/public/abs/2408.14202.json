A\nmathematical problem is bounding the reticulation number for multiple trees\nover a fixed number of taxa. While this problem has been extensively studied\nfor two trees, much less is known about the upper bounds on the reticulation\nnumbers for three or more arbitrary trees. In this paper, we present a few\nnon-trivial upper bounds on reticulation numbers for three or more trees.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Populations and Evolution","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"3ju-pBXNv4cndIA2x6fYAFsBK5HOx8S00vkQQAOjgoA","pdfSize":"1012890"}
