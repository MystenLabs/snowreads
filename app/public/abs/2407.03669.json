The structure profiles and properties of neutron stars such as mass,\nradius and compactness are obtained through numerical methods using quadratic,\nexponential, and logarithmic $f(Q)$ models. The results indicate that\nnonmetricity affects the interior profile deviations of the star, which in turn\ninfluence the properties of stars, as illustrated in the mass-radius relation\ndiagram. This effect allows the star to accommodate either more or less matter\ncompared to GR, resulting in a different total mass. For the quadratic model,\nwe cannot generate larger masses, whereas the other two models can give\nconsistent results for both smaller and larger masses of the observed stars. By\ntuning model parameters, we obtain $\\mathcal{M}-\\mathcal{R}$ diagrams that are\ncompatible with observational constraints from NICER and LIGO.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
