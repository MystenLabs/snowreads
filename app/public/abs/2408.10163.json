This onboard UAV system aims\nto enhance collaboration with USVs for following and landing tasks under such\nchallenging conditions. The main contribution of our system is the novel\nmathematical USV model, describing the movement of the USV in 6 degrees of\nfreedom on a wavy water surface, which is used to estimate and predict USV\nstates. The estimator fuses data from multiple global and onboard sensors,\nensuring accurate USV state estimation. The predictor computes future USV\nstates using the novel mathematical USV model and the last estimated states.\nThe estimated and predicted USV states are forwarded into a trajectory planner\nthat generates a UAV trajectory for following the USV or landing on its deck,\neven in harsh environmental conditions. The proposed approach was verified in\nnumerous simulations and deployed to the real world, where the UAV was able to\nfollow the USV and land on its deck repeatedly.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
