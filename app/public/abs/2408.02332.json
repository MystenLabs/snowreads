The central aim of multi-agent\noptimization is for a network of agents to collaboratively solve a system-level\noptimization problem with local objective functions and node-to-node\ncommunication by distributed algorithms. The scalability of such algorithms\ncrucially depends on the complexity of the communication messages, and a number\nof communication compressors for distributed optimization have recently been\nproposed in the literature. First of all, we introduce a general\nspatio-temporal compressor characterized by the stability of the resulting\ndynamical system along the vector field of the compressor. We show that several\nimportant distributed optimization compressors such as the greedy sparsifier,\nthe uniform quantizer, and the scalarizer all fall into the category of this\nspatio-temporal compressor. Next, we propose two distributed prime-dual flows\nwith the spatio-temporal compressors being applied to local node states and\nlocal error states, respectively, and prove (exponential) convergence of the\nnode trajectories to the global optimizer for (strongly) convex cost functions.\nFinally, a few numerical examples are present to illustrate our theoretical\nresults.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
