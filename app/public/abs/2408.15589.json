In a previous paper by the author, when\n$\\sigma\\leq 1/2$ this probability is zero. Here we give a positive lower bound\nfor this probability depending on $x_\\sigma$ that becomes large as\n$\\sigma\\to1/2^+$. The main inputs in our proofs are a maximal inequality based\nin relatively high moments for these partial sums combined with a\nHal\\'asz-Bonami's moment inequality, and also explicit estimates for the\npartial sums of non-negative multiplicative functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VTJ_xJfrClgx9ZCRmRBdJ9utZdis_cIOzt2fIL5ZHE8","pdfSize":"389936"}
