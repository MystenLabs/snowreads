Due to the Open\nSource Software (OSS) nature of third party libraries, there are rising\nconcerns with the sustainability of these libraries. In a survey of 49\ndevelopers from the NPM ecosystem, we find that developers are more likely to\nmaintain their own packages rather than contribute to the ecosystem. Our\nresults opens up new avenues into tool support and research into how to sustain\nthese ecosystems, especially for developers that depend on these libraries.
