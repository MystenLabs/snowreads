A {\\em bull} is a graph consisting of a triangle with two\ndisjoint pendant edges, a {\\em hammer} is a graph obtained by identifying an\nendvertex of a $P_3$ with a vertex of a triangle. A class ${\\cal F}$ is\n$\\chi$-bounded if there is a function $f$ such that $\\chi(G)\\leq f(\\omega(G))$\nfor all induced subgraphs $G$ of a graph in ${\\cal F}$. A class ${\\cal C}$ of\ngraphs is {\\em Pollyanna} (resp. {\\em linear-Pollyanna}) if ${\\cal C}\\cap {\\cal\nF}$ is polynomially (resp. linear-polynomially) $\\chi$-bounded for every\n$\\chi$-bounded class ${\\cal F}$ of graphs. Chudnovsky {\\em et al}\n\\cite{CCDO2023} showed that both the classes of bull-free graphs and\nhammer-free graphs are Pollyannas. Let $G$ be a connected graph with no clique\ncutsets and no universal cliques. In this paper, we show that $G$ is $(C_4$,\nhammer)-free if and only if it has girth at least 5, and $G$ is $(C_4$,\nbull)-free if and only if it is a clique blowup of some graph of girth at least\n5. As a consequence, we show that both the classes of $(C_4$, bull)-free graphs\nand $(C_4$, hammer)-free graphs are linear-Pollyannas.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
