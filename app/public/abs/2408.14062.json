By rotating\nthe sample around a fixed axis and recording spectrum at each rotation step,\nthe intensity of the transmitted beam is obtained as a function of the rotation\nangle and wavelength. The questions addressed concern determination of lattices\nparameters and orientations of centrosymmetric crystals from such data. It is\nshown that if the axis of sample rotation is inclined to the beam direction,\nthe reflection positions unambiguously determine reciprocal lattice vectors,\nwhich is not the case when the axis is perpendicular to the beam. Having a set\nof such vectors, one can compute crystal orientation or lattice parameters\nusing existing indexing software. The considerations are applicable to\narbitrary Laue symmetry. The work contributes to the automation of analysis of\ndiffraction data obtained in the neutron imaging mode.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"wizV-P9wAJLi486jcx6XXf2xVnLK64ZOAY2hqX6PwvA","pdfSize":"436070"}
