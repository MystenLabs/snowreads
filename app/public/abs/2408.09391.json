For odd dimensions $d$, the problem\nis fairly easy. However, for even dimensions $d$ the problem becomes very\ndifficult. We provide sharp asymptotic bounds for the conflict-free chromatic\nnumber in all even dimensions $4\\leq d \\leq 20$ except for $d=16$. We also\nprovide non-trivial upper and lower bounds for all even dimensions $d$. We\nexhibit a strong relation to the famous Erd\\H{o}s girth conjecture in extremal\ngraph theory which might be of independent interest for the study of\nconflict-free colorings. Improving the upper or lower bounds for general even\ndimensions $d$ would imply an improved lower or upper bound (respectively) on\nthe Erd\\H{o}s girth conjecture. Finally, we extend our result for dimension $4$\nshowing that the hypergraph whose hyperedges are the union of two discrete\nintervals from $[n]$ of cardinality at least $3$ has conflict-free chromatic\nnumber $\\Theta(\\sqrt {n})$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"D3-3p0rrsgSZjAq2ca70nlCSXyMGvmcGaxDhV_LTCY8","pdfSize":"605049"}
