Reducing\ncircuit depth decreases noise in near-term quantum computations and reduces\noverall computation time, thus, also benefiting fault-tolerant quantum\ncomputations. Here, we show how to reduce the depth of quantum sub-routines\nthat typically scale linearly with the number of qubits, such as quantum\nfan-out and long-range CNOT gates, to a constant depth using mid-circuit\nmeasurements and feed-forward operations, while only requiring a 1D line\ntopology. We compare our protocols with existing ones to highlight their\nadvantages. Additionally, we verify the feasibility by implementing the\nmeasurement-based quantum fan-out gate and long-range CNOT gate on real quantum\nhardware, demonstrating significant improvements over their unitary\nimplementations.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"PJk3l8cFAspaFpEXs-qWxPHo-dgg8WN8Mbj2qpxDwLs","pdfSize":"6186186"}
