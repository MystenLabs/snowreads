This bound is independent of codimension and sharp on planes. As an\napplication we verify a conjecture of Colding-Minicozzi about the entropy of\nclosed self-shrinkers of arbitrary codimension for self-shrinkers that are\ntopologically two-dimensional real projective planes. As part of the proof we\nintroduce two auxiliary functionals which we call stable conformal volume and\nvirtual entropy which should be of independent interest.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"X39VTimLqOcpbOZneqLo5Fg5YQjXepVE_-UtfhXtBMg","pdfSize":"320797"}
