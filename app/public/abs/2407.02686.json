The focus lies on the evolution\nof the principle eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix in the regime that the\nnumber of vertices grows large. The main result is a functional central limit\ntheorem, which displays that the principal eigenvalue essentially inherits the\ncharacteristics of the dynamics of the individual edges.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
