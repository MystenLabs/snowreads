The maximal operator is a generalization of that in Stromberg.\nIt turns out that our maximal operator is a more smooth operator than the usual\nfractional maximal operator. Further, we give another proof of the embedding\nfrom $BV$ to $L^{n/(n-1),1}$ due to Alvino by using the usual medians.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
