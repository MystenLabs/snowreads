Here, we report large TUR violations when superconducting\nreservoirs replace metallic ones. The coexistence of different transport\nprocesses, namely (multiple) Andreev reflection, where electrons and their\nretro-reflected holes create Cooper pairs, in addition to the normal\nquasiparticle transport is identified as the source for such TUR breakdowns.\nThe large TUR violation is a remarkable advantage for building low dissipative\nand highly stable quantum thermal machines.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
