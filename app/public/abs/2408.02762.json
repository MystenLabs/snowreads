Here, we employ the gwNRHME framework to combine a multi-modal\nquasi-circular waveform model NRHybSur3dq8 and quadrupolar non-spinning\neccentric waveform model EccentricIMR to construct multi-modal non-spinning\neccentric model NRHybSur3dq8-gwNRHME. Using a total of 35 eccentric numerical\nrelativity (NR) simulations obtained from the SXS and RIT catalogs, we\ndemonstrate that NRHybSur3dq8-gwNRHME model predictions agree well with NR\n(with typical relative $L_2$ errors of ~0.01 for the dominant quadrupolar mode)\nfor mass ratios $ 1 \\leq q \\leq 4$ and eccentricities up to ~0.2 measured about\n10 cycles before the merger. To demonstrate the modularity of the gwNRHME\nframework, we further combine EccentricIMR with BHPTNRSur1dq1e4 model and\ndevelop a non-spinning eccentric models named BHPTNRSur1dq1e4-gwNRHME. Finally,\nwe develop a different variant of these models by replacing EccentricIMR with\nEccentricTD. Both the gwNRHME framework and associated models are available\nthrough the gwModels package.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
