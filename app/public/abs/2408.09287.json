However, even these improved lower bounds\nsuggest that shadow codes have considerably inferior distance-rate\ncharacteristics compared with the concatenation of a Reed-Solomon outer code\nand a first-order Reed-Muller inner code.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
