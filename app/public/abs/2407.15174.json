Adversarial Data\nAugmentation (ADA) is a commonly used approach that enhances model adaptability\nby incorporating synthetic samples, designed to simulate potential unseen\nsamples. While ADA effectively addresses amplitude-related distribution shifts,\nit falls short in managing temporal shifts, which are essential for time series\ndata. To address this limitation, we propose the Temporal Adversarial Data\nAugmentation for time teries Data (TADA), which incorporates a time warping\ntechnique specifically targeting temporal shifts. Recognizing the challenge of\nnon-differentiability in traditional time warping, we make it differentiable by\nleveraging phase shifts in the frequency domain. Our evaluations across diverse\ndomains demonstrate that TADA significantly outperforms existing ADA variants,\nenhancing model performance across time series datasets with varied\ndistributions.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
