Remote pilots\nmust develop a combination of technical and cognitive skills to manage the\ncomplexities of modern drone operations. This paper explores the integration of\nneurotechnology, specifically auricular vagus nerve stimulation (aVNS), as a\nmethod to enhance remote pilot training and performance. The scientific\nliterature shows aVNS can safely improve cognitive functions such as attention,\nlearning, and memory. It has also been shown useful to manage stress responses.\nFor safe and efficient sUAS/UAV operation, it is essential for pilots to\nmaintain high levels of vigilance and decision-making under pressure. By\nmodulating sympathetic stress and cortical arousal, aVNS can prime cognitive\nfaculties before training, help maintain focus during training and improve\nstress recovery post-training. Furthermore, aVNS has demonstrated the potential\nto enhance multitasking and cognitive control. This may help remote pilots\nduring complex sUAS operations by potentially reducing the risk of impulsive\ndecision-making or cognitive errors. This paper advocates for the inclusion of\naVNS in remote pilot training programs by proposing that it can provide\nsignificant benefits in improving cognitive readiness, skill and knowledge\nacquisition, as well as operational safety and efficiency. Future research\nshould focus on optimizing aVNS protocols for drone pilots while assessing\nlong-term benefits to industrial safety and workforce readiness in real-world\nscenarios.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Neurons and Cognition","Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
