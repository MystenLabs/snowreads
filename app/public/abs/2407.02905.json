We also show that for an open and dense subset of the space\nof Riemannian metrics on an $n$-disc with $n \\ge 3$ and with a strictly convex\nboundary there are $n$ geometrically distinct orthogonal geodesic chords\nwithout self-intersections. We use a perturbation result for intersecting\ngeodesic segments of the author and a genericity statement due to Bettiol and\nGiamb\\`o and existence results for orthogonal geodesic chords by Giamb\\`o,\nGiannoni, and Piccione.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
