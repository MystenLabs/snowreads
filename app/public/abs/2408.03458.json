We focus on binary systems, in which either\none or both species can phase separate, and we discuss the stability of the\nhomogeneous state determining the conditions for the emergence of a Hopf-type\nbifurcation. We then examine the effects of a specific autocatalytic chemical\nreaction, and computationally determine the full solutions to the partial\ndifferential equations. We find that when both species phase separate,\nsustained pulsed dynamics arise in one dimension. When considered in two\ndimensions, the system generates persistent, complex dynamic droplets, which do\nnot generally appear if only one of the species can phase separate. We finally\ndiscuss the emergence of dynamics with complex features, which can be\nunderstood using the framework of a cellular automata.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons","Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"_AD-PxPPuUlnCCZ5TR-6imwO22-FdqnSvcSicxRm_XU","pdfSize":"11281694"}
