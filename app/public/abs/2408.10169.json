It has been known that the Bousch operator $\\mathcal{L}_A$ is\ntropical linear and corresponds to the Ruelle operator $\\mathcal{R}_A$. In this\npaper, we present general idempotent analysis (tropical algebra) results,\ndefine the tropical adjoint operator $\\mathcal{L}_A^{\\ostar}$ which corresponds\nto $\\mathcal{R}_A^{*}$, and study the existence and generic uniqueness of\ntropical eigen-densities of $\\mathcal{L}_A^{\\ostar}$. We also investigate the\nLogarithmic type zero temperature limit of equilibrium states which implies the\nlarge deviation principle. It turns out that the rate function is the tropical\nproduct of a calibrated sub-action and a tropical eigen-density.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
