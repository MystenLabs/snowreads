Our results resum the leading power of $n$ at any\nloop order. In the small $\\lambda n$ regime we reproduce the known diagrammatic\nresults and predict the infinite series of higher-order terms. For intermediate\nvalues of $\\lambda n$ we find that $\\Delta_n/n$ increases monotonically\napproaching a $(\\lambda n)^{1/3}$ behavior in the $\\lambda n \\to \\infty$ limit.\nWe further generalize our results to the $\\displaystyle{\\left(\\vec{\\phi} \\cdot\n\\vec{\\phi}\\right)^{n/2}}$ operators in the $O(N)$ model.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"4IcJodnd1TYM8pJ6PvSpP5v-fOaMBBcevMc3BejstLk","pdfSize":"387464"}
