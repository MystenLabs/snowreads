Recently three of these galaxies were shown to have\nprominent Balmer breaks, demonstrating that their light at $\\lambda_{\\rm rest}\n\\sim 3500$ $\\r{A}$ is dominated by a stellar population that is relatively old\n($\\sim$200 Myr). All three also have broad H$\\beta$ emission with $\\sigma >\n1000 \\,\\rm km s^{-1}$, a common feature of such `little red dots'. From\nS\\'ersic profile fits to the NIRCam images in F200W we find that the stellar\nlight of galaxies is extremely compact: the galaxies have half-light radii of\n$r_{\\rm e}\\sim$ 100 pc, in the regime of ultra compact dwarfs in the nearby\nUniverse. Their masses are uncertain, as they depend on the contribution of\npossible light from an AGN to the flux at $\\lambda_{\\rm rest}>5000$ $\\r{A}$. If\nthe AGN contribution is low beyond the Balmer break region, the masses are $M_*\n\\sim 10^{10}-10^{11}\\mathrm{M}_{\\odot}$, and the central densities are higher\nthan those of any other known galaxy population by an order of magnitude.\nInterestingly, the implied velocity dispersions of $\\sim$1500 kms$^{-1}$ are in\nvery good agreement with the measured H$\\beta$ line widths. We suggest that\nsome of the broad lines in `little red dots' are not due to AGNs but simply\nreflect the kinematics of the galaxies, and speculate that the galaxies are\nobserved in a short-lived phase where the central densities are much higher\nthan at later times. We stress, however, that the canonical interpretation of\nAGNs causing the broad H$\\beta$ lines also remains viable.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"KSrpZZdv-Q3iA-XDQauwNtDTSNKGtgUAC767pR7RAi8","pdfSize":"3110990"}
