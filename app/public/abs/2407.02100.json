We focus on patch smoothers, which offer robust\nconvergence rates with respect to the finite element degree for various\nequations, in the setting of multiplicative subspace correction for numerical\nefficiency. By combining the computation of local residuals with local solvers,\nwe increase the locality of the problem and thus reduce data transfers. The\nthread-parallel implementation of this algorithm is based on coloring, which\ncontradicts cache efficiency. We improve data locality by rearranging the loop\ninto batches so that more data can be reused. The organization of consecutive\nbatches prioritizes data locality.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
