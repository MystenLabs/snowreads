Neutron-matter\ncalculations employing chiral effective field theory (EFT) interactions have\nbeen extensively used for this purpose. Among the various many-body methods,\nquantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods stand out due to their nonperturbative nature\nand the achievable precision. However, QMC methods require local interactions\nas input, which leads to the appearance of stronger regulator artifacts as\ncompared to non-local interactions. To circumvent this, we employ large-cutoff\ninteractions derived within chiral EFT (400 MeV $\\leq \\Lambda_c \\leq$ 700 MeV)\nfor studies of pure neutron matter. These interactions have been adjusted to\nnucleon-nucleon scattering phase shifts, the triton binding energy, as well as\nthe triton beta-decay half life. We find that regulator artifacts significantly\ndecrease with increasing cutoff, leading to a significant reduction of\nuncertainties in the neutron-matter EOS. We discuss implications for the\nsymmetry energy and demonstrate how our new calculations lead to a reduction in\nthe theoretical uncertainty of predicted neutron-star radii by up to 30% for\nlow-mass stars.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
