We\ninvestigate the related operator norm $c_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\Omega)$ of $K_\\Omega$ on\nthe corresponding space of complex-valued functions, and the norm $a(\\Omega)$\non the subspace of analytic functions. This change requires introduction of\ntechniques much different from the ones used in the classical setting. We prove\nthe equality $c_{\\mathbb{R}}(\\Omega) = c_{\\mathbb{C}}(\\Omega)$, the analytic\nNeumann-type inequality $a(\\Omega) < 1$, and provide various estimates for\nthese quantities expressed in terms of the geometry of $\\Omega$. We apply our\nresults to estimates for the holomorphic functional calculus of operators on\nHilbert space of the type $\\|p(T)\\| \\leq K \\sup_{z \\in \\Omega} |p(z)|$, where\n$p$ is a polynomial and $\\Omega$ is a domain containing the numerical range of\nthe operator $T$. Among other results, we show that the well-known\nCrouzeix-Palencia bound $K \\leq 1 + \\sqrt{2}$ can be improved to $K \\leq 1 +\n\\sqrt{1 + a(\\Omega)}$. In the case that $\\Omega$ is an ellipse, this leads to\nan estimate of $K$ in terms of the eccentricity of the ellipse.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Complex Variables"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
