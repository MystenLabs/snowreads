In order to\nanalyze the security of an S-box, recently, three new tables have been\nintroduced: the Extended Boomerang Connectivity Table (EBCT), the Lower\nBoomerang Connectivity Table (LBCT), and the Upper Boomerang Connectivity Table\n(UBCT). In fact, these tables offer improved methods over the usual Boomerang\nConnectivity Table (BCT) for analyzing the security of S-boxes against\nboomerang-style attacks. Here, we put in context these new EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT\nconcepts by connecting them to the DDT for a differentially $\\delta$-uniform\nfunction and also determine the EBCT, LBCT, and UBCT entries of three classes\nof differentially $4$-uniform power permutations, namely, Gold, Kasami and\nBracken-Leander. We also determine the Double Boomerang Connectivity Table\n(DBCT) entries of the Gold function. As byproducts of our approach, we obtain\nsome previously published results quite easily.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
