Through\nspecially crafted materialized view for join and novel design of\ngroup-aggregation (GA) protocols, MapComp removes duplicated join workload and\nexpedites subsequent GA, improving the efficiency of JGA query execution. To\nsupport continuous data updates, our materialized view offers\npayload-independence feature and brings in significant efficiency improvement\nof view refreshing with free MPC overhead. This feature also allows further\nacceleration for GA, where we devised multiple novel protocols that outperform\nprior works. Notably, our work represents the first endeavor to expedite secure\ncollaborative JGA queries using materialized views. Our experiments demonstrate\na significant advantage of MapComp, achieving up to a 2189.9x efficiency\nimprovement compared to the non-view based baseline when executing queries\neight times.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
