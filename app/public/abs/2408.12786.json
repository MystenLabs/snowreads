We detect significant 401 Hz pulsations across the\n0.5$-$150 keV band. The pulse fraction increases from $\\sim$2% at 1 keV to\n$\\sim$13% at 66 keV. Five type-I X-ray bursts have been detected, including\nthree photospheric radius expansion bursts, with a rise time of $\\sim$2 s and\nan exponential decay time of $\\sim$5 s. The recurrence time is $\\sim$9.1 h,\nwhich can be explained by unstable thermonuclear burning of hydrogen-deficient\nmaterial on the neutron star surface. The quasi-simultaneous 1$-$150 keV\nbroadband spectra from NICER, NuSTAR, and INTEGRAL can be well fitted by an\nabsorbed reflection model, relxillCp, and a Gaussian line of instrumental\norigin. The Comptonized emission from the hot corona is characterized by a\nphoton index $\\Gamma$ of $\\sim$1.8 and an electron temperature $kT_{\\rm e}$ of\n$\\sim$40 keV. We obtain a low inclination angle $i\\sim34^{\\circ}$. The\naccretion disk shows properties of strong ionization, $\\log(\\xi/{\\rm\nerg~cm~s^{-1}})\\sim4.5$, over-solar abundance, $A_{\\rm Fe}\\sim 7.7$, and high\ndensity, $\\log(n_{\\rm e}/{\\rm cm^{-3}})\\sim 19.5$. However, a lower disk\ndensity with normal abundance and ionization could also be possible. From the\ninner disk radius $R_{\\rm in}=1.67R_{\\rm ISCO}$ and the long-term spin-down\nrate of $-3.1(2)\\times10^{-15}~{\\rm Hz~s^{-1}}$, we constrain the magnetic\nfield of IGR J17498$-$2921 in the range of $(0.9-2.4)\\times10^8$ G.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LeFmn8qOThOuikTe_h0mihKBnxVrF79rbzQEETdSLzw","pdfSize":"1173088"}
