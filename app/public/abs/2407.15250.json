In particular, we focus on dynamics by considering models for a\nquantum box with a moving wall and harmonic oscillator with time-dependent\nfrequency. For both models we computed the energy needed for acceleration\n(deceleration) as a function of time. The results obtained are compared with\nthose of other acceleration (deceleration) protocols\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
