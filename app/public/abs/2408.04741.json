In addition,\nwe extend their proof methods for the generalized toric inequalities in two\nways. The first extension constructs the graph corresponding to the toric\ninequalities and the generalized toric conjectures by tiling the Euclidean\nspace. An entanglement wedge nesting relation then determines the geometric\nstructure of the tiles. In the second extension, we exploit the cyclic nature\nof the inequalities and conjectures to construct cycle graphs. Then, the graph\ncan be obtained using graph Cartesian products of cycle graphs. In addition, we\ndefine a set of knots on the graph by following \\cite{Czech:2023xed}. These\ngraphs with knots then imply the validity of their associated inequality. We\nstudy the particular case where the graph can be decomposed into disjoint\nunions of torii. %We extend and propopse the proof by a contraction map of\ntoric inequalities to the conjectures. We also discuss ways to explore the\nconjectured inequalities whose corresponding geometries are $d$-dimensional\ntorus $(d>2)$.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"upDIxp2Ce1QPQeUNOhnQQ-HSYesPkfU7hC0E5s_b6e0","pdfSize":"3792807"}
