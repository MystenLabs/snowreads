The {\\mu}DE can enable a novel and\npassive seasonal thermoregulation of buildings by reducing summertime\nterrestrial radiative heat gain, and wintertime loss. We show several types of\n{\\mu}DE, such as metallic and white variants, made using low-cost materials and\nscalable manufacturing techniques that are already in large-scale use.\nFurthermore, we show that its directional emittance can be geometrically\ntailored to sky-view factors in different urban scenarios. Outdoor experiments\nshow that {\\mu}DEs stay up to 1.53{\\deg}C cooler than traditional building\nenvelopes when exposed to direct sunlight on summer days and up to 0.46{\\deg}C\nwarmer during winter nights. Additionally, {\\mu}DEs demonstrate significant\ncooling powers of up to 40 Wm-2 in warm conditions and heating powers of up to\n30 Wm-2 in cool conditions, relative to typical building envelopes. Building\nenergy models show that {\\mu}DEs can achieve all-season energy savings similar\nto or higher than those of cool roofs. Collectively, our findings show {\\mu}DEs\nas highly promising for thermoregulating buildings.\n","subjects":["Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
