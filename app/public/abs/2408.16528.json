The electric permittivity\n$\\varepsilon$ and the magnetic permeability $\\mu_M$ are evaluated from the\ngluon self-energies through which the real part of the square of the refraction\nindex ${\\rm Re}\\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia index $n_{DL}$ are\ninvestigated. The real part of $\\varepsilon$ displays a frequency pole\n$\\omega_d=p$, which is just the position of the frequency inflexion of the\nimaginary part of $\\varepsilon$. The non-extensive parameter $q$ significantly\naffects the real and imaginary parts of $\\varepsilon$ in the space-like region\n$\\omega<p$, while the frequency pole $\\omega_d=p$ remains unchanged as $q$\nincreases. The magnetic permeability, ${\\rm Re}\\, n^2$ and the Depine-Lakhtakia\nindex $n_{DL}$ diverge at frequency $\\omega_m$. As $q$ increases, the pole\nfrequency $\\omega_m$ shifts to large frequency region. The Depine-Lakhtakia\nindex $n_{DL}$ becomes negative in a quite large frequency region\n$\\omega\\in[\\omega_c, \\omega_m]$. When $q$ increases, the frequency range for\n$n_{DL}<0$ becomes wider. Nevertheless, there are no propagating modes for the\nnegative refraction. In addition, as momentum $p$ increases, the electric\npermittivity, the magnetic permeability, ${\\rm Re}\\, n^2$ and $n_{DL}$ are\nsensitive to the change of $p$, which indicates the importance of the spatial\ndispersion in the electromagnetic responses of the QGP.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
