This model, introduced by Kawasaki et al. (J.\nTheor. Biol. 188, 1997), describes the spatial-temporal dynamics of bacterial\ncolonies $b=b(x,t)$ and nutrients $n=n(x,t)$ on agar plates. Kawasaki et al.\nprovided numerical evidence for wavefronts, leaving the analytical confirmation\nof these solutions an open problem. We prove the existence of an infinite\nfamily of wavefronts parameterized by their wave speed, which varies on a\nclosed positive half-line. We provide an upper bound for the threshold speed\nand a lower bound for it when $D$ is sufficiently large. The proofs are based\non several analytical tools, including the shooting method and the fixed-point\ntheory in Fr\\'echet spaces, to establish existence, and the central manifold\ntheorem to ascertain uniqueness.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"L9cWPDTrqVS9UkgjePNmr-LS6DlegC4aAEyejCB4wvQ","pdfSize":"375627","objectId":"0x8c0ada997a15b749228f8ea0576b929f9c4632f383e81fe00cf9af0f040b13df","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
