Given a relative \\\"{u}lrich bundle on a\ncomplete intersection subvariety, we construct a relative \\\"{u}lrich bundle on\nthe ambient variety. Using this, we prove that there exists a rank $d$\n\\\"{u}lrich bundle on degree $d$ generic cyclic coverings of $\\mathbb{P}^2$ with\nbranch divisor of degree $d \\cdot k$ such that $d \\cdot k$ is even. When $d\n\\cdot k$ is odd, we also give an estimation of the rank of \\\"{u}lrich bundle on\ngeneric cyclic coverings of $\\mathbb{P}^2$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
