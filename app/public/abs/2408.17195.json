In particular, the\nformula for the modular data of the gauged theory is provided in terms of\nmodular data of $\\mathcal{C}$, which provides positive evidence of the\nreconstruction program. Moreover as a direct consequence, the formula for the\nfusion rules is derived, generalizing the results of\nEdie-Michell-Jones-Plavnik. Our construction explicitly shows the genus-$0$\ndata of the gauged theory contains higher genus data of the original theory. As\napplications, we obtain an identity for the modular data that does not come\nfrom modular group relations, and we prove that representations of the\nsymmetric mapping class group (associated to closed surfaces) coming from\nweakly group theoretical modular categories have finite images.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Operator Algebras"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
