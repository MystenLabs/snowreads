To date, their use is restricted to time evolutions\ngoverned by time-independent generators. We introduce a generalization valid\nfor driven quantum systems governed by a time-dependent Hamiltonian that maps\nthe evolution to a diffusion problem in a one-dimensional lattice with\nnearest-neighbor hopping probabilities that are inhomogeneous and\ntime-dependent. This representation is used to establish a novel class of\nfundamental limits to the quantum speed of evolution and operator growth. We\nalso discuss generalizations of the algorithm, adapted to discretized time\nevolutions and periodic Hamiltonians, with applications to many-body systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Other Condensed Matter","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"wjs2eOdZxZJmMwiPFpnUJQ1X0Mtti00ikcYZM4IwZJ4","pdfSize":"5779305"}
