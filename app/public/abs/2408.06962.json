We show that every torsor of the Jacobian of the\nuniversal family of degree-$m$ Fermat curve is necessarily a connected\ncomponent of the Picard scheme. We show that the Jacobian of the generic\ndegree-$m$ Fermat curve has uncountably many non-isomorphic torsors. We give\nsome results towards the Franchetta type problem for torsors of the Jacobian of\nthe universal family of genus-$g$ curves over $\\mathcal{M}_g$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/General Topology","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
