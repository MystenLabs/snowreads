We consider how relaxing this assumption\nallows us to extract potential information about modified dispersion relations\nand other fundamental physics questions, as both the group and phase velocity\nof waves become relevant. After developing the formalism we carry out simple\nGaussian wavepacket examples and then consider more realistic waveforms, such\nas that from binary inspirals. When the frequency evolves only slowly across\nthe PTA temporal baseline, the monochromatic assumption at an effective mean\nfrequency remains a good approximation and we provide scaling relations that\ncharacterize its accuracy.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
