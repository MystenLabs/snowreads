The transformed set encodes a rich representation of\nhigh order relations between the input features. A particular min-cost-max-flow\nfractional matching problem, whose entropy regularized version can be\napproximated by an optimal transport (OT) optimization, leads to a transform\nwhich is efficient, differentiable, equivariant, parameterless and\nprobabilistically interpretable. While the Sinkhorn OT solver has been adapted\nextensively in many contexts, we use it differently by minimizing the cost\nbetween a set of features to $itself$ and using the transport plan's $rows$ as\nthe new representation. Empirically, the transform is highly effective and\nflexible in its use and consistently improves networks it is inserted into, in\na variety of tasks and training schemes. We demonstrate state-of-the-art\nresults in few-shot classification, unsupervised image clustering and person\nre-identification.
