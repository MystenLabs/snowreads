Chernoff's results in this\ndirection provide us with a general approximation scheme. There are situations\nwhen we need to break the interval into uneven pieces. In this paper, we\nexplore alternative conditions to the one found by Smolyanov et. al such that\nChernoff's original result can be extended to unevenly distributed time\nintervals. Two applications concerning the foundations of quantum mechanics and\nthe central limit theorem are presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
