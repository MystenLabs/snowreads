With minimum model assumptions, we quantify the magnitude\nof the average energy loss and its transverse momentum dependence. Then, we\nquantify the impact of fluctuations in the energy loss and nuclear PDFs on the\nmeasured jet suppression. Employing the Glauber model to infer the information\nabout the collision geometry, we quantify the path-length dependence of the\naverage energy loss, which is shown to be consistent with that expected for the\nradiative energy loss. Using the obtained parameterizations, we evaluate jet\n$v_2$, obtaining results consistent with measurements. We also provide\nmodel-independent predictions for the magnitude of energy loss expected in\nupcoming oxygen-oxygen collisions. Finally, we analyze intriguing features seen\nin the suppression of jets in the $\\gamma$-jet system.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kljyG2udGPx9KTlQQ8nHZRryT0F3UhrObhLKvsulLYo","pdfSize":"696318","objectId":"0x3c11de569c3c15bbfecc468e053859b304ff3d1523e1b59d9349d086abdbf4af","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
