We first\nrevisit the workhorse of such lattices, namely traveling waves, both from a\ncontinuum, but also from a genuinely discrete perspective, both without and\nwith a linear force component (induced by the so-called precompression). We\nthen extend considerations to time-periodic states, examining dark breather\nstructures in homogeneous crystals, as well as bright breathers in diatomic\nlattices. The last pattern that we consider extensively is the dispersive shock\nwave arising in the context of suitable Riemann (step) initial data. We show\nhow the use of continuum (KdV) and discrete (Toda) integrable approximations\ncan be used to get a first quantitative handle of the relevant waveforms. In\nall cases, theoretical analysis is accompanied by numerical computations and,\nwhere possible, by a recap and illustration of prototypical experimental\nresults. We close the chapter by offering a number of ongoing and potential\nfuture directions and associated open problems in the field.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tLpFuwAxm4Fvuo60NPYsDEpTa0XoCxCqO8rm27cBJ_s","pdfSize":"1158366"}
