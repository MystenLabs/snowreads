We\nintroduce the Enhanced Transformer for Health Outcome Simulation (ETHOS), a\nnovel application of the transformer deep-learning architecture for analyzing\nhigh-dimensional, heterogeneous, and episodic health data. ETHOS is trained\nusing Patient Health Timelines (PHTs)-detailed, tokenized records of health\nevents-to predict future health trajectories, leveraging a zero-shot learning\napproach. ETHOS represents a significant advancement in foundation model\ndevelopment for healthcare analytics, eliminating the need for labeled data and\nmodel fine-tuning. Its ability to simulate various treatment pathways and\nconsider patient-specific factors positions ETHOS as a tool for care\noptimization and addressing biases in healthcare delivery. Future developments\nwill expand ETHOS' capabilities to incorporate a wider range of data types and\ndata sources. Our work demonstrates a pathway toward accelerated AI development\nand deployment in healthcare.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
