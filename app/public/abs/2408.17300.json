For lattice gauge theory, however,\nvariational quantum simulation faces a challenge as local gauge invariance\nenforces a constraint on the physical Hilbert space. In this paper, we\nincorporate multi-objective optimization for variational quantum simulation of\nlattice gauge theory at zero and finite temperatures. By setting energy or free\nenergy of the system and penalty for enforcing the local gauge invariance as\ntwo objectives, the multi-objective optimization can self-adjust the proper\nweighting for two objectives and thus faithfully simulate the gauge theory in\nthe physical Hilbert space. Specifically, we propose variational quantum\neigensolver and variational quantum thermalizer for preparing the ground states\nand thermal states of lattice gauge theory, respectively. We demonstrate the\nquantum algorithms for a $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory with spinless fermion in\none dimension. With numeral simulations, the multi-objective optimization shows\nthat minimizing energy~(free energy) and enforcing the local gauge invariance\ncan be achieved simultaneously at zero temperature~(finite temperature). The\nmulti-objective optimization suggests a feasible ingredient for quantum\nsimulation of complicated physical systems on near-term quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z0dNIs5DH6pu9dHKs8q8mkWPhYBwraDRihBeUWSzEP8","pdfSize":"1044403"}
