This\narticle shows that an alternative gauge-fixing condition inspired by\nsupersymmetry cures this divergence. The resulting geometry is a hyperbolic\nanalogue of the hyperk\\\"ahler geometry of Euclidean monopole moduli spaces.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
