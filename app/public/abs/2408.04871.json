Assuming that for training (constructing an optimal weight matrix $Q$)\nwe have a set of training pairs, i.e. we know the input data \\begin{equation}\nG=\\left\\{g^{\\left(1\\right)},g^{\\left(2\\right)},\\cdots,g^{\\left(K\\right)}\\right\\},\n\\end{equation} as well as the correct answers to these input data\n\\begin{equation}\nH=\\left\\{h^{\\left(1\\right)},h^{\\left(2\\right)},\\cdots,h^{\\left(K\\right)}\\right\\}.\n\\end{equation} We will study the possibilities of constructing a weight matrix\n$Q$ of a neural network that will give correct answers to arbitrary input data\nbased on the connection of the specified problem with a system of linear\nalgebraic equations (SLAE). Consider a class of neural networks in which each\nneuron has only one output signal and performs linear operations. We will show\nhow such LNEs are reduced to SLAEs. Since the questions $G$ and the correct\nanswers $H$ are known to us, the desired weight matrix $Q$ must satisfy the\nequations \\begin{equation} Qg^{\\left(k\\right)}=h^{\\left(k\\right)},\nk=1,2,\\cdots,K. \\end{equation} It is required to restore $Q$. In the general\ncase, the matrix $Q$ is rectangular $Q=Q_{MN}=\\left\\{q_{mn}\\right\\}$, $m$ is\nthe row number, and $g^{\\left(k\\right)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^N$,\n$h^{\\left(k\\right)}\\in\\mathbb{R}^M$. Let $G_{NK}$ be a matrix composed of\ncolumns $g^{\\left(1\\right)}, g^{\\left(2\\right)},\\cdots,g^{\\left(k\\right)}$, and\n$H_{MK}$ be a matrix composed of columns\n$h^{\\left(1\\right)},h^{\\left(2\\right)},\\cdots,h^{\\left(k\\right)}$. Then, with\nrespect to $Q_{MN}$, we obtain a matrix SLAE. \\begin{equation}\nQ_{MN}G_{NK}=H_{MK}. \\end{equation} This paper will present methods for\nregularizing the constructed system.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"5Sqm4W1no31x_iZVump4PEbHkKJIlBJcy8ElWOnZbuE","pdfSize":"2374351"}
