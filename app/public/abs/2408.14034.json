We utilize\nthe doubling trick and compute the leading terms in the large central charge\nexpansion of correlation functions in the holographic BCFT. In the\ncorresponding AdS space with an end of the world brane, we analyze the\nentanglement wedge cross section, the dual counterpart of reflected entropy.\nThis AdS/BCFT setup allows us to explore a richer set of phases in the\nentanglement wedge cross section. The $m-1$ correction in the holographic BCFT\nmanifests as modifications in the entanglement wedge cross section induced by\ncosmic branes. For the adjacent intervals anchored to the boundary of BCFT, we\nshow the duality between the entanglement wedge cross section with the\nbackreaction from a cosmic brane and Renyi reflected entropy at all orders in\n$m-1$. Furthermore, by analyzing the entanglement wedge cross section for\ngeneral adjacent intervals, we provide guidance for an $\\epsilon$-expansion of\nfive-point functions in the holographic CFT, where $\\epsilon$ is the rescaled\nconformal dimension by the central charge.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
