This study investigates a block structure that consists of covariate\nand response groups. It examines the block-selection problem of\nhigh-dimensional models with group structures for both responses and\ncovariates, where both the number of blocks and the dimension within each block\nare allowed to grow larger than the sample size. We propose a novel strategy\nfor detecting the block structure, which includes the block-selection model and\na non-zero block selector (NBS). We establish the uniform consistency of the\nNBS and propose three estimators based on the NBS to enhance modeling\nefficiency. We prove that the estimators achieve the oracle solution and show\nthat they are consistent, jointly asymptotically normal, and efficient in\nmodeling extremely high-dimensional data. Simulations generate complex data\nsettings and demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method. A gene-data\nanalysis also demonstrates its effectiveness.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
