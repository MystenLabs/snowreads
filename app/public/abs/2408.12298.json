The Chebotarev invariant $C(G)$ of $G$ is the expected value of\nthe random variable $n$ that is minimal subject to the requirement that $n$\nrandomly chosen elements of $G$ invariably generate $G$. In this paper, we show\nthat if $G$ is a nonabelian finite simple group, then $C(G)$ is absolutely\nbounded. More generally, we show that if $G$ is a direct product of $k$\nnonabelian finite simple groups, then $C(G)=\\log{k}/\\log{\\alpha(G)}+O(1)$,\nwhere $\\alpha$ is an invariant completely determined by the proportion of\nderangements of the primitive permutation actions of the factors in $G$. It\nfollows from the proof of the Boston-Shalev conjecture that $C(G)=O(\\log{k})$.\nWe also derive sharp bounds on the expected number of generators for $G$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"TKxbzi9zVaKB7E9dMBZE2ZmtaIOKekeJoNHSL8tnd_A","pdfSize":"250360"}
