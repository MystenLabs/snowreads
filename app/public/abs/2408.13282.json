Three implementation schemes are\ntried: full fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model, parameter-efficient\nfine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model, and self-built language model from\nscratch. Through the self-built question and answer task dataset, based on the\ntensorflow and keras deep learning platform framework, the model is constructed\nand trained to predict the start position and end position of the answer in the\nbridge design specification given by the user. The experimental results show\nthat full fine-tuning of the Bert pretrained model achieves 100% accuracy in\nthe training-dataset, validation-dataset and test-dataset, and the system can\nextract the answers from the bridge design specification given by the user to\nanswer various questions of the user; While parameter-efficient fine-tuning of\nthe Bert pretrained model and self-built language model from scratch perform\nwell in the training-dataset, their generalization ability in the test-dataset\nneeds to be improved. The research of this paper provides a useful reference\nfor the development of question answering system in professional field.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
