Although\nadvances in action recognition (AR) and temporal action detection (AD),\nespecially transformer-based models and vision foundation models, have achieved\nhigh performance on human action datasets, animal videos remain relatively\nunder-researched. This thesis addresses this gap by proposing the model MARINE,\nwhich utilizes motion-based frame selection designed for fast animal actions\nand DINOv2 feature extraction with a trainable classification head for action\nrecognition. MARINE outperforms VideoMAE in identifying predator attacks in\nvideos of fish, both on a small and specific coral reef dataset (81.53\\%\nagainst 52.64\\% accuracy), and on a subset of the more extensive Animal Kingdom\ndataset (94.86\\% against 83.14\\% accuracy). In a multi-label setting on a\nrepresentative sample of Animal Kingdom, MARINE achieves 23.79\\% mAP,\npositioning it mid-field among existing benchmarks. Furthermore, in an AD task\non the coral reef dataset, MARINE achieves 80.78\\% AP (against VideoMAE's\n34.89\\%) although at a lowered t-IoU threshold of 25\\%. Therefore, despite room\nfor improvement, MARINE offers an effective starter framework to apply to AR\nand AD tasks on animal recordings and thus contribute to the study of natural\necosystems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"60AKNXGGxv_7ElTV2kWW5bQjQRrQdlIglMO7J8zvp88","pdfSize":"25569045"}
