However, the\naccuracy of the implicit geometry is unsatisfactory because the passive static\nenvironmental illumination has low spatial frequency and cannot provide enough\ninformation for accurate geometry reconstruction. In this work, we propose\nActiveNeRF, a 3D geometry reconstruction framework, which improves the geometry\nquality of NeRF by actively projecting patterns of high spatial frequency onto\nthe scene using a projector which has a constant relative pose to the camera.\nWe design a learnable active pattern rendering pipeline which jointly learns\nthe scene geometry and the active pattern. We find that, by adding the active\npattern and imposing its consistency across different views, our proposed\nmethod outperforms state of the art geometry reconstruction methods\nqualitatively and quantitatively in both simulation and real experiments.
