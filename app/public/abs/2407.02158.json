We present UltraPixel, a novel\narchitecture utilizing cascade diffusion models to generate high-quality images\nat multiple resolutions (\\textit{e.g.}, 1K to 6K) within a single model, while\nmaintaining computational efficiency. UltraPixel leverages semantics-rich\nrepresentations of lower-resolution images in the later denoising stage to\nguide the whole generation of highly detailed high-resolution images,\nsignificantly reducing complexity. Furthermore, we introduce implicit neural\nrepresentations for continuous upsampling and scale-aware normalization layers\nadaptable to various resolutions. Notably, both low- and high-resolution\nprocesses are performed in the most compact space, sharing the majority of\nparameters with less than 3$\\%$ additional parameters for high-resolution\noutputs, largely enhancing training and inference efficiency. Our model\nachieves fast training with reduced data requirements, producing\nphoto-realistic high-resolution images and demonstrating state-of-the-art\nperformance in extensive experiments.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SMLpzCpK9i2UjVyt2XSXjB6vNn7oROcWkSHSrSSFtrs","pdfSize":"48718879","objectId":"0x3a20f0cb153f45d594c703c655dc54bf9373d9e539e59084c529b193ce3f81f1","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
