Specifically, in this work we discuss\nmore general gauged noninvertible symmetries in which the noninvertible\nsymmetry is not multiplicity free, and discuss the case of Rep$(A_4)$ in\ndetail. We realize Rep$(A_4)$ gaugings for the $c = 1$ CFT at the exceptional\npoint in the moduli space and find new self-duality under gauging a certain\nnon-group algebra object, leading to a larger noninvertible symmetry Rep$(SL(2,\nZ_3))$. We also discuss more general examples of decomposition in\ntwo-dimensional gauge theories with trivially-acting gauged noninvertible\nsymmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
