The integrator is suited for Lie-Poisson\nsystems that also admit an isospectral formulation, which enables scalability\nto high-dimensional systems. Its derivation follows from discrete Lie-Poisson\nreduction of the symplectic midpoint scheme for stochastic Hamiltonian systems.\nWe prove almost sure preservation of Casimir functions and coadjoint orbits\nunder the numerical flow and provide strong and weak convergence rates of the\nproposed method. The scalability, structure-conservation, and convergence rates\nare illustrated numerically for the (generalized) rigid body, point vortex\ndynamics, and the two-dimensional Euler equations on the sphere.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
