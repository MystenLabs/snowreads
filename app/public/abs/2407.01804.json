However, their effectiveness in low- and\nhigh-budget scenarios seems to require different strategies, and achieving\noptimal results across varying budget scenarios remains a challenge. In this\nstudy, we introduce Dynamic Coverage & Margin mix (DCoM), a novel active\nlearning approach designed to bridge this gap. Unlike existing strategies, DCoM\ndynamically adjusts its strategy, considering the competence of the current\nmodel. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evaluations on diverse\ndatasets, including challenging computer vision tasks, we demonstrate DCoM's\nability to overcome the cold start problem and consistently improve results\nacross different budgetary constraints. Thus DCoM achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in both low- and high-budget regimes.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZMIVFUri5x1Zoy_bUFd-1Toup10XfAzDCfpLmI89t38","pdfSize":"2488798"}
