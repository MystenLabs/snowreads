This can be seen as a tropical analog of classical\nresults of Mumford and Roitman for Chow groups of smooth (complex) projective\nalgebraic varieties. We also show that the existence of tropical 1-forms on\ntropical surfaces does not imply infinite dimensionality by considering the\ncase of a tropical Klein bottle.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
