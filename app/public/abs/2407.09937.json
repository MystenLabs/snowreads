The\nmain step of the proof is a characterization of the nilpotent Lie groups among\nthe solvable Lie groups solely in terms of topological properties of their\ncoadjoint orbits.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Operator Algebras","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
