This paper\nintroduces a formal approach to clearly define the Operational Domain (OD) and\nODD for automated vehicles. Furthermore, the absence of essential terms, such\nas the OD, has resulted in the creation of numerous terms that have made things\nmore complicated and confusing. This level of complexity is unacceptable when\nit comes to developing safety-critical systems, where any uncertainty can lead\nto significant risks. This study addresses these deficiencies by providing a\nprecise mathematical model of OD and clarifying its relationship with other\nterms. Also, by formalizing these terms, this work establishes a foundation for\ndeveloping further concepts such as ODD specification and ODD monitoring, which\nare explained in this paper.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"70XXsTx3JbsxQdK7-l-TCqhvkPKlfHzTX7z_kfAGeQA","pdfSize":"463750"}
