Although\npromising, the quality factors that are considered in these works are general\nrather than FR-specific, \\eg, atmospheric turbulence, resolution, \\etc.\n  Motivated by the observation of the vulnerability of current FR models to\neven small Face Alignment Errors (FAE) in LQ images, we present a simple yet\neffective method that considers FAE as another quality factor that is tailored\nto FR. We seek to improve LQ FR by enhancing FR models' robustness to FAE. To\nthis aim, we formalize the problem as a combination of differentiable spatial\ntransformations and adversarial data augmentation in FR. We perturb the\nalignment of the training samples using a controllable spatial transformation\nand enrich the training with samples expressing FAE.\n  We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed method by conducting evaluations\non IJB-B, IJB-C, IJB-S (+4.3\\% Rank1), and TinyFace (+2.63\\%).\n\\href{https://github.com/msed-Ebrahimi/ARoFace}{https://github.com/msed-Ebrahimi/ARoFace}\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
