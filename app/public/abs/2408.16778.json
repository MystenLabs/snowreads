Among the CVNN architectures, the complex-valued\nradial basis function neural network (C-RBF) stands out, especially when\noperating in noisy environments such as 5G multiple-input multiple-output\n(MIMO) systems. In such a context, this paper extends the classical shallow\nC-RBF to deep architectures, increasing its flexibility for a wider range of\napplications. Also, based on the parameter selection of the phase transmittance\nradial basis function (PT-RBF) neural network, we propose an initialization\nscheme for the deep C-RBF. Via rigorous simulations conforming to 3GPP TS 38\nstandards for digital communications, our method not only outperforms\nconventional initialization strategies like random, $K$-means, and\nconstellation-based methods but it also seems to be the only approach to\nachieve successful convergence for deep C-RBF architectures. These findings\npave the way to more robust and efficient neural network deployments in\ncomplex-valued digital communication systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
