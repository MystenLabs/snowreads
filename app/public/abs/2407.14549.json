Forcing it to do so\nresults in a naked null singularity at the would-be horizon. Therefore, since\nthe universe is expanding, black holes must couple to the cosmological\nexpansion, which was suggested as the growth mechanism for supermassive black\nholes in galaxies, with implications for the dark energy puzzle.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
