As the general communication\nnetwork cannot meet the emergency requirements, in this paper we study the\nmulti-UAV enabled wireless emergency communication system. Our goal is to\nmaximize the capacity with jointly optimizing trajectory and allocating power.\nTo tackle this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two\nsub-problems to optimize the trajectory and power allocation, respectively.\nThen, we propose the successive convex approximation technique and the block\ncoordinate update algorithm to solve the two subproblems. The approximate\noptimal solution can be obtained after continuous iterations. Simulation\nresults show that the capacity can be greatly increased using our proposed\njoint trajectory optimization and power allocation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
