The angular momentum\nflux in scalar-tensor theories involves both a tensorial and a scalar\ncontribution which can be further decomposed as instantaneous, tail and\nnon-linear memory effects up to 1.5PN order. We compute the explicit\nexpressions of tail effects using the Fourier decomposition of tensorial and\nscalar multipole moments, and non-linear memory effects using the Newtonian\norder quasi-Keplerian representation of elliptic orbits in scalar-tensor\ntheories. This work is important to construct the radiation-reaction force and\nhence the waveform templates for eccentric binaries in scalar-tensor theories\nof gravity.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
