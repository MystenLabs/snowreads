This paper employs the Markov regime-switching model with time-varying\ntransition probability (TVTP-MS) to investigate the growth pattern of China's\npublic debt and the impact of financial variables such as credit, house prices\nand stock prices on the growth of public debt. We identify two distinct regimes\nof China's public debt, i.e., the surge regime with high growth rate and high\nvolatility and the steady regime with low growth rate and low volatility. The\nmain results are twofold. On the one hand, an increase in the growth rate of\nthe financial variables helps to moderate the growth rate of public debt,\nwhereas the effects differ between the two regimes. More specifically, the\nimpacts of credit and house prices are significant in the surge regime, whereas\nstock prices affect public debt growth significantly in the steady regime. On\nthe other hand, a higher growth rate of financial variables also increases the\nprobability of public debt either staying in or switching to the steady regime.\nThese findings highlight the necessity of aligning financial adjustments with\nthe prevailing public debt regime when developing sustainable fiscal policies.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
