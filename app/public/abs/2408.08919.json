This paper presents a systematic review of\nthe current research on optimal power flow (OPF) within IES, addressing the\nspatiotemporal interrelationships and coupled co-supply among primary energy\nprocesses such as electricity, gas, and heat (cooling). It highlights the\nchallenges and future directions in this field, underscoring the lack of\ncomprehensive studies on coupled power flow modeling for electricity-heat-gas\nsystems and the need for more robust modeling approaches that align with\npractical engineering applications. Furthermore, the paper discusses the\npotential of multi-target energy storage systems to enhance energy consumption\nefficiency and flexibility in energy resource management. The existing models\nand algorithms for target power flow and optimal power flow are critiqued for\ntheir lack of flexibility and comprehensiveness, particularly in handling\nmulti-objective flows and ensuring system safety and reliability. The study\nemphasizes the necessity for further development of safety and reliability\nassessment frameworks to support the evolving demands of integrated energy\nsystems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"9VzuRDkS8eF1VVK0DVXKT_VcViTkUatqkYRkOEn9qk8","pdfSize":"415775"}
