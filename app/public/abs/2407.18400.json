We\nformulate and analyze a kinetic MFG model for an interacting system of\nnon-cooperative motile agents with inertial dynamics and finite-range\ninteractions, where each agent is minimizing a biologically inspired cost\nfunction. By analyzing the associated coupled forward-backward in time system\nof nonlinear Fokker-Planck and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, we obtain\nconditions for closed-loop linear stability of the spatially homogeneous MFG\nequilibrium that corresponds to an ordered state with non-zero mean speed.\nUsing a combination of analysis and numerical simulations, we show that when\nenergetic cost of control is reduced below a critical value, this equilibrium\nloses stability, and the system transitions to a travelling wave solution. Our\nwork provides a game-theoretic perspective to the problem of collective motion\nin non-equilibrium biological and bio-inspired systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0x2BV375wt4zdXOvfJ_-1fchcOyFySGDA1ANpr4rQJA","pdfSize":"4246596"}
