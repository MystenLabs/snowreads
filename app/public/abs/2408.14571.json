The\nHamiltonian H_MJ1 reshapes the existing paradigm, providing a more robust and\nversatile framework than the Hamiltonian H_RD, with the potential to catalyze\nnew advancements in the study of quantum materials. H_MJ1 encapsulates two\ndistinct spin textures: a unidirectional, momentum-independent persistent spin\ntexture (PST), and a bidirectional (partial) PST. In contrast Hamiltonian H_MJ2\nportrays a spiral spin texture, drawing a conceptual link to the cosmological\nprocess of expansion and contraction, mirrored within a two-dimensional quantum\nframework. We also explore the fundamental aspects of earlier analytical models\nthat underpin the construction of the present MJ spintronic model. The physical\ninterpretations of these models are illustrated graphically, and the emerging\nspin phenomena resulting from complex SOC are elucidated using a simple vector\nmodel.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"LWD0MRh-sLB-11pBF-zFl48wMnbYKgybVUVKfX8nNCI","pdfSize":"2112299"}
