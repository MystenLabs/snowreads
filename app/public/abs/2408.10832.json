We present a\ncategorical obstruction to the coherence of bulk group symmetry and boundary\nsymmetries in terms of liftings of categorical actions on the bulk theory to a\ncertain 2-group of boundary symmetries.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Quantum Algebra","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Category Theory","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
