The\njumping diffusion coefficient gives rise to the discontinuity of the spatial\ngradient of solution across the interface. We use the Banach-Necas-Babuska\ntheorem to show the well-posedness of the continuous variational problem. A\nfully discrete finite-element based scheme is analyzed using the Galerkin\nmethod and unstructured fitted meshes. An optimal error estimate is established\nin a discrete energy norm under appropriate globally low but locally high\nregularity conditions. Some numerical results corroborate our theoretical\nresults.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"EDB5xq-XliYKa8_aWtvf19sjowifiWIdhVY-j4JT1vU","pdfSize":"2373965"}
