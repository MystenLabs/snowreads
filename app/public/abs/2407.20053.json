Recently,\nmachine learning has emerged as an appealing alternative to improve accuracy\nand reduce computational time. However, due to limited observational technology\nand high costs, the scarcity of real-world data restricts the potential of\nmachine learning models. To overcome these limitations, we propose an ocean SWH\nestimation framework, namely Orca. Specifically, Orca enhances the limited\nspatio-temporal reasoning abilities of classic LLMs with a novel spatiotemporal\naware encoding module. By segmenting the limited buoy observational data\ntemporally, encoding the buoys' locations spatially, and designing prompt\ntemplates, Orca capitalizes on the robust generalization ability of LLMs to\nestimate significant wave height effectively with limited data. Experimental\nresults on the Gulf of Mexico demonstrate that Orca achieves state-of-the-art\nperformance in SWH estimation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
