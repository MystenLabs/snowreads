We propose a simple test based on Wilcoxon's\nrank sum statistic for which we prove asymptotic normality under the null\nhypothesis and fixed alternatives under mild conditions on the underlying\ndistributions of the point clouds. Furthermore, we show consistency of the test\nand derive a variance approximation that allows to construct a computationally\nfeasible, distribution-free test with good finite sample performance. The power\nand robustness of the test for high-dimensional data and low sample sizes is\ndemonstrated by numerical simulations. Finally, we apply the proposed test to\ncase-control testing on microarray data in genetic studies, which is considered\na notorious case for a high number of variables and low sample sizes.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
