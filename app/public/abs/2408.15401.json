The MEM\nsimultaneously accounts for service accessibility and transportation costs\nacross different modes of transportation and social demographics. We provide a\ndata-driven validation of the proposed MEM to characterize the impact of\nvarious parameters in the metric across cities in the U.S. We subsequently\ndevelop a routing framework that aims to optimize MEM within a transportation\nnetwork containing both public transit and private vehicles. Within this\nframework, a system planner provides routing suggestions to vehicles across all\nmodes of transportation to maximize MEM. We evaluate our approach through\nnumerical simulations, analyzing the impact of travel demands and compliance of\nprivate vehicles. This work provides insights into designing transportation\nsystems that are not only efficient but also equitable, ensuring fair access to\nessential services across diverse populations.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"RvzSYovHvtH9Ses4ZBfr1QSiOewCSMyUNcw3NBQaYb0","pdfSize":"4801658"}
