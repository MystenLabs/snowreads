However, this approach overlooks crucial equivalences between\nexpressions that arise from mathematical symmetries, such as commutativity,\nassociativity, and distribution laws for arithmetic operations. Consequently,\nexpressions with similar errors on a given data set are apart from each other\nin the search space. This leads to a rough error landscape in the search space\nthat efficient local, gradient-based methods cannot explore. This paper\nproposes and implements a measure of a behavioral distance, BED, that clusters\ntogether expressions with similar errors. The experimental results show that\nthe stochastic method for calculating BED achieves consistency with a modest\nnumber of sampled values for evaluating the expressions. This leads to\ncomputational efficiency comparable to the tree-based syntactic distance. Our\nfindings also reveal that BED significantly improves the smoothness of the\nerror landscape in the search space for symbolic regression.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
