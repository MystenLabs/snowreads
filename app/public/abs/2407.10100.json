Community, core-periphery, disassortative and other partitions\nallow us to understand the organisation and function of large networks. In this\nwork we study under what conditions certain common meso-scale structures are\ndetectable using the idea of block modularity. We find that the configuration\nmodel imposes strong restrictions on core-periphery and related structures in\ndirected networks. We derive inequalities expressing when such structures can\nbe detected under the configuration model. Nestedness is closely related to\ncore-periphery and is similarly restricted to only be detectable under certain\nconditions. We show that these conditions are a generalisation of the\nresolution limit to structures other than assortative communities. We show how\nblock modularity is related to the degree corrected Stochastic Block Model and\nthat optimisation of one can be made equivalent to the other in general.\nFinally, we discuss these issues in inferential versus descriptive approaches\nto meso-scale structure detection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Physics/Physics and Society"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"99d4M4HsRFt9s2bDodHkQYvb_LBjzff_wGiGSBEWkfw","pdfSize":"1508947"}
