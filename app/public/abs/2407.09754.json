Although their intensity drops fast and,\nmoreover, it is not clear whether these fields last long enough to induce a\nmagnetization during the quark-gluon plasma phase, most of the models and\nsimulations predict a significant intensity that lasts up to proper times of\norder 1 fm after the beginning of the reaction, which is a typical time for the\nhydrodynamical phase to start. This interval of time is referred to as the\npre-equilibrium stage. The evolution of the reaction during pre-equilibrium is\nthus likely to be influenced by these fields. In this work we adopt a strong\nfield approximation to study the effects of the magnetic field-induced\nanisotropy on the gluon pressure. We include this anisotropy within the\ndescription obtained by means of Effective Kinetic Theory and explore the\nconsequences to reach isotropization at proper times of order 1 fm. We show\nthat when including the magnetic field effects, isotropization is achieved\nfaster.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
