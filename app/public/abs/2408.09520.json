Consequently, circular diffraction images were obtained\nwhen the reciprocal lattice vectors were evenly distributed on the conical\nsurface at a certain inclination angle in the reciprocal space. This result\nprovides clear evidence that the phase in question was smectic C. The\npolarization properties also showed that the observed smectic C phase had\nspontaneous polarization in the direction parallel to the director and was\nidentified as ferroelectric smectic C. These results provide a new type of\nclassification for liquid crystalline phases that has been established over\nmany years and is a significant contribution to the basic science of soft\nmatter research.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
