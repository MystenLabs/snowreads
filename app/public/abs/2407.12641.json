Here we consider the case of vanishing baryon\nchemical potential, where detailed comparisons to data from lattice QCD are\npossible. To this end, we extend previous works by including a realistic pion\nmass and pion condensation into the decompactified limit of the model and\nevaluate the system for arbitrary isospin chemical potentials and temperatures.\nAfter suitably fixing the 3 parameters of the model, we find that the overall\nphase structure is in excellent agreement with lattice results. This also holds\nfor observables at low temperatures in the strongly coupled regime, while we\ndiscover and discuss some discrepancies at large temperatures. Our findings\ngive reassurance for the validity of previous and future applications of this\nmodel and highlight the aspects where improvements are needed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
