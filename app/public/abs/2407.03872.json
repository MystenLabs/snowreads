Unlike traditional object\ndetection methods, RGB-TIR object detection aims to utilize both RGB and TIR\nimages for complementary information during detection. The challenges of\nRGB-TIR object detection from the perspective of unmanned aerial vehicles\ninclude highly complex image backgrounds, frequent changes in lighting, and\nuncalibrated RGB-TIR image pairs. To address these challenges at the model\nlevel, we utilized a lightweight YOLOv9 model with extended multi-level\nauxiliary branches that enhance the model's robustness, making it more suitable\nfor practical applications in unmanned aerial vehicle scenarios. For image\nfusion in RGB-TIR detection, we incorporated a fusion module into the backbone\nnetwork to fuse images at the feature level, implicitly addressing calibration\nissues. Our proposed method achieved an mAP score of 0.516 and 0.543 on A and B\nbenchmarks respectively while maintaining the highest inference speed among all\nmodels.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
