We model this as a large two-player zero-sum one-shot game\nplayed on a graph representation of the physical world, with the optimal\nlogistics plans described by the (possibly randomized) Nash equilibria of this\ngame. Our logistics model is fairly sophisticated, and is able to handle\nmultiple modes of transport and goods, accounting for possible storage of goods\nin warehouses, as well as Leontief utilities based on demand satisfied. We\nprove computational hardness results related to equilibrium finding and propose\na practical double-oracle solver based on solving a series of best-response\nmixed-integer linear programs. We experiment on both synthetic and real-world\nmaps, demonstrating that our proposed method scales to reasonably large games.\nWe also demonstrate the importance of explicitly modeling the capabilities of\nthe adversary via ablation studies and comparisons with a naive logistics plan\nbased on heuristics.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Science and Game Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"q4IIV8GOIUX_ra_fIuZA1ZgzVtyccQlvhZMI3kKhl50","pdfSize":"8412936"}
