However, their\ncomplex architectures result in large parameter counts and extended training\ntimes, limiting their practical application and scalability to global-scale\nforecasting. This paper aims to explore the key factor for accurate weather\nforecasting and design more efficient solutions. Interestingly, our empirical\nfindings reveal that absolute positional encoding is what really works in\nTransformer-based weather forecasting models, which can explicitly model the\nspatial-temporal correlations even without attention mechanisms. We\ntheoretically prove that its effectiveness stems from the integration of\ngeographical coordinates and real-world time features, which are intrinsically\nrelated to the dynamics of weather. Based on this, we propose LightWeather, a\nlightweight and effective model for station-based global weather forecasting.\nWe employ absolute positional encoding and a simple MLP in place of other\ncomponents of Transformer. With under 30k parameters and less than one hour of\ntraining time, LightWeather achieves state-of-the-art performance on global\nweather datasets compared to other advanced DL methods. The results underscore\nthe superiority of integrating spatial-temporal knowledge over complex\narchitectures, providing novel insights for DL in weather forecasting.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
