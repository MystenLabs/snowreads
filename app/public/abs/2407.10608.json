As a result, the corresponding dual symmetries of the full phase\ndiagram can be shown without any approximation. And it has been shown not only\nin the NJL models, but also in framework of two- and three-color massless QCD\nitself. This is quite interesting, since one might say that it is not very\ncommon to show something completely non-perturbatively in QCD.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
