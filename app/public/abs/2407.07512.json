In this contribution, we\nreport on the study performed in arXiv:2403.11975, which investigates these\nlimits from the perspective of infrared factorisation, offering general\ndefinitions for strongly-ordered soft and collinear kernels, expressed in terms\nof gauge-invariant operator matrix elements. These definitions facilitate the\nidentification of local subtraction counterterms for strongly-ordered\nconfigurations, whose integrals are designed to cancel the IR poles of\nreal-virtual counterterms. This framework is validated at tree level for\nmultiple emissions, and at one loop for single and double emissions.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"EsZy3NOagxboGkchbVfJ-BGMPR08qU_5VtDrt3rdLiA","pdfSize":"167199"}
