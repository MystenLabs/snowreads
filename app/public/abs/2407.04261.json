Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a\nplanetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital\nperiod. We find that critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy\nkicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide\nrange of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant\npopulation of primordially tight JuMBOs. Applying our results to the recently\ndiscovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space\nTelescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\\sim$9\\%\nwide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 = 10$--20~au and a\ndensity-weighted residence time of $\\chi \\gtrsim 10^4$~Myr~pc$^{-3}$ are\nfavored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight\nbinaries near the cluster core.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
