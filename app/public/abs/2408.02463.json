The\nvalidity of this relation is shown experimentally in this paper, by comparison\nwith simultaneously measured electrical currents and simulations. Moreover, we\nverify that the method is applicable under various light concentrations and\napplied voltages, which allows us to investigate the cell in relevant\nconditions. Results evidence several kind of series resistances affecting the\ncurrent transport efficiencies. We show that the relative contribution of those\ndifferent resistances to the loss in current collection is a function of the\nillumination intensity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
