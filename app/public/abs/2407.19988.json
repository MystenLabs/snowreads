Existing solutions have limitations in terms of\naccessibility. In this paper, we propose HeadsetOff, a novel system that\nachieves photorealistic video conferencing on economical VR headsets by\nleveraging voice-driven face reconstruction. HeadsetOff consists of three main\ncomponents: a multimodal predictor, a generator, and an adaptive controller.\nThe predictor effectively predicts user future behavior based on different\nmodalities. The generator employs voice, head motion, and eye blink to animate\nthe human face. The adaptive controller dynamically selects the appropriate\ngenerator model based on the trade-off between video quality and delay.\nExperimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HeadsetOff in achieving\nhigh-quality, low-latency video conferencing on economical VR headsets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
