Previous\nmodels for acceleration such as diffusive shock acceleration and that due to\nturbulence fall short in terms of efficiency. In this letter, we propose the\npossibility of acceleration via magnetic reconnection. In particular, we invoke\nthe plasmoid instability which has been previously applied to understand\nparticle energization in high energy systems. Turbulence in galaxy clusters\nlead to fluctuation dynamos that are known to generate magnetic fields\nstructures consisting of sharp reversals. These form natural sites of\nreconnection. We perform Particle-In-Cell (PIC) simulations of the plasmoid\ninstability in collisionless and nonrelativistic plasmas. We show that the\nresulting particle energy spectra have power law indices that are consistent\nwith that inferred from observations. Our estimates of the maximum achievable\nLorentz factor is about $10^5$ indicating that acceleration due magnetic\nreconnection is a promising avenue for understanding the origin of nonthermal\nemission in galaxy clusters.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"JAO0wyk08ZC0T2PBpeuBu8gEHx81EBtDoGFB3Ik6bmU","pdfSize":"2359107","objectId":"0x853e5d536ab3fc9e8badaa33bdcfa2d8d1e1d7ed323845d38b79867fd6a7ccdc","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
