Typically,\nsuch problems can be investigated and fixed by on-call engineers, but locating\nthe cause of such problems and fixing errors are often time-consuming.\nTherefore, automatic data validation is a better solution to defend the system\nand downstream services by enabling early detection of errors and providing\ndetailed error messages for quick resolution. This paper proposes a\nself-validate data management system with automatic pattern discovery\ntechniques to verify the correctness of semi-structural string data in\nenterprise data pipelines. Our solution extracts patterns from historical data\nand detects erroneous incoming data in a top-down fashion. High-level\ninformation of historical data is analyzed to discover the format skeleton of\ncorrect values. Fine-grained semantic patterns are then extracted to strike a\nbalance between generalization and specification of the discovered pattern,\nthus covering as many correct values as possible while avoiding over-fitting.\nTo tackle cold start and rapid data growth, we propose an incremental update\nstrategy and example generalization strategy. Experiments on large-scale\nindustrial and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of\nour method compared to alternative solutions. Furthermore, a case study on an\nindustrial platform (Ant Group Inc.) with thousands of applications shows that\nour system captures meaningful data patterns in daily operations and helps\nengineers quickly identify errors.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Databases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
