Nevertheless, fast and reversible control of symmetry in materials\nremains a challenge, especially for nanoscale systems. Here, we unveil\nreversible symmetry changes in colloidal lead chalcogenide quantum dots on\npicosecond timescales. Using a combination of ultrafast electron diffraction\nand total X-ray scattering, in conjunction with atomic-scale structural\nmodeling and first-principles calculations, we reveal that symmetry-broken lead\nsulfide quantum dots restore to a centrosymmetric phase upon photoexcitation.\nThe symmetry restoration is driven by photoexcited electronic carriers, which\nsuppress lead off-centering for about 100 ps. Furthermore, the change in\nsymmetry is closely correlated with the electronic properties as shown by\ntransient optical measurements. Overall, this study elucidates reversible\nsymmetry changes in colloidal quantum dots, and more broadly defines a new\nmethodology to optically control symmetry in nanoscale systems on ultrafast\ntimescales.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
