Let $s_i$ denote the transposition in the\nsymmetric group $\\mathfrak{S}_n$ that swaps $i$ and $i+1$. Given a word\n$\\mathsf{w}$ over the alphabet $\\{s_1,\\ldots,s_{n-1}\\}$, we can generate a\nrandom subword by independently deleting each letter of $\\mathsf{w}$ with\nprobability $1-p$. For a large class of starting words $\\mathsf{w}$ --\nincluding all alternating reduced words for the decreasing permutation -- we\ncompute precise asymptotics (as $n\\to\\infty$) for the expected number of\ninversions of the permutation represented by the random subword. This result\ncan also be seen as an asymptotic formula for the expected number of inversions\nof a permutation represented by a certain random (non-reduced) pipe dream. In\nthe special case when $\\mathsf{w}$ is the word\n$(s_{n-1})(s_{n-2}s_{n-1})\\cdots(s_1s_2\\cdots s_{n-1})$, we find that the\nexpected number of inversions of the permutation represented by the random\nsubword is asymptotically equal to\n\\[\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}}{3\\sqrt{\\pi}}\\sqrt{\\frac{p}{1-p}}\\,n^{3/2};\\] this settles a\nconjecture of Morales, Panova, Petrov, and Yeliussizov.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
