Pre-trained on DeepSeekMath-Base with\nspecialization in formal mathematical languages, the model undergoes supervised\nfine-tuning using an enhanced formal theorem proving dataset derived from\nDeepSeek-Prover-V1. Further refinement is achieved through reinforcement\nlearning from proof assistant feedback (RLPAF). Beyond the single-pass\nwhole-proof generation approach of DeepSeek-Prover-V1, we propose RMaxTS, a\nvariant of Monte-Carlo tree search that employs an intrinsic-reward-driven\nexploration strategy to generate diverse proof paths. DeepSeek-Prover-V1.5\ndemonstrates significant improvements over DeepSeek-Prover-V1, achieving new\nstate-of-the-art results on the test set of the high school level miniF2F\nbenchmark ($63.5\\%$) and the undergraduate level ProofNet benchmark ($25.3\\%$).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"XJjl-z9jgpH4S7kPeWLNYuVTQb6gZSjXemXZx7tDgSU","pdfSize":"1867033"}
