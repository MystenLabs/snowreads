The leading universal corrections in the EFT are one-loop in-medium\neffects at the Fermi surface, and reproduce the well-known\nGor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov result. The complete subleading universal corrections\nare presented here, and include one-loop effects away from the Fermi surface,\ntwo-loop in-medium effects, as well as modifications to the fermion propagator.\nTogether, these effects are found to reduce the gap at low densities.\nApplications to neutron superfluidity in neutron stars are also discussed.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Superconductivity","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
