Used\nby governments, companies, and academics, its mathematically rigorous\nguarantees and worst-case assumptions on the strength and knowledge of\nattackers make it a robust and compelling framework for reasoning about\nprivacy. However, even with landmark successes, differential privacy has not\nachieved widespread adoption in everyday data use and data protection.
