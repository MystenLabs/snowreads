In this paper, we propose an offline active learning method that\nselects nodes to query by explicitly incorporating information from both the\nnetwork structure and node covariates. Building on graph signal recovery\ntheories and the random spectral sparsification technique, the proposed method\nadopts a two-stage biased sampling strategy that takes both informativeness and\nrepresentativeness into consideration for node querying. Informativeness refers\nto the complexity of graph signals that are learnable from the responses of\nqueried nodes, while representativeness refers to the capacity of queried nodes\nto control generalization errors given noisy node-level information. We\nestablish a theoretical relationship between generalization error and the\nnumber of nodes selected by the proposed method. Our theoretical results\ndemonstrate the trade-off between informativeness and representativeness in\nactive learning. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method\nis competitive with existing graph-based active learning methods, especially\nwhen node covariates and responses contain noises. Additionally, the proposed\nmethod is applicable to both regression and classification tasks on graphs.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yGRLn7ILjVoptPBbO0D3WGyUftvptslzImTEXXh9DUU","pdfSize":"3708118"}
