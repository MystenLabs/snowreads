To succinctly describe\ntheir shifts when the system is applied perturbation, the notions of functional\nand functional derivative are borrowed from functional analysis to consider the\nwhole system as an argument of the geometric representation of the periodic\norbit or cycle. The shifts of an orbit/trajectory and periodic orbit/cycle are\nanalyzed and concluded as formulae for maps/flows, respectively. The theory\nshall be beneficial to the sensitivity to perturbation analysis, control and\noptimization of various systems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Nonlinear Sciences/Chaotic Dynamics","Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
