In the constructed models, the Ricci scalar is an integral of motion\nirrespectively of the type of metric. The general solutions of evolution\nequations in the spatially flat FLRW metric have been found for models the\nquartic potentials.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
