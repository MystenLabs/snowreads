The evolution of the exchange frequencies\nwith interlayer distance -- as the crystal undergoes a sequence of structural\ntransitions -- leads to both ferromagnetic and multi-sublattice\nantiferromagnetic phases. Extrapolation of the results to higher density\nsuggests a rich magnetic phase diagram of the bilayer Wigner crystal, including\nthe possibility of spin-nematic and valence-bond solid phases. The bilayer\ncrystal is stable to higher electron densities than the monolayer, leading to\nenhanced magnetic energy scales. Our estimates of the exchange energies suggest\nsome of the magnetic phases may be accessible in recently discovered bilayer\nWigner crystals in a transition-metal dichalcogenide system.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
