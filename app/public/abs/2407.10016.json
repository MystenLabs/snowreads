This raises the question: how does an edge model differ from\na high-accuracy (base) model for the same task? We introduce XDELTA, a novel\nexplainable AI tool that explains differences between a high-accuracy base\nmodel and a computationally efficient but lower-accuracy edge model. To achieve\nthis, we propose a learning-based approach to characterize the model\ndifference, named the DELTA network, which complements the feature\nrepresentation capability of the edge network in a compact form. To construct\nDELTA, we propose a sparsity optimization framework that extracts the essence\nof the base model to ensure compactness and sufficient feature representation\ncapability of DELTA, and implement a negative correlation learning approach to\nensure it complements the edge model. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to\ntest XDELTA's ability to explain model discrepancies, using over 1.2 million\nimages and 24 models, and assessing real-world deployments with six\nparticipants. XDELTA excels in explaining differences between base and edge\nmodels (arbitrary pairs as well as compressed base models) through geometric\nand concept-level analysis, proving effective in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
