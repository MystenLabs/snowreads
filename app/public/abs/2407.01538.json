We show that observing the statistical moments of market demand\nallows the analyst to test aggregate data for rationality. Interestingly, just\nthe mean and variance of demand carry observable restrictions. This is in stark\ncontrast to impossibility result of the Sonnenschein-Mantel-Debreu theorem,\nwhich shows that aggregate demand carries no observable restrictions at all. We\nleverage our approach to deliver a characterization of rationality in terms of\nmoments for the common two-good case. We illustrate the usefulness of\nmoment-based restrictions through two applications: (i) improving the precision\nof demand and welfare estimates; and (ii) testing for the existence of a\nwelfare-relevant representative consumer.\n","subjects":["Economics/Theoretical Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"hF2EVFXa5ASLooj2Diy6NRWfFOP4tECObjmL5cuHOuY","pdfSize":"424964","objectId":"0xe92aae62ac17b7e5c8cfcfd576385e9591cc4b976df975bde58de1b1eab32b2f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
