Dash cams are now been used for this purpose which enables\nthe instant identification and understanding of multiple objects and\noccurrences in the surroundings. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for\nobject detection in dashcams using transformers. Our system is based on the\nstate-of-the-art DEtection TRansformer (DETR), which has demonstrated strong\nperformance in a variety of conditions, including different weather and\nillumination scenarios. The use of transformers allows for the consideration of\ncontextual information in decisionmaking, improving the accuracy of object\ndetection. To validate our approach, we have trained our DETR model on a\ndataset that represents real-world conditions. Our results show that the use of\nintelligent automation through transformers can significantly enhance the\ncapabilities of dashcam systems. The model achieves an mAP of 0.95 on\ndetection.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
