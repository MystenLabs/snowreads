We also construct some further physically meaningful properties,\nfor instance the squareability, the toughness, the degree of freedom, and also\nseveral ones of entropic motivation. Metrological multipartite entanglement\ncriteria with the quantum Fisher information fit naturally into this framework.\nHere we formulate these for the depth of squareability, which therefore turns\nout to be the natural choice, leading to stronger bounds than the usual\nentanglement depth. Namely, the quantum Fisher information turns out to provide\na lower bound not only on the maximal size of entangled subsystems, but also on\nthe average size of entangled subsystems for a random choice of elementary\nsubsystems. We also formulate convex criteria for both cases, which are much\nstronger than the original ones. This means that the aforementioned bounds hold\nalso for the average in every decomposition of the quantum state. We also argue\nfor that one-parameter partial entanglement properties bearing entropic meaning\nare more suitable for the purpose of defining metrological bounds.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
