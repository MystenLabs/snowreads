These systems have arbitrary relative degree,\ncompensated by the technique of time-scaling. The resulting approach guarantees\nglobal convergence of the system output to a small neighborhood of the optimum\npoint. To corroborate with the theoretical results, numerical simulations are\npresented considering a system with two inputs and one output, which rapidly\nconverges to the optimal parameters of the objective function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZPY6uad8PMf7XcBDqRqRLyfHW9aQH2Hsz0kKLrUWuN8","pdfSize":"751987","objectId":"0x0ef90273d63de102bf278276a59c92d12d931d8aad836c35fc4c871a5906e944","registeredEpoch":"2","certifiedEpoch":"2","startEpoch":"2","endEpoch":"202"}
