Solving it would benefit many users, as creating\ncomplex 3D assets takes days of manual labor. Many previous works have\nattempted to address this issue, often at the expense of output fidelity, which\nquestions the practicality of such methods.\n  We introduce LumiGauss, a technique that tackles 3D reconstruction of scenes\nand environmental lighting through 2D Gaussian Splatting. Our approach yields\nhigh-quality scene reconstructions and enables realistic lighting synthesis\nunder novel environment maps. We also propose a method for enhancing the\nquality of shadows, common in outdoor scenes, by exploiting spherical harmonics\nproperties. Our approach facilitates seamless integration with game engines and\nenables the use of fast precomputed radiance transfer.\n  We validate our method on the NeRF-OSR dataset, demonstrating superior\nperformance over baseline methods. Moreover, LumiGauss can synthesize realistic\nimages when applying novel environment maps.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"m1i2DJHlYym8xIBz52xCllr0VgYTq4Ujba6-PqNvIds","pdfSize":"35974970"}
