We employ a GPT model as a forecaster to learn\nspatiotemporal precipitation dynamics using tokenized radar images. The\ntokenizer is based on a Quantized Variational Autoencoder featuring a novel\nreconstruction loss tailored for the skewed distribution of precipitation that\npromotes faithful reconstruction of high rainfall rates. The approach produces\nrealistic ensemble forecasts and provides probabilistic outputs with accurate\nuncertainty estimation. The model is trained without resorting to randomness,\nall variability is learned solely from the data and exposed by model at\ninference for ensemble generation. We train and test GPTCast using a 6-year\nradar dataset over the Emilia-Romagna region in Northern Italy, showing\nsuperior results compared to state-of-the-art ensemble extrapolation methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"cndLdvnOCaXIrAuODOH4xnKGTc7QyCZIC1JqPzcdBa4","pdfSize":"5148955"}
