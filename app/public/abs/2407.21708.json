Creating ontologies, however, is a complex and time-consuming\nendeavor. ChEBI is a well-known ontology in the field of chemistry, which\nprovides a comprehensive resource for defining chemical entities and their\nproperties. However, it covers only a small fraction of the rapidly growing\nknowledge in chemistry and does not provide references to the scientific\nliterature. To address this, we propose a methodology that involves augmenting\nexisting annotated text corpora with knowledge from Chebi and fine-tuning a\nlarge language model (LLM) to recognize chemical entities and their roles in\nscientific text. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.\nBy combining ontological knowledge and the language understanding capabilities\nof LLMs, we achieve high precision and recall rates in identifying both the\nchemical entities and roles in scientific literature. Furthermore, we extract\nthem from a set of 8,000 ChemRxiv articles, and apply a second LLM to create a\nknowledge graph (KG) of chemical entities and roles (CEAR), which provides\ncomplementary information to ChEBI, and can help to extend it.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"M3sV98jwgVf_V9RciLct66kFWfbNehx7MtySHIhROgM","pdfSize":"1521298"}
