However, building\nhigh-performance and robust adaptation rules is often a challenge because it\nessentially involves searching the optimal design in a complex (variables)\nspace. In response, this paper attempt to employ large language models (LLMs)\nas a optimizer to construct and optimize adaptation rules, leveraging the\ncommon sense and reasoning capabilities inherent in LLMs. Preliminary\nexperiments conducted in SWIM have validated the effectiveness and limitation\nof our method.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
