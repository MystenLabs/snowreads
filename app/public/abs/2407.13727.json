We provide, for\nthe first time, this high-fidelity cross-correlation maps in order to\nillustrate how much can be learned from them once the cosmic neutrino\nbackground is measured. As cross-correlations will have more signal than\nauto-correlations of the C$_{\\nu}$B itself, these might be the ones to be\nmeasured first by Ptolemy-like experiments. Our predictions thus provide the\nimprint of what massive neutrinos should look like from cosmological\nobservations.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
