In\nparticular, in clean metals we identify skew-scattering and a \"Snap\"\n(third-order derivative of velocity) dominating the Pockels and Kerr EO\nbehavior of metals in the clean limit. Strikingly, we find that both Pockels\nand Kerr EO in metals play critical roles in metallic EO phenomena: for\ninstance, metallic Pockels and Kerr EO effectively compete to produce a\nfield-activated birefringence that is non-reciprocal in applied DC fields.\nSimilarly, both contribute to sizeable field-induced modulations to\ntransmission and reflection across a range of frequencies. We find metallic EO\neffects can be naturally realized in layered 2D materials such as gapped\nbilayer graphene producing pronounced values of EO coefficients in the\nterahertz -- an interesting new metallic platform for terahertz electro-optic\nmodulation.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
