As the antenna scale increases, acquiring CSI\nresults in significantly higher system overhead. In this letter, we propose a\nnovel channel prediction method which utilizes wireless environmental\ninformation with pilot pattern optimization for CSI prediction (WEI-CSIP).\nSpecifically, scatterers around the mobile station (MS) are abstracted from\nenvironmental information using multiview images. Then, an environmental\nfeature map is extracted by a convolutional neural network (CNN). Additionally,\nthe deep probabilistic subsampling (DPS) network acquires an optimal fixed\npilot pattern. Finally, a CNN-based channel prediction network is designed to\npredict the complete CSI, using the environmental feature map and partial CSI.\nSimulation results show that the WEI-CSIP can reduce pilot overhead from 1/5 to\n1/8, while improving prediction accuracy with normalized mean squared error\nreduced to 0.0113, an improvement of 83.2% compared to traditional channel\nprediction methods.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
