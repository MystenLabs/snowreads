The layers are stable on the\nwater surface and can be transferred to a solid substrate to form a multilayer\nfilm. Despite the volatility of the source material, some films can even\nwithstand heating.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
