A biflow (or $2$-commodity flow) in\n$G$ is an assignment $f:\\, {\\cal P}\\rightarrow \\mathbb R_+$ such that $\\sum_{e\n\\in Q \\in {\\cal P}}\\, f(Q) \\le c(e)$ for all $e \\in E$, whose value is defined\nto be $\\sum_{Q \\in {\\cal P}}\\, f(Q)$. A bicut in $G$ is a subset $K$ of $E$\nthat contains at least one edge from each member of ${\\cal P}$, whose capacity\nis $\\sum_{e\\in K}\\, c(e)$. In 1977 Seymour characterized, in terms of forbidden\nstructures, all graphs $G$ for which the max-biflow (integral) min-bicut\ntheorem holds true (that is, the maximum value of an integral biflow is equal\nto the minimum capacity of a bicut for every capacity function $c$); such a\ngraph $G$ is referred to as a Seymour graph. Nevertheless, his proof is not\nalgorithmic in nature. In this paper we present a combinatorial polynomial-time\nalgorithm for finding maximum integral biflows in Seymour graphs, which relies\nheavily on a structural description of such graphs.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
