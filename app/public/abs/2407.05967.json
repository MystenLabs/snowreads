This paper\ningeniously integrates spiral sampling into the Transformer architecture,\nenhancing its ability to leverage mesh topology for superior performance in\nhand mesh reconstruction, resulting in substantial accuracy boosts. STMR\nemploys a single image encoder for model efficiency. To augment its information\nextraction capability, we design the multi-scale pose feature extraction\n(MSPFE) module, which facilitates the extraction of rich pose features,\nultimately enhancing the model's performance. Moreover, the proposed predefined\npose-to-vertex lifting (PPVL) method improves vertex feature representation,\nfurther boosting reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments on the\nFreiHAND dataset demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance and unparalleled\ninference speed of STMR compared with similar backbone methods, showcasing its\nefficiency and effectiveness.
