The\nongoing experimental analysis employs the traditional reaction plane method to\nevaluate the flow coefficients $v_n$ and claims to see isotropic radiation from\nthe thermal quark-gluon plasma. We show in this work, that in the region above\nthe pion mass, the dilepton flow measurement might suffer from cancellation\neffects that mask the complicated underlying dynamics. Contributions from\ndifferent baryonic and mesonic resonances show collective behaviour with\ndifferent signs and lead to an overall vanishing elliptic flow. To\ndifferentiate the different contributions, we propose to employ the scalar\nproduct method, which exploits the previously measured hadronic flow to create\ndifferent reference planes. As a proof of concept, we calculate the $v_2$ of\ndielectrons for Ag+Ag collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{NN}}=2.55$ $\\mathrm{GeV}$ with\nboth methods and investigate the contribution of each source, concluding that\nthe scalar product method provides the proton and pion tagged flow coefficients\nas two distinct measurements, disentangling the various dilepton sources.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yYLDIASzDc-E2OCraQmIwfbLDuIx-5VEF9r2qS3jb0c","pdfSize":"1281828"}
