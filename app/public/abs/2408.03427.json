The proposed approach produces similar outcomes with respect to\nprevious models but with fewer parameters, resulting in an extremely\ninterpretable architecture rooted in the underlying physics of the problem. The\narchitectural novelties arise from three pivotal aspects. Firstly, we employ an\nembedding updating method that is analogous to classical Graph Neural Networks,\ntherefore bridging the classical-quantum gap. Secondly, each layer is devoted\nto capturing interactions of distinct orders, aligning with the physical\nproperties of the system. Lastly, we harness SWAP gates to emulate the\nproblem's inherent symmetry, a novel strategy not found currently in the\nliterature. The obtained results in the considered experiments are encouraging\nto lay the foundation for continued research in this field.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
