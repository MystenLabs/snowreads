Using broadband infrared spectroscopy combined with\ndensity-functional band-structure calculations, we show that optical\nconductivity of RuO$_2$, the bulk probe of its electronic structure, is well\ndescribed by the nonmagnetic model of this material. The sharp Pauli edge\ndemonstrates the presence of a Dirac nodal line lying 45 meV below the Fermi\nlevel. Good match between the experimental and ab initio plasma frequencies\nunderpins weakness of electronic correlations. The intraband part of the\noptical conductivity indicates Fermi-liquid behavior with two distinct\nscattering rates below 150 K. Fermi-liquid theory also accounts for the\ntemperature-dependent magnetic susceptibility of RuO$_2$ and allows a\nconsistent description of this material as paramagnetic metal.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
