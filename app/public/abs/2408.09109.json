Current protocols prioritize\noptimizing individual network parameters, overlooking the necessity for a\nnuanced approach in scenarios with intermittent connectivity, fluctuating\nsignal strength, and varying network densities, ultimately failing to address\naerial network requirements comprehensively. This paper proposes a novel,\nImproved Q-learning-based Multi-hop Routing (IQMR) algorithm for optimal\nUAV-assisted communication systems. Using Q(\\lambda) learning for routing\ndecisions, IQMR substantially enhances energy efficiency and network data\nthroughput. IQMR improves system resilience by prioritizing reliable\nconnectivity and inter-UAV collision avoidance while integrating real-time\nnetwork status information, all in the absence of predefined UAV path planning,\nthus ensuring dynamic adaptability to evolving network conditions. The results\nvalidate IQMR's adaptability to changing system conditions and superiority over\nthe current techniques. IQMR showcases 36.35\\% and 32.05\\% improvements in\nenergy efficiency and data throughput over the existing methods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
