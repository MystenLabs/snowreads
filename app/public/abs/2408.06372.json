We state and prove a tropical version of this reciprocity; the\ntropical ideas lead to yet another transparent ``combinatorial'' proof of the\nclassical Weil reciprocity law. Then, we construct a tropical Weil pairing on\nthe set of divisors of degree zero.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
