For this purpose we describes the set $\\Pi_n$ of all\n$(2n) \\times n$ matrices, consisting of elements of the set $\\mathbb{Z}_n =\\{\n1,2,\\ldots ,n\\}$, such that every row is a permutation. We emphasize the\nrelationship between these matrices and the $n^2 \\times n^2$ Sudoku matrices.\nAn algorithm to obtain random $\\Pi_n$ matrices is presented in this paper.\nSeveral auxiliary algorithms that are related to the underlying problem have\nbeen described. We evaluated all algorithms according to two criteria -\nprobability evaluation, and time for generation of random objects and checking\nof belonging to a specific set. This evaluations are interesting from both\ntheoretical and practical point of view because they are particularly useful in\nthe analysis of computer programs.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics","Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"mtvp_sIz0T91gfpS2Wg6nFafCx7Wtd0AiDhaHuIXQ4c","pdfSize":"190468"}
