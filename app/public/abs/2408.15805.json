The complexity of the disease necessitates\na detailed model of HPV transmission and its progression to cancer; to infer\nproperties of the above we require a careful process that can match to\nimperfect or incomplete observational data. In this paper, we describe the\nHPVsim simulator to satisfy the former requirement; to satisfy the latter we\ncouple this stochastic simulator to a process of emulation and history matching\nusing the R package hmer. With these tools, we are able to obtain a\ncomprehensive collection of parameter combinations that could give rise to\nobserved cancer data, and explore the implications of the variability of these\nparameter sets as it relates to future health interventions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Applications","Statistics/Computation"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nr-Gkvry9kyfdMh9hg5pWwHaTbCotm-fTnl4327UBFE","pdfSize":"10208410"}
