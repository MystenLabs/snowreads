Our approach\npartitions a quantum circuit into a hierarchy of subcircuits and simulates the\nsubcircuits on multi-node GPUs, exploiting available data parallelism while\nminimizing communication costs. To minimize communication costs, we formulate\nan Integer Linear Program that rewards simulation of \"nearby\" gates on \"nearby\"\nGPUs. To maximize throughput, we use a dynamic programming algorithm to compute\nthe subcircuit simulated by each kernel at a GPU. We realize these techniques\nin Atlas, a distributed, multi-GPU quantum circuit simulator. Our evaluation on\na variety of quantum circuits shows that Atlas outperforms state-of-the-art\nGPU-based simulators by more than 2$\\times$ on average and is able to run\nlarger circuits via offloading to DRAM, outperforming other large-circuit\nsimulators by two orders of magnitude.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tSwubtHrkOv-U-9oDS_wzjJ7VULukZDj7mGOYmgtmlE","pdfSize":"2129601"}
