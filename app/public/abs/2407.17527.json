In this model, Ohm's law is generalized to\ninclude the restoring friction force, which aligns the velocity of the shell\nwith the rotational speed of the inner core and outer mantle. Our findings\nreveal that, in this context, Cowling's theorem and the neutral point argument\nare modified, leading to magnetic energy growth for a suitable choice of\ntoroidal flow. The global equilibrium magnetic field that emerges from our\nmodel exhibits a dipolar character.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
