HHLPar is built upon a Hybrid\nHoare Logic for HCSP, which is able to reason about continuous-time properties\nof differential equations, as well as communication and parallel composition of\nparallel HCSP processes with the help of parameterised trace assertions and\ntheir synchronization. The logic was formalised and proved to be sound in\nIsabelle/HOL, which constitutes a trustworthy foundation for the verification\nconducted by HHLPar. HHLPar implements the Hybrid Hoare Logic in Python and\nsupports automated verification: On one hand, it provides functions for\nsymbolically decomposing HCSP processes, generating specifications for separate\nsequential processes and then composing them via synchronization to obtain the\nfinal specification for the whole parallel HCSP processes; On the other hand,\nit is integrated with external solvers for handling differential equations and\nreal arithmetic properties. We have conducted experiments on a simplified\ncruise control system to validate the performance of the tool.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
