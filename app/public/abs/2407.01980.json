To\nthis aim, we obtain a total of 43 OC-DCEPs (including 33 fundamental mode, 9\nfirst overtone mode, and 1 multimode DCEPs.) and calibrate the PWZR as\n$W_G=(-3.356 \\,\\pm\\, 0.033) \\,(\\log{P-1})+(-5.947 \\,\\pm\\, 0.025)+(-0.285\n\\,\\pm\\, 0.064)[\\textrm{Fe/H}]$. The concurrently obtained residual parallax\noffset in OC, $zp = -4\\pm5\\,\\mu\\textrm{as}$, demonstrate the adequacy of the\nparallax corrections within the magnitude range of OC member stars. By\ncomparing the field DCEPs' DR3 parallaxes with their photometric parallaxes\nderived by our PWZR, we estimated the residual parallax offset in field DCEPs\nas $zp = -15\\pm3\\,\\mu\\textrm{as}$. Using our PWZR, we estimate the distance\nmodulus of the Large Magellanic Cloud to be $18.482 \\,\\pm\\, 0.040$ mag, which\naligns well with the most accurate published value obtained through geometric\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Solar and Stellar Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
