This work uses free\nevolution of the formally-singular conformally compactified Einstein equations\nin spherical symmetry. One way to construct gauge conditions suitable for this\napproach relies on building the gauge source functions from a time-independent\nbackground spacetime metric. This background reference metric is set using the\nheight function approach to provide the correct asymptotics of hyperboloidal\nslices of Minkowski spacetime. The present objective is to study the effect of\ndifferent choices of height function on hyperboloidal evolutions via the\nreference metrics used in the gauge conditions. A total of 10 reference metrics\nfor Minkowski are explored, identifying some of their desired features. They\ninclude 3 hyperboloidal layer constructions, evolved with the non-linear\nEinstein equations for the first time. Focus is put on long-term numerical\nstability of the evolutions, including small initial gauge perturbations. The\nresults will be relevant for future (puncture-type) hyperboloidal evolutions,\n3D simulations and the development of coinciding Cauchy and hyperboloidal data,\namong other applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"2tEp5JVrPFAd0jDJPJZVM5yHLS4IodxUNPbPCx0Q-R0","pdfSize":"1072417"}
