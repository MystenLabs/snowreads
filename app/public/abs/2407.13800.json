The equations of continuum mechanics take nontrivial\nforms on curved surfaces. Although the curved surface formulation of the\ncontinuum equations are derived in many excellent references available in the\nliterature, they are not readily usable for solving physical problems due to\nthe covariant, contravariant or mixed nature of the stress and strain tensors\nin the equations. We present the continuum equations in terms of physical\ncomponents in a general differentiable manifold. This general formulation of\nthe continuum equations can be used readily for modelling physical problems on\narbitrary curved surfaces. We demonstrate this with the help of some examples.\n","subjects":["Physics/Classical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"krOW6VIiL9juqeqUQ5rhgH02HlFNNXyupuSbXPuq-uQ","pdfSize":"765110"}
