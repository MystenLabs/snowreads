However, it is also significant even in symmetric\nones, and unveiling its atomic-level origin remains an issue. We use electron\nmicroscopy to propose defect-mediated bulk DMI in Pt/Co/Pt. We find an\nenhancement of the net DMI by increasing sputter gas pressure. The samples have\na compositional gradient, but their compositional asymmetry is weak. Our\nanalysis suggests that the asymmetric distribution of dislocations in the\ncompositional gradient regions generates bulk DMI. Our results indicate the\nimportance of bulk DMI in multilayers and could facilitate the development of\nspintronic devices.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
