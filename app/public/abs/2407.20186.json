However, its\nmeasurements suffer from a contamination from unresolved sources whose\nimportance remains unclear. In this Letter, we propose a novel data-driven\nestimate of the contribution of unresolved leptonic sources based on the\ninformation present in the ATNF and the LHAASO catalogs. We find that in the\ninner Galaxy at most $\\sim60\\%$ of the diffuse flux measured by LHAASO at\n$10\\,\\rm{TeV}$ may originate from unresolved leptonic sources, and this\nfraction drops with energy to less than $20\\%$ at $100\\,\\rm{TeV}$. In the outer\nGalaxy, the contribution of unresolved leptonic sources is always subdominant.\nIt is less than $\\sim 20\\%$ at $10\\,\\rm{TeV}$ and less than $\\sim 8\\%$ above\n$\\sim25\\,\\rm{TeV}$. We conclude that the UHE diffuse background should be\ndominated by photons from a hadronic origin above a few tens of $\\rm{TeV}$.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
