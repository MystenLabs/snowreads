To ensure improvement in\nsuch features, a careful selection of the tilt angles is mandatory. In this\nwork, we present a rigorous analysis of how the force subspace varies with the\ntilt cant angles, namely the tilt angles along the vehicle arms, taking into\naccount gravity compensation and torque decoupling to abide by the hovering\ncondition. Novel metrics are introduced to assess the performance of existing\ntilted platforms, as well as to provide some guidelines for the selection of\nthe tilt cant angle in the design phase.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"Hm8wfOepgX8Gm62PS3ZFfAAFkGxRKiWNS7LZvKJK3nE","pdfSize":"1285325"}
