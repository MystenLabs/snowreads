While attention has been given\nto looking at differences in learning outcomes through comparisons of students'\nend performance, less attention has been given in comparing students'\nengagement patterns between different modalities. In this study, we analyze a\nheterogeneous knowledge graph consisting of students, course videos, formative\nassessments and their interactions to predict student performance via a Graph\nConvolutional Network (GCN). Using students' performance on the assessments, we\nattempt to determine a useful model for identifying at-risk students. We then\ncompare the models generated between 5 on-campus and 2 fully-online MOOC-style\ninstances of the same course. The model developed achieved a 70-90\\% accuracy\nof predicting whether a student would pass a particular problem set based on\ncontent consumed, course instance, and modality.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"IA6Ap_EICVklXSGcruY7KAZMgzAO41yn_oir14AuswM","pdfSize":"595002"}
