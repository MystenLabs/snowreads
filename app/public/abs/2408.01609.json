Fed-RD strategically employs differential privacy and secure\nmultiparty computation to guarantee the privacy of training data. We provide\ntheoretical analysis of the end-to-end privacy of the training algorithm and\npresent experimental results on realistic synthetic datasets. Our results\ndemonstrate that Fed-RD achieves high model accuracy with minimal degradation\nas privacy increases, while consistently surpassing benchmark results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
