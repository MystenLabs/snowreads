Inspired by recent\ndevelopments in model-based output regulation design techniques and in\ndata-driven control design for nonlinear systems, we derive a data-dependent\nsemidefinite program that, when solved, directly returns a controller that\napproximately regulates the tracking error to zero. When specialized to the\ncase of linear systems, the result appears to improve upon existing work.\nNumerical results illustrate the findings.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
