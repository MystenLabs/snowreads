We find excellent prospects for a statistical detection of the\nintensity mapping signal with current and future experiments such as the JWST,\nSPHEREx and CDIM. We also describe the detectability of the signal in\ncross-correlation with the 21-cm emission from atomic hydrogen in the\nintergalactic medium at these redshifts. We find that the cross-correlation\nsignal should be detectable at a significance of a few tens of standard\ndeviations out to $z \\sim 16$ using the above experiments in combination with\nthe Square Kilometre Array (SKA)-LOW and its pathfinder, the Murchison\nWidefield Array (MWA).\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Astrophysics/Astrophysics of Galaxies"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
