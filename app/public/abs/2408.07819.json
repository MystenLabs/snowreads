A key\npoint is to better detect class outliers and class-attribute outliers, which\nonly exist in multi-view data. However, existing methods either is not able to\nreduce the impact of outliers when learning view-consistent information, or\nstruggle in cases with varying neighborhood structures. Moreover, most of them\ndo not apply to partial multi-view data in real-world scenarios. To overcome\nthese drawbacks, we propose a novel method named Regularized Contrastive\nPartial Multi-view Outlier Detection (RCPMOD). In this framework, we utilize\ncontrastive learning to learn view-consistent information and distinguish\noutliers by the degree of consistency. Specifically, we propose (1) An\noutlier-aware contrastive loss with a potential outlier memory bank to\neliminate their bias motivated by a theoretical analysis. (2) A neighbor\nalignment contrastive loss to capture the view-shared local structural\ncorrelation. (3) A spreading regularization loss to prevent the model from\noverfitting over outliers. With the Cross-view Relation Transfer technique, we\ncould easily impute the missing view samples based on the features of\nneighbors. Experimental results on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our\nproposed approach could outperform state-of-the-art competitors under different\nsettings.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"z-1tPRBt6inEiw-gPK1G94UBG9fCxzftb9odmlb--k4","pdfSize":"1990025"}
