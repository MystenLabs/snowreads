In this study, we analyze, simulate, optimize, and compare the\nperformance of two prevalent algorithms used for Information Reconciliation:\nCascade and LDPC codes in combination with the Blind protocol. We focus on\ntheir applicability in practical and industrial settings, operating in\nrealistic and application-close conditions. The results are further validated\nthrough evaluation on a live industrial QKD system.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A7MjBUAR9wpSDhOEHb-XuRP7M6dknd097W9SSv5YTDk","pdfSize":"1550400"}
