This approach offers several\nadvantages, including linearity, unconditional energy stability, and ease of\nimplementation. By introducing scalar auxiliary variables, a modified system\nthat is equivalent to the original system is constructed at the continuous\nlevel. However, during temporal discretization, computational errors can lead\nto a loss of equivalence and accuracy. In this paper, we introduce a new\nConstant Scalar Auxiliary Variable (CSAV) approach in which we derive an\nOrdinary Differential Equation (ODE) for the constant scalar auxiliary variable\nr. We also introduce a stabilization parameter ({\\alpha}) to improve the\nstability of the scheme by slowing down the dynamics of r. The CSAV approach\nprovides additional benefits as well. We explicitly discretize the auxiliary\nvariable in combination with the nonlinear term, enabling the solution of a\nsingle linear system with constant coefficients at each time step. This new\napproach also eliminates the need for assumptions about the free energy\npotential, removing the bounded-from-below restriction imposed by the nonlinear\nfree energy potential in the original SAV approach. Finally, we validate the\nproposed method through extensive numerical simulations, demonstrating its\neffectiveness and accuracy.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
