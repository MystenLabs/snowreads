To accomplish\nour goal, we adopt non-polynomial functions as generalizing terms, namely,\nhyperbolic sine and cosine functions. These functions manifest potential minima\nat $\\phi=0$ in the BPS bound, facilitating the emergence of double-kinks (and\ndouble-antikinks). Moreover, as these functions are modified, the double\nkinks/antikinks may acquire profiles similar to configurations of fields\nresembling double compactons/anti-compactons.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cRLkB0lUe6om_l8czMaSVWcseVrGAMy_TjaovGZPXWc","pdfSize":"2675838"}
