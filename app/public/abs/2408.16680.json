We propose compact optimization models for\nQTSP in mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP), mixed-integer linear\nprogramming (MILP), constraint programming (CP), and domain-independent dynamic\nprogramming (DIDP). Our experimental results demonstrate that the DIDP model\nperforms better than other approaches in optimality gap and solution quality\nwhen the problem size is large enough.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
