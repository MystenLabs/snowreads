This experiment achieved a\nsub-100 DRU (differential-rate-unit, expressed in counts/keV/kg/day) background\nin the MeV region of interest by employing a combination of active and passive\nveto techniques. Such a low background facilitates the search for ALPs with\naxion-photon coupling $g_{a\\gamma \\gamma} > 10^{-6}$ and axion-electron\ncoupling $10^{-8}< g_{aee} < 10^{-4}$ in the 1 keV to 10 MeV mass range. This\nindicates that the experiment has the capability to constrain the unexplored\ncosmological triangle in the ALP-photon parameter space for ALPs in the MeV\nmass range.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GplPMYTybd0rdT4rKAxmPngceFBEWGFfwVwF1zHMiNk","pdfSize":"8091183"}
