However, the richer data sets produced by these\ndetectors will pose new computational, physical and astrophysical challenges,\nnecessitating the development of novel algorithms and data analysis strategies.\nTo aid in these efforts, this paper introduces gwforge, a user-friendly,\nlightweight Python package, to generate mock data for next-generation\ndetectors. We demonstrate the package's capabilities through data simulation\nexamples and highlight a few potential applications: performance loss due to\nforeground noise, bright-siren cosmology and impact of waveform systematics on\nbinary parameter estimation.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"yBCc2AkOHTs2KKpc_tOTtA5Kd6JGe5Z7yf9tukbMQYU","pdfSize":"2494546"}
