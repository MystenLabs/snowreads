However, achieving\nentanglement and verifying that the generated state does not follow the\nprinciple of local causality has proven difficult for spin qubits in\ngate-defined quantum dots, as it requires simultaneously high concurrence\nvalues and readout fidelities to break the classical bound imposed by Bell's\ninequality. Here we employ heralded initialization and calibration via gate set\ntomography (GST), to reduce all relevant errors and push the fidelities of the\nfull 2-qubit gate set above 99 %, including state preparation and measurement\n(SPAM). We demonstrate a 97.17 % Bell state fidelity without correcting for\nreadout errors and violate Bell's inequality with a Bell signal of S = 2.731\nclose to the theoretical maximum of $2\\sqrt{2}$. Our measurements exceed the\nclassical limit even at elevated temperatures of 1.1 K or entanglement\nlifetimes of 100 $\\mu s$.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
