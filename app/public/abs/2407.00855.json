In this work\nwe extend the scope of $\\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ to accommodate Horndeski theories\nwith K-mouflage screening, allowing for the computation of matter power spectra\nin the non-linear regime in these models. We explore the boost of the dark\nmatter power spectrum relative to GR-$\\Lambda$CDM in K-mouflage gravity, and\nalso discuss how large-scale structure computations change between the Einstein\nand Jordan frames. A dissection of the relative contributions of the modified\nbackground, linear growth, fifth force, and the conformal factor (a new\ninclusion to $\\texttt{Hi-COLA}$) to the boost factor is presented. The ability\nof $\\texttt{Hi-COLA}$ to run with general Horndeski models and multiple\nscreening mechanisms makes it an ideal tool for testing gravity with upcoming\ngalaxy survey data.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
