Additionally, it investigates corrections\narising from the breakdown of Lorentz symmetries and the existence of Electric\nDipole Moments (EDM) for leptons. Graphics are constructed to illustrate the\ninfluence of EDM and Lorentz violation on the cross section. Strong magnetic\nfield limit is analyzed. Furthermore, the investigation utilizes experimental\ndata on EDM values to explore the upper limits of the Lorentz violation\nparameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"nVqAPkpt1BK-G9uQ2H2K6i5JRrtrAxjCxFZI1MqbVL4","pdfSize":"775769"}
