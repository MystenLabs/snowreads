Here, we report the integration of V$_{Si}$ centers\nwith a plasmonic nanocavity to Purcell enhance the emission, which is critical\nfor scalable quantum networking. Employing a simple fabrication process, we\ndemonstrate plasmonic cavities that support a nanoscale mode volume and exhibit\nan increase in the spontaneous emission rate with a measured Purcell factor of\nup to 48. In addition to investigating the optical resonance modes, we\ndemonstrate that an improvement in the optical stability of the spin-preserving\nresonant optical transitions relative to the radiation-limited value. The\nresults highlight the potential of nanophotonic structures for advancing\nquantum networking technologies and emphasizes the importance of optimizing\nemitter-cavity interactions for efficient quantum photonic applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
