Traditional deep learning models,\nsuch as long short-term memory (LSTM), enhance beam tracking accuracy however\nare limited by poor robustness and generalization. In this letter, we use large\nlanguage models (LLMs) to improve the robustness of beam prediction. By\nconverting time series data into text-based representations and employing the\nPrompt-as-Prefix (PaP) technique for contextual enrichment, our approach\nunleashes the strength of LLMs for time series forecasting. Simulation results\ndemonstrate that our LLM-based method offers superior robustness and\ngeneralization compared to LSTM-based models, showcasing the potential of LLMs\nin wireless communications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
