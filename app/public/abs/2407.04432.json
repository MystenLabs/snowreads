It is based on adding fresh qubits at each Trotter step, which\nenables a simpler implementation of the dynamics in the extended system. After\neach step, the extra qubits are recycled, so that the whole process accurately\napproximates the correct unitary evolution. A key ingredient of the approach is\nan isometry that maps a simple, diagonal Hamiltonian in the extended system to\nthe original one. We give a procedure to compute this isometry, while\nminimizing the number of extra qubits required. We estimate the error at each\ntime step, as well as the number of gates, which scales as $O(N^2)$, where $N$\nis the number of orbitals. We illustrate our results with two examples: the\nHydrogen chain and the FeMoCo molecule. In the Hydrogen chain we observe that\nthe error scales in the same way as the Trotter error. For FeMoCo, we estimate\nthe number of gates in a fault-tolerant setup.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
