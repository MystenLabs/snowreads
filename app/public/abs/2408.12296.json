Specifically, we consider\nhypothesis tests relying on machine learning, where model selection can\nintroduce a bias towards specific families of new physics signals. We show that\nit is beneficial to combine different tests, characterised by distinct choices\nof hyperparameters, and that performances comparable to the best available test\nare generally achieved while providing a more uniform response to various types\nof anomalies. Focusing on the New Physics Learning Machine, a methodology to\nperform a signal-agnostic likelihood-ratio test, we explore a number of\napproaches to multiple testing, such as combining p-values and aggregating test\nstatistics.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
