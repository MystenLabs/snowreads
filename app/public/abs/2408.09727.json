In this work, we propose a user-independent\nsoftware/hardware system that can quantitatively evaluate the accuracy of a 3D\npointcloud map acquired from LiDAR(-Inertial) SLAM. We introduce a LiDAR target\nthat functions robustly in the outdoor environment, while remaining observable\nby LiDAR. We also propose a software algorithm that automatically extracts\nrepresentative points and calculates the accuracy of the 3D pointcloud map by\nleveraging GPS position data. This methodology overcomes the limitations of the\nmanual selection method, that its result varies between users. Furthermore, two\ndifferent error metrics, relative and absolute errors, are introduced to\nanalyze the accuracy from different perspectives.
