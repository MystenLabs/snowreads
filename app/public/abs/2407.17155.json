However, existing image hiding\nmethods have a serious problem that the hiding and revealing process cannot be\nfully invertible, which results in the revealing network not being able to\nrecover the secret image losslessly, which makes it impossible to\nsimultaneously achieve high fidelity and secure transmission of the secret\nimage in an insecure network environment. To solve this problem,this paper\nproposes a fully invertible image hiding architecture based on invertible\nneural network,aiming to realize invertible hiding of secret images,which is\ninvertible on both data and network. Based on this ingenious architecture, the\nmethod can withstand deep learning based image steganalysis. In addition, we\npropose a new method for enhancing the robustness of stego images after\ninterference during transmission. Experiments demonstrate that the FIIH\nproposed in this paper significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art image\nhiding methods in hiding a single image, and also significantly outperforms\nother state-of-the-art methods in robustness and security.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
