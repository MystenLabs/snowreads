In metastatic prostate\ncancer, two new assays have become available: one that quantifies the number of\ncancer cells circulating in the peripheral blood, and the other a marker of the\naggressiveness of the disease. It is critical to determine the magnitude of the\neffect of these biomarkers on the discrimination of a model-based risk score.\nTo do so, most analysts frequently consider the discrimination of two separate\nsurvival models: one that includes both the new and standard factors and a\nsecond that includes the standard factors alone. However, this analysis is\nultimately incorrect for many of the scale-transformation models ubiquitous in\nsurvival, as the reduced model is misspecified if the full model is specified\ncorrectly. To circumvent this issue, we developed a projection-based approach\nto estimate the impact of the two prostate cancer biomarkers. The results\nindicate that the new biomarkers can influence model discrimination and justify\ntheir inclusion in the risk model; however, the hunt remains for an applicable\nmodel to risk-stratify patients with metastatic prostate cancer.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
