The\npresent article has two purposes. The first one is to develop general theory of\nhomogeneous statistical manifolds. In particular we construct explicit examples\nof homogeneous statistical manifolds of low dimension. The second purpose is to\nclassify $3$-dimensional Lie groups admitting non-trivial conjugate symmetric\nleft invariant statistical structure.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
