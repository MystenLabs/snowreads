Here, we provide full\ndetails on the derivation of the main theorems for general symmetry and for\nconcrete symmetries. Furthermore, we consider a general framework where we have\naccess to a finite set of connected compact unitary subgroups, which includes\nsymmetric local unitary gate sets.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
