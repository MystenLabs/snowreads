This paper\naddresses the challenge of optimizing seed orders fulfillment in a centralized\nwarehouse where orders are processed in waves, taking into account the\nunpredictable arrival of seed stocks and strict order deadlines. We model the\nwave scheduling problem as a Markov decision process and propose an adaptive\nhybrid tree search algorithm that combines Monte Carlo tree search with\ndomain-specific knowledge to efficiently navigate the complex, dynamic\nenvironment of seed distribution. By leveraging historical data and stochastic\nmodeling, our method enables forecast-informed scheduling decisions that\nbalance immediate requirements with long-term operational efficiency. The key\nidea is that we can augment Monte Carlo tree search algorithm with\nproblem-specific side information that dynamically reduces the number of\ncandidate actions at each decision step to handle the large state and action\nspaces that render traditional solution methods computationally intractable.\nExtensive simulations with realistic parameters-including a diverse range of\nproducts, a high volume of orders, and authentic seasonal durations-demonstrate\nthat the proposed approach significantly outperforms existing industry standard\nmethods.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"CqJo28jFdKqLX4fvbDuqj6h2DfGGFoTE3r79SgEHdOk","pdfSize":"925717"}
