It is conjectured that there is a quaternary Legendre\npair for any even $\\ell$. Before, the smallest open case had been $\\ell=28$ and\n$\\ell=38$ was the only length $\\le 60$ resolved before. Here we provide\nconstructions for $\\ell=28,30,32$, and $34$. In parallel and independently,\nJedwab and Pender found a construction of quaternary Legendre pairs of length\n$\\ell=(q-1)/2$ for any prime power $q\\equiv 1\\bmod 4$, which in particular\ncovers $\\ell=30$, $36$, and $40$, so that now $\\ell=42$ is the smallest\nunresolved case.\n  The main new idea of this paper is a way to separate the search for the\nsubsequences along even and odd indices which substantially reduces the\ncomplexity of the search algorithm.\n  In addition, we use Galois theory for cyclotomic fields to derive conditions\nwhich improve the PSD test.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"VXmccpUURqlH5MJaqQrEHfD1Jyko8-hJwD66krgqgZI","pdfSize":"170358"}
