By incorporating\na non-perturbative treatment of the higher-order corrections, we achieve\nconsistent predictions for the Fermi and Gamow-Teller matrix elements, which\nare crucial for determining the triton lifetime. Our results are consistent\nwith earlier theoretical calculations, confirming the robustness of our\napproach. This study marks a significant advancement in the systematic\napplication of NLEFT to nuclear $\\beta$-decay processes, paving the way for\nfuture high-precision calculations in more complex nuclear systems.\nAdditionally, we discuss potential improvements to our approach, including the\nexplicit inclusion of two-pion exchange mechanisms and the refinement of\nthree-nucleon forces. These developments are essential for extending the\napplicability of NLEFT to a broader range of nuclear phenomena, including\nneutrinoless double-$\\beta$ decay.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/Nuclear Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
