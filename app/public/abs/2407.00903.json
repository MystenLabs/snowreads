Among these, Weyl exceptional rings (WER),\nextended from point-like singularities, are particularly interesting.\nTheoretically, a WER was predicted to carry a topological charge with a nonzero\nChern number, but it has not been measured so far. We here investigate this\ntopology in a circuit, where the WER is synthesized with a superconducting\nqubit controllably coupled to a decaying resonator. The high flexibility of the\nsystem enables us to characterize its eigenvectors on different manifolds of\nparameter space. We extract both the quantized Berry phase and Chern number\nfrom these eigenvectors. Furthermore, we demonstrate a topological transition\ntriggered by shrinking the size of the manifold$-$a unique feature of the WER.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
