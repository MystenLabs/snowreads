The external magnetic field breaks time reversal (TR)\nsymmetry, opening the possibility of the scattering of otherwise topologically\nprotected fermionic edge states. The scattering happens to be always an\nover-barrier event, irrespective of the shape of the edge deformation and\nmagnitude of the magnetic field. We use the advanced Pokrovsky-Khalatnikov\nsemiclassical approach, which allows us to obtain analytically both the main\nexponential and pre-exponential factors of the scattering amplitude for wide\nclasses of analytic deformation profiles.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ZrFQkS1_61-p5GjRdESiA8b02RxqlTfbNtEqFC8D8ts","pdfSize":"12885076"}
