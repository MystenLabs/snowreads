It is important to\nunderstand the mechanisms at play and how they are represented in climate\nmodels. In this study we use causal inference to verify whether the proposed\nmechanism for bistability of the subpolar gyre is represented in CMIP6 models.\nIn many models an increase of sea surface salinity leads to a deepening of the\nmixed layer resulting in a cooling of the water at intermediate depth, in line\nwith theory. The feedback from the subsurface temperature through density to\nthe strength of the gyre circulation is more ambiguous, with fewer models\nindicating a significant link. Those that do show a significant link do not\nagree on its sign. One model (CESM2) contains all interactions, with both a\nnegative and delayed positive feedback loop.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
