Our numerical method applies the Laplace transform to the parabolic\nproblem, yielding a modified Helmholtz equation which is solved with a boundary\nintegral method. Returning to the time domain is achieved by quadrature of the\ninverse Laplace transform by deforming along the so-called Talbot contour. We\ndemonstrate the method for various complex geometries formed by disjoint bodies\nof arbitrary shape on which either uniform Dirichlet or Neumann boundary\nconditions are applied. The use of the Laplace transform bypasses constraints\nwith traditional time-stepping methods and allows for integration over the long\nequilibration timescales present in diffusion problems in unbounded domains.\nUsing this method, we demonstrate shielding effects where the complex geometry\nmodulates the dynamics of capture to absorbing sets. In particular, we show\nexamples where geometry can guide diffusion processes to particular absorbing\nsites, obscure absorbing sites from diffusing particles, and even find the\nexits of confining geometries, such as mazes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
