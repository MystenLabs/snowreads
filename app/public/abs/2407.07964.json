We focus in particular on the 0-form\nsymmetry. The gapped domain walls that generate these symmetries are specified\nby boundary conditions for the gauge fields on either side of the wall. We\ninvestigate the fusion rules of these symmetries and their action on other\ntopological defects including the Wilson lines, magnetic fluxes, and gapped\nboundaries. We illustrate these constructions with various novel examples,\nincluding non-invertible electric-magnetic duality symmetry in 3+1d\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory, and non-invertible analogs of electric-magnetic\nduality symmetry in non-Abelian finite group gauge theories. In particular, we\ndiscover topological domain walls that obey Fibonacci fusion rules in 2+1d\ngauge theory with dihedral gauge group of order 8. We also generalize the\nCheshire string defect to analogous defects of general codimensions and gauge\ngroups and show that they form a closed fusion algebra.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Mathematics/Quantum Algebra"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
