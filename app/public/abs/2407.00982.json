In the scheme, the two-level atom is\nmoved through the cavity and driven by a classical field. The atom interacts\ndispersively with the cavity field, which results in a photon-number-dependent\nStark shift. Assuming that the atom enters the cavity in the excited state\n$|{a}\\rangle$, the obtained output cavity field is taken into account. The\nstate vector $|\\psi(t)\\rangle$ describes the entire atom-field system but in\nour work we deal with the statistical aspects of the cavity field only. The\nquantum state that corresponds to the output cavity field is obtained by\ntracing out the atom part from $|{\\psi(t)}\\rangle\\langle{\\psi(t)}|$. Different\nquantum phase properties such as quantum phase distribution, angular $Q$ phase\nfunction, phase dispersion are evaluated for the obtained radiation field. The\nsecond-order correlation function $g^2(0)$, an indirect phase characteristic is\nalso considered.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ArzPSvhGpgoCPlaxMwxk2kfAUYi6UAKgUa7SzD1icBU","pdfSize":"673581"}
