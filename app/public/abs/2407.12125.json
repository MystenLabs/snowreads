An actuator schedule selects, for each time instant,\nwhich control inputs act on the system in that instant. We address the optimal\nscheduling of control inputs under a hard constraint on the number of inputs\nthat can be used at each time. For a sparsely controllable system, we\ncharacterize sparse actuator schedules that make the system controllable, and\nthen devise a greedy selection algorithm that guarantees controllability while\nheuristically providing low control effort. We further show how to enhance our\ngreedy algorithm via Markov chain Monte Carlo-based randomized optimization\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
