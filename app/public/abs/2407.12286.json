As flying drones\nbecome more ubiquitous, their wireless signals will necessitate new wireless\ntechnologies and algorithms to provide robust radio infrastructure while\npreserving radio spectrum usage. A potential solution for this spectrum-sharing\nlocalization challenge is to limit the bandwidth of any transmitter beacon.\nHowever, location signaling with a narrow bandwidth necessitates improving a\nwireless aerial system's ability to filter a noisy signal, estimate the\ntransmitter's location, and self-pilot to improve the location estimate. By\nshowing results through simulation, emulation, and a final drone flight\nexperiment, this work provides an algorithm using a Gaussian process for radio\nsignal estimation and Bayesian optimization for drone automatic guidance. This\nresearch supports advanced radio and aerial robotics applications in critical\nareas such as search-and-rescue, last-mile delivery, and large-scale platform\ndigital twin development.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"cxsqVZ6aK1KVyCbBd_I2Jh3MObyBPrKs926LVhm3ym8","pdfSize":"3478961"}
