Identifying\nmilitary spending shocks, I use local projections to show that a percentage\npoint rise in the military spending share leads to a 1-1.5% rise in total\nemissions, as well as a 1% rise in emission intensity. Using a dynamic\nproduction network model calibrated for the US, I find that a permanent shock\nof the same size would increase total emissions by between 0.36% and 1.81%, and\nemission intensity by between 0.22% and 1.5%. The model indicates that fossil\nfuel and energy-intensive firms experience a considerable expansion in response\nto such a shock, which could create political obstacles for the green\ntransition. Similarly, investment in renewables and green R&D could be crowded\nout by defence spending, further hindering the energy transition. Policymakers\ncan use carbon prices or green subsidies to counteract these effects, the\nlatter likely being more efficient due to political and social constraints.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Of3SpfIV_O3mjPsXfxpxSs2cELn1hlFQc0RpzqoAhbs","pdfSize":"1426958"}
