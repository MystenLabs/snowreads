Our pion analysis uses a\nstate-of-the-art statistical methodology that accounts for the epistemic\nuncertainty. Fant\\^omas4QCD, designed to handle multiple functional forms for\nsolving the inverse problem, systematically explores a variety of solutions for\nPDFs, thereby improving estimates of epistemic uncertainty. Through this novel\napproach, we interpret our results for the valence sector, considering various\nnon-perturbative methods available for predicting the pion PDF. We emphasize\nthe distinctions between (global) QCD analyses and QFT-based calculations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
