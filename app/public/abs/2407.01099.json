Here we propose the Gemini dark matter model, which contains a heavy\nmother particle $\\chi_3$ and two twins $\\chi_{1/2}$ which are almost degenerate\nin mass and are produced at the same time. The dark sector is charged under the\nsame Froggatt-Nielsen symmetry that can explain the hierarchy of the Standard\nmodel Yukawa couplings. The slightly heavier $\\chi_2$ decays into $\\chi_1$ and\nthe axionic component of the flavon, which washes out the small scale structure\nand resolves $S_8/\\sigma_8$ tension. We present the production mechanism of\nGemini dark matter and viable parameter regions. We find that despite the\npreferred dark matter mass being $\\mathcal{O}(1)$--$\\mathcal{O}(100)$ keV, they\nconstitute cold dark matter. The Gemini dark matter model predicts an abundance\nof dark radiation that will be probed in future measurements of the CMB.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
