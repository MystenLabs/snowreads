In particular, we rigorously demonstrate\nthe existence and uniqueness of solutions using the Sobolev space theory based\non a variational approach. Deriving $L^2$-contraction estimates, we show that\nthe error, defined as the mean square of the differences between the true\nsolution and our trial function at the sample points, is dominated by the\ntraining loss. Furthermore, we show that as the quantities of the coefficients\nfor the differential equation increase, the error-to-loss ratio rapidly\ndecreases. Our theoretical and experimental results confirm the robustness of\nthe error regardless of the quantities of the coefficients.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
