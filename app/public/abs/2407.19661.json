Using negativity as the\nentanglement measure, we study the entanglement dynamics of the system. The\ncalculations show that in cases where the entanglement decays quickly, the\nenvironment will have a quantum phase transition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
