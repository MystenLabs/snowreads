In this work, we take $A,\nB$ in the Banach subalgebra ${\\mathcal A}$ with the spectra of $A$ and $B$ in\nthe Banach algebra ${\\mathcal B}$ being disjoint, and show that the operator\nSylvester equation $ BX-XA=Q$ has a unique solution $X\\in {\\mathcal A}$ for\nevery $Q\\in {\\mathcal A}$. Under the additional assumptions that ${\\mathcal B}$\nis the operator algebra ${\\mathcal B}(H)$ on a complex Hilbert space $H$ and\nthat $A$ and $B$ are normal in ${\\mathcal B}(H)$, an explicit norm estimate for\nthe solution $X$ of the above operator Sylvester equation is provided. In this\nwork, the above conclusion on norm control is also discussed for Banach\nsubalgebras of localized infinite matrices and integral operators.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
