By employing the Lorentz-Drude model, we analyze theoretically and\nvia numerical simulation the effects of periodic modulation of dispersion\nparameters, revealing the emergence of hybrid bandgaps from interaction of\npolaritonic branches with unique characteristics. Our study demonstrates that\ndispersive PTCs offer novel excitation channels and amplification\npossibilities, that require lower modulation frequencies compared to\nnon-dispersive systems thus alleviating experimental challenges for the\nrealization of PTCs in the optical regime. These findings pave the way for\nadvancements in polaritonic lasing and resonant Raman scattering.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
