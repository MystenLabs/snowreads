Causal\ndiscovery, in contrast, aims to uncover causal relationships among multiple\nvariables in a data-driven manner, by investigating statistical associations\nrather than relying on predefined causal structures. This approach, more common\nin computer science, seeks to understand causality in an entire system of\nvariables, which can be visualized by causal graphs. This survey provides an\nintroduction to key concepts, algorithms, and applications of causal discovery\nfrom the perspectives of economics and social sciences. It covers fundamental\nconcepts like d-separation, causal faithfulness, and Markov equivalence,\nsketches various algorithms for causal discovery, and discusses the back-door\nand front-door criteria for identifying causal effects. The survey concludes\nwith more specific examples of causal discovery, e.g. for learning all\nvariables that directly affect an outcome of interest and/or testing\nidentification of causal effects in observational data.\n","subjects":["Economics/Econometrics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
