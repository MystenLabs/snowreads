Often the tasks arrive dynamically while the service providers\nremain static. Preventing task rejection caused by service provider overload is\nof utmost significance. To ensure a positive experience in relevant\napplications for both service providers and tasks, fairness must be considered.\nTo address the issue, we model the problem as an online matching within a\nbipartite graph and tackle two minimax problems: one focuses on minimizing the\nhighest waiting time of a task, while the other aims to minimize the highest\nworkload of a service provider. We show that the second problem can be\nexpressed as a linear program and thus solved efficiently while maintaining a\nreasonable approximation to the objective of the first problem. We developed\nnovel methods that utilize the two minimax problems. We conducted extensive\nsimulation experiments using real data and demonstrated that our novel\nheuristics, based on the linear program, performed remarkably well.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
