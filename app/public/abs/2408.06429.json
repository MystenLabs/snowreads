Inpainting, which is used to remove objects or fill in\nparts of an image, serves as a powerful tool for both image restoration and\nforgery. This paper introduces a novel approach for detecting image inpainting\nforgeries by combining DT-CWT with Hierarchical Feature segmentation and with\nnoise inconsistency analysis. The DT-CWT offers several advantages for this\ntask, including inherent shift-invariance, which makes it robust to minor\nmanipulations during the inpainting process, and directional selectivity, which\nhelps capture subtle artifacts introduced by inpainting in specific frequency\nbands and orientations. By first applying color image segmentation and then\nanalyzing for each segment, noise inconsistency obtained via DT-CW we can\nidentify patterns indicative of inpainting forgeries. The proposed method is\nevaluated on a benchmark dataset created for this purpose and is compared with\nexisting forgery detection techniques. Our approach demonstrates superior\nresults compared with SOTA in detecting inpainted images.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
