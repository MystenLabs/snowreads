We\npropose a generative model for point clouds that employs an attention-based\naggregation while preserving a linear computational complexity with respect to\nthe number of points. The model is trained in an adversarial setup, ensuring\ninput permutation equivariance and invariance for the generator and critic,\nrespectively. To stabilize known unstable adversarial training, a feature\nmatching loss is introduced. We evaluate the performance on two different\ndatasets. The former is the top-quark \\textsc{JetNet150} dataset, where the\nmodel outperforms the current state-of-the-art GAN-based model, despite having\nsignificantly fewer parameters. The latter is dataset 2 of the CaloChallenge,\nwhich comprises point clouds with up to $30\\times$ more points compared to the\nfirst dataset.
