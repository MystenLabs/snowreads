Consequently, these\nmeasures inadequately capture the human color perception of misaligned image\npairs, which are prevalent in digital photography (e.g., the same scene\ncaptured by different smartphones). In this paper, we describe a perceptual CD\nmeasure based on the multiscale sliced Wasserstein distance, which facilitates\nefficient comparisons between non-local patches of similar color and structure.\nThis aligns with the modern understanding of color perception, where color and\nstructure are inextricably interdependent as a unitary process of perceptual\norganization. Meanwhile, our method is easy to implement and training-free.\nExperimental results indicate that our CD measure performs favorably in\nassessing CDs in photographic images, and consistently surpasses competing\nmodels in the presence of image misalignment. Additionally, we empirically\nverify that our measure functions as a metric in the mathematical sense, and\nshow its promise as a loss function for image and video color transfer tasks.\nThe code is available at https://github.com/real-hjq/MS-SWD.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
