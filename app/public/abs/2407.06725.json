We study such\na system, Algorand, from a process execution perspective. Algorand promises low\ntransaction fees and fast finality. However, Algorand's cost structure differs\ngreatly from previous generation blockchains, rendering earlier cost models for\nblockchain-based process execution non-applicable. We discuss and contrast\nAlgorand's novel cost structure with Ethereum's well-known cost model. To study\nthe impact for process execution, we present a compiler for BPMN\nChoreographies, with an intermediary layer, which can support multi-platform\noutput, and provide a translation to TEAL contracts, the smart contract\nlanguage of Algorand. We compare the cost of executing processes on Algorand to\nprevious work as well as traditional cloud computing. In short: they allow vast\ncost benefits. However, we note a multitude of future research challenges that\nremain in investigating and comparing such results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
