This function takes values in an\nadelic completed group ring and interpolates all the hypergeometric functions\nof the same type over all finite fields. It specializes at the unit argument to\nthe adelic beta function of Ihara and Anderson. We prove some transformation\nformulas and a summation formula for the adelic hypergeometric function, which\nare known classically for complex hypergeometric functions.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory","Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
