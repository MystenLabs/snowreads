The\nspontaneous breaking of continuous time translation symmetry leads to a novel\nstate of matter named continuous time crystal (CTC). It exhibits periodic\noscillation without the need for periodic driving, and the relative phases for\nrepetitively realized oscillations are random. However, the mechanism behind\nthe spontaneous symmetry breaking in CTCs, particularly the random phases,\nremains elusive. Here we propose and experimentally realize two types of CTCs\nbased on distinct mechanisms: manifold topology and near-chaotic motion. We\nobserve both types of CTCs in thermal atomic ensembles by artificially\nsynthesizing spin-spin nonlinear interactions through a measurement-feedback\nscheme. Our work provides general recipes for the realization of CTCs, and\npaves the way for exploring CTCs in various systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
