The result is a Yes/No certificate. We\nillustrate how the method can be useful in obtaining less conservative linear\nenclosures for nonlinear systems.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
