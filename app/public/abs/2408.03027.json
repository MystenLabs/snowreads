Then we\napply this construction to proofs of non-liftability of candidate\nnon-Fourier-Mukai functors, i.e.\\ functors that do not admit an\n$\\mathcal{A}_\\infty$/$\\mathrm{dg}$-lift. This approach allows explicit\ncomputation of the obstruction against an $\\mathcal{A}_\\infty$-lift. We in\nparticular observe that this computation gives for smooth degree $d>2$\nhypersurfaces an abundance of non-Fourier-Mukai functors.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Commutative Algebra","Mathematics/Category Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
