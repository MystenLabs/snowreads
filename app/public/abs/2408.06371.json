In either zone, inhomogeneities in the wave field caused\nby shoaling, crossing seas or current interactions disturb wave statistics,\nincreasing rogue wave probability and magnitude. Such amplification of the\nfrequency of rogue waves and their intensity, i.e. the maximum normalized\nheight, have been attested in numerical simulations and laboratory studies, in\nparticular for wave-current interactions. In this study, we investigate the\neffect of the current intensity and direction on rogue wave probability, by\nanalyzing long-term observations from the southern North Sea. We observe that\nthe amplification is similar for opposing and following currents. Despite the\nsea states being dominantly broad-banded and featuring a large directional\nspread, anomalous statistics are of the same order of magnitude as those\nobserved in unidirectional laboratory experiments for stationary currents.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atmospheric and Oceanic Physics","Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
