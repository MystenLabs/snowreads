The\ndynamics of a single point vortex are governed by a Hamiltonian system, with\nmost of its energy levels corresponding to time-periodic motion. We show that\nfor the single point vortex, under certain non-degeneracy conditions, it is\npossible to desingularize most of these trajectories into time-periodic\nconcentrated vortex patches. We provide concrete examples of these\nnon-degeneracy conditions, which are satisfied by a broad class of domains,\nincluding convex ones. The proof uses Nash-Moser scheme and KAM techniques, in\nthe spirit of the recent work of Hassainia-Hmidi-Masmoudi on the leapfrogging\nmotion, combined with complex geometry tools. Additionally, we employ a vortex\nduplication mechanism to generate synchronized time-periodic motion of multiple\nvortices. This approach can be, for instance, applied to desingularize the\nmotion of two symmetric dipoles (with four vortices) in a disc or a rectangle.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first result showing the existence of non-rigid\ntime-periodic motion for Euler equations in generic simply-connected bounded\ndomain. This answers an open problem that has been pointed in the literature,\nfor example by Bartsch-Sacchet.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/"}
