More precisely, we show that solutions to the Einstein vacuum\nequations with positive cosmological constant arising from data on a cylinder\nthat is uniformly close to the Kerr de Sitter geometry (with possibly different\nmass and angular momentum parameters at either end) are future geodesically\ncomplete and display asymptotically de Sitter-like degrees of freedom. The\nproof uses an ADM formulation of the Einstein equations in parabolic gauge.\nTogether with a well-known theorem of Hintz-Vasy [Acta Math. 220 (2018)], our\nresult yields a global stability result for Kerr de Sitter from Cauchy data on\na spacelike hypersurface bridging two black hole exteriors.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Analysis of PDEs","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
