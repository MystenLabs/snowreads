However, the\nmain applications of computer vision in video processing have focused on\ndetection of relatively simple actions while complex events such as violence\ndetection have been comparatively less investigated. This study focuses on the\nbenchmarking of various deep learning techniques on a complex dataset. Next, a\nlarger dataset is utilized to test the uplift from increasing volume of data.\nThe dataset size increase from 500 to 1,600 videos resulted in a notable\naverage accuracy improvement of 6% across four models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"2kp3qwd3rc0MF-1Yv2J236CZIkuVUEh63zEw-ZUzWRU","pdfSize":"677414"}
