One possibility of\nclassification of these physics-based models is their level of geometric\nresolution, including three-dimensionally resolved models and geometrically\nhomogenized models, known as Doyle-Fuller-Newman or pseudo two-dimensional\nmodels. Within this study, the advantages and drawbacks of these two types of\nmodels are identified within a wide range of the design parameter values.\nTherefore, the sensitivity of an output quantity of the models on one or a\ncombination of parameters is compared. In particular, the global sensitivity,\ni.e., the sensitivity in a wide range of parameter values, is computed by using\nthe Sobol indices as a measure. Furthermore, the local sensitivity of the\ndifference in the output quantities of both models is evaluated to identify\nregions of parameter values in which they contain significant deviations.\nFinally, remarks on the potential interplay between both models to obtain fast\nand reliable results are given.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Chemical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
