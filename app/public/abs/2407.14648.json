These charged pion scattering events can be an\nadditional irreducible source of exotic particles which couple to photons or\nhadrons. We analyze the sensitivity of the DUNE Near Detector complex to\nmillicharged particles (MCPs) and heavy axion-like particles (ALPs) with\nlow-energy couplings to gluons. Using the framework of chiral perturbation\ntheory, we demonstrate regimes of parameter space where the charged pion\nproduction channel dominates over previously-considered production mechanisms\nfor both MCPs and ALPs, thereby improving the sensitivity of DUNE to these new\nparticles compared to previous studies.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
