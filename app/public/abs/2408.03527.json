The\nextended deformations of convex polyhedra arise from parallel translations of\ngiven half-spaces and hyperplanes, whose normal vectors give rise to the\nso-called ``derived arrangement'' proposed by Rota as well as Crapo in\ndifferent forms. We show that two extended deformations of convex polyhedra are\nnormally (combinatorially, as a consequence) equivalent if they are\nparameterized by the same open face of the derived arrangement. Note that these\nextended deformations are based on parallel translations of the given\nhyperplanes. It allows us to study three deformations of real hyperplane\narrangements: parallel translations, conings, and elementary lifts, whose\nconfiguration spaces are parameterized by open faces of the derived\narrangement. Consequently, it gives a characterization of the normal,\ncombinatorial, and sign equivalences of those three deformations via the\nderived arrangement. Additionally, the relationships among these three\nequivalence relations are discussed, and several new descriptions of real\nderived arrangements associated with faces and sign vectors of real hyperplane\narrangements are provided.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
