A primary\nchallenge in this space is constructing a training databse of sufficient size\nand diversity. Our method relies on a small number of starting data points, and\nprovides a recipe to interpolate systematically between them, generating an\narbitrary number of samples at the desired quality. We test this strategy using\na realistic automotive geometry, and demonstrate that convolutional neural\nnetworks perform exceedingly well at predicting drag coefficients and surface\npressures. Promising results are obtained in testing extrapolation performance.\nOur method can be applied to other problems of aerodynamic shape optimization.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
