The system is investigated by low-temperature heat capacity\nas well as by DC and AC magnetization. While the system does not show a\nlong-range magnetic order down to at least $T = 280$~mK, we observe signatures\nof slow spin dynamics, magnetic field induced relaxation processes at\nrelatively high temperatures, and a spin-frozen state below $T = 0.6$~K. Our\nresults suggest that similar to the canonical spin ice systems\nHo$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ [Ehlers 2004] and Dy$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ [Snyder 2001], spin\nfreezing in Ho$_2$Zr$_2$O$_7$ is preceded by two slow spin relaxation\nprocesses; the first forms a field-induced region extending to at least 18~K\nand the second is rather field-independent and appears at $T_{\\mathrm g2} =\n1$~K [Ramon 2020].\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"1oG0eW4l6i-wDRa-qdgygb_51K3XRB4CuA2lyAFjhTY","pdfSize":"2678414"}
