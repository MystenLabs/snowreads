GLINT is effectively a testbed for more stable,\ncompact, and modular instruments for the era of 30m-class telescopes. GLINT is\nnow undergoing an upgrade with a new photonic chip for more achromatic nulls,\nand for phase information to enable fringe tracking. Here we provide an\noverview of the motivations for the GLINT project and report on the design of\nthe new chip, the on-site installation, and current status.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Instrumentation and Methods for Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
