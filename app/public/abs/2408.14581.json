Since Gentzen's proof of the cut-elimination theorem\nfor the system $\\mathbf{LK}$, several other proofs have been proposed. Even\nthough the techniques of these proofs can be modified to sequent systems other\nthan $\\mathbf{LK}$, they are essentially of a very particular nature; each of\nthem describes an algorithm to transform a given proof to a cut-free proof.\nHowever, due to its reliance on heavy syntactic arguments and case\ndistinctions, such an algorithm makes the fundamental structure of the argument\nrather opaque. We, therefore, consider rules abstractly, within the framework\nof logical structures familiar from universal logic \\`a la Jean-Yves B\\'eziau,\nand aim to clarify the essence of the so-called ``elimination theorems''. To do\nthis, we first give a non-algorithmic proof of the cut-elimination theorem for\nthe propositional fragment of $\\mathbf{LK}$. From this proof, we abstract the\nessential features of the argument and define something called ``normal sequent\nstructures'' relative to a particular rule. We then prove a version of the\nrule-elimination theorem for these. Abstracting even more, we define ``abstract\nsequent structures'' and show that for these structures, the corresponding\nversion of the ``rule''-elimination theorem has a converse as well.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Logic"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
