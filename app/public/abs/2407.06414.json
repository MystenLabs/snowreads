Experiments on Alcator C-Mod observed pedestal\ndegradation and loss in confinement below a critical value of net power\ncrossing the separatrix, $P_\\mathrm{net} = P_\\mathrm{net}^\\mathrm{crit} \\approx\n2.3$ MW. New analysis of ionization and particle flux profiles reveal\nsaturation of the pedestal electron density, $n_{e}^\\mathrm{ped}$ despite\ncontinuous increases in ionization throughout the pedestal, inversely related\nto $P_\\mathrm{net}$. A limit to the pedestal $\\nabla n_{e}$ emerges as the\nparticle flux, $\\Gamma_{D}$ continues to grow, implying increases in the\neffective particle diffusivity, $D_\\mathrm{eff}$. This is well-correlated with\nthe separatrix collisionality, $\\nu^{*}_\\mathrm{sep}$ and a turbulence control\nparameter, $\\alpha_{t}$, implying a possible transition in type of turbulence.\nThe transition is well correlated with the experimentally observed value of\n$P_\\mathrm{net}^\\mathrm{crit}$. SOLPS-ITER modeling is performed for select\ndischarges from the power scan, constrained with experimental electron and\nneutral densities, measured at the outer midplane. The modeling confirms\ngeneral growth in $D_\\mathrm{eff}$, consistent with experimental findings, and\nadditionally suggests even larger growth in $\\chi_{e}$ at the same\n$P_\\mathrm{net}^\\mathrm{crit}$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Plasma Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
