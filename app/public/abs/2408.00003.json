We examine two premium principles based on\nreported and settled claims, using recursively computable finite-time ruin\nprobabilities to evaluate the performance of time-varying premiums. Our\nfindings suggest that, under specific assumptions, a higher probability of\nby-claim settlement delays leads to lower ruin probabilities. Moreover, a\nstronger correlation between main claims and their associated by-claims results\nin higher ruin probabilities. Lastly, the premium adjustment principles based\non settled claims experience contribute to higher ruin probabilities compared\nto those based on reported claims experience, assuming all other factors remain\nconstant. Notably, this difference becomes more pronounced when there is a high\nlikelihood of by-claim delays.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Risk Management","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
