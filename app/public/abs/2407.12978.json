The\nactuator was embedded in an infant-scale test rig featuring two degrees of\nfreedom: an actuated revolute joint supporting shoulder abduction/adduction and\na passive (but lockable) revolute joint supporting elbow flexion/extension.\nIntegrated load cells and an encoder within the rig were used to measure the\nforce applied by the actuator and the shoulder joint angle, respectively. The\nactuator's performance was evaluated under various anchoring points and elbow\njoint angles. Experimental results demonstrate that optimal performance,\ncharacterized by maximum range of motion and minimal force applied on the torso\nand upper arm, can be achieved when the actuator is anchored at two-thirds the\nlength of the upper arm, with the elbow joint positioned at a 90-degree angle.\nThe force versus pressure and joint angle graphs reveal nonlinear and\nhysteresis behaviors. The findings of this study yield insights about optimal\nanchoring points and elbow angles to minimize exerted forces without reducing\nthe range of motion.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
