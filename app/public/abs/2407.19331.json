In this paper, we investigate the impact of such\npersonalization techniques on the group fairness of the learned models, and\nshow that personalization can also lead to improved (local) fairness as an\nunintended benefit. We begin by illustrating these benefits of personalization\nthrough numerical experiments comparing two classes of personalized FL\nalgorithms (clustering and fine-tuning) against a baseline FedAvg algorithm,\nelaborating on the reasons behind improved fairness using personalized FL, and\nthen providing analytical support. Motivated by these, we further propose a\nnew, Fairness-aware Federated Clustering Algorithm, Fair-FCA, in which clients\ncan be clustered to obtain a (tuneable) fairness-accuracy tradeoff. Through\nnumerical experiments, we demonstrate the ability of Fair-FCA to strike a\nbalance between accuracy and fairness at the client level.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
