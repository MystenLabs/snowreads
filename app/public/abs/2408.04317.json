They guide distribution of\nresponsibilities, planning, or expectations. However, with the technological\nprogress, project archetypes may become outdated, ineffective, or\ncounterproductive by impeding more adequate approaches. Understanding\narchetypes of software development projects is core to leverage their\npotential. The development of applications using machine learning and\nartificial intelligence provides a context in which existing archetypes might\noutdate and need to be questioned, adapted, or replaced. We analyzed 36\ninterviews from 21 projects between IBM Watson and client companies and\nidentified four project archetypes members initially used to understand the\nprojects. We then derive a new project archetype, cognitive computing project,\nfrom the interviews. It can inform future development projects based on\nAI-development platforms. Project leaders should proactively manage project\narchetypes while researchers should investigate what guides initial\nunderstandings of software projects.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Software Engineering"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
