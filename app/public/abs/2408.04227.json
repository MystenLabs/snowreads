This paper introduces a Physical Prior Guided\nCooperative Learning (P2GCL) framework to jointly enhance atmospheric\nturbulence strength estimation and infrared image restoration. P2GCL involves a\ncyclic collaboration between two models, i.e., a TMNet measures turbulence\nstrength and outputs the refractive index structure constant (Cn2) as a\nphysical prior, a TRNet conducts infrared image sequence restoration based on\nCn2 and feeds the restored images back to the TMNet to boost the measurement\naccuracy. A novel Cn2-guided frequency loss function and a physical constraint\nloss are introduced to align the training process with physical theories.\nExperiments demonstrate P2GCL achieves the best performance for both turbulence\nstrength estimation (improving Cn2 MAE by 0.0156, enhancing R2 by 0.1065) and\nimage restoration (enhancing PSNR by 0.2775 dB), validating the significant\nimpact of physical prior guided cooperative learning.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Image and Video Processing","Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SJ89DvTCTguFVx_AV6ljvLheK8eBRBsCI9THC2n1Tg8","pdfSize":"1924916"}
