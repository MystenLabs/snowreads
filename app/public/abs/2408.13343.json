It emphasizes user-friendliness, stability, scalability, high\nthroughput, and low latency. The software includes features such as an online\nwaveform scope, scalar panel, and real-time single spectrum display for each\ninput channel, along with an online event builder and analyzer capable of\ngenerating 1D and 2D histograms and applying graphical cuts. Users can also\ncreate and integrate custom online analyzers to meet specific experimental\nrequirements. FSUDAQ has been successfully tested at the John D. Fox Laboratory\nat FSU, including with the Encore, ANASEN, and Super-Enge Split-Pole\nSpectrograph experiments. In terms of performance, FSUDAQ can handle up to\napproximately 500k triggers per second per channel without waveform recording,\nor data rates of around 65 MB/s per optical fiber, with or without waveform\nrecording.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"8Wez-2ARycYWzqxZI3U9n7i7MSEhhG8PilwW7yiiN1I","pdfSize":"5113898"}
