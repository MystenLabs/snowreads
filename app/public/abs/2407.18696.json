However, the\nimaging distance of an OAM hologram is typically inflexible and determined by\nthe focal length of the Fourier transform lens placed behind the hologram.\nHere, 3D orbital angular momentum holography is proposed and implemented. The\nFourier transform between the holographic plane and imaging plane is performed\nby superimposing Fresnel zone plates (FZP) onto the computer-generated\nholograms (CGH). The CGH is binarized and fabricated on the birefringence\nlithium niobate crystal by femtosecond laser micromachining. Experimental\nverification demonstrates the feasibility of the encoding method. Moreover, by\nsuperimposing FZPs with different focal lengths into various OAM channels,\nOAM-multiplexing holograms are constructed. Target images are separately\nprojected to different planes, thereby enabling 3D multi-plane holographic\nimaging with low crosstalk. The interval between adjacent imaging planes can be\nuniform and minimal, free from depth of field constraints, thus achieving high\nlongitudinal resolution. This work achieves OAM holography in a more compact\nmanner and further expands its applicability.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
