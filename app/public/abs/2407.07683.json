By considering\nclimate and linguistic baselines, we improve the accuracy of weather-related\nsentiment analysis. Our findings show that emotional responses to weather are\ncomplex, influenced by combinations of weather variables and regional language\ndifferences. The results highlight the importance of context-sensitive methods\nfor better understanding public mood in response to weather, which can enhance\nimpact-based forecasting and risk communication in the context of climate\nchange.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
