Here, I introduce biorecap, an R package that retrieves and\nsummarizes bioRxiv preprints using a large language model (LLM) running locally\non nearly any commodity laptop. biorecap leverages the ollamar package to\ninterface with the Ollama server and API endpoints, allowing users to prompt\nany local LLM available through Ollama. The package follows tidyverse\nconventions, enabling users to pipe the output of one function as input to\nanother. Additionally, biorecap provides a single wrapper function that\ngenerates a timestamped CSV file and HTML report containing short summaries of\nrecent preprints published in user-configurable subject areas. By combining the\nstrengths of LLMs with the flexibility and security of local execution,\nbiorecap represents an advancement in the tools available for managing the\ninformation overload in modern scientific research. The biorecap R package is\navailable on GitHub at https://github.com/stephenturner/biorecap under an\nopen-source (MIT) license.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Biology/Other Quantitative Biology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"gMFMTN3HRtzJVKMidcrRILvlWEKRJp52---u9IwA5rs","pdfSize":"272555"}
