Recent works demonstrate that\nconvolutional neural networks are susceptible to adversarial examples - where\nthe input images look similar to the natural images but are classified\nincorrectly by the model. To provide a rebuttal to this problem, we propose a\nnew method to build robust deep neural networks against adversarial attacks by\nreformulating the saddle point optimization problem in \\cite{madry2017towards}.\nOur proposed method offers significant resistance and a concrete security\nguarantee against multiple adversaries. The goal of this paper is to act as a\nstepping stone for a new variation of deep learning models which would lead\ntowards fully robust deep learning models.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"D_npsloy5ogshcS_dHsfTrIAxZ93faRLpGQX0KbEcjk","pdfSize":"5564846"}
