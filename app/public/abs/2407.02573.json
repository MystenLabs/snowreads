These gravitational\ninteractions can be used to constrain their allowed parameter space. However,\nEDOs can have different formation mechanisms, sizes, and shapes, requiring a\ncase-by-case analysis when studying their impact on different areas of\ncosmology. We thus present a repository of all available bounds for these\nobjects, with a code that allows plotting user-defined combinations of all\nup-to-date bounds for a given shape and different radii. We propose a standard\nfor the EDOs' mass profiles so that different sets of bounds are consistent\nwith each other, and provide instructions on using the code and contributing to\nthe repository.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
