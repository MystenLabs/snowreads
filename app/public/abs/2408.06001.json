Here, we leverage the layered\nnature of hBN to directly measure the quantum efficiency (QE) of single\nB-centres. The defects were engineered in a 35 nm flake of hBN using electron\nbeam irradiation, and the local dielectric environment was altered by\ntransferring a 250 nm hBN flake on top of the one containing the emitters. By\nanalysing the resulting change in measured lifetimes, we determined the QE of\nB-centres in the thin flake of hBN, as well as after the transfer. Our results\nindicate that B-centres located in thin flakes can exhibit QEs higher than 40%.\nNear-unity QEs are achievable under reasonable Purcell enhancement for emitters\nembedded in thick flakes of hBN, highlighting their promise for quantum\nphotonics applications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
