The\nfields of the theory are the gauge potential in the adjoint and a scalar in the\nfundamental representation of the Lorentz group, a metric tensor then emerging\nas a composite field in a symmetry-broken phase. Three distinct such phases of\nthe theory are considered. In an SO(3) phase, the fundamental field is\nidentified with a generalised Painlev\\'e-Gullstrand-Lema\\^itre coordinate time.\nIn the static spherically symmetric case it is a stealth scalar, and the\ngeneral vacuum solution is then parameterised by two constants, one related to\nthe black hole mass and the other to an observer. Also, formulations of\npregeometric first order electromagnetism are considered in order to construct\na consistent realisation of a charged black hole. In an SO(1,2) phase of the\ntheory, the Schwarzschild solution is realised as a configuration wherein the\nfundamental field is real outside and imaginary inside the horizon. In this\nphase the field can be associated with an effective radial pressure resulting\nin additional singularities and asymptotic non-flatness. Finally, a\nsymmetry-broken phase which would correspond to solutions in an alternative\nattempt at a Lorentz gauge theory is shown to be incompatible with black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
