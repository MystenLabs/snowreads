This result has\nstrong implications for the complexity of simulating many-body systems using\nvariational tensor network methods. For every phase in the phase diagram, the\ndual representation of the ground state that breaks all symmetries minimises\nboth the entanglement entropy and the required number of variational\nparameters. We demonstrate the applicability of this idea by developing a\ngeneralised density matrix renormalisation group algorithm that works on (dual)\nconstrained Hilbert spaces, and quantify the computational gains obtained over\ntraditional DMRG methods in a perturbed Heisenberg model. Our work testifies to\nthe usefulness of generalised non-invertible symmetries and their formal\ncategory theoretic description for the nuts and bolts simulation of strongly\ncorrelated systems.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
