The second conjecture, due to Smith from 1984, states that\nfor $r\\ge 2$ in every $r$-connected graph any two longest cycles intersect in\nat least $r$ vertices. In this paper, we prove a new lemma about the\nintersection of longest cycles in a graph which can be used to improve the best\nknown bounds towards both of the aforementioned conjectures: First, we show\nthat every connected vertex-transitive graph on $n\\geq 3$ vertices contains a\ncycle of length at least $\\Omega(n^{13/21})$, improving on $\\Omega(n^{3/5})$\nfrom [De Vos, arXiv:2302:04255, 2023]. Second, we show that in every\n$r$-connected graph with $r\\geq 2$, any two longest cycles meet in at least\n$\\Omega(r^{5/8})$ vertices, improving on $\\Omega(r^{3/5})$ from [Chen, Faudree\nand Gould, J. Combin. Theory, Ser.~ B, 1998]. Our proof combines combinatorial\narguments, computer-search and linear programming.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
