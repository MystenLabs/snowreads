We focus on summarizing batching, spectral, and initial sequence\ncovariance estimation techniques. We emphasize practical recommendations for\nmodern MCMC simulations, where positive correlation is common and leads to\nnegatively biased covariance estimates. Our discussion is centered on\ncomputationally efficient methods that remain viable even when the number of\niterations is large, offering insights into improving the reliability and\naccuracy of MCMC output in such scenarios.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Computation","Statistics/Applications"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
