However, in\npractice, we often need to use nonlinear optimization models, for which the\nexisting optimization tools such as Cplex or Gurobi may not be directly\napplicable and an (error-prone) manual transformation often has to be done.\nThus, to address this issue, in this paper we investigate the problem of\nautomatically verifying and synthesizing reductions, the solution of which may\nallow an automatic linearization of nonlinear models. We show that the\nsynthesis of reductions can be formulated as an $\\exists^* \\forall^*$ synthesis\nproblem, which can be solved by an SMT solver via the counter-example guided\ninductive synthesis approach (CEGIS).\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Logic in Computer Science","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control","Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"bhZ0Ow0lIZhU5okbidVVFXt-OxkBKARooD057lSjVDU","pdfSize":"96620"}
