Our model achieved\nremarkable results, with a purity rate of $98\\,\\%$ and a retention rate of\n$90\\,\\%$ for CDC cells with signal hits, surpassing the design-goal performance\nof $90\\,\\%$ for both metrics. This study marks the initial application of deep\nlearning to COMET tracking, paving the way for more advanced techniques in\nfuture research.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"ss_Z5rmwtla_5YLmrpKBVybQnJsubYDHEjQ710Cnu_s","pdfSize":"2678221"}
