We show that these results can be extended to certain curved\nbackgrounds that, for suitable choice of the domain of the coordinates, can be\nrelated via conformal transformations to systems in Taub-NUT spaces. These\ninclude the multi-fold Kepler systems as special cases. The curvature of the\nspace is not constant and depends on a rational parameter that is also related\nto the order of the integrals. New results on minimal superintegrability when\nthe electrostatic potential depends on both radial and angular variables are\nalso presented.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
