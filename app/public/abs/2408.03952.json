Social influence can lock in an\ninitial popularity advantage of an option over a higher quality alternative.\nYet several experiments designed to enable social influence have found that\nsocial systems self-correct rather than lock-in. Here we identify a behavioral\nphenomenon that makes inferior lock-in possible, which we call the 'marginal\nmajority effect': A discontinuous increase in the choice probability of an\noption as its popularity exceeds that of a competing option. We demonstrate the\nexistence of marginal majority effects in several recent experiments and show\nthat lock-in always occurs when the effect is large enough to offset the\nquality effect on choice, but rarely otherwise. Our results reconcile\nconflicting past empirical evidence and connect a behavioral phenomenon to the\npossibility of social lock-in.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Mathematics/Probability"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
