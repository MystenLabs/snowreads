Quantum walks are powerful tools for various graph-based\napplications such as spatial search, community detection, and node\nclassification. Although many quantum-walk-based graph algorithms have been\nextensively studied, specific quantum circuits for implementing these\nalgorithms have not yet been provided. To address this issue, we present a\ncircuit design for implementing the discrete-time quantum walk on complex\nnetworks. We investigate the functionality of our circuit using the small-sized\nWatts-and-Strogatz model as the complex network model, comparing it with\ntheoretical calculations. This work offers a new approach to constructing\nquantum circuits for implementing quantum walks on arbitrary complex networks.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
