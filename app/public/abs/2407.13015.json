We establish a\nnecessary condition for a subset $S \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}} \\cap B(0,\n\\rho)$ to be the exceptional set of a $p$-adic transcendental analytic function\nwith rational coefficients, demonstrating that, in general, the answer to\nMahler's Problem C over $\\mathbb{C}_p$ is negative. However, we prove that if\n$S$ is closed under algebraic conjugation and contains 0, there exist\nuncountably many transcendental analytic functions $f \\in\n\\mathbb{Q}_{\\rho}[[z]]$ such that $S_f = S$. Furthermore, if $\\rho \\geq 1$, $f$\ncan be taken in $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\rho}[[z]]$. Additionally, we demonstrate that any\n$S \\subseteq \\overline{\\mathbb{Q}} \\cap B(0, \\rho)$ containing 0 can be the\nexceptional set of uncountably many transcendental analytic functions $f \\in\n\\overline{\\mathbb{Q}}_{\\rho}[[z]]$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
