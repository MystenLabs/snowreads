In this work, we investigate\nthe use of the transformer model for radiology report generation from chest\nX-rays. We also highlight limitations in evaluating radiology report generation\nusing only the standard language generation metrics. We then applied a\ntransformer based radiology report generation architecture, and also compare\nthe performance of a transformer based decoder with the recurrence based\ndecoder. Experiments were performed using the IU-CXR dataset, showing superior\nresults to its LSTM counterpart and being significantly faster. Finally, we\nidentify the need of evaluating radiology report generation system using both\nlanguage generation metrics and classification metrics, which helps to provide\nrobust measure of generated reports in terms of their coherence and diagnostic\nvalue.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
