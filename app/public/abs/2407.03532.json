These\npredominantly extragalactic transients encode information on the expansion of\nthe Universe through their dispersion measure, reflecting interactions with the\nintervening medium along the line of sight. In this study, we introduce a novel\nmethod for reconstructing the late-time cosmic expansion rate and estimating\nthe Hubble constant, solely derived from FRBs measurements coupled with their\nredshift information while employing Artificial Neural Networks. Our approach\nyields a Hubble constant estimate of $H_0 = 67.3\\pm6.6\\rm \\ km \\ s^{-1} \\\nMpc^{-1}$. With a dataset comprising 23 localised data points, we demonstrate a\nprecision of $\\sim10\\%$. However, our forecasts using simulated datasets\nindicate that in the future it could be possible to achieve precision\ncomparable to the SH0ES collaboration or the Planck satellite. Our findings\nunderscore the potential of FRBs as alternative, independent tools for probing\ncosmic dynamics.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"QPRIBwz4YvRo-HgEHWX16apj1iPZFmSOjQMIifA1jHc","pdfSize":"803569"}
