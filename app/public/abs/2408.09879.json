We describe isometries with respect\nto the symmetric quantum Wasserstein divergence $d_{sym}$, the divergence\ninduced by all of the Pauli matrices. We also give a complete characterization\nof isometries with respect to $D_z$, the quantum Wasserstein distance\ncorresponding to the single Pauli matrix $\\sigma_z$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Metric Geometry","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
