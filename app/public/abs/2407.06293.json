Currently, the computational intensity of accurately\nsimulating the residual stress on the path scale remains a significant\nchallenge, limiting our understanding of the LPBF processes.\n  This paper presents a framework for simulating the LPBF process residual\nstress based on the path-level thermal history. Compared with the existing\napproaches, the path-level simulation requires discretization only to capture\nthe scanning path rather than the details of the melt pools, thus requiring\nless dense mesh and is more computationally efficient. We develop this\nframework by introducing a new concept termed effective thermal strain to\ncapture the anisotropic thermal strain near and around the melt pool. We\nvalidate our approach with the high-fidelity results from the literature. We\nuse the proposed approach to simulate various single-island scanning patterns\nand layers with multiple full and trimmed islands. We further investigate the\ninfluence of the path-level thermal history and the layer shape on the residual\nstress by analyzing their simulation results.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Engineering, Finance, and Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
