A three-dimensional suction-blowing distribution\nis applied on the top boundary to induce flow separation. Three levels of\nsuction strength (i.e., adverse pressure gradient (APG) strength) are tested.\nFor each suction level, the spanwise extent of the suction is varied using a\nGaussian distribution centered about the domain centerline. Two non-uniform\nsuction distributions are compared with uniformly-applied suction across the\nfull span (implying a two-dimensional LSB), totaling nine cases. All cases are\nperformed at $Re_\\delta = U_{\\infty}\\delta/\\nu = 1000$ based on the inflow\nboundary layer thickness ($\\delta$) and free-stream velocity ($U_{\\infty}$).\nInitial results indicate stark contrast between three-dimensional and\ntwo-dimensional LSBs. Most notably, the role of suction width is determining\nthe topology of the LSB and its reattachment mechanism. Meanwhile, APG is\nresponsible for determining the size of the LSB and level of turbulence at\nreattachment. Streamwise-oriented vortices are identified along the crest of\nthe three-dimensional LSBs.\n","subjects":["Physics/Fluid Dynamics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
