In this work, we successfully apply QML to drug\ndiscovery, showing that QML can significantly improve model performance and\nachieve faster convergence compared to classical ML. Moreover, we demonstrate\nthat the model accuracy of the QML improves as the number of qubits increases.\nWe also introduce noise to the QML model and find that it has little effect on\nour experimental conclusions, illustrating the high robustness of the QML\nmodel. This work highlights the potential application of quantum computing to\nyield significant benefits for scientific advancement as the qubit quantity\nincrease and quality improvement in the future.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Quantitative Biology/Biomolecules"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
