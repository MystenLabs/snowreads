Our findings are rigorously validated through comprehensive numerical\nsimulations, ensuring robust and consistent outcomes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"vDHiroIaf8fl-iPuPYyJv25MWudPGhmKFqcS9R2CIFo","pdfSize":"985223"}
