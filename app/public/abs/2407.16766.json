However, as conjectured in [4], we show\nthat the probability is not zero in the case of sets of two elements and\ncalculate the exact value. We explore some generalisations on deficient sets\nand their likelihoods.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Rings and Algebras"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"SQbyeErEQ-KJMyw49HCn2osCVlqQQ_XrjwXbNHkoyOc","pdfSize":"489962"}
