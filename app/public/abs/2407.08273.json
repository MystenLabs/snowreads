Previous works generally focus on\nusing exclusive SQL generation prompt to improve the LLMs' reasoning ability.\nHowever, they are mostly hard to handle large databases with numerous tables\nand columns, and usually ignore the significance of pre-processing database and\nextracting valuable information for more efficient prompt engineering. Based on\nabove analysis, we propose RB-SQL, a novel retrieval-based LLM framework for\nin-context prompt engineering, which consists of three modules that retrieve\nconcise tables and columns as schema, and targeted examples for in-context\nlearning. Experiment results demonstrate that our model achieves better\nperformance than several competitive baselines on public datasets BIRD and\nSpider.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
