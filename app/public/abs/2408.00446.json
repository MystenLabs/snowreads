As a powerful theoretical tool to\ndeal with this system, we employ the Schwinger-Keldysh Green's function\ntechnique. We systematically evaluate the superfluid transition, as well as the\nsingle-particle properties, in the nonequilibrium BCS-BEC crossover region, by\nadjusting the chemical potential difference between the reservoirs and the\nstrength of an s-wave pairing interaction associated with a Feshbach resonance.\nIn the weak-coupling BCS side, the chemical potential difference is shown to\nimprint a two-step structure on the particle momentum distribution, leading to\nan anomalous enhancement of pseudogap, as well as the emergence of exotic\nFulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov-type superfluid instability. Since various\nnonequilibrium situations have recently been realized in ultracold Fermi gases,\nthe theoretical understanding of nonequilibrium BCS-BEC crossover physics would\nbecome increasingly important in this research field.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
