We show that a finite subset $A$ of rationals, of cardinality at\nmost $q$, contains a $n^{th}$ power in $\\mathbb{Q}_{p}$ for almost every prime\n$p$ if and only if $A$ contains a perfect $n^{th}$ power, barring some\nexceptions when $n$ is even. This generalizes the Grunwald-Wang theorem for\n$n^{th}$ powers, from one rational number to finite subsets of rational\nnumbers. We also show that the upper bound $q$ in this generalization is\noptimal for every $n$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
