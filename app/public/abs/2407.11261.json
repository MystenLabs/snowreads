To gain insight into the impact of polyadic\nrelationships on dynamical processes on networks, we formulate and study a\npolyadic voter process, which we call the group-driven voter model (GVM), in\nwhich we incorporate the effect of group interactions by nonlinear interactions\nthat are subject to a group (i.e., hyperedge) constraint. By examining the\ncompetition between nonlinearity and group sizes, we show that the GVM achieves\nconsensus faster than standard voter-model dynamics, with an optimum minimizing\nexit time {\\tau} . We substantiate this finding by using mean-field theory on\nannealed uniform hypergraphs with N nodes, for which {\\tau} scales as A ln N,\nwhere the prefactor A depends both on the nonlinearity and on group-constraint\nfactors. Our results reveal how competition between group interactions and\nnonlinearity shapes GVM dynamics. We thereby highlight the importance of such\ncompeting effects in complex systems with polyadic interactions.\n","subjects":["Physics/Physics and Society","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks","Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Nonlinear Sciences/Adaptation and Self-Organizing Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
