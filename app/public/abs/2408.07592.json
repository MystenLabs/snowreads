Despite advancements in RFFI methods,\nbackground noise and intentional modulation features result in weak energy and\nsubtle differences in the RFF features. These challenges diminish the\ncapability of RFFI methods in feature representation, complicating the\neffective identification of device identities. This paper proposes a novel\nMulti-Periodicity Dependency Transformer (MPDFormer) to address these\nchallenges. The MPDFormer employs a spectrum offset-based periodic embedding\nrepresentation to augment the discrepency of intrinsic features. We delve into\nthe intricacies of the periodicity-dependency attention mechanism, integrating\nboth inter-period and intra-period attention mechanisms. This mechanism\nfacilitates the extraction of both long and short-range periodicity-dependency\nfeatures , accentuating the feature distinction whilst concurrently attenuating\nthe perturbations caused by background noise and weak-periodicity features.\nEmpirical results demonstrate MPDFormer's superiority over established baseline\nmethods, achieving a 0.07s inference time on NVIDIA Jetson Orin NX.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"DBNejTopBU6FXDDocGk2w65XGMAXPUyi_o_DboH4ZL4","pdfSize":"5053175"}
