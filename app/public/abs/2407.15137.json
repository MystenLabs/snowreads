The reaction proceeds by\nbreakdown of deuteron into a proton and a neutron due to the action of the\nfirst perturbation. In the second, nuclear perturbation, the neutron gets\ncaptured by the heavy nucleus. Both perturbations are assumed to be\nelectromagnetic and lead to the emission of two photons, one at each vertex.\nThe heavy nucleus is taken to be ${}^{58}$Ni although many other may be\nconsidered.The reaction rate is found to be very small unless assisted by some\nspecial conditions. In the present case we assume the presence of a nuclear\nresonant state. In the presence of such a state we find that the reaction rate\n  is sufficiently large to be observable in laboratory even at low energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
