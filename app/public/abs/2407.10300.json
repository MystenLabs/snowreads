Leveraging gradient information and iterative optimization, the proposed\napproach refines the parameters of COBRA's dynamical model such as coefficient\nof friction and actuator parameters using experimental and simulated data.\nExperimental validation on the hardware platform demonstrates the efficacy of\nthe proposed approach, highlighting its potential to address sim-to-real gap in\nrobot implementation.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
