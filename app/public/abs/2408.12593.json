This task is common for sealing surfaces in the manufacturing\nof automobiles, appliances, electronics, and other products. Gasket Assembly is\na long-horizon, high-precision task and the gasket must align with the channel\nand be fully pressed in to achieve a secure fit. To compare approaches, we\npresent 4 methods for Gasket Assembly: one policy from deep imitation learning\nand three procedural algorithms. We evaluate these methods with 100 physical\ntrials. Results suggest that the Binary+ algorithm succeeds in 10/10 on the\nstraight channel whereas the learned policy based on 250 human teleoperated\ndemonstrations succeeds in 8/10 trials and is significantly slower.
