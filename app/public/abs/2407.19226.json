Appl. Math., 79:3, 419-429, 2021] and [Shao, SIAM J.\nMatrix Anal.

In this paper, we comprehensively study these two\nalgorithms. First, we theoretically analyse the algorithms given in\n[Steinerberger, Q. Appl. Math., 79:3, 419-429, 2021] for solving least squares.\nSecond, we extend the two algorithms to block versions and provide their\ntheoretical convergence rates. Our numerical experiments also verify the\nefficiency of these algorithms. Third, as a theoretical complement, we address\nsome key questions left unanswered in [Shao, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 44(1),\n212-239, 2023].\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
