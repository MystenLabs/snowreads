As models grow in complexity, vanishing and\nexploding gradients impede performance. We propose Z-Score Normalization for\nGradient Descent (ZNorm), an innovative technique that adjusts only the\ngradients to accelerate training and improve model performance. ZNorm\nnormalizes the overall gradients, providing consistent gradient scaling across\nlayers, thereby reducing the risks of vanishing and exploding gradients, having\nbetter performances. Our extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and medical datasets\ndemonstrate that ZNorm enhances performance metrics. ZNorm consistently\noutperforms existing methods, achieving superior results using the same\nexperimental settings. In medical imaging applications, ZNorm improves tumor\nprediction and segmentation performances, underscoring its practical utility.\nThese findings highlight ZNorm's potential as a robust and versatile tool for\nenhancing the training speed and effectiveness of deep neural networks across a\nwide range of architectures and applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"UQScx6-pQDQfgXVtnld_O6N3cnK1dA0BEnU6323PQmI","pdfSize":"1567704","txDigest":"D7VEmszkGjbaHpqBqSnDRZaZJBjy4VFRuDbKGzVqQpHs","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
