This non-ignorable\nmissingness structure, if not appropriately accounted for, can result in\nparticipation bias in association analyses. To deal with this issue, Chen et\nal. (2016) proposed to collect additional genetic information from family\nmembers of individuals whose genotype data were not available, and developed a\nmaximum likelihood method for bias correction. In this study, we develop an\nestimating equation approach to analyzing data collected from this design that\nallows adjustment of covariates. It jointly estimates odds ratio parameters for\ngenetic association and missingness, where a logistic regression model is used\nto relate missingness to genotype and other covariates. Our method allows\ncorrelation between genotype and covariates while using genetic information\nfrom family members to provide information on the missing genotype data. In the\nestimating equation for genetic association parameters, we weight the\ncontribution of each genotyped subject to the empirical likelihood score\nfunction by the inverse probability that the genotype data are available. We\nevaluate large and finite sample performance of our method via simulation\nstudies and apply it to a family-based case-control study of breast cancer.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
