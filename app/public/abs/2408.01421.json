We\nstudy the polarization density as a topological invariant and provide an\nanalytic treatment of its behavior in the low-energy sector of the\none-dimensional interacting SSH model. By formulating the topological invariant\nin terms of Green's functions, we use the low-energy field theory of the\nThirring model to derive the behavior of the polarization density. We show that\nthe polarization density in the continuum theory describes the usual\ntopological insulating phases. Still, it contains an extra factor from the\nfields' scaling dimensions in the low-energy quantum field theory. We interpret\nthis as a measure of the modified charge of the new excitations in the system.\nWe find two distinct contributions: a renormalization of the electronic charge\n$e$ of a Fermi liquid because of quasiparticle smearing and an additional\ncontribution coming from the topological charge of the soliton arising in the\nbosonized version of the Thirring model, the sine-Gordon model.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
