It generates consistent modified Einstein equations where $\\Lambda$ and\n$G$ are functions of spacetime. In addition, these equations respect, without\nany ad hoc choices, the Bianchi identities. We analyse this action in a quantum\ncosmology scenario. Furthermore, assuming homogeneous and isotropic spacetime,\nthe action gives a non singular cosmology with power law inflation. Tensor and\nscalar perturbations have been used to constraint the free parameters.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
