This makes the standard Hubbard-Stratonovich\ntransformation inapplicable to such problems. We used, instead, the functional\nHubbard-Stratonovich transformation which allowed to solve the problem\nanalytically for large sizes of matrices. We show that $\\rho(E)$ depends\ncrucially on the control parameter that drives the system through the\ntransition between the ergodic and the fractal phases and it can be used as an\norder parameter.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks","Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
