We show that if a code is $t$-homogeneous that is, the codewords\nof the code for every given weight hold a $t$-design, then its Jacobi\npolynomial in genus $g$ with composition $T$ with $|T|\\leq t$ can be obtained\nfrom its weight enumerator in genus~$g$ using the polarization operator. Using\nthis fact, we investigate the invariant ring, which relates the homogeneous\nJacobi polynomials of the binary codes in genus $g$. Specifically, the\ngenerators of the invariant ring appearing for $g=1$ are obtained. Moreover, we\ndefine the split Jacobi polynomials in genus~$g$ and obtain the MacWilliams\ntype identity for it. A split generalization for higher genus cases of the\nrelation between the Jacobi polynomials and weight enumerator of a\n$t$-homogeneous code also given.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Group Theory","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
