Specifically, we consider the problem of finding\nthe shortest tour such that all objects of interest can be detected\nsuccessfully. To represent a viable detection region for each object, we\npropose to use an entropy-based viewing score that generates a diameter-bounded\nregion as a viewing neighborhood. We formulate the detection-based trajectory\nplanning problem as a stochastic traveling salesperson problem with\nneighborhoods and propose a center-visit method that obtains an approximation\nratio of O(DmaxDmin) for disjoint regions. For non-disjoint regions, our method\n-provides a novel finite detour in 3D, which utilizes the region's minimum\ncurvature property. Finally, we show that our method can generate efficient\ntrajectories compared to a baseline method in a photo-realistic simulation\nenvironment.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Data Structures and Algorithms"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
