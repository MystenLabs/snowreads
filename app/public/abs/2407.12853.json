AFC is crucial in discerning truth from misinformation, especially\ngiven the huge amounts of content are generated online daily. Current research\nfocuses on predicting claim veracity through metadata analysis and language\nscrutiny, with an emphasis on justifying verdicts. This paper surveys recent\nmethodologies, proposing a comprehensive taxonomy and presenting the evolution\nof research in that landscape. A comparative analysis of methodologies and\nfuture directions for improving fact-checking explainability are also\ndiscussed.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence","Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/","blobId":"N7_7Qlw3NDSJn8EIoikxvmy5u4qsrqxO3pfpCWXVQhQ","pdfSize":"599022"}
