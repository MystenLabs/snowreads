We show that $F$ is of Berwald\n(Douglas) type if and only if $\\tilde{F}$ is of Berwald (Douglas) type. In the\ncase of Berwaldian metrics, we give the relation between their flag curvatures.\nAlso, we have studied the relations between their base Riemannian metrics.\nFinally, as examples, the results are studied in the Heisenberg group and\nalmost Abelian Lie groups.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Differential Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
