Therefore,\nthe sparse pixel-level annotation methods have been introduced to train models\nwith a subset of pixels within each image. We introduce a Bayesian active\nlearning framework based on sparse pixel-level annotation that utilizes a\npixel-level Bayesian uncertainty measure based on Balanced Entropy (BalEnt)\n[84]. BalEnt captures the information between the models' predicted\nmarginalized probability distribution and the pixel labels. BalEnt has linear\nscalability with a closed analytical form and can be calculated independently\nper pixel without relational computations with other pixels. We train our\nproposed active learning framework for Cityscapes, Camvid, ADE20K and VOC2012\nbenchmark datasets and show that it reaches supervised levels of mIoU using\nonly a fraction of labeled pixels while outperforming the previous\nstate-of-the-art active learning models with a large margin.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
