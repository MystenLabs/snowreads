Our\nalgorithms run in $O(n^2\\log n)$ time for the second shortest walk and in\n$O(n^3)$ time for the third shortest walk. We also show how to reduce the\nrunning time for the second shortest homotopically non-trivial closed walk to\n$O(n\\log n)$ when both the genus and the number of boundaries are fixed.\n  Our algorithms rely on a careful analysis of the configurations of the first\nthree shortest homotopically non-trivial curves in $S$. As an intermediate\nstep, we also describe how to compute a shortest essential arc between\n\\emph{one} pair of vertices or between \\emph{all} pairs of vertices of a given\nboundary component of $S$ in $O(n^2)$ time or $O(n^3)$ time, respectively.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computational Geometry","Mathematics/Geometric Topology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Uf902wAH0tkDm5-PcH55YCxGJsQK0adNKYwIZpw0mM0","pdfSize":"580573","objectId":"0xd68fe5e38e28de697de87d53652f0413c69f05a6662e54e1abc076fbb864ee3f","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
