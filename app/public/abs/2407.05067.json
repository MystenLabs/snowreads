In this approach, one computes the\nsmooth sensitivity of a given query $q$ on the given input $D$ and releases\n$q(D)$ with noise added proportional to this smooth sensitivity. One question\nremains: what distribution should we pick the noise from?\n  In this paper, we give a new class of distributions suitable for the use with\nsmooth sensitivity, which we name the PolyPlace distribution. This distribution\nimproves upon the state-of-the-art Student's T distribution in terms of\nstandard deviation by arbitrarily large factors, depending on a \"smoothness\nparameter\" $\\gamma$, which one has to set in the smooth sensitivity framework.\nMoreover, our distribution is defined for a wider range of parameter $\\gamma$,\nwhich can lead to significantly better performance.\n  Moreover, we prove that the PolyPlace distribution converges for $\\gamma\n\\rightarrow 0$ to the Laplace distribution and so does its variance. This means\nthat the Laplace mechanism is a limit special case of the PolyPlace mechanism.\nThis implies that out mechanism is in a certain sense optimal for $\\gamma \\to\n0$.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
