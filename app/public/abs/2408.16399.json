In this paper, a joint relay and intelligent\nreflecting surface (IRS)-assisted communication is considered to investigate\nthe gains of optimizing both the phase angles and selection of relays. The\ncombination of successive refinement and reinforcement learning is proposed.\nSuccessive refinement algorithm is used for phase optimization and\nreinforcement learning is used for relay selection. Experimental results\nindicate that the proposed approach offers improved achievable rate performance\nand scales better with number of relays compared to considered benchmark\napproaches.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
