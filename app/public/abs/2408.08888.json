Currently, most anomaly detection algorithms for\nastronomical time-series rely either on hand-crafted features or on features\ngenerated through unsupervised representation learning, coupled with standard\nanomaly detection algorithms. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that\nleverages the latent space of a neural network classifier for anomaly\ndetection. We then propose a new method called Multi-Class Isolation Forests\n(MCIF), which trains separate isolation forests for each class to derive an\nanomaly score for an object based on its latent space representation. This\napproach significantly outperforms a standard isolation forest when distinct\nclusters exist in the latent space. Using a simulated dataset emulating the\nZwicky Transient Facility (54 anomalies and 12,040 common), our anomaly\ndetection pipeline discovered $46\\pm3$ anomalies ($\\sim 85\\%$ recall) after\nfollowing up the top 2,000 ($\\sim 15\\%$) ranked objects. Furthermore, our\nclassifier-based approach outperforms or approaches the performance of other\nstate-of-the-art anomaly detection pipelines. Our novel method demonstrates\nthat existing and new classifiers can be effectively repurposed for real-time\nanomaly detection.
