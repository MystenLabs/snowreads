The use of a\nspace-time discretization with smooth basis functions yields advantages in the\napproximation of the solution. The existence of the unique solution for\ncontinuous and discrete space-time variational formulations is proven. We also\nestablish the a priori error estimate for the space-time isogeometric scheme.\nThe non-linear system is linearized through Picard's method and a suitable\npreconditioner for the linearized system is provided. Finally, to confirm the\ntheoretical findings, results of some numerical experiments are presented.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/","blobId":"_Ty70c6fgsi2iALE2cc5Wh2ONpgC5EwXDUMuF2a-RIU","pdfSize":"413111","txDigest":"BiZV9byumEfeYXG4vqRC8hwE6f9QkLzgbA9mAXzKeVji","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
