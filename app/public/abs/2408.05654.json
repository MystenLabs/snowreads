With the AC thermal conductivity, an analogous concept of the\nAC electrical conductivity in solid state physics, we transform BTE under the\nrelaxation time approximation into the form of the diffusion equation. This\ntransformation maps any analytical solution of the diffusion equation under\nperiodic heating to that of the BTE, with the nonlocal effect captured by the\njump boundary condition. After investigating the validity of this framework, we\napply it to generalize the 3{\\omega} method from diffusive to quasi-ballistic,\nand propose an experimental scheme to address the inconsistency problem above.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/"}
