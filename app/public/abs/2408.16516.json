A major limiting factor in the\ninterpretation of measurements is the nuclear polarization contribution. We\npropose a method to determine this contribution to the hyperfine structure in\nmuonic atoms from a combination of theory and experiment for hydrogenlike ions\nand muonic atoms. Applying the method to $^{203,205}$Tl and $^{209}$Bi, for\nwhich there are H-like ion and muonic atom hyperfine experimental data, we find\nthat the nuclear polarization contribution for these systems is small, and\nplace a limit on its size of less than $10\\%$ the total hyperfine splitting. We\nhave also performed direct calculations of the nuclear polarization\ncontribution using a semi-analytical model, which indicate that it may be as\nmuch as two orders of magnitude smaller. Therefore, we conclude that the\nnuclear polarization correction to the hyperfine structure of muonic atoms does\nnot represent a limiting factor for next-generation experiments.\n","subjects":["Physics/Atomic Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
