We propose a\nBoolean satisfiability based approach to resource sharing. Our key\ncontributions are an algorithm for converting any constrained assignment to a\nweighted-SAT based optimization. We propose a theorem that allows optimal\nresource assignment problems to be solved via repeated application of a SAT\nsolver. Additionally we show a way to encode continuous time ordering\nconstraints using Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). We benchmark our new\nalgorithms and show that they can be used in an ad-hoc setting. We test our\nalgorithms on a fleet of simulated and real world robots and show that the\nalgorithms are able to handle real world situations. Our algorithms and test\nharnesses are opensource and build on Open-RMFs fleet management system.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"BcgWpZaDFtsL2R0V7l63ajE3vc21cSmQ5xdQBgTFufU","pdfSize":"4202380"}
