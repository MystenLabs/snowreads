The two challenges of the SABR\nsimulation lie in sampling (i) the integrated variance conditional on terminal\nvolatility and (ii) the terminal price conditional on terminal volatility and\nintegrated variance. For the first sampling procedure, we analytically derive\nthe first four moments of the conditional average variance, and sample it from\nthe moment-matched shifted lognormal approximation. For the second sampling\nprocedure, we approximate the conditional terminal price as a\nconstant-elasticity-of-variance (CEV) distribution. Our CEV approximation\npreserves the martingale condition and precludes arbitrage, which is a key\nadvantage over Islah's approximation used in most SABR simulation schemes in\nthe literature. Then, we adopt the exact sampling method of the CEV\ndistribution based on the shifted-Poisson-mixture Gamma random variable. Our\nenhanced procedures avoid the tedious Laplace inversion algorithm for sampling\nintegrated variance and non-efficient inverse transform sampling of the forward\nprice in some of the earlier simulation schemes. Numerical results demonstrate\nour simulation scheme to be highly efficient, accurate, and reliable.\n","subjects":["Quantitative Finance/Computational Finance","Quantitative Finance/Mathematical Finance"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
