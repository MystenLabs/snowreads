To confront this challenge, we introduce an ML-based\nexplainability framework, $\\texttt{XAI4PDF}$, to classify PDFs by parton flavor\nor underlying theoretical model using ResNet-like neural networks (NNs). By\nleveraging the differentiable nature of ResNet models, this approach deploys\nguided backpropagation to dissect relevant features of fitted PDFs, identifying\nx-dependent signatures of PDFs important to the ML model classifications. By\napplying our framework, we are able to sort PDFs according to the analysis\nwhich produced them while constructing quantitative, human-readable maps\nlocating the x regions most affected by the internal theory assumptions going\ninto each analysis. This technique expands the toolkit available to PDF\nanalysis and adjacent particle phenomenology while pointing to promising\ngeneralizations.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
