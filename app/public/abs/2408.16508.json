A component is defined as colorful if each color appears at most\nonce. The problems differ in the objective function, which determines which\npartition is the best one. These problems have applications in community\ndetection, cybersecurity, and bioinformatics. We present integer non-linear\nformulations, which are then linearized using standard techniques. To solve\nthese formulations, we develop exact branch-and-cut algorithms, embedding\nvarious improving techniques, such as valid inequalities, bounds limiting the\nnumber of variables, and warm-start and preprocessing techniques. Extensive\ncomputational tests on benchmark instances demonstrate the effectiveness of the\nproposed procedures. The branch-and-cut algorithms can solve reasonably sized\ninstances efficiently. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to\npropose an exact algorithm for solving these problems.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Social and Information Networks"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
