Following this concept, we\ninvestigate the thermodynamic states and phase transitions of Bardeen-AdS-class\nblack holes, revealing that the system can be classified into two categories,\nType I and Type II, based on whether it adopts a pure Bardeen-AdS spacetime\nwithout event horizons or a Bardeen-AdS black hole as its phase state, each\nexhibiting distinct thermodynamic properties. If one includes the Bardeen-AdS\nblack holes in the system (Type I), there will be three distinct black hole\nstates and the phase transitions between them are analogous to the\nReissner-Nordstrom-AdS black holes. On the other hand, if the pure Bardeen-AdS\nspacetime is included (Type II), an additional tiny black hole state emerges. A\nphase transition reminiscent of the Hawking-Page transition was found.\nSignificantly, in this scenario, thermodynamical characteristic curves exhibit\ndiscontinuous behavior, which attributes to the multiple horizons. The presence\nof a Bardeen-AdS black hole within the phase structure of the Bardeen-AdS-class\nblack hole profoundly modifies the thermodynamical properties of the system,\nhighlighting the novel aspects of regular black holes.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"QIZYLiZ-73zvoqmQFdNDI107oK9NRQh2lFF9_-kDG28","pdfSize":"1947894"}
