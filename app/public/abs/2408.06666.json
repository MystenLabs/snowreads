Traditional biomimetic fish often mimic fish joints using\ntandem components like servos, which leads to increased volume, weight and\ncontrol complexity. In this paper, a new double-joint robotic fish using a\ncomposite linkage was designed, where the propulsion mechanism transforms the\nsingle-degree-of-freedom rotation of the motor into a double-degree-of-freedom\ncoupled motion, namely caudal peduncle translation and caudal fin rotation.\nMotion analysis of the propulsion mechanism demonstrates its ability to closely\nemulate the undulating movement observed in carangiform fish. Experimental\nresults further validate the feasibility of the proposed propulsion mechanism.\nTo improve propulsion efficiency, an analysis is conducted to explore the\ninfluence of swing angle amplitude and swing frequency on the swimming speed of\nthe robotic fish. This examination establishes a practical foundation for\nfuture research on such robotic fish systems.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
