In this model, maintaining\nintegrity of the supply is a core concern, therefore protections against\ndouble-spending are often at the heart of a secure digital money scheme.\nQuantum money exploits the quantum mechanical principle of no-cloning to enable\na currency that is immune to double spending. One of the challenges of the\nscheme is that users require technology that is currently out of reach. Here,\nwe propose a model for quantum currency, which alleviates the need for quantum\nwallets by delegating quantum storage and processing to an intermediary that we\ncall a \"quantum vault\". We develop the basic building blocks of this\nquantum-enabled digital currency and discuss its benefits and challenges.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
