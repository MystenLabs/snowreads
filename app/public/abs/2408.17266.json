It is proved that if\n$\\left[\\frac{b}{M}\\right]\\geq \\left[n-\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i+r}{M}\\right]$,\nthen this equation is solvable (here $M$ is the least common multiple of the\nnumbers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$; $r$ is the remainder of $b$ modulo $M$). With the\naid of this result, it is shown that the considered equation is solvable if\neither $b\\geq nM-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i$ or $b\\geq (n-1)M$. The case where\n$\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i\\geq (n-2)M+2$ is considered closer. It is proved that, in\nthat case, the equation is solvable if $b>(n-1)M-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i$. If, in\naddition, $r>(n-1)M-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i$, then it has\n$\\frac{M^{n-1}}{a_1a_2...a_n}C^{n-1}_{b'+n-1}$ integer non-negative solutions;\nit is also shown that if $b\\geq M$ and $r\\leq (n-1)M-\\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_i$, then\nthe number of solutions of the equation is greater than or equal to\n$\\frac{M^{n-1}}{a_1a_2...a_n}C^{n-1}_{b'+n-2}$; here\n$b'=\\left[\\frac{b}{M}\\right]$ (and $C^{k}_{m}$ denotes the binomial coefficient\n${\\begin{pmatrix}m\\\\k\\\\\\end{pmatrix}}$). Moreover, it is proved that if the\nnumbers $a_1,a_2,...,a_n$ are coprime, then $Frob(a_1,a_2,...,a_n)\\leq c$,\nwhere $c$ is the smallest among the numbers $a_ia_j-a_i-a_j$ with $(a_i,a_j)=1$\n($1\\leq i< j\\leq n$).\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
