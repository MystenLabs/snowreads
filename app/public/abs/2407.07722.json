Two of these platforms, carrying two SiPMs each, were\nintegrated into the \\~NuSat-7 satellite (COSPAR-ID: 2020-003B). Analysis\nrevealed that these SiPMs experienced an increase in dark current over time due\nto damage from trapped and solar proton radiation. The total ionizing dose\nreceived by the payload and the SiPMs was measured using p-MOSFET dosimeters,\nwith a resulting value of 5 Gy, or a 1 MeV neutron equivalent fluence of\n$\\phi_n = 5 \\cdot 10^9$ n/cm$^2$. The dark current was observed to increase up\nto 500 times. Parameters such as Gain and Photon Detection Efficiency remained\nunchanged throughout the mission. These findings align with previous\nperformance reports involving different SiPMs irradiated with various particles\nand energies.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
