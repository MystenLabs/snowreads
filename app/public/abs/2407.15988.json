Here, we develop\nvariants of the union-find decoder that simplify its implementation and provide\npotential decoding speed advantages. Furthermore, we show how these methods can\nbe adapted to decode non-topological quantum low-density-parity-check (qLDPC)\ncodes. All the developed decoders can directly include both qubit erasures and\nPauli errors in the decoding step, thus addressing the dominant noise\nmechanisms for photonic quantum computing. We investigate the strengths and\nweaknesses of the different decoder variants, benchmark their speed and\nthreshold error rates on several codes, and provide the used source code.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
