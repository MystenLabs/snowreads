This paper proposes a label consistency based dynamic point\ndetection and removal method for handling moving vehicles and pedestrians in\nautonomous driving scenarios, and embeds the proposed dynamic point detection\nand removal method into a self-designed LiDAR-inertial odometry system.\nExperimental results on three public datasets demonstrate that our method can\naccomplish the dynamic point detection and removal with extremely low\ncomputational overhead (i.e., 1$\\sim$9ms) in LIO systems, meanwhile achieve\ncomparable preservation rate and rejection rate to state-of-the-art methods and\nsignificantly enhance the accuracy of pose estimation. We have released the\nsource code of this work for the development of the community.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
