This index aims to balance the demands\nplaced on the peer review system by a researcher's publication output with\ntheir engagement in reviewing others' work, providing a measure of whether they\nare giving back to the academic community commensurately with their own\npublication demands. The R-Index offers a straightforward and fair approach to\nencourage equitable participation in peer review, thereby supporting the\nsustainability and efficiency of the scholarly publishing process.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Digital Libraries"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"FoIYyV5eQM3seI6zIAuTrT9rvkJxqVoW0jf9kgGo9tE","pdfSize":"218454"}
