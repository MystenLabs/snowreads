It can seriously impact\nsociety, especially in countries like Ethiopia, where it can trigger conflicts\namong diverse ethnic and religious groups. While hate speech detection in\nresource rich languages are progressing, for low resource languages such as\nAmharic are lacking. To address this gap, we develop Amharic hate speech data\nand SBi-LSTM deep learning model that can detect and classify text into four\ncategories of hate speech: racial, religious, gender, and non-hate speech. We\nhave annotated 5k Amharic social media post and comment data into four\ncategories. The data is annotated using a custom annotation tool by a total of\n100 native Amharic speakers. The model achieves a 94.8 F1-score performance.\nFuture improvements will include expanding the dataset and develop state-of-the\nart models.\n  Keywords: Amharic hate speech detection, classification, Amharic dataset,\nDeep Learning, SBi-LSTM\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computation and Language","Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/","blobId":"cMnIt0bOSrXmMGXcwgb-YHGICajCLJ7eDhrmwLSpOOQ","pdfSize":"214022"}
