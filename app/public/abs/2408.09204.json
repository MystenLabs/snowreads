During this 15.4-year\nperiod, two over-recovery glitches and four anti-glitches were identified,\nmarking a rare occurrence in rotation-powered pulsars (RPPs). The magnitudes of\nthese (net) spin-down glitches were determined to be $|\\Delta\\nu_{\\rm g}/\\nu|\n\\sim 10^{-8}$, well above the estimated detectability limit. For the two\nover-recovery glitches, the respective recovery fractions $Q$ are $2.1(7)$ and\n$1.4(2)$. Further analysis showed no substantial variations in either the flux\nor pulse profile shape in any of these events, suggesting that small (net)\nspin-down glitches, unlike large events observed in magnetars and magnetar-like\nRPPs, may occur without leaving an impact on the magnetosphere. Within the\nframework of the vortex creep and vortex bending models, anti-glitches and\nover-recoveries indicate the recoupling of vortex lines that moved inward as a\nresult of a crustquake; meanwhile, the apparent fluctuations in the spin-down\nrate after the glitches occur as a result of the coupling of the oscillations\nof bent vortex lines to the magnetosphere.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"kjSBJ-lA7ee5Kv9DmjEETKfHekmGEXvMTXXMuFHCKUQ","pdfSize":"853463"}
