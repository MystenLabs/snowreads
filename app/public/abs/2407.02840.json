Formally, this condition is the statement that $E[S(t)|S(t_0)]$, the\nexpected entropy of the universe at the current time $t$ conditioned on its\nvalue $S(t_0)$ at a time $t_0$ in the past, is an increasing function of $t $.\nWe point out that in general this is incorrect. The epistemic axioms underlying\nprobability theory say that we should condition expectations on all that we\nknow, and on nothing that we do not know. Arguably, we know the value of the\nuniverse's entropy at the present time $t$ at least as well as its value at a\ntime in the past, $t_0$. However, as we show here, conditioning expected\nentropy on its value at two times rather than one radically changes its\ndynamics, resulting in a unexpected, very rich structure. For example, the\nexpectation value conditioned on two times can have a maximum at an\nintermediate time between $t_0$ and $t$, i.e., in our past. Moreover, it can\nhave a negative rather than positive time derivative at the present. In such\n\"Boltzmann bridge\" situations, the second law would not hold at the present\ntime. We illustrate and investigate these phenomena for a random walk model and\nan idealized gas model, and briefly discuss the role of Boltzmann bridges in\nour universe.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/History and Philosophy of Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
