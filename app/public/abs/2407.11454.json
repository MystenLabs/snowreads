These states\ncirculate among users with quantum resources through quantum channels or\nface-to-face interactions. Quantum mechanics grants quantum money\nphysical-level unforgeability but also makes minting, storing, and circulating\nit significantly challenging. Currently, quantum computers capable of minting\nand preserving quantum money have not yet emerged, and existing quantum\nchannels are not stable enough to support the efficient transmission of quantum\nstates for quantum money, limiting its practicality. Semi-quantum money schemes\nsupport fully classical transactions and complete classical banks, reducing\ndependence on quantum resources and enhancing feasibility. To further minimize\nthe system's reliance on quantum resources, we propose a cloud-based\nsemi-quantum money (CSQM) scheme. This scheme relies only on semi-honest\nthird-party quantum clouds, while the rest of the system remains entirely\nclassical. We also discuss estimating the computational power required by the\nquantum cloud for the scheme and conduct a security analysis.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Cryptography and Security","Computing Research Repository/Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"b2bYWq4HHipnfm2l5I6Q3jbBnBC1SnB0jHgimZ8DJBY","pdfSize":"800959"}
