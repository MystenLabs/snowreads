Unfortunately, decoherence, caused\nby environmental interference during quantum state storage, can degrade quantum\nstates, leading to entanglement loss in the resource state and reduction of the\nfidelity of the teleported information. In this work, we investigate the use of\nerror correction and error syndrome information in scheduling teleportation at\na quantum network node in the presence of multiple teleportation requests and a\nfinite rate of remote entanglement distribution. Specifically, we focus on the\nscenario where stored qubits undergo decoherence over time due to imperfect\nmemories. To protect the qubits from the resulting errors, we employ quantum\nencodings, and the stored qubits undergo repeated error correction, generating\nerror syndromes in each round. These error syndromes can provide additional\nbenefits, as they can be used to calculate qubit-specific error likelihoods,\nwhich can then be utilized to make better scheduling decisions. By integrating\nerror correction techniques into the scheduling process, our goal is to\nminimize errors and decoherence effects, thereby enhancing the fidelity and\nefficiency of teleportation in a quantum network setting.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Computing Research Repository/Networking and Internet Architecture"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"e6rBXX85DMF7txxyDQ-tbTqhoz5aoSWnDdlzaXsplLQ","pdfSize":"422500"}
