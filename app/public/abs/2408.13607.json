Their\nredshift and total projected size ranges are between 0.06 to 1.6 and 0.7 Mpc to\n3.2 Mpc, respectively. We conducted a detailed analysis to characterise their\nproperties, including arm-length ratios, flux density ratios of pairs of lobes,\nand misalignment angles. These measurements allow us to study the symmetry\nparameters, which are influenced by the immediate and large-scale environments\nof DDRGs. Our study conclusively shows that the cocoons in which the inner\nlobes of DDRGs grow are often contaminated with surrounding material from the\nexternal medium, leading to observed asymmetries in the inner lobes. Our\nanalysis also reveals highly misaligned DDRGs, which could be due to\nenvironmental factors and/or changes in the supermassive black hole jet\nejection axes. By studying the misalignment angles, we assess the stability of\nthe jets in these systems in relation to their environment. Additionally, we\nhave also characterised the large-scale environments of DDRGs, identifying them\nwithin dense galaxy clusters and studying how cluster weather significantly\naffects their morphologies. Interestingly, we have identified two gigahertz\npeaked-spectrum (GPS) candidates in the unresolved cores of the DDRGs, as well\nas one triple-double candidate, which, if confirmed, would be only the fifth\nknown case. Additionally, we have discovered a DDRG in a distant galaxy cluster\nat $z\\sim$\\,1.4.
