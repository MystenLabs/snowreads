{"id":"2408.06736","title":"Speculations on Uncertainty and Humane Algorithms","authors":"Nicholas Gray","authorsParsed":[["Gray","Nicholas",""]],"versions":[{"version":"v1","created":"Tue, 13 Aug 2024 08:54:34 GMT"}],"updateDate":"2024-08-14","timestamp":1723539274000,"abstract":"  The appreciation and utilisation of risk and uncertainty can play a key role\nin helping to solve some of the many ethical issues that are posed by AI.\nUnderstanding the uncertainties can allow algorithms to make better decisions\nby providing interrogatable avenues to check the correctness of outputs.\nAllowing algorithms to deal with variability and ambiguity with their inputs\nmeans they do not need to force people into uncomfortable classifications.\nProvenance enables algorithms to know what they know preventing possible harms.\nAdditionally, uncertainty about provenance highlights the trustworthiness of\nalgorithms. It is essential to compute with what we know rather than make\nassumptions that may be unjustified or untenable. This paper provides a\nperspective on the need for the importance of risk and uncertainty in the\ndevelopment of ethical AI, especially in high-risk scenarios. It argues that\nthe handling of uncertainty, especially epistemic uncertainty, is critical to\nensuring that algorithms do not cause harm and are trustworthy and ensure that\nthe decisions that they make are humane.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
