Rev.\nLett. {\\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)]. It has been shown in that article that there\nexists an entire family of universal PDFs parameterized by\n$\\zeta=\\lim_{L,\\xi_\\infty\\rightarrow\\infty} L/\\xi_\\infty$ which is the ratio of\nthe system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\\xi_{\\infty}$ with both the\nthermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously. We show\nhow these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm,\ncan be systematically computed perturbatively in the $\\epsilon=4-d$ expansion.\nWe determine the whole family of universal PDFs and show that they are in good\nqualitative agreement with Monte Carlo data. Finally, we conjecture on how to\nsignificantly improve the quantitative agreement between the one-loop and the\nnumerical results.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Statistical Mechanics","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"0ig_3Xb6EExD0hlGLVrhttA7x1duiDo3NCF_srPxUTI","pdfSize":"486475"}
