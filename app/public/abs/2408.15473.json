Research in this field is limited by social stigma and the lack of\neffective replication models. To address these challenges, we developed a\nsophisticated rectal simulator that integrates power, control, and data\nacquisition systems with soft pouch actuators. The system comprises four key\nsubsystems: mechanical, electrical, pneumatic, and control and data\nacquisition. The mechanical subsystem utilizes common materials such as\naluminum frames, wooden boards, and compact structural components to facilitate\nthe installation and adjustment of electrical and control components. The\nelectrical subsystem supplies power to regulators and sensors. The pneumatic\nsystem provides compressed air to actuators, enabling the simulation of FI. The\ncontrol and data acquisition subsystem collects pressure data and regulates\nactuator movement. This comprehensive approach allows the robot to accurately\nreplicate human defecation, managing various feces types including liquid,\nsolid, and extremely solid. This innovation enhances our understanding of\ndefecation and holds potential for advancing quality-of-life devices related to\nthis condition.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
