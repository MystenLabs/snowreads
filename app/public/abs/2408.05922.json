In this article, we study the crystallizations of small covers over the\n$n$-simplex $\\Delta^n$ and the prism $\\Delta^{n-1} \\times I$. It is known that\nthe small cover over the $n$-simplex $\\Delta^n$ is $\\mathbb{RP}^n$. For every\n$n\\geq 2$, we prove that $\\mathbb{RP}^n$ has a unique $2^n$-vertex\ncrystallization. We also demonstrate that there are exactly $1 + 2^{n-1}$ D-J\nequivalence classes of small covers over the prism $\\Delta^{n-1} \\times I$,\nwhere $n\\geq 3$. For each $\\mathbb{Z}_2$-characteristic function of\n$\\Delta^{n-1} \\times I$, we construct a $2^{n-1}(n+1)$-vertex crystallization\nof the small cover $M^n(\\lambda)$ with regular genus $1 + 2^{n-4}(n^2 - 2n -\n3)$, where $n\\geq 4$. In particular, we construct four orientable and four\nnon-orientable $\\mathbb{RP}^3$-bundles over $\\mathbb{S}^1$ up to D-J\nequivalence with the regular genus 6.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Geometric Topology","Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
