We investigate the strongly correlated quantum\nphases of matter that emerge in two-dimensional atom arrays where three Rydberg\nlevels are used to encode an effective spin-1 degree of freedom. Dipolar\nexchange between such spin-1 Rydberg atoms naturally yields two distinct\nmodels: (i) a two-species hardcore boson model, and (ii) upon tuning near a\nF\\\"orster resonance, a dipolar spin-1 XY model. Through extensive, large-scale\ninfinite density matrix renormalization group calculations, we provide a broad\nroadmap predicting the quantum phases that emerge from these models on a\nvariety of lattice geometries: square, triangular, kagome, and ruby. We\nidentify a wealth of correlated states, including lattice supersolids and\nsimplex phases, all of which can be naturally realized in near-term\nexperiments.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Quantum Gases","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
