For $1\\le\nm\\le n$, we show that $s_m(t)$, the sum of the first $m$ angles of the path\n$t\\mapsto e^{tx}e^y$ of unitary matrices, is a convex function of $t$ (provided\nthe path stays in a vecinity of the identity matrix). This vecinity is\ndescribed in terms of the opertor norm of matrices, and it is optimal. We show\nthat the when all the maps $t\\mapsto s_m(t)$ are linear, then $x$ commutes with\n$y$. Several application to unitarily invariant norms in the unitary group are\ngiven. Then we extend these applications to $Ad$-invariant Finsler norms in the\nspecial unitary group of matrices. This last result is obtained by proving that\nany $Ad$-invariant Finsler norm in a compact semi-simple Lie group $K$ is the\nsupremum of a family of what we call orbit norms, induced by the Killing form\nof $K$.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Functional Analysis","Mathematics/Differential Geometry","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
