We develop a covariant formalism using\nHertzian potentials to describe guided electromagnetic modes in spacetimes with\nmetrics that depend on the proper length along the waveguide axis. The Maxwell\nequations are solved using a Hertzian potential ansatz, resulting in wave\nequations for TE and TM modes. We analyze the axial and transverse components\nof the solutions and derive expressions for the cutoff frequency and guide\nwavelength. The special case of TEM modes is also examined. As an illustrative\nexample, we apply the formalism to radial propagation in Schwarzschild\nspacetime. This work provides a framework for studying guided electromagnetic\nwaves in curved spacetime geometries, opening up potential applications in\nprecision tests of general relativity and relativistic quantum optics.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
