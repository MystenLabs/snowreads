Firstly, the classical CCR model was\nused. Then, a model that considered undesirable outputs was developed to suit\nthe Chinese marine economy. Using the two models, the economic efficiencies\nwithout environmental consideration and the environmental performance index\nwere calculated and compared. According to the results, the empirical\nrelationship between EPI and EE, per capita GDP, and the industrial structure\nwas analyzed. It is useful for guiding the coastal local economy of China to a\nhealthy way.\n","subjects":["Economics/General Economics","Quantitative Finance/Economics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
