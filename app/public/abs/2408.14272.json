It has been intensively studied\nin classical physical systems, as in neural networks where an attractor\ndynamics settles on stable solutions. Several extensions to the quantum domain\nhave been recently reported, displaying different features. In this work, we\ndevelop a comprehensive framework for a quantum associative memory based on\nopen quantum system dynamics, which allows us to compare existing models,\nidentify the theoretical prerequisites for performing associative memory tasks,\nand extend it in different forms. The map that achieves an exponential increase\nin the number of stored patterns with respect to classical systems is derived.\nWe establish the crucial role of symmetries and dissipation in the operation of\nquantum associative memory. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates the\nfeasibility of addressing both quantum and classical patterns, orthogonal and\nnon-orthogonal memories, stationary and metastable operating regimes, and\nmeasurement-based outputs. Finally, this opens up new avenues for practical\napplications in quantum computing and machine learning, such as quantum error\ncorrection or quantum memories.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"V2UujAErzj2P_WT8XGk_PVPs3Cqms8iM9zVueQjh39k","pdfSize":"1711422"}
