Such diagonalization is currently of interest in\ncondensed matter physics, for modelling of gates in superconducting circuits\nand for studying isolated quantum many-body systems. While the block\ndiagonalisation of a particular Hermitian matrix is not unique, it can be made\nunique with certain auxiliary conditions. It has been assumed in some recent\nliterature that two of these conditions, ``least action\" vs.\nblock-off-diagonality of the generator, lead to identical transformations. We\nshow that this is not the case, and that these two approaches diverge at third\norder in the small parameter. We derive the perturbative power series of the\n``least action\", exhibiting explicitly the loss of block-off-diagnoality.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
