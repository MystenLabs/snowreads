Existing\nanalytical models cannot account for the patch force in the 3D geometries of\nreal experiments. Here, we present a finite-element method model to evaluate\nthe impact of patches in arbitrary geometries. First, we test our model against\nthe plate-plate and sphere-plate geometries, for which the exact solutions are\nknown. Then, we apply it to the analytically unwieldy case of plate-concave\nplate that is relevant for Casimir force measurements. This work provides a\nreliable estimation of the parasitic contribution from random potential\npatches.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
