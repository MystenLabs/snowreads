In the resulting state, exotic properties like axion\nelectrodynamics, the quantum anomalous Hall effect, and other topological\nmagnetoelectric responses are expected to emerge. A detailed understanding of\nthe magnetic order and its coupling to the topological surface states is\nessential to harness and tune these properties. Here, we leverage near-resonant\nelectric quadrupole optical second harmonic generation to probe magnetic\nfluctuations in the candidate axion insulator EuSn$_2$(As,P)$_2$ across its\nantiferromagnetic phase boundary. We observe a pronounced dimensional crossover\nin the quantum decoherence induced by magnetic fluctuations, where\ntwo-dimensional in-plane ferromagnetic correlations at high temperatures give\nway to three-dimensional long-range order at the N\\'eel temperature. We also\nobserve the breaking of rotational symmetry within the long-range-ordered\nantiferromagnetic state and map out the resulting spatial domain structure.\nMore generally, we demonstrate the unique capabilities of nonlinear optical\nspectroscopy to study quantum coherence and fluctuations in magnetic quantum\nmaterials.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
