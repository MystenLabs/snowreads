However, superlenses\nare easily affected by weak intrinsic losses and hyperlenses cannot achieve\nperfect imaging, significantly constraining their practical utility. To address\nthese challenges, here we propose a perfect hyperlens based on the\ntransformation optics. Importantly, perfect hyperlens is capable of\nself-focusing in geometrical optics while supporting propagating waves with\nexceptionally large wavenumbers, which endows it with key advantages such as\nultra-high resolution, no aberration and strong robustness. Furthermore, we\ndemonstrate the hyperbolic focusing performance in naturally in-plane\nhyperbolic polaritons of {\\alpha}-MoO3 films numerically, which can be achieved\nby gradient thickness. The results greatly innovate the design principles of\ntraditional imaging lens, providing many potentially significant applications\nfor super-resolution real-time imaging, lithography, and sensing.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
