By including both quantitative and qualitative metrics, the\nframework seeks to represent HAIC's dynamic and reciprocal nature, enabling the\nassessment of its impact and success. This framework's practicality can be\nexamined by its application in an array of domains, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, finance, and education, each of which has unique challenges and\nrequirements. Our hope is that this study will facilitate further research on\nthe systematic evaluation of HAIC in real-world applications.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
