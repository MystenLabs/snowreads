These effects may range from\nminor deviations in behavior to catastrophic system failures. To formally\ndefine these effects, we identify misalignments between the global inherent\nspecification (the true specification) and its local approximation (such as the\nconfiguration of different reward components or observations). Using\nestablished safety terminology, we develop a framework to understand these\nemergent effects. To showcase the resulting implications, we use two broadly\nconfigurable exemplary gridworld scenarios, where insufficient specification\nleads to unintended behavior deviations when derived independently. Recognizing\nthat a global adaptation might not always be feasible, we propose adjusting the\nunderlying parameterizations to mitigate these issues, thereby improving the\nsystem's alignment and reducing the risk of emergent failures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multiagent Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
