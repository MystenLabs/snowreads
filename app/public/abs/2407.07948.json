This issue is\npronounced at microscopic and especially quantum scales and can only be\nmitigated by incurring additional entropy dissipation. Understanding this\nconstraint is crucial for both fundamental physics and technological design.\nFor instance, clocks are inherently governed by the second law of\nthermodynamics and need a thermodynamic flux towards equilibrium to measure\ntime, which results in a minimum entropy dissipation per clock tick. Classical\nand quantum models and experiments often show a linear relationship between\nprecision and dissipation, but the ultimate bounds on this relationship are\nunknown. Our theoretical discovery presents an extensible quantum many-body\nsystem that achieves clock precision scaling exponentially with entropy\ndissipation. This finding demonstrates that coherent quantum dynamics can\nsurpass the traditional thermodynamic precision limits, potentially guiding the\ndevelopment of future high-precision, low-dissipation quantum devices.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
