We can effectively control the influence\nof the concepts and mix them together using a novel score distillation\napproach, referred to as the Blended Score Distillation (BSD). BSD operates on\neach attention layer of the denoising U-Net of a diffusion model as it extracts\nand injects the per-objective activations into a unified denoising pipeline\nfrom which the deformation gradients are calculated. To localize the expression\nof these activations, we create a probabilistic Region of Interest (ROI) map on\nthe surface of the mesh, and turn it into 3D-consistent masks that we use to\ncontrol the expression of these activations. We demonstrate the effectiveness\nof BSD empirically and show that it can deform various meshes towards multiple\nobjectives.
