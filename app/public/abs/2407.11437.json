From reactive molecular\ndynamics study we clearly observe a formation of conductive filament of gold\natoms from the top electrode on to the 2D MoS2 layer. This state was described\nthe onset of low-resistance state from the initial high-resistance state. To\nfurther understand the switching mechanism in the device we deploy\nfirst-principle calculations where we see an electron channel being formed\nduring the filament formation leading to the low-resistance state of the\ndevice. MoS2 with single defect gives rise to a conductance ratio of LRS to the\ninitial structure is 63.1336 and that of the LRS to HRS is 1.66.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Materials Science","Physics/Computational Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"6DeEaO--7G4OdNMsw53FRf9N95mC5bJ_Xky4MsE8EtI","pdfSize":"886112","objectId":"0xd04559f4620e0fa714c4ea0f20b6c7ecf5698aab34239784daa14955cd240c50","registeredEpoch":"3","certifiedEpoch":"3","startEpoch":"3","endEpoch":"203"}
