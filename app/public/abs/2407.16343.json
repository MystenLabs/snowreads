According to the two different signs of symmetry\nreduction and two different values of the phase difference between plus and\nminus infinity, we discuss four cases with significant differences about\nanalytical regions, symmetry, asymptotic behavior and the presence or absence\nof discrete eigenvalues, namely, the existence or absence of soliton solutions.\nTherefore, in all cases, we study the direct scattering and inverse scattering\nproblem, separately. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is constructed and solved as\nwell as the reconstruction formula of potential is derived, respectively.\nFinally, combining the time evolution, we provide the dark, bright, dark-bright\nsoliton solutions on the nonzero background in difference cases under the\nreflectionless condition.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Nonlinear Sciences/Exactly Solvable and Integrable Systems"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
