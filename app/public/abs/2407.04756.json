In order to follow the analogy, first we discuss the classical\nDirac field as a spinorial variable, by introducing properly defined momenta\nand a suitably modified, factor ordered Poisson bracket. According to the\nDirac--Bergmann algorithm two second class Hamiltonian constraints emerge,\nleading to a factor ordered Dirac bracket on the full phase space. This becomes\nthe Poisson bracket on the reduced phase space in the canonical chart adapted\nto the shell. The Dirac equation is recovered both as consistency condition on\nthe full phase space and as canonical equation on the reduced phase space.\nAlternatively, considering the Dirac field as odd Grassmann variable, we\npresent the details of the Dirac--Bergmann algorithm (with either left and righ\nderivatives acting on Grassmann valued superfunctions and involving a different\ntype of generalized Poisson and Dirac brackets). We propose a recipe for the\ncanonical second quantization of all three versions of the generalized Dirac\nbrackets, yielding the correct fundamental anticommutator.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
