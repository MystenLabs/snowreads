In this interpretation, statements such as \"spin is 'up' along\ndirection $x$\" are relational statements about the configurations of\nmacroscopic devices which are mediated by the spin and not about any intrinsic\nproperties of the spin. The operational meaning of these statements is provided\nby the practically infinite resources of macroscopic devices that serve to\ndefine the notion of a direction in three-dimensional space. This is the\nsubject of \"textbook quantum mechanics\": The description of quantum systems in\nrelation to an experimental context.. Can one go beyond that? Relational\nquantum mechanics endeavors to provide a relational description between any\nquantum systems without the necessity of involving macroscopic devices.\nHowever, by applying \"textbook quantum mechanics\" in such situations, it\nimplicitly assumes infinite resources, even for simple quantum systems such as\nspins, which have no capacity to define an experimental context. This leads to\nconceptual difficulties. We analyse Penrose's spin network proposal as a\npotential formalisation of quantum theory that goes beyond the textbook\nframework: A description in presence of finite resources, which is inherently\nrelational and inseparable in the system-context entity.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
