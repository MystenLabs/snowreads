It provides\nMPI-parallel scheduling, organized storage of input, checkpoint, and output\nfiles, as well as statistical postprocessing. With a minimalist design, it aims\nto aid the development of high-quality Monte Carlo codes, especially for\ndemanding applications in condensed matter and statistical physics. This\nhands-on user guide shows how to implement a simple code with Carlo.jl and\nprovides benchmarks to show its efficacy.\n","subjects":["Physics/Computational Physics","Condensed Matter/Strongly Correlated Electrons"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"A003n8xlaKMEOYGaVptj77QomwJx5bqiIuFa0EwCF78","pdfSize":"339487"}
