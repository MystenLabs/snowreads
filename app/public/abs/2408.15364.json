Different in-medium scenarios for the\nmodification of the $\\phi$ meson spectral function in nuclear matter are\ninvestigated: i) dropping pole mass, ii) collisional broadening and iii)\nsimultaneous dropping pole mass and collisional broadening. Even though the\n$\\phi$ meson production in p+A reactions occurs only at densities around or\nbelow normal nuclear matter density $\\rho_0$, we find visible modifications of\nthe generated dilepton spectra for the in-medium scenarios compared to the\nvacuum distribution.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"rbO6s-H0vep2GgqR3YNPBu0_Pe23WfKsMcvpvfI9FPE","pdfSize":"839575"}
