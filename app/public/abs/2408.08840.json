It also\nsupports the typical way to solve time-dependent problems using time-stepping\nschemes, either with an implementation by hand or through the use of external\nlibraries like SUNDIALS. A different approach is the usage of finite elements\nin time as well, which results in space-time finite element schemes. The\nlibrary ideal.II (short for instationary deal.II) aims to extend deal.II to\nsimplify implementations of the second approach.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Numerical Analysis","Computing Research Repository/Mathematical Software","Computing Research Repository/Numerical Analysis"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
