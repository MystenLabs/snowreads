We\nutilize theoretical models and ray tracing simulations to investigate the\ncommunication performance of two different-sized scalable finite ARs, one\nsmaller configuration with 48 x 48 array of unit cells and the other\nconstructed by combining four smaller ARs to form a larger array with 96 x 96\nunit cells. To validate the developed theoretical approach, we conducted\nmeasurements in an auditorium to evaluate the received power through an AR link\nat different angles and frequencies. In addition, models of scalable deflectors\nare implemented in the MATLAB ray tracer to simulate the measurement scenario.\nThe results from theoretical calculations and ray tracing simulations achieve\ngood agreement with measurement results.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/"}
