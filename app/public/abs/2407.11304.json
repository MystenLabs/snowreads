We advocate a two-stage\nframework for picturing SDHEPs based on the separation of scales, which gives a\nclear description both kinematically and dynamically. We examine the\nsensitivity of the SDHEP to the parton momentum fraction $x$-dependence of\nGPDs, and demonstrate it quantitatively with two specific processes that can be\nreadily measured at J-PARC or AMBER using a pion beam and at JLab using a\nphoton beam, respectively. Both processes are capable of providing enhanced\nsensitivity to the $x$-dependence, overcoming the problem of shadow GPDs, and\ndisentangling different types of GPDs with various spin asymmetries.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Experiment","Physics/High Energy Physics - Lattice","Physics/Nuclear Experiment","Physics/Nuclear Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
