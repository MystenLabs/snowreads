This method utilizes signal\nphotons generated by stimulated parametric down-conversion (ST-PDC), enabling\nthe use of a silicon detector to capture high-precision methane absorption\nspectra in the mid-infrared region. By controlling the system loss, we achieve\nmore significant changes in visibility, thereby increasing sensitivity. The\nmethane concentration within a gas cell is determined accurately. In addition,\nST-PDC enables long-distance sensing and the capability to measure low ambient\nmethane concentrations in the real world. A low-cost CMOS camera is employed to\ncapture spatial interference fringes, ensuring fast and efficient detection.\n","subjects":["Physics/Optics","Physics/Applied Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
