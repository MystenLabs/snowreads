The main ingredient is the\nGauss-Manin connection matrix of families of projective varieties. We also aim\nto investigate a conjecture on the ring of definition of leaf schemes and its\nconsequences such as the algebraicity of leaf schemes (Cattani-Deligne-Kaplan\ntheorem in the case of Hodge loci). This conjecture is a consequence of a\nlocal-global principle for leaf schemes.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Algebraic Geometry","Mathematics/Complex Variables","Mathematics/Number Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
