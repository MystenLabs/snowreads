We first derive novel closed-form\nanalytic expressions for the Bussgang estimator, the well-known linear minimum\nmean square error (MMSE) estimator in quantized systems. Afterward, closed-form\nanalytic expressions for the CME in special cases are presented, revealing that\nthe optimal estimator is linear in the one-bit quantized observation, opposite\nto higher resolution cases. Through a comparison to the recently studied\nGaussian case, we establish a novel MSE inequality and show that that the\nsignal of interest is correlated with the auxiliary quantization noise. We\nextend our analysis to multiple observation scenarios, examining the\nMSE-optimal transmit sequence and conducting an asymptotic analysis, yielding\nanalytic expressions for the MSE and its limit. These contributions have broad\nimpact for the analysis and design of various signal processing applications.\n","subjects":["Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Signal Processing","Computing Research Repository/Information Theory","Mathematics/Information Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"OhhuWSjjUMO4l2jqaJscJ-sZsLJyFx7E43vPw4kXEKM","pdfSize":"444052"}
