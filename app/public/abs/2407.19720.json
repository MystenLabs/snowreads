Garfield++ simulated the detector's performance, and\nthe single photoelectron performance of different mixed gases was tested with\nan ultraviolet laser. The detector uses a low resistivity ($\\sim1.4\\cdot\n10^{10} \\Omega\\cdot cm$) float glass so that its rate capability is\nsignificantly higher than that of ordinary float glass($10^{12}\\sim10^{14}\n\\Omega\\cdot cm$), the laser test results show that in MRPC\ngas($R134a/iC_{4}H_{10}/SF_{6}(85/10/5)$), the single photoelectron time\nresolution is best to reach 20.3 ps at a gas gain of $7\\cdot 10^{6}$.\nIncreasing the proportion of $iC_{4}H_{10}$ can effectively reduce the\nprobability of photon feedback, without changing the time resolution and\nmaximum gain. In addition to being applied to high-precision time measurement\nscenarios (eg:T0, TOF), the detector can also quantitatively test the single\nphotoelectron performance of different gases and will be used to find\neco-friendly MRPC gases.\n","subjects":["Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
