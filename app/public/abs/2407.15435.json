Its only input is a set of images\nbut it relies heavily on geometric parameters computed by the SfM process. At\nthe same time, there is an existing abundance of raw 3D models, that could\ninform the structural perception of certain buildings but cannot be applied. In\nthis paper, we propose a straightforward method to harness these raw 3D models\nto guide 3D Gaussians in capturing the basic shape of the building and improve\nthe visual quality of textures and details when photos are captured\nnon-systematically. This exploration opens up new possibilities for improving\nthe effectiveness of 3D reconstruction techniques in the field of architectural\ndesign.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
