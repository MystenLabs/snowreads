Over 1110 hours of observations\non an Xmon qubit, we simultaneously measure the coherence noise budget across\ntwo different operational frequencies. We find that incoherent errors, which\npredominate in overall error rates, exhibit minimal frequency dependence,\nsuggesting they are primarily due to wide-band, diffusive incoherent error\nsources. In contrast, coherent errors, although less prevalent, show\nsignificant sensitivity to operational frequency variations and telegraphic\nnoise. We speculate that this sensitivity is due to interactions with a single\nstrongly coupled environmental defect -- modeled as a two-level system -- which\ninfluences qubit control parameters and causes coherent calibration errors. Our\nresults also demonstrate that PB offers improved sensitivity, capturing\nadditional dynamics that conventional relaxation time measurements cannot\ndetect, thus presenting a more comprehensive method for capturing dynamic\ninteractions within quantum systems. The intricate nature of these coherence\ndynamics underscores the need for further research.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Physics/Data Analysis, Statistics and Probability","Physics/Instrumentation and Detectors"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/","blobId":"Xneh34EbDb2oGaAb5_7LCyMIQbnUZSqVaIAeKj4XhbU","pdfSize":"1328457"}
