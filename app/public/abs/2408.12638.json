Several works have been done in the field of model-based fault\ndiagnosis. Many researchers have discovered more advanced statistical methods\nand algorithms for better fault detection on any automotive dynamic engine\nsystem. The gas turbines/diesel engines produce highly complex and huge data\nwhich are highly non-linear. So, researchers should come up with an automated\nsystem that is more resilient and robust enough to handle this huge, complex\ndata in highly non-linear dynamic automotive systems. Here, I present an\nAI-based fault classification and prediction model in the diesel engine that\ncan be applied to any highly non-linear dynamic automotive system. The main\ncontribution of this paper is the AI-based Transformer fault classification and\nprediction model in the diesel engine concerning the worldwide harmonic light\nvehicle test procedure (WLTP) driving cycle. This model used 27 input\ndimensions, 64 hidden dimensions with 2 layers, and 9 heads to create a\nclassifier with 12 output heads (one for fault-free data and 11 different fault\ntypes). This model was trained on the UTSA Arc High-Performance Compute (HPC)\ncluster with 5 NVIDIA V100 GPUs, 40-core CPUs, and 384GB RAM and achieved 70.01\n% accuracy on a held test set.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
