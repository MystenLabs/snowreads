In this framework, we represent each robot design as a grammar and\nleverage the capabilities of LLMs to navigate the extensive robot design space,\nwhich is traditionally time-consuming and computationally demanding. By\nintegrating automatic prompt design and a reinforcement learning based control\nalgorithm, RoboMorph iteratively improves robot designs through feedback loops.\nOur experimental results demonstrate that RoboMorph can successfully generate\nnontrivial robots that are optimized for a single terrain while showcasing\nimprovements in morphology over successive evolutions. Our approach\ndemonstrates the potential of using LLMs for data-driven and modular robot\ndesign, providing a promising methodology that can be extended to other domains\nwith similar design frameworks.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Robotics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
