We found that songs with\nhigh levels of valence, energy and loudness are more likely to be positioned at\nthe beginning of each album. We also found that transitions between consecutive\ntracks tend to alternate between increases and decreases of valence and energy.\nThese findings were used to build a system which automates the process of\nalbum-sequencing. Our results and hypothesis have both practical and\ntheoretical applications. Practically, sequencing regularities can be used to\ninform playlist generation systems. Theoretically, we show weak to moderate\nsupport for the idea that music is perceived in both global and local contexts.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Multimedia"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
