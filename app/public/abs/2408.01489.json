In this work, we show how the coherent scattering of neutrinos off\ndense neutron matter can lead to an additional cooling channel in neutron stars\n(NSs). We also include the effects of gravitational capture and boosting, but\nfind that the cooling is efficient only in the presence of large overdensities.\nWe further discuss the prediction of a boosted C$\\nu$B flux on Earth from\nnearby NSs and the potential detection prospects in the case of a future nearby\ngalactic supernova. Although currently these ideas do not offer any detection\nprospects, they can be used to constrain overdensities on short length scales\n$\\mathcal{O}(10\\text{ km})$. We also discuss the impact of new physics\nscenarios, such as long-range forces, on NS cooling through the C$\\nu$B.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/High Energy Astrophysical Phenomena"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"tssAQLJ3AB0LsfpqDs4MBnGiDlEasbMS5FoJKVzPD84","pdfSize":"744762","txDigest":"22LHNXNsvZhA1a67Zo5T9uhyb4XwUivkMrAkk5eBGQt9","endEpoch":"1","status":"CERTIFIED"}
