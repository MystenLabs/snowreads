Proposed limits on releasing open foundation models may have significant\ndefense industrial impacts. If model training is a form of defense production,\nthese impacts deserve further scrutiny. Preliminary evidence suggests that an\nopen foundation model ecosystem could benefit the U.S. Department of Defense's\nsupplier diversity, sustainment, cybersecurity, and innovation priorities.\nFollow-on analyses should quantify impacts on acquisition cost and supply chain\nsecurity.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Computers and Society"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
