To transform these workplace\ndynamics, this paper proposes creating culturally-aware workplace tools,\nspecifically designed to adapt to the cultural dimensions of monochronic and\npolychronic work styles. We illustrate this approach with \"CultureFit,\" a tool\nthat we engineered based on extensive research in Chronemics and culture\ntheories. To study and evaluate our tool in the real world, we conducted a\nfield experiment with 55 workers from 24 different countries. Our field\nexperiment revealed that CultureFit significantly improved the earnings of\nworkers from cultural backgrounds often overlooked in design. Our study is\namong the pioneering efforts to examine culturally aware digital labor\ninterventions. It also provides access to a dataset with over two million data\npoints on culture and digital work, which can be leveraged for future research\nin this emerging field. The paper concludes by discussing the importance and\nfuture possibilities of incorporating cultural insights into the design of\ntools for digital labor.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Human-Computer Interaction","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"Tb6RHN-bO0AQXcer8xkaxU6I5cI2GhhR5koLleWIxZ8","pdfSize":"3038774"}
