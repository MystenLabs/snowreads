In contrast to existing frameworks\nwhere either ad-hoc observables or blackbox neural networks are used to\nconstruct observables in the extended dynamic mode decomposition (EDMD), our\nobservables are informed by governing equations via Polyflow. To improve the\nnoise robustness and guarantee long-term stability, we designed a stable\nparameterization of the Koopman operator together with a progressive learning\nstrategy for roll-out recurrent loss. To further improve model performance in\nthe phase space, a simple iterative strategy of data augmentation was\ndeveloped. Numerical experiments of prediction and control of classic nonlinear\nsystems with ablation study showed the effectiveness of the proposed techniques\nover several state-of-the-art practices.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Statistics/Machine Learning"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
