The main results include central limit\ntheorems for the height of the interface and the winding number of the directed\npolymer in a periodic random environment. We present two different approaches\nfor each result, utilizing either a homogenization argument or tools from\nMalliavin calculus. A surprising finding in the case of a $1+1$ spacetime white\nnoise is that the effective variances for both the height and the winding\nnumber can be expressed in terms of independent Brownian bridges.\n  Additionally, we present two new results: (i) the explicit expression of the\ncorrector used in the homogenization argument, and (ii) the law of the iterated\nlogarithm for the height function.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
