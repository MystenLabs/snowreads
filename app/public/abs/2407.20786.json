In recent studies on solubility prediction the authors\ncollected seven thermodynamic and kinetic solubility datasets from different\ndata sources. They used state-of-the-art graph-based methods and compared\nmodels developed for each dataset using different data cleaning protocols and\nhyperparameter optimization. In our study we showed that hyperparameter\noptimization did not always result in better models, possibly due to\noverfitting when using the same statistical measures. Similar results could be\ncalculated using pre-set hyperparameters, reducing the computational effort by\naround 10,000 times. We also extended the previous analysis by adding a\nrepresentation learning method based on Natural Language Processing of smiles\ncalled Transformer CNN. We show that across all analyzed sets using exactly the\nsame protocol, Transformer CNN provided better results than graph-based methods\nfor 26 out of 28 pairwise comparisons by using only a tiny fraction of time as\ncompared to other methods. Last but not least we stressed the importance of\ncomparing calculation results using exactly the same statistical measures.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Machine Learning","Computing Research Repository/Artificial Intelligence"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
