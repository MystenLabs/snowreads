However, the assessment of their\nperformance might be challenging with the non-random treatment assignment. This\nstudy conducts a conceptual analysis, which can be applied to finite-sample\nstudies. We present a framework for evaluating TBPs using observational data\nfrom a target population of interest. We then explore the impact of confounding\nbias on TBP evaluation using measures of discrimination and calibration, which\nare the moderate calibration and the concentration of the benefit index\n($C_b$), respectively. We illustrate that failure to control for confounding\ncan lead to misleading values of performance metrics and establish how the\nconfounding bias propagates to an evaluation bias to quantify the explicit bias\nfor the performance metrics. These findings underscore the necessity of\naccounting for confounding factors when evaluating TBPs, ensuring more reliable\nand contextually appropriate treatment decisions.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
