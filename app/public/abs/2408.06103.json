Under the\n``proportional asymptotic'' regime and Gaussian covariates with known\n(population) covariance $\\Sigma$, we derive Consistent and Asymptotically\nNormal (CAN) estimators of our targets of inference through a Method-of-Moments\ntype of estimators that bypasses estimation of high dimensional nuisance\nfunctions and hyperparameter tuning altogether. Additionally, under\nnon-Gaussian covariates, we demonstrate universality of our results under\ncertain additional assumptions on the regression coefficients and $\\Sigma$. We\nalso demonstrate that knowing $\\Sigma$ is not essential to our proposed\nmethodology when the sample covariance matrix estimator is invertible. Finally,\nwe complement our theoretical results with numerical experiments and\ncomparisons with existing literature.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Statistics Theory","Economics/Econometrics","Statistics/Methodology","Statistics/Machine Learning","Statistics/Statistics Theory"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"iK9Cf8d6bxWo-3-dlLcT1fVkUwuK5L316LPm5G0XXgk","pdfSize":"3767733"}
