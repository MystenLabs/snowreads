This\nhidden QCD is almost scale-invariant, so-called walking, and predicts the light\nscalar meson (the walking dilaton) associated with the spontaneous scale\nbreaking, which develops the Coleman-Weinberg (CW) type potential as the\nconsequence of the nonperturbative scale anomaly, hence plays the role of an\ninflaton of the small-field inflation. The $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs is coupled to the\nwalking dilaton inflaton, which is dynamically induced from the so-called\nbosonic seesaw mechanism. We explore the hybrid inflation system involving the\nwalking dilaton inflaton and the $U(1)_{B-L}$ Higgs as a waterfall field. We\nfind that observed inflation parameters tightly constrain the $U(1)_{B-L}$\nbreaking scale as well as the walking dynamical scale to be $\\sim 10^9$ GeV and\n$\\sim 10^{14}$ GeV, respectively, so as to make the waterfall mechanism worked.\nThe lightest walking pion mass is then predicted to be around 500 GeV.\nPhenomenological perspectives including embedding of the dynamical electroweak\nscalegenesis and possible impacts on the thermal leptogenesis are also\naddressed.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
