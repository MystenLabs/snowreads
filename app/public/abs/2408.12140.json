The resulting two-dimensional nonlinear\nequation has the form of a generalized nonlinear Schr\\\"{o}dinger equation with\nnonlocal nonlinearity, that is when the nonlinear response depends on the wave\nintensity at some spatial domain. The modulation instability of IGWs is\npredicted, and specific cases for the Earth's atmosphere are considered. In a\nnumber of particular cases, the instability thresholds and instability growth\nrates are analytically found. Despite the nonlocal nonlinearity, we demonstrate\nthe possibility of critical collapse of IGWs due to the scale homogeneity of\nthe nonlinear term in spatial variables.\n","subjects":["Nonlinear Sciences/Pattern Formation and Solitons"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
