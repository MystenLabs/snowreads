In this paper, Boolean models in hyperbolic space\nare considered, where one takes the union of the particles of a stationary\nPoisson process in the space of compact (convex) subsets of the hyperbolic\nspace. Geometric functionals such as the volume of the intersection of the\nBoolean model with a compact convex observation window are studied. In\nparticular, the asymptotic behavior for balls with increasing radii as\nobservation windows is investigated. Exact and asymptotic formulas for\nexpectations, variances, and covariances are shown and univariate and\nmultivariate central limit theorems are derived. Compared to the Euclidean\nframework, some new phenomena can be observed.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Probability","Mathematics/Metric Geometry"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
