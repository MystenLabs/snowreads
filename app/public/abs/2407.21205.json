Differential Equations 321(2022)\n99-129), the nature of dynamics of a generalist predator and prey with stage\nstructure is modeled as a three-dimensional coupled nonlinear differential\nsystem. A detailed analysis of the bifurcation shows that the model exhibits a\nhigh complexity in its dynamics, which arises from the use of predatory mites\nas agent for controlling stage structures of tea green leafhopper pest.\nUnfortunately, there is a mistake in Proposition 2.2, item (3), also the\nhypothesis in Proposition 3.3 is incorrect. In this paper, we revisit the model\nand straighten those mentioned errors as in item (3), changed the existing\nhypothesis by a suitable one and give a corrected proof of Proposition 3.3 in\nits new form. Also, we show that the model does undergo both Hopf bifurcation\nand Bautin bifurcation, and numerical examples are given to support the\nanalytic results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Dynamical Systems","Mathematics/Classical Analysis and ODEs"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
