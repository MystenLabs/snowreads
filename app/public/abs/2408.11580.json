The result\nprovides a solution to many pending questions on feedback loops concerning\nflatness-based control and model-free control (MFC). Elementary module theory,\nordinary differential fields and the generalization of K\\\"ahler differentials\nto differential fields provide an intrinsic definition of the tangent linear\nsystem. The algebraic manipulations associated with the operational calculus\nlead to homeostat and intelligent controllers. They are illustrated via some\ncomputer simulations.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control","Computing Research Repository/Systems and Control","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science/Systems and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"f00JwXoSsJq07yJ5cXW5s0Z86Lvg3jqBLjZ0Q6J9ga0","pdfSize":"985547"}
