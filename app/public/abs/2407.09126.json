Here we ask about operators $Q_A$ representing\nthe charge content of a region $A\\subseteq \\mathbb{R}^3$ in 3d physical space.\nThere is a natural formula for $Q_A$ but, as we explain, there are difficulties\nabout turning it into a mathematically precise definition. First, $Q_A$ can be\nwritten as a series but its convergence seems hopeless. Second, we show for\nsome choices of $A$ that if $Q_A$ could be defined then its domain could not\ncontain either the vacuum vector or any vector obtained from the vacuum by\napplying a polynomial in creation and annihilation operators. Both observations\nspeak against the existence of $Q_A$ for generic $A$.\n","subjects":["Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics","Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
