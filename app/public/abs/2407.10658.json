Despite the absence of surface charge on the channel\nwalls and the associated electric double layer, we do observe a robust ion\nselectivity. This selectivity favors the transport of cations from base to tip\nwhen the electric field is directed from base to tip, and anions from base to\ntip when the field direction is reversed. Additionally, we observe a\ncorresponding electro-osmotic water flow from base to tip, regardless of the\nelectric field direction. Intriguingly, ion selectivity and electro-osmotic\nflow are conventionally associated with surface charge and electric double\nlayers. However, in uncharged tapered nanoslits, we uncover a novel mechanism\nfor these phenomena, where ion selectivity arises from the divergence of the\nheterogeneous water polarization.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Soft Condensed Matter"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
