Accurate, high-resolution seismic impedance data form the\nfoundation for subsequent reservoir interpretation. Deep learning methods have\ndemonstrated significant potential in seismic impedance inversion. Traditional\nsingle semi-supervised networks, which directly input original seismic logging\ndata, struggle to capture high-frequency weak signals. This limitation leads to\nlow-resolution inversion results with inadequate accuracy and stability.\nMoreover, seismic wavelet uncertainty further constrains the application of\nthese methods to real seismic data. To address these challenges, we propose\nADDIN-I: an Attention-based Dual-branch Double-Inversion Network for Impedance\nprediction. ADDIN-I's dual-branch architecture overcomes the limitations of\nsingle-branch semi-supervised networks and improves the extraction of\nhigh-frequency weak signal features in sequence modeling. The network\nincorporates an attention mechanism to further enhance its feature extraction\ncapabilities. To adapt the method for real seismic data applications, a deep\nlearning forward operator is employed to fit the wavelet adaptively. ADDIN-I\ndemonstrates excellent performance in both synthetic and real data\napplications.\n","subjects":["Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
