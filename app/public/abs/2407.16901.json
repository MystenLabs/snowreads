We assume the presence of a common\ninfluencer between two different agents. Moreover, we explore two cases in\nwhich such an assumption does not hold but leaders with independent opinion are\npresent. By using careful estimates on the system's trajectories, we are able\nto prove asymptotic convergence to consensus estimates. Some numerical tests\nillustrate the theoretical results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Optimization and Control"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
