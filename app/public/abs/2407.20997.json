We herein report on discovery of the first mineral carrier of\nmeteoritic ammonium and show its relevance to the compositional and spectral\ncharacteristics of cometary and asteroidal bodies. Chemically distant from\npreviously inferred volatile organics or ammoniated phyllosilicates, it is an\naqueous metal-ammonium sulfate related to a family of so-called Tutton salts.\nNickeloan boussingaultite, (NH4)2(Mg,Ni)(SO4)2 6H2O, occurs in Orgueil, a\nprimitive carbonaceous chondrite closely related to (162173) Ryugu and (101955)\nBennu, the C-type asteroids. The available spectroscopic, chemical and\nmineralogical data signify that natural Tutton salts perfectly fit into the\nrole of ammonium reservoir under conditions of cometary nuclei and carbonaceous\nasteroids.\n","subjects":["Astrophysics/Earth and Planetary Astrophysics","Physics/Geophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
