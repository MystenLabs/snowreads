In 1978, Chv\\'atal and Thomassen revealed the\ncomplexity of determining whether an undirected graph can be oriented to\nachieve a diameter of two, proving it to be NP-complete. This breakthrough has\nsparked ongoing interest in identifying sufficient conditions for graphs to be\noriented with the smallest possible diameter of two -- critical for optimizing\ncommunication and network flow in larger structures. In 2019, Czabarka,\nDankelmann, and Sz\\'ekely significantly advanced this field by establishing\nthat the minimum degree threshold for achieving such an orientation in\nundirected graphs of order $n$ is $\\frac{n}{2} + \\Theta(\\ln n)$. In this paper,\nwe extend this foundational result by determining the minimum degree threshold\nnecessary for realizing an orientation with diameter two in mixed graphs, which\ncontain both undirected and directed edges. Mixed graphs offer a versatile\nframework, representing an intermediate stage in the orientation process,\nmaking our findings a substantial generalization of previous results.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
