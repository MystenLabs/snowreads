This new\nfeature allows for the investigation of 2-BMGs further by exploiting the\nnumerous known results on $P_6$ and $C_6$ free graphs together with the\navailable polynomial algorithms developed for their studies. In this direction,\nthere are also some new contributions about dominating bicliques and certain\nvertex decompositions of the undirected underlying graph of a 2-qBMG.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
