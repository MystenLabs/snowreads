They present an opportunity to address a\nlong-standing challenge in data management: the extraction of structured data\nfrom unstructured text. Consequently, several approaches are using these models\nto perform information extraction. However, these modern approaches leave an\nopportunity behind because they do not exploit the relational structure of the\ntarget extraction table. In this paper, we introduce a new model, Relation\nCoherence, that exploits knowledge of the relational structure to improve the\nextraction quality. We incorporate the Relation Coherence model as part of\nFabricQA-Extractor, an end-to-end system we built from scratch to conduct large\nscale extraction tasks over millions of documents. We demonstrate on two\ndatasets with millions of passages that Relation Coherence boosts extraction\nperformance and evaluate FabricQA-Extractor on large scale datasets.\n","subjects":["Computing Research Repository/Information Retrieval"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","blobId":"GypqJYfYyDhUMVjMnjbjXx3e1SsaX1iMhncTFdR5wkA","pdfSize":"682138"}
