We focus on two specific cases where the phonon frequencies are\n$\\omega_{0}=1$ and $\\omega_{0}=2$, respectively. Phase transitions are analyzed\nusing both the average and minimum inverse participation ratio to identify\nmetallic, fractal, and insulating states. We provide numerical evidence to show\nthat the presence of the optical cavity induces a critical, intermediate phase\nin between the extended and localized phases, hence drastically modifying the\ntraditional transport phase diagram of the Aubry-Andre-Harper model, in which\ncritical states can only exist at the well-defined metal-insulator critical\npoint. We also investigate the probability distribution of the inverse\nparticipation ratio and conduct a multifractal analysis to characterize the\nnature of the critical phase, in which we show that extended, localized, and\nfractal eigenstates coexist. Altogether our findings reveal the pivotal role\nthat the coupling to electromagnetic cavities plays in tailoring critical\ntransport phenomena at the microscopic level of the eigenstates.\n","subjects":["Condensed Matter/Disordered Systems and Neural Networks"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
