Their vacuum expectation values can be\ncomputed at large $N$ through supersymmetric localisation. The holographic\nduals are given by back-reacted spherical D-branes. For $d\\neq 4$, the\nresulting theories are non-conformal and correspondingly, the dual geometries\ndo not possess an asymptotic AdS region. The main aim of this work is to\ncompute the holographic Wilson loops by evaluating the partition function of a\nprobe fundamental string and M2-brane in the dual geometry, focusing on the\nnext-to-leading order. Along the way, we highlight a variety of issues related\nto the presence of a non-constant dilaton. In particular, the structure of the\ndivergences of the one-loop partition functions takes a non-universal form in\ncontrast to examples available in the literature. We devise a general framework\nto treat the divergences, successfully match the sub-leading scaling with\n$\\lambda$ and $N$, and provide a first step towards obtaining the numerical\nprefactor.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
