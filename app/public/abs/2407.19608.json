The inequality was proved by Stanley (1981) for\nregular matroids, and by Yan (2023) in full generality. In the original paper,\nStanley asked for equality conditions of the SY~inequality, and proved total\nequality conditions for regular matroids in the case $k=0$. In this paper, we\ncompletely resolve Stanley's problem. First, we obtain an explicit description\nof the equality cases of the SY inequality for $k=0$, extending Stanley's\nresults to general matroids and removing the ``total equality'' assumption.\nSecond, for $k\\ge 1$, we prove that the equality cases of the SY inequality\ncannot be described in a sense that they are not in the polynomial hierarchy\nunless the polynomial hierarchy collapses to a finite level.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Computing Research Repository/Computational Complexity","Computing Research Repository/Discrete Mathematics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
