Perturbations break Weyl flatness of the\nFriedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric, allowing conformally coupled fields\n-- in particular fermions studied here -- to be produced even in the massless\nlimit. Particle production can be computed by studying the Bogoliubov\ntransformation induced by the stochastic background. For perturbations\ngenerated during inflation, we present a closed formula for the resulting\nabundance of particles that depends solely on the power spectrum of curvature\nperturbations at the end of inflation. This production mechanism can be\ndominant especially if the amplitude of curvature perturbations is enhanced for\nmodes that exit the horizon towards the end of inflation. In the simplest\nscenario, the critical dark matter abundance is reproduced for $M \\gtrsim\n10^{6}$ GeV.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology","Astrophysics/Cosmology and Nongalactic Astrophysics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
