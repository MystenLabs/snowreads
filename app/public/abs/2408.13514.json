The present study\nconsiders various scenarios under various restrictions on the cluster sizes and\nnumber of clusters. It is shown that $\\hat{\\beta}_P$ could be inconsistent in\nmany realistic situations. We propose a simple estimator, $\\hat{\\beta}_A$ based\non data averaging. The asymptotic properties of $\\hat{\\beta}_A$ is studied. It\nis shown that $\\hat{\\beta}_A$ is consistent even when $\\hat{\\beta}_P$ is\ninconsistent. It is further shown that the proposed estimator $\\hat{\\beta}_A$\ncould be more efficient as compared to $\\hat{\\beta}_P$ in many practical\nscenarios. As a consequence of averaging, we show that $\\hat{\\beta}_A$ retains\nconsistency, asymptotic normality under classical measurement error problem\ncircumventing the use of IV. A detailed simulation study shows the efficacy of\n$\\hat{\\beta}_A$. It is also seen that $\\hat{\\beta}_A$ yields better goodness of\nfit.\n","subjects":["Statistics/Methodology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
