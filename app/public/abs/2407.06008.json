By connecting the integer matrix to a bilinear\nform of Schechtman-Varchenko, we show that there is a closed formula for its\ndeterminant that only depends on the combinatorics of the underlying matroid.\nWe conjecture an analogous formula for its $q$-deformation. Our work also\napplies more generally in the setting of affine oriented matroids.\n  Additionally, we give a representation-theoretic interpretation of our\n$q$-intersection matrix using Braden-Licata-Proudfoot-Websters's hypertoric\ncategory $\\mathcal{O}$ (or more generally Kowalenko-Mautner's category\n$\\mathcal{O}$ for oriented matroid programs). This paper is part of a broader\nprogram to categorify matroidal Schur algebras defined by Braden-Mautner.\n","subjects":["Mathematics/Combinatorics","Mathematics/Representation Theory"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
