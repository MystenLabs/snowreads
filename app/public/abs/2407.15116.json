Due to the new annihilation processes related to\ntriplets, the light component cannot necessarily be dominant in the dark matter\nrelic density, which is different from the Z5 two-component dark matter model\nin the SM. The model is considered to explain the excess of electron-positron\nflux measured by the AMS-02 Collaborations in this work, which is encouraged by\nthe decay of the triplets arising from dark matter annihilations in the\nGalactic halo. We discuss the cases of the light and heavy components\ndetermining dark matter density within a viable parameter space satisfying\nrelic density and direct detection constraints, and by fitting the antiproton\nspectrum observed in the PAMELA and AMS experiments, we find that the parameter\nspace is flexible and the electron-positron flux excess can be obtained in both\ncases with the mass of two dark matter particles being larger than that of the\ntriplets'.\n","subjects":["Physics/High Energy Physics - Phenomenology"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
