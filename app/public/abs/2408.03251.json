It\nis guaranteed to work for time-dependent Hamiltonians that always have an\nenergy gap to the first excited state throughout the entire evolution, but it\ncan be excruciatingly slow. To speed up the process, we introduce a scaling\nfactor that modulates the Hamiltonian during the time evolution, controlled by\na variational principle on the final energy of the unscaled Hamiltonian. We\nfind the optimized time evolution resembles a local adiabatic time evolution\nwith an additional rapid modulation of the scale, which both reduces diabatic\nexcitation from the ground state, and returns excited states back to the ground\nstate. This approach is particularly simple to implement; it does not require\nconstructing complicated counter-diabatic Hamiltonians nor does it need any a\npriori knowledge of the energy gap of the system. When the time evolution is\ndiscretized into problem and mixer components it closely resembles the quantum\napproximate optimization algorithm, featuring a local adiabatic field with\noscillations arising from the ratio of angles at each layer and from a\nlayer-dependent modulation of the overall scale.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://arxiv.org/licenses/nonexclusive-distrib/1.0/"}
