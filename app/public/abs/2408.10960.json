If the error rate is\nsufficiently small, the protocol approaches and stabilizes a predesignated pure\ntarget state with high fidelity and high purity, and thus implements autonomous\nstate stabilization. We present numerical simulation results for one and two\nqubits, taking Andreev qubit circuits as example. As function of the error\nrate, a sharp threshold separates an error-correcting weak-damping regime from\na strong-damping regime where the target state cannot be reached anymore. At\nthe threshold, the purity gap closes.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics","Condensed Matter/Mesoscale and Nanoscale Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
