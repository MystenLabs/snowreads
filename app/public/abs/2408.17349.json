Our proof requires no new\nmodifications to the protocol steps or hardware, and works by obtaining a\nsuitable bound on the phase error rate. It is applicable to imperfectly\ncharacterized detectors, and only requires the maximum relative difference in\ndetection efficiencies and dark count rates of the detectors to be\ncharacterized. Moreover, our proof allows Eve to use any spatio-temporal degree\nof freedom in each round to choose detector efficiencies and dark count rates\nin their allowed ranges, thereby addressing an important problem of detector\nside channels. We prove security in the variable-length framework, where users\nare allowed to adaptively determine the length of key to be produced, and\nnumber of bits to be used for error-correction, based on observations made\nduring the protocol. We quantitatively demonstrate the effect of\nbasis-efficiency mismatch by applying our results to the decoy-state BB84\nprotocol.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/"}
