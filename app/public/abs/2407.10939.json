In particular, we give a contour integral\nformula for solutions to the Teukolsky equations, and we find a recursion\noperator that generates an infinite family of solutions and leads to the\nconstruction of Cech representatives and sheaf cohomology classes on twistor\nspace. Apart from the general conformally self-dual case, examples include\nself-dual black holes, scalar-flat K\\\"ahler surfaces, and quaternionic-K\\\"ahler\nmetrics, where we map the Teukolsky equation to the conformal wave equation,\nestablish new relations to the linearised Przanowski equation, and find new\nclasses of quaternionic deformations.\n","subjects":["Physics/General Relativity and Quantum Cosmology","Physics/High Energy Physics - Theory","Physics/Mathematical Physics","Mathematics/Mathematical Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
