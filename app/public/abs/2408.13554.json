In this paper, we\ndemonstrate theoretically and experimentally, that pulses designed by\noptimization can be used to counteract the loss of fidelity due to a control\namplitude error of the transmon qubit. We analyze the control landscape\nobtained by robust optimal control and find it to depend on the error range,\nnamely the solutions can get trapped in the basin of attraction of sub-optimal\nsolutions. Robust controls are found for different error values and are\ncompared to an incoherent loss of fidelity mechanism due to a finite relaxation\nrate. The controls are tested on the IBMQ's qubit and found to demonstrate\nresilience against significant $\\sim 10\\%$ errors.\n","subjects":["Physics/Quantum Physics"],"license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/"}
